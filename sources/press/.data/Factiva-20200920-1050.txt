Good day. Customer engagement startup Freshworks Inc. has raised $150 million in new funding, joining a number of other business software startups to raise large funding rounds in a strong year for enterprise exits.

Leading the round at a $3.5 billion valuation were existing investors Sequoia Capital, CapitalG and Accel, which was the company's first investor. The company has raised about $400 million in total funding, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

The new round follows the public debuts of enterprise companies including Slack Technologies Inc., Crowdstrike Inc., Zoom Video Communications Inc. and PagerDuty Inc.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Mega fund. Norwest Venture Partners, which invests through both growth and venture strategies, has closed its latest fund with $2 billion in commitments, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports.

* The vehicle, Norwest Venture Partners XV LP, is 33% larger than its predecessor, which collected $1.5 billion and closed in February 2018. That fund has made almost 50 new investments since then.

* Norwest is mainly backed by San Francisco-based banking giant Wells Fargo & Co., its anchor limited partner.

* Managing more than $9.5 billion in capital, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Norwest invests in companies ranging from seed stage to buyouts.

China's VC boom ends. A year after an abrupt turn in investor confidence in the growth and profit potential of Chinese tech startups, venture-capital fundraising in the world's second-largest economy is on pace to touch its lowest level since 2013, the Journal's Jing Yang reports.

* Some 61 China-focused venture-capital funds completed fundraising this year through October, raising $12.6 billion, according to Preqin, a financial data provider.

* Without a surge in activity in the last two months of 2019, the tally which includes both U.S. dollar- and yuan-denominated fundraising will likely fall far short of the $25.6 billion raised last year by 170 funds.

We losses. Office-space startup WeWork lost $1.25 billion in the third quarter as expenses far outpaced revenue growth, draining the company's cash ahead of a bailout by SoftBank Group Corp. last month, the Journal's Eliot Brown reports. The report of the heavy dose of red ink compares with WeWork's prior record loss of $638 million, posted in the second quarter, and is more than double the $497 million loss reported in same year-earlier period.

Dairy alternatives. Miyoko's Creamery, a venture-backed startup selling alternative vegan dairy products, is looking to turn struggling, rival dairy farmers into its suppliers by helping them become plant farmers, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports.

Espionage concerns. The recent resignation of a compliance director at GitLab Inc. illustrates anxiety in the tech industry about foreign espionage. It also shows how, in managing one risk, companies can expose themselves to other risks, Risk & Compliance Journal's Kristin Broughton reports.

Drone demand. Drone-software maker DroneDeploy Inc. has raised $35 million as it builds tools for companies to use aerial photos and videos to improve their businesses, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. DroneDeploy's Series D was led by Bessemer Venture Partners and Bessemer Partner David Cowan will join the company's board.

AI for IT. Moveworks Inc., an enterprise artificial-intelligence software company, said Thursday that it raised an additional $75 million in venture capital, bringing its total raised to $105 million, WSJ Pro's John McCormick reports. The Mountain View, Calif., firm helps large corporations respond to employees' information-technology requests. Iconiq Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Sapphire Ventures, all new investors, led the round.

Exits

Publicly traded NextGen Healthcare Inc. agreed to acquire patient-engagement software maker Medfusion Inc. for $43 million. Cary, N.C.-based Medfusion previously raised funding from investors including Bull City Venture Partners and Hatteras Venture Partners.

Cloud applications developer Grid Dynamics International Inc. will become a publicly listed company through a merger agreement with special purpose acquisition company ChaSerg Technology Acquisition Corp. San Ramon, Calif.-based Grid Dynamics is backed by Benhamou Global Ventures.

VC Funds

Health care-focused firm Concord Health Partners closed a $50 million fund whose anchor limited partner investor is the American Hospital Association. The AHA Innovation Development Fund LP will continue making early-stage investments in startups providing transformative technologies for hospitals and health systems.

Tech News

TikTok's growth surges in India, undented by U.S. security concerns. Chinese video-sharing app has four times as many downloads in South Asian nation as in America, with users often filming in public.

Ping An fintech arm chooses US over Hong Kong for IPO

SoftBank-backed OneConnect sells tech platforms to smaller banks and plans to use proceeds for expansion

OneConnect, the financial technology arm of China s largest insurance company, has picked the US over Hong Kong to launch its long-awaited initial public offering.

Bankers were estimating the company, which is also backed by SoftBank, could raise up to $2bn in a potential Hong Kong listing, according to a Financial Times report last year.

The Ping An Insurance affiliate listed its offering size as $100m, a figure described by one banker involved as a place holder amount that was likely to change. SoftBank led a funding round valuing OneConnect at $7.5bn last year, according to Ping An s 2018 annual report.

Ping An declined to comment on the IPO. The offering is being led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Ping An of China Securities.

A large financial conglomerate with a background in insurance, banking and trust businesses, Ping An has in the past few years launched dozens of start-ups focused on areas such as medical care, financial technology, online car sales and artificial intelligence.

SoftBank has invested in many of its businesses, including Ping An Good Doctor. The online healthcare start-up raised $1.1bn in its IPO in Hong Kong in May last year, but had largely traded below its issue price until last month.

OneConnect, another one of the conglomerate s start-ups, began as an internal unit that developed fintech for the company. Now it has an outward facing business, for instance selling technology platforms to smaller banks and other services such as providing credit checks.

The company had an operating loss of $156m in the nine months ended September 30, the filing shows.

OneConnect said its customer base includes all of China s big banks and nearly half of the country s insurance groups, with 3,700 customers in total.

 Through our platform, in the nine months ended September 30, on a daily basis we facilitated over 135,000 anti-fraud checks, 4.2m credit risk assessments, and the processing of approximately 13,000 auto insurance claims,  it said.

OneConnect plans to use the proceeds to continue its international expansion, after establishing subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia.

In Hong Kong, it is set to develop the Hong Kong Monetary Authority s eTradeConnect platform, a large-scale interbank blockchain trade finance platform, which serves 13 big banks. Alongside Ping An, it will invest further in AI, blockchain and cloud computing.

Despite trade tensions between the US and China, and a deepening tech war between the two economies, Chinese companies have continued to seek listings in New York.

At least nine Chinese companies filed for an IPO in October, including Canaan Creative, one of the world s largest makers of bitcoin mining materials, dronemaker EHang Holdings and real estate marketplace FangDD.

But OneConnect s US listing also comes as a number of big Chinese tech champions are choosing Hong Kong to list.

Alibaba this week filed with the Hong Kong exchange to raise up to $13.4bn in a secondary listing while ByteDance, which owns viral video app TikTok, is one of the world s biggest unlisted start-ups and is considering a listing in the city next year.

U.S. Bank has named Tanushree Luke, a former Capital One Financial Corp. executive and Darpa scientist, as the head of its artificial-intelligence efforts.

Ms. Luke joined U.S. Bank, whose parent is U.S. Bancorp, on Oct. 31. She succeeds David Berglund, who left the bank earlier this year and is now head of AI at Jacksonville, Fla., financial-services technology company Fidelity National Information Services, known as FIS.

In addition to looking for new areas to apply AI, Ms. Luke said she would focus on ensuring U.S. Bank's use of AI is ethical, on protecting customer data privacy, and on making customers' online experiences more intuitive. She reports to Dominic Venturo, U.S. Bank's chief innovation officer.

"It's been incredible in getting to know the leaders of the company and how they are so aligned to doing things responsibly, and really caring about customers first," Ms. Luke said.

Mr. Venturo said Ms. Luke's priorities are right in line with where the bank is headed.

"When we had the opportunity to meet and talk about what we've been doing and where we're trying to go, there was such a natural alignment of the areas of interest and the work we're trying to do," he said.

U.S. Bank, which is based in Minneapolis, uses AI to identify fraud threats and to help its anti-money-laundering analysts spot suspicious activity. It also uses the technology in its mobile app to analyze customers' transactions to help them monitor their cash flow and spending habits.

Ms. Luke was most recently at Capital One, where she served as head of predictive AI and machine learning for the bank's Eno chatbot. Earlier, Ms. Luke, who has a Ph.D. in computational theoretical physics, was chief data scientist at cybersecurity company BitVoyant and a technical lead at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Darpa, part of the Defense Department, is responsible for developing emerging technologies for use by the military.

Qualia Raises $55 Million, Extending String of Real-Estate Tech Deals; Real-estate startups raised $1.7 billion across 106 deals last month, according to CREtech

Qualia Labs Inc. has raised $55 million, joining a string of investments in startups making software to streamline the real-estate buying process.

Tiger Global Management led the Series C financing, which brings Qualia's total capital raised to $95 million since it was founded in 2015. The San Francisco-based startup raised a $33 million Series B round last year led by Menlo Ventures.

The new financing comes amid a surge in venture funding for real-estate startups. The sector attracted $1.7 billion across 106 deals last month, up from $1.37 billion raised across 89 deals in September and the sixth consecutive billion-dollar funding month, according to real-estate tech research firm CREtech.

So far in November, deals in the sector have included Real Estate Exchange Inc., a real-estate broker platform that raised a $40 million Series C1 round, and Snapdocs Inc., a mortgage processing platform that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/real-estate-technology-startup-snapdocs-raises-25-million-to-develop-ai-capabilities-11573120801" to bolster its use of artificial intelligence.

Qualia sells subscriptions to software that serves as a digital platform for parties involved in the real-estate purchasing process. Buyers, sellers, title agents, escrow officers, lenders and real-estate agents can use Qualia to sign documents and communicate, among other functions.

The technology reduces paper and streamlines what is a notoriously arduous process, Qualia co-founder and Chief Executive Nate Baker said.

Qualia's software also accounts for regional variations in the real-estate purchasing process, enabling users to close deals in every U.S. state. Building that element of the software was previously one of the startup's biggest challenges and was a key area of investment, Mr. Baker said.

With that challenge mostly behind the company, the new capital will primarily be used to bolster the startup's Austin, Texas, office's go-to-market team, Mr. Baker said.

Existing investors Bienville Capital, 8VC and Menlo Ventures also participated in new round.

Good day. A number of startups have tried building auto marketplaces to sell or resell cars. The latest is ACV Auctions, which has garnered a $1.5 billion valuation and raised the largest ever venture round for an upstate New York company, WSJ Pro reports below.

Meanwhile, real estate has seen a slew of new startups looking to change how property is bought and sold. Startup Qualia Labs has raised $55 million for its software designed to streamline the buying process, WSJ Pro reports.

Also in real estate, startups like Opendoor and public companies such as Zillow are making cash offers to home sellers to ease the selling process then reselling them. These so-called iBuyers are paying close to market value, or just over 1% less than market value, which is peace of mind for sellers but raises questions about how their business models operate on such thin margins, The Wall Street Journal reports.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Buffalo unicorn. A startup based far outside Silicon Valley has built a billion-dollar platform for auto dealers, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports exclusively. ACV Auctions Inc. has raised $150 million at a $1.5 billion valuation for its marketplace for selling cars. Wellington Management led the investment in the Buffalo, N.Y.-based business, with existing investors Bain Capital Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and Tribeca Venture Partners participating.

* The investment in ACV Auctions is the largest on record for an upstate New York business, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

* Although there are many sites for consumers looking to sell their cars, ACV has carved out a niche by focusing on transactions between dealerships. CEO George Chamoun said the company was inspired by in-person car auctions and is trying to bring a similar concept online. It views itself as an alternative to Manheim Inc., which provides in-person car auctions.

* Dealers alert ACV about prospective car sales, then ACV provides an in-person inspection. Mr. Chamoun likened the process to selling diamonds, because it involves an appraisal.

Logistics deal. Digital freight broker Convoy has raised $400 million in a Series D funding round that values the business at $2.75 billion and backs its expansion in a growing array of technology-focused upstarts making inroads in the freight transportation sector, Logistics Report's Jennifer Smith reports. Sustainable investment management firm Generation Investment Management LLP and previous investor T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. led the latest funding round, with participation from previous investor Alphabet Inc.'s CapitalG fund and others.

Real estate software. Qualia Labs Inc. has raised $55 million, joining a string of investments in startups making software to streamline the real-estate buying process, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports exclusively. Tiger Global Management led the Series C financing, which brings Qualia's total capital raised to $95 million since it was founded in 2015.

Exits

3-D printing company Formlabs Inc. acquired its primary material supplier, Spectra Group Photopolymers LLC, for an undisclosed amount. Somerville, Mass.-based Formlabs, which has a valuation of $1 billion, is backed by investors including SOSV, Foundry Group, New Enterprise Associates, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Pitango Venture Capital.

VC Funds

Salesforce Ventures launched a new $50 million Consultant Trailblazer Fund to provide cloud consulting companies and digital agencies with capital to build and scale their Salesforce services capabilities. The San Francisco-based firm launched its first Consultant Trailblazer Fund with the same amount in 2017, and fully committed the fund in just over two years.

Dumortier goes into battle for responsible investing

Asset management

An ex-trader at hedge fund Edoma Partners is launching a fund focusing on responsible investments, the latest sign that a sector known for its single-minded focus on making money is turning its attention to ethical investing.

Quentin Dumortier, who served as a captain in the French special forces before switching careers to become a hedge fund manager, has launched hedge fund firm Atlas Global Investors in London.

Mr Dumortier plans to filter stocks based on strong or weak performance in categories such as water conservation, clean mobility, and financial inclusion. He will then select a basket of stocks to back from the strong performers and a basket of stocks to bet against from the laggards.

The launch of Atlas, which has not previously been reported, is among the first examples of a hedge fund focused solely on responsible investing, and comes as some of the biggest names in the industry turn to the environmental, social and governance sector in search of returns.

Caxton Associates, one of the oldest hedge funds, in July told investors that "ESG is now centre stage for us in active investment decision-making in several areas".

Man Group, the biggest listed hedge fund firm, says it has discovered a "factor" that can identify stocks with strong or improving ESG characteristics likely to beat the market.

However, Atlas's launch comes at a tough time for start-ups, with investors on track to pull money from the $3.2tn hedge fund industry for the third calendar year of the past four.

Nearly 400 hedge funds pulled down their shutters in the first half of this year, compared with 289 launches, according to data group HFR.

That closure-to-launch ratio is running near its highest level since the depths of the credit crisis in 2008.

A few new funds are attracting investor capital, however. Earlier this month the Financial Times revealed that Michele Gesualdi, former chief investment officer at Kairos Investment Management, had raised more than $1bn for an alternative investments firm.

Tory election pledges include more charging points for cars and increased wind power

Boris Johnson on Wednesday pledged large-scale investments in green technologies, including more charging points for electric cars and plans for increased use of offshore wind power generation.

The prime minister also said the Conservatives would double public research and development spending to 18bn by 2024-25, compared with 2017 levels, in a move that would offset the loss of EU funding after Brexit.

While some plans had been previously announced, Mr Johnson s speech in Coventry involved some significant new commitments by the Tories.

He said a future Conservative government would ensure every household was within 30 miles of an electric vehicle charging point through a 500m investment in a  fast-charging network .

Mr Johnson also announced a new target for offshore wind power capacity, increasing it from 30 gigawatts to 40GW by 2030, which he claimed would create up to 9,000 new jobs.

He said 800m would be invested in technology that captures carbon dioxide gas produced by burning fossil fuels and pumps it deep underground, while 500m would be spent helping energy intensive industries reduce their emissions.

The prime minister announced plans for an advanced research projects agency that would support  blue skies research and investment in UK leadership in artificial intelligence and data .

Business and science lobby groups welcomed the prime minister s commitment to increase research and development spending if the Conservatives are re-elected, but warned that Mr Johnson appeared to be signalling a damaging U-turn on collaboration with EU partners.

His proposal to  replace  EU funding with the 18bn package implied that a Tory government would no longer take part in the bloc's Horizon research and innovation programme, said one group.

 It is two steps forward but could be one very big step back for business,  said Felicity Burch, director of innovation and digital at the CBI.

 We welcome the ambition and commitment to R&D spending 	. 	. 	. 	But moving away from European collaborative opportunities would be a big concern for British business and investors in British science and innovation. 

Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, Britain s national scientific academy, said:  Successful science is not based on money alone. We will also need to maintain full participation in European funding schemes and the collaboration that they promote, rather than trying to replace them. 

Mr Johnson also pledged 1.8bn to rebuild further education colleges over the next five years.

Further education colleges welcomed the spending. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, called the  long overdue  investment  great news for the 2.2m people who study and train in colleges every year and who deserve the best facilities .

Hi everyone   the big news is that Alibaba is planning to raise up to $15bn on the Hong Kong stock market, fuelling expectations of further investments in the region. This week we launch a new section called  Art of the Deal , which will track the big venture capital and private equity deals. Indian company Paytm s investment plans gets under way. Separately, check out the Fitbit for cows, Mongolia s start-up scene and XPeng, the Chinese electric car company that is bucking a trend.

The Big Story

Asia s most valuable company, Alibaba, is seeking to raise a lot more money. A secondary listing in Hong Kong could raise up to $15bn, sources told the Financial Times. Ostensibly, a company worth $486bn with $33bn in cash and equivalents does not appear to need the extra dosh.

So what will it do with its bulging wallet?

Key implications: Sources told the Nikkei Asian Review that Alibaba may invest some of the proceeds in artificial intelligence projects or in acquisitions in areas such as food delivery and travel.

The other striking characteristic of Alibaba in recent years has been its expansion into the rest of Asia. One aspect of this is the Touch  n Go payments app in Malaysia, a joint venture between Alibaba s affiliate Ant Financial and Malaysia s CIMB. It has emerged as the market leader, beating out competition from Grab, the Singapore-based start-up.

Other ventures in Asia include Zomato in India, which has ambitious expansion plans (see Heard by Henny). Also in India, Paytm (see Art of the Deal below) is seeking to raise more funds. Several other affiliates in South Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh, Thailand and elsewhere give Alibaba an unrivalled consumer tech network across the region.

Upshot: It is not yet clear what Alibaba will do with the money that it raises in its planned Hong Kong share issue. But its growing presence in the region can only be enhanced by the extra investment dollars.

Mercedes  top 10

A round-up of the week s best tech stories from the FT s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.

*

Visitors to China can now access Alipay and WeChat Pay without having a Chinese bank account. It s hard to overstate what a game-changer this is in terms of foreigners and tourists gaining access to China s cashless economy.

*

Visa is in discussions with south-east Asian tech unicorn Gojek to bring out a  pay later service  to the platform. The world s biggest payments network participated in a funding round by the Indonesia-based start-up this year.

*

There s a Fitbit for cows. India, the world s number one milk market, has an unproductive cow problem and start-up Stellapps is hoping its devices can fix it.

*

Alibaba Singles  Day headlines brought us a number of eye-popping sales numbers (again). The FT s Ryan McMorrow analyses the challenge that comes with that: logistics. The Chinese company is also very sensitive about anyone questioning its sales figures, like this man did.

*

It was a grim debut for 36Kr, the Chinese news and data website that listed on the Nasdaq last week. Shares were priced at $14.50 and are now down nearly 40 per cent.

*

The WeWork knock-on effect is hitting another SoftBank-backed company in Asia: India s Oyo. The discount hotel chain is scaling back revenue guarantees aimed at persuading hotel owners to sign up to its platform, and has cancelled some existing agreements. Read the Nikkei Asian Review scoop here.

*

Mark Zuckerberg once wanted to buy the Chinese company that formed the basis of video app TikTok. Now it has become a  convenient bogeyman to the  privacy-focused , America-first narrative championed by the Facebook founder .

*

Here s a great piece in the Nikkei Asian Review on the unique role India s enterprising women are playing in fuelling the country s internet revolution   especially in ecommerce.

*

Can Mongolia s growing IT sector keep the economy humming during severe winters? The country s high smartphone penetration (1.4 per person) is fertile ground for start-ups.

*

In the internet age, even emojis are big business. John Thornhill digs into how our  tears of joy  are subject to corporate lobbying, civic campaigning and geopolitical bullying. Who should be in charge of responding to the evolving demands?

When sages speak

*

This is a fascinating report by Jonathan Hillman and Maesea McCalpin from CSIS on the  safe city  technology that Huawei is selling around the world. The facial recognition, licence plate recognition, social media monitoring and other surveillance capabilities it sells are generally being bought by authoritarian countries, raising the charge that Huawei is helping to  export authoritarianism .

*

Elsa B Kania sounds the alarm in this report on how the US risks losing  a critical competitive advantage  in 5G telecoms.  Today, China seems poised to become a global leader and first mover in 5G,  she writes.  The US government has yet to commit any funding or national initiatives in 5G that are close to comparable in scope and scale to those of China.  You could call this a  new Sputnik moment , but for the apparent lack of US concern.

*

The guys at Macro Polo, who we often feature in TSA, have done an excellent deep dive into organic light-emitting diode(OLED) screens and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technologies. By 2022, OLED production is projected to be almost 25 times greater than what it was in 2012. Li-ion battery demand, meanwhile, is set to grow from 26GWh in 2015 to 54GWh in 2025 as demand from smartphones, laptops and other digital devices grows.

Heard by Henny

Just a few years ago, there was almost no online food delivery in India. But today Zomato has 200,000 people bringing food to middle class consumers in 500 cities across the country. In 18 months, it hopes to double that number, its co-founder Gaurav Gupta said.

Its average delivery person receives Rs22,000 ($305) a month gross or between Rs15,000 and Rs18,000 in take-home pay, depending on whether they travel by push bike or motorbike. If you add the number of people working for Zomato s great rival Swiggy for ride-hailing services including Ola and Uber, and the army of those delivering parcels ordered from Amazon and Flipkart, the grand total might reach 1.5m, according to estimates from McKinsey s Mumbai office.

But is the uplift from the tech boom in India powerful enough to carry the broader economy? While it no doubt helps, the tech advance falls far short of presenting an answer to India s slowing economy. Gross domestic product growth is hovering at about 5 per cent a year   far less than the level required to absorb about 1m people joining the workforce every month.

Read the story here by Henny Sender, the FT s chief correspondent, international finance.

Art of the deal

Digital payments in India are one of the most compelling tech trends in Asia. India is also one of the most competitive markets anywhere, with SoftBank, Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway, Tencent, Walmart, Xiaomi and others all backing local businesses against the likes of PayPal, Google Pay and others.

Paytm, which is backed by Alibaba, Berkshire and SoftBank, is the market leader with nearly 130m monthly active users and 450m registered users. It is reportedly looking to raise $2bn in a new financing round, said Deal Street Asia.

Paytm, which ranks as India s most valuable unicorn, is also planning to increase its investments in early-stage start-ups, earmarking $70m for this purpose. One of its focuses will be artificial intelligence-based businesses and big data.

Elsewhere:

*

Tencent has acquired a stake in India s PolicyBazaar, India s largest insurance aggregator. The deal may have been worth about $150m. It marks Tencent s first entry into India s underserved insurance sector and complements its recent investment into NiYo, a start-up that helps the country s blue-collar workers manage their finances.

*

In other deals-related activity, Beijing-based private equity firm Primavera Capital Group has raised $3.4bn for what is the second-largest China-focused fund raised by a local manager. It s been a busy week for Tencent, which is also leading a $400m fundraising in Chinese online car services platform Tuhu.

In the spotlight

He Xiaopeng s given name means  little friend . And the chief executive of Chinese electric vehicle start-up XPeng has needed friends of late.

The country s new energy vehicle market has struggled this year, with sales falling 46 per cent year on year in October alone (see below). But investors in XPeng have kept the faith, agreeing to back the company to the tune of an extra $400m, XPeng announced.

Alibaba is already an investor in XPeng but the latest financing round also brings in Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. The money raised will be used for research and development on autonomous driving software and mass production of XPeng s G3 sport utility model and P7 sedan.

Smart data

Why are new energy vehicle sales falling in China? The 46 per cent year-on-year drop in electric vehicle sales in October has prompted some to wonder if it is all over for a market that was thought to hold enormous promise.

But the reasons for the slowdown reveal a different narrative. Chinese consumers are fighting shy of buying electric vehicles because their second hand value is so poor. A three-year-old BYD e6 is worth about 30 per cent of its sales price when new   much lower than the equivalent for a gasoline car.

The reason for this, in turn, is that battery technology in China is on the march. Chinese battery makers, such as CATL, are set to bring out batteries that are cheaper, longer lasting and quicker to charge as soon as next year. Car buyers are holding off for a better deal.

Regulation round-up

*

Show me the money. Singapore s central bank will probably extend its funding for fintech initiatives, citing huge  success  in boosting competitiveness and innovation. There are now more than 600 fintech start-ups in Singapore, up from about 50 in 2015, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The new funding plans could extend to cyber security and artificial intelligence, MAS said.

*

Vietnam is taking a leaf out of Indonesia s book and restricting foreign ownership on payments companies. The country s central bank is proposing a 49 per cent cap on foreign ownership. For context the five largest e-payment companies in the country, which account for 90 per cent of the market, are owned anywhere between 30 per cent and 90 per cent by overseas investors. But if the law is approved it will not be implemented retroactively, which may temper some opposition.

Academics accuse Morningstar of understating bond fund risk levels

Fixed income

A group of academic researchers has taken aim at Morningstar, the financial services company, arguing that it is luring investors into unsuitable products by understating the riskiness of many of the funds it rates.

In a recent paper, professors Huaizhi Chen, Umit Gurun and Lauren Cohen noted that Morningstar relied on selfreported summaries from US fixed income funds to come up with its scores. By cross-referencing those summaries with data that must be filed by law to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the researchers found that many funds told Morningstar they held more triple-A and double-A bonds than they actually did.

That misreporting ultimately leads investors to put money into misclassified funds, the researchers said. By their estimate, about 30 per cent of high- and medium-credit quality funds were given a less risky profile in recent years than they should have received.

A Morningstar spokesperson said the researchers had "misunderstood" the company's "proprietary methodologies" and used some of its data incorrectly to make "sweeping conclusions". The Chicago-based company is considered the de facto data provider for many financial advisers and retail investors in the US, scoring hundreds of fixed-income funds according to its proprietary star rating system, which blends backward-looking assessments of risk-adjusted performance, cost and other measures. Other academic work has found links between those ratings and investor behaviour, noting big inflows in the wake of upgrades and outflows after downgrades. Assets under management in bond funds came to a record $9.4tn at the end of June this year, double the level of 2010, as the spread of negative interest rates across fixed-income markets drove up the value of the bond market globally.

"People perceive the star ratings as some kind of endorsement," said Samuel Lee, a financial adviser and former strategist for Morningstar. He added that by relying on self-reported data, the company "opens itself up to manipulation" by fund managers, which pay Morningstar for its services.

"Fund companies are going to play the game," he said. "It's rational behaviour on their part."

In the paper, the academics argue that although Morningstar has access to the SEC data on funds' holdings, it chooses to focus on the self-reported summaries, where misreporting of risk is "persistent, widespread, and appears strategic".

Misclassifications are "overwhelmingly one-sided", the paper argued. "One per cent of all misstatements push funds down a category 99 per cent of misstatements push up to a safer category."

Morningstar added: "We stand by the accuracy of our data and analytics, and we are reaching out to the authors with an offer to help understand the data they used and to clarify the ... methodologies we employ."

Good day. The venture-capital industry has long been known for lacking diversity. That can make fundraising an uphill battle for some founders of color, according to Precursor Ventures.

To help address this, the San Francisco seed-stage firm created a list of venture firms and angel investors that have invested in at least two early-stage startups led by underrepresented minorities. Precursor limited its list to seed or Series A rounds since 2018 and firms with more than $5 million in assets under management.

The list of more than 60 firms includes some well-known names such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and True Ventures but also smaller or lesser-known firms such as Better Ventures, Harlem Capital Partners and Trail Mix Ventures. Precursor hopes the list will help founders find more places to pitch, and cause venture firms to be more open to providing data.

Saving the Vision Fund. Rajeev Misra, who put together SoftBank Group Corp.'s $100 billion Vision Fund, is now in charge of keeping it from falling apart, The Wall Street Journal reports. A finance whiz who cut his teeth on Wall Street, Mr. Misra pads around the Vision Fund's London headquarters barefoot, often chewing on betel nuts, a mild stimulant. The past month has taken him to New York, where he arranged the financing for the WeWork rescue, and to the Middle East, where he tried to allay the concerns of the fund's two largest investors, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.

WeWork metric. Just weeks before WeWork expected its stock to begin trading publicly, the startup was still wrangling with the Securities and Exchange Commission over a controversial key financial metric and a litany of other concerns about its planned multibillion-dollar IPO, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Controls on tech exports. The Commerce Department faces criticism for a delay in implementing a 2018 law, which some fear gives China a window to buy military items. Congress passed a law last year that called for tougher restrictions on the types of cutting-edge technology U.S. companies can sell abroad. The Commerce Department has yet to write the wording that would implement the new rules.

When quantum computing hits the market, the financial-services industry could be the first to benefit, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive said at a quantum-computing panel event, WSJ's Sara Castellanos reports. A quantum algoritm could be deployed to a new financial model in days or weeks, while approving a new material or drug discovered by a quantum computer is likely to take years, he said at Thursday's event, hosted by International Business Machines Corp.

Gormley's Take: Biotech and Tech VCs Have Different Views on AI-Based Drug Discovery

By Brian Gormley

Two recent commentaries by biotechnology industry insiders highlighted a divide among venture capitalists: those who see artificial intelligence powering a revolution in drug discovery, and those who don't.

Venture firms have financed several startups applying AI to drug discovery, including Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Atomwise Inc. and twoXAR Inc., betting the technology will help uncover a new generation of novel medicines.

Today's Top Stories

BP Energy Closes Second Fund With About $350 Million

BP Energy Partners recently closed on almost $350 million to pursue its strategy of investing in businesses that help industries gain access to natural gas, Luis Garcia writes for WSJ Pro. A week ago, the firm closed its second and latest fund, BP Natural Gas Opportunity Partners II LP, on $348 million of commitments, only 0.6% shy of the pool's $350 million target, said Loren Soetenga, who oversees investor relations for the Dallas-based private-equity firm.

Loan Investor Owl Rock Sells 20% Stake to Dyal to Fund Expansion

Owl Rock Capital Group, one of the fastest-growing firms in one of Wall Street's fastest-growing sectors, is about to get even bigger. The private-lending business started in 2016 has sold a 20% stake to Dyal Capital Partners to help launch a new investment vehicle Owl Rock hopes to grow to $3 billion to $5 billion. Dyal paid about $500 million for the stake, implying a valuation of at least $2.5 billion for the firm, people familiar with the matter said. Money raised by the sale is earmarked for new investment products including a business-development company, or BDC, that will be marketed to institutional investors, one of the people said.

Blackstone Takes Controlling Stake in Owner of Dating App Bumble

Blackstone Group Inc. is taking a majority stake in the owner of dating app Bumble as part of the private-equity giant's broader push to invest more in fast-growing companies. The deal, which was announced Friday and previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, values dating-site parent company MagicLab at about $3 billion, Blackstone said. As part of the deal, Andrey Andreev, the founder and chief executive of MagicLab, will sell his stake in the company to Blackstone and step down from his role. Thirty-year-old Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd will retain the vast majority of her stake and will become CEO of the company.

Cumming's Take: Private-Equity Investors Want Fundraising Hamster Wheel to Slow

By Chris Cumming

Private-equity investors are wearying of large, established managers raising new funds at ever shorter intervals, a new survey shows. In private equity, the fundraising cycle has perhaps never been as short as it is now. The average time between a private-equity firm's fund closings has tightened, reaching about 42 months last year, more than 10 months fewer than in 2013.

Big Number

$8.5 Trillion

The total wealth of the world's billionaires last year, down about $388 billion, or 4.4%, from 2017, according to UBS Group AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

Deals

TriArtisan Capital Advisors has agreed to sell a majority stake in TGI Fridays restaurant owner TGIF Group to blank-check company Allegro Merger Corp. that will lead to a public listing for the multinational casual dining chain. The transaction will give TriArtisan $30 million in cash and stock and allow it to transfer about $350 million in debt to the special-purpose acquisition company. More than half of Fridays approximately 840 restaurants are located outside the U.S. The group had trailing 12-month sales of about $2 billion. Allegro was formed in August 2017 and is led by Eric Rosenfeld as chief executive, according to a regulatory filing. He has led five previous transactions involving blank-check companies.

Greenridge Investment Partners has acquired cloud-based association management software provider GrowthZone, investing alongside management of the Nisswa, Minn.-based company. With the investment, Greenridge's Jack Cardwell and Ben Moss have joined the GrowthZone board.

Oak HC/FT has invested $20 million in secure identification technology provider ABC Technologies BV. Oak HC/FT is a growth-equity fund based in Greenwich, Conn., with $1.9 billion under management. ABC, a subsidiary of ICTS International NV, is the holding company for AU10TIX Ltd., which specializes in hardware and software used to authenticate and digitize passports, driver's licenses and other IDs.

Starwood Energy Group Global has agreed to acquire the gas-gathering business of Third Coast Midstream LLC. The operations are in and around Lavaca County, Texas. The operation includes more than 260 miles of pipeline and related infrastructure in the Eagle Ford shale region.

Gemspring Capital has invested in Crafty Apes LLC, a visual effects company based in Los Angeles. Crafty Apes' services range from 2-D and 3-D compositing to digital cosmetics and computer-generated imagery. Founded in 2011, the company's recent credits include "La La Land," "Stranger Things," "Hidden Figures" and "Ant-Man and the Wasp."

Butterfly Equity has acquired a majority interest in Orgain Inc., with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan investing alongside as a minority partner. Irvine, Calif.-based Orgain produces organic and clean nutrition products including protein powders, shakes and bars. Orgain's founder will retain a minority stake.

Colony Capital Posts $555 Million Loss Amid a Shift to Digital

Onex Corp. reported segment net income of $131 million, or $1.27 a share, for the third quarter and said the results were primarily driven by private-equity gains. The fair value of its private-equity investments generated a gross return of 4% in the quarter. The investment manager said comparisons shouldn't be made with year-earlier results because of a change in its reporting practices. Onex said it received $775 million from its private-equity investments in the first nine months of the year, largely driven by the sale of Jack's Family Restaurants and the secondary sales of SIG Combibloc Group AG and Clarivate Analytics PLC.

For the second time this year, Lime Rock Partners-backed natural gas producer Arsenal Energy Holdings LLC has filed for bankruptcy, blaming falling prices, tightening lending standards and high transportation costs. The company filed for chapter 11 protection Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., with a prepackaged restructuring agreement backed by all major lenders. Natural gas prices have cratered over the past year, an aftereffect of the industry's rapid growth in the U.S., and a supply glut has hammered shares of Appalachian producers.

Some pension-fund managers are venturing further into unusual investment territory as this year's plunge in bond yields makes it harder to find decent long-term returns. Funds are dabbling in riskier asset classes, including private markets, real-estate projects, infrastructure financing and direct lending. Some are making riskier fixed-income bets, buying volatile assets such as 100-year Argentine government bonds. Others are going farther afield, investing in greenhouses and waste management.

Rajeev Misra, who put together SoftBank Group Corp.'s $100 billion Vision Fund, is now in charge of keeping it from falling apart, The Wall Street Journal reports. A finance whiz who cut his teeth on Wall Street, Mr. Misra pads around the Vision Fund's London headquarters barefoot, often chewing on betel nuts, a mild stimulant. He recently changed the layout of his office after consulting his astrologer.

Central bank group BIS taps Benoit CSur to lead digital currency push

Basel-based hub seeks to create public alternatives to private payment initiatives

Benot CSur has been picked to head a new unit of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) charged with producing public alternatives to private digital currency initiatives such as Facebook s Libra coin.

Mr CSur comes to the role from the European Central Bank, where he has been a member of the executive board with oversight of payments systems since January 2012. His eight-year term expires on December 31.

The Basel-based BIS, owned by 60 central banks, will unveil its initiative to tackle private sector monetary and payment innovations. The Innovation Hub will have unprecedented power to add to the stock of public monetary goods.

The first task facing Mr CSur, who starts in January and will serve a five-year term, will be to co-operate with the Swiss National Bank to create a central bank digital currency for wholesale use between banks, safeguarded by so-called distributed ledger technology (DLT).

BIS officials believe central banks should pool their resources to fend off potentially disruptive competition from much better funded private sector competitors.

Facebook s Libra project, which has lost seven of its founding partners since its announcement in June, is feared to lock users in publicly unaccountable walled-gardens. Though questions remain over the project s future as it prepares to launch in 2020, the growing popularity of privately issued and internationally distributed stablecoins has prompted the BIS to take action on a joint approach.

Stablecoins, which draw their stability from the fiat-denominated collateral that backs them, are often distributed across DLT or cryptocurrency blockchain systems.

 We re not just here to make money, we re here to make sure we serve the public interest, a global public interest,  said Hyun Song Shin, BIS economic adviser and acting hub head.  It s a role that needs to be done. And it s the right moment because we re on the cusp of a huge leap. 

The announcement this summer of Facebook s Libra project sparked global consternation in public policy circles owing to fears it could undermine monetary sovereignty and introduce new money laundering risks into the global financial system.

This has increased pressure on central banks to offer a co-ordinated alternative solution to the sort of payment frictions Libra aims to combat and which fintech specialists say can no longer be ignored.

 From 2017 on, developments have been very fast. The hype about bitcoin brought to the fore a lot of forces in the market and society,  said Agustn Carstens general manager of the BIS.

With the new hub, the BIS is hoping to strike a balance between the private and public sector on the firm belief that some public goods ought to be provided by public bodies but that other features, such as those focused on customer service and usability, are better provided to the market by private players.

In Hong Kong, the hub will work with local monetary authorities on ventures to solve supply chain problems. And in Singapore, it will look to apply its resources to so-called  suptech    regulation and supervision innovation   utilising big data and artificial intelligence.

 In some cases the problem is not technological, so why try to force a technology solution where things are working? We need to be smarter about where we devote our resources,  said Mr Carstens.  We don t want to sacrifice what we have that works well. 

The rollout of further international centres in the Americas and Europe is expected in the hub s secondary phase.

During his testimony to Congress last month, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, warned legislators that the creation of an international digital currency was  too important for any single company to undertake on its own  and that if the US did not innovate its financial leadership could not be guaranteed as China was moving much more quickly.

Thus far, central banks have mostly been experimenting independently on DLT and fintech projects.

Chime rings the changes after two-day outage

Largest US challenger bank left 5m customers without access to their accounts

Digital-only challenger banks have built sizeable customer bases, in parton a reputation for ease of use. No branches, no fuss.

So it was jarring when Chime, the largest US challenger bank, left 5m customers without access to their accounts last month. The service outage lasted roughly two days beginning on October 16, after users began complaining about declined payments.

Chime s rapid growth and recent stumbles were popular topics at private dinners and hallway meetings during the recent Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, taking place less than two weeks after the outage. Some attendees said that Chime was an example of fintechs pursuing growth-at-all-cost strategies while neglecting basic business functions.

But Chime s setback also turned the spotlight on its payments partner Galileo, and similar start-ups that connect consumer-facing apps to credit card processors and other parts of the financial system.

Varo, another US challenger bank customer that uses Galileo, also experienced outages around the same time as Chime.

In an interview at Money 20/20, Chime chief executive Chris Britt said the company s troubles began after Galileo experienced database issues affecting card authorisation functions. Mr Britt said Chime  intentionally 	. 	. 	. 	reduced the functionality in the app  to  limit the amount of stress  on Galileo and help restore card purchases, causing the extended service lapses.

Mr Britt said Chime planned to stay with Galileo despite the outage and called the company  one of the premiere processing systems .

 If anything it s brought us closer together and allowed us to put in more rigorous processes for monitoring in partnership with them,  Mr Britt said.

In a statement, Galileo said it worked on  restoring the most critical functions first  and that  any outage is unacceptable to Galileo s commitment to quality .

 Most companies   from airlines to large technology companies to large banks and fintechs   rely on service providers and as we have seen recently, outages are an unfortunate part of life in technology,  the company said.

News of Galileo s issues came at an awkward time. On the same day, it announced that Accel Partners had led a $77m funding round for the company s expansion into Latin America and Europe.

Beside Chime and Varo, Galileo serves many of the largest private fintech groups including Monzo, Revolut, Robinhood and TransferWise. The Utah-based company has said it is profitable and manages more than $26bn in payments annually.

Now, Galileo may be pressed to direct some of the new funding towards systems improvements, ensuring its plumbing doesn t falter as it expands into new territories.

Challenger banks raised a record haul of $2.5bn in 55 deals in the seven months to July, according to CB Insights data, ranking as the fastest-growing private fintech sector.

But many like Chime still rely on banking partners to hold customer deposits, and the Bank of England has recently questioned the risk models underlying some digital challengers. In the same month as Chime s outage, the UK group Revolut also experienced an hours-long service disruption that the company said was due to  human error  on its own end.

Since the Chime outage, Mr Britt said that the company has worked on creating another  redundant data centre  with Galileo to alleviate the effects of any further lapses.

 That s the reality of the world of financial infrastructure,  said Richie Serna, chief executive of the payments company Finix.  At scale, you re doing such a high volume and the margin for error is so small, so redundancy is such a critical part of everything we do.

BIS: Moving fast and stablising things

Benot CSur to head coordinated central bank response to innovation challenge from the private sector.

Deep in the underbelly of the looming tower that the Bank for International Settlements calls home in neutrality-loving Switzerland, the bankers who supposedly rule the world queue up to pay for their lunch like everyone else.

Here in Basel   like in many other workplaces   physical cash is no longer accepted; workers instead flash their pre-paid cards, stocked with digital currency unique to themselves. The tech is on the dated side of payments innovation, but it still equates -- at least in theory -- to the current vogue for stablecoins.

For that s really all a stablecoin system is: any digital unit, issued to a specific network, backed by an underlying pool of high-quality collateral -- in this case, Swiss francs.

The functional, albeit slightly aged, luncheon system is an apt metaphor for the state of central banking innovation more broadly. These monetary guardians, once powerful and advanced, look increasingly dated and irrelevant when compared to competition from fintech.

The hope is that this is all set to change. In Benot CSur the BIS has captured one of the world s most intelligent and forward thinking officials. He will head the new Innovation Hub, set up to tackle tech giants  attempted power grab of the global monetary system.

Before we look at what happens next, we need to go back in time.

The BIS was founded nearly 90 years ago to manage reparations payments in the aftermath of World War One and with a mission to foster closer cooperation between the world s central banks.

The headquarters is a little younger dating back to the 1970s. But the Swiss lair remains replete with highly stylised cream-leather furnishings, shag-pile carpets and drop-down shell chandeliers, made by the Danish designer and architect Verner Panton. The perfect monument, then, to what the future must have looked like when Roger Moore was the man the world looked to to defend it from international criminal syndicates intent on global domination.

Today the greater threat, some might argue, comes from aspiring tech monopolists, obsessed with achieving global domination by capturing the international payments system instead.

It s tempting to assume, as some already have, that the central bankers  Innovation Hub was put into action precisely to stamp out such megalomaniacal forces emanating from the tech arena.

The timing certainly fits.

The BIS said on June 30, just a week or so after Facebook revealed their Libra stablecoin plan, that its board had approved a hub  to foster international collaboration on innovative financial technology within the central banking community complementing the already well established cooperation within the existing committees. 

But FT Alphaville understands that the hub predates Libra. The idea originated around the beginning of 2019 after BIS officials realised over the course of 2018 that the rollout of stablecoins meant they could no longer afford to ignore developments in the fintech and cryptocurrency space or to appear complacent. Not least because of how fintech is increasingly seeking to replicate fiat systems by leveraging their stability -- but not necessarily the regulations that go with them.

"From 2017 on developments have been very fast. The hype about bitcoin brought to the fore a lot of forces in the market and society...  said Agustn Carstens, general manager of the BIS.

Mr Carstens acknowledged that Facebook s announcement had forced central banks to put their thinking caps on, especially in the wake of global consternation that the multilateral initiative could undermine monetary sovereignty and introduce money laundering risks into the global financial system.  The surprise was that Libra was such a bold challenge to fiat currency. I think it was really bold. But that s also welcome, as it s forced us to regroup and to rethink and not to neglect the issue. 

The key challenge facing the public sector remains mitigating the sort of payment frictions Libra aims to combat and which fintech specialists say can no longer be ignored. Those frictions are particularly prevalent in slow and expensive cross-border payments -- giving the BIS, as a global talking shop for central banks, an opportunity to lead the charge against private stablecoins.

The hub will welcome CSur as its new head from January 15 onwards, replacing Hyun Song Shin who is acting in the role in the interim. The appointment follows an eight-year term on the ECB s executive board for the Frenchman during which time he will have gained just the right blend of central banking and payments experience to do the job.

Along with encouraging central bank coordination on financial innovation CSur will also be tasked with pooling central bank resources to better compete with the seemingly endless pockets of private sector challengers in the fintech space. A further objective of the hub will be to ensure the public stock of monetary goods is not displaced by private sector initiatives.

For the first time in its history, the BIS will also directly influence public policy instead of staying firmly on the backseat.  We are rolling up our sleeves and making things that will add to the stock of public goods. This is the leap for us. We ve always observed, but now the second bit is going to be new,  Mr Shin told FT Alphaville.

While it has been known for a while the BIS was planning an innovation hub, the details and priorities of the hub have thus far been vague. It was revealed over the summer that the hub would initially operate from Basel, Hong Kong and Singapore, under the auspices of the host central banks in question, and later rolled out to other centres in the Americas and Europe.

But now we know the hub s initial phase will see it cooperate with the Swiss National Bank on the creation of a wholesale central bank digital currency using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and further tokenisation of assets utilising R3 s Corda technology platform.

In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the hub will work with local monetary authorities on ventures using DLT to solve supply chain problems. Finally, in Singapore, the hub will look to apply its resources to so-called  suptech  -- regulation and supervision innovation -- utilising big data and artificial intelligence. The rollout of further international centres in the Americas and Europe is expected in the hub s secondary phase.

With the hub, the BIS is hoping to strike a balance between the private and public sector on the firm belief that some public goods ought to be provided by public bodies but that other features, such as those focused on customer service and usability, are better provided to the market by private players.

"We should encourage the private sector to do what they do best, which is to serve customers,  Mr Shin said. "Some public goods ought to be provided by the public sector. It doesn't mean we have to do everything, but we have to find the right dividing line between what the public sector does best and what the private sector does best."

Thus far, central bankers have been experimenting independently on DLT and fintech projects. In many cases, among them exploratory work by the Bank of Canada on DLT, experiments have failed to deliver on hyped up market claims while revealing no obvious advantage over standing technologies.

While it is often said the private sector likes to move fast and break things the BIS approach to financial disruption will put stability and security at the forefront.

 In some cases the problem is not technological, so why try to force a technology solution where things are working? We need to be smarter about where we devote our resources  Mr. Carstens said.  We don t want to sacrifice what we have that works well.

Academics accuse Morningstar of misclassifying bond funds

Trio alleges that funds report significantly safer portfolios than they actually hold

A group of academic researchers has taken aim at Morningstar, the financial services giant, arguing the company is luring investors into unsuitable products by understating the riskiness of many of the funds it rates.

In a recent paper professors Huaizhi Chen, Umit Gurun and Lauren Cohen noted that Morningstar relies on self-reported summaries from US fixed income funds to come up with its scores. By cross-referencing those summaries with data that must be filed by law to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the researchers found that many funds told Morningstar they held more triple-A and double-A bonds than they actually did.

That misreporting ultimately leads investors to put money into misclassified funds, the researchers said. By their estimate, about 30 per cent of high- and medium-credit quality funds were given a less risky profile in recent years than they should have received.

Morningstar said the researchers had  misunderstood  the company s  proprietary methodologies  and used some of its data incorrectly to make  sweeping conclusions .

The Chicago-based company is considered the de facto data provider for many financial advisers and retail investors in the US, scoring hundreds of fixed-income funds according to its proprietary star rating system, which blends backward-looking assessments of risk-adjusted performance, cost and other measures. Other academic work has found links between those ratings and investor behaviour, noting big inflows following upgrades and outflows after downgrades.

Assets under management in bond funds came to a record $9.4tn at the end of June this year, double the level of 2010, as the spread of negative interest rates across fixed-income markets drove up the value of the bond market globally.

 People perceive the star ratings as some kind of endorsement,  said Samuel Lee, a financial adviser and former strategist for Morningstar. He added that by relying on self-reported data, the company  opens itself up to manipulation  by fund managers, which pay Morningstar for its services.

 Fund companies are going to play the game,  he said.  It s rational behaviour on their part. 

In the paper, the academics argue that although Morningstar has access to the SEC data on funds  holdings, it chooses to focus on the self-reported summaries, where misreporting of risk is  persistent, widespread, and appears strategic .

Misclassifications are  overwhelmingly one-sided , the paper argued.  1 per cent of all misstatements push funds down a category   99 per cent of misstatements push up to a safer category. 

The academics added that misclassifications had the effect of boosting returns for the funds, compared with peers. If the misclassified funds were instead compared with others of a similar risk profile, the outperformance would cease to exist.

 We need to make sure [Morningstar is] doing their job and doing what they say they do, because their job is only going to become more and more important,  Mr Cohen told the Financial Times.

Mr Cohen is the LE Simmons professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. Mr Gurun is the Ashbel Smith professor of accounting at the University of Texas at Dallas and Huaizhi Chen is an assistant professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame.

Morningstar added:  We stand by the accuracy of our data and analytics, and we are reaching out to the authors with an offer to help understand the data they used and to clarify the 	. 	. 	. 	methodologies we employ.

This year's Women to Watch in venture capital invest in some of the hottest areas of technology and life sciences, from machine learning and fintech to genetics and genome-editing tool CRISPR. They come from a range of backgrounds in business, government and academia, while their venture-capital firms span some of the largest firms in Silicon Valley to new firms seeking to carve out new pieces of the industry.

Sarah Cannon

Partner, Index Ventures

Based in San Francisco, Sarah Cannon invests in startups reshaping the future of work at Index Ventures and is particularly interested in themes like productivity, analytics and automation. When Ms. Cannon was hired by Index last year, she became the first woman partner at the firm's U.S. operations. During her roughly year and a half with Index, she worked on the investment into Pitch Software GmbH, and served as board observer at both Pitch and Slack Technologies Inc. before it went public. Previously, Ms. Cannon spent four years as a principal at Alphabet Inc.'s venture-capital arm, CapitalG, where she invested in companies including Looker Data Sciences Inc. Looker Data was acquired by Google LLC for $2.6 billion in June, a deal that is pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. "That was the first investment where I was really leading the charge," Ms. Cannon said. Prior to becoming a venture investor, Ms. Cannon spent a year as a policy adviser on the National Economic Council at the White House during the Obama administration. She also worked for roughly two years as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. and spent a year in Ghana as a Fulbright scholar.

Connie Chan

General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz

Andreessen Horowitz had a policy of never promoting general partners from within, instead hiring investors with outside operational experience. But last year, Connie Chan broke the mold, becoming the first Andreessen Horowitz investor to get promoted to general partner, after working there since 2011. While at the Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm, Ms. Chan sourced the investment in scooter startup Neutron Holdings Inc., doing business as Lime, and also advocated for the firm to invest in social media platform Pinterest Inc. Today, she's looking to make investments in categories such as audio, real estate and e-commerce. For investment professionals looking to move up the ranks to partner, she advised others to speak up and "make sure your opinions are heard."

Amanda Eilian

Partner, Able Partners

Wellness is more than organic skin care and superfoods, according to Able Partners co-founder and Partner Amanda Eilian. Ms. Eilian, whose New York-based firm was launched in 2016 to invest in the booming sector, considers a wide range of startups, including those in fields like clinical mental illness and health care for menopausal women. Portfolio companies include Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Inc., biohacker-focused Bulletproof 360 Inc. and Atai Life Sciences Inc., which is developing psychedelic-based drugs for depression. "We're really interested in areas of stigma," said Ms. Eilian, who formed Able Partners with entrepreneur Lisa Blau. "There's a lot to be done with mental health and sexual wellness, or basically anything for aging women." Ms. Eilian, a graduate of Harvard Business School, turned to venture capital after several years working in late-stage private equity and mergers and acquisitions. She also was the founder and vice president of Capital Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition vehicle that had an initial public offering in 2009. She is currently the president of Videolicious Inc., a video creation platform she co-founded in 2007. Able Partners is funded by Ms. Eilian and Ms. Blau, who also saw several companies through to exit. Most, but not all, of Able Partners' portfolio companies are headed by women.

Shruti Gandhi

Founder, Array Ventures

Shruti Gandhi, founder of San Francisco-based Array Ventures, is one of the few pre-seed early-stage investors in business software technology. There are relatively few such investors because of the technical expertise required to evaluate such companies before they have customers or other proof points, according to Ms. Gandhi. "Most don't have the expertise to evaluate deals in the enterprise at this stage," she said. "That's why we get a lot of deal flow from other firms to leverage our expertise." Ms. Gandhi invests in technical founders in areas such as big data and machine learning. Previously an investor at True Ventures, Samsung Next and Lightbank, she is a solo-general partner who has now raised two venture funds totaling $40 million and has invested in 41 companies. Three companies have been acquired Hiuy, Simility Inc. and Mobilize Networks Inc. Investors in Array include Foundation Capital, as well as entrepreneur Eric Ries and Richard Socher Inc., chief scientist at Salesforce.com Inc. While solo-general partner firms are rare in venture, Ms. Gandhi says this approach helps her move quickly, which entrepreneurs appreciate. "When you have a lot of partners, there's a lot of politics involved," she said.

Sarah Kunst

Founder, Cleo Capital

Sarah Kunst believes that increasing diversity in the tech industry requires getting more women into decision-making roles in investing. She founded Cleo Capital, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based seed and pre-seed venture firm focused on investing in female scouts and startups. Ms. Kunst, who founded personal fitness startup ProDay Inc. and was an investor at Mohr Davidow Ventures, was previously a scout for Sequoia Capital to invest in early-stage companies. After becoming a scout, she realized there were few women who were scouts and wanted to change that. "I learned almost 90% of scouts were men," she said. Her firm, which has raised $3.5 million for its first fund, invests in both scouts and startups. The scouts include Birchbox Inc. co-founder Mollie Chen and Styleseat Inc. Chief Executive Melody McCloskey. There are not only fewer female investors, but female-led startups often are challenged because they receive less capital, she said. "The problem is both at the top line there's not enough diversity in investing and also there is less capital to play with, so there's less margin for error so it makes it harder" for female entrepreneurs, she said.

Kavita Patel

Venture Partner, New Enterprise Associates

Kavita Patel built a career in medicine and health-care public policy before joining New Enterprise Associates as a venture partner based in Washington, D.C., in late 2017. A primary-care physician who earned her medical degree from the University of Texas Health Science Center, Dr. Patel worked for Sen. Ted Kennedy as deputy staff director on health, and later served in the Obama administration, where she was involved in the design of health-care-reform legislation. At NEA, she works with startups such as Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc., which develops genomics-based tests designed to optimize cancer treatment. She is also an independent director on the board of NEA-backed primary-care services company Paladina Health LLC.

Nicole Quinn

Partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners

Nicole Quinn joined Menlo Park, Calif.-based Lightspeed Venture Partners in 2015 after spending eight years at Morgan Stanley. Ms. Quinn has been making investments in e-commerce, marketplace and other consumer companies. Her investments include women's shoe business Rothy's Inc., meditation app Calm and wedding registry site Zola Inc. She also works on celebrity-driven investments, including Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Inc. and Lady Gaga's Haus Laboratories. Ms. Quinn is looking to make more investments in the social media influencer space after seeing the growth of portfolio company Cameo. Ms. Quinn said the founders she invests in "have a huge vision and one that is true to who they are."

Celestine Schnugg

General Partner, Boom Capital

Celestine Schnugg is a general partner at Boom Capital in San Francisco, where she invests in pre-seed, early-stage startups operating in so-called "frontier tech," or companies whose work lies in highly technical, often overlapping sectors of science and engineering. Ms. Schnugg, who began working at the firm in 2017, is particularly focused on first-time founders newly out of academia, when networking can be challenging. She has led deals in startups such as Mammoth Biosciences Inc., which offers a CRISPR-based platform for researchers, and System1 Biosciences Inc., which is developing neurological drugs by experimenting with miniature brains. Prior to Boom Capital, Ms. Schnugg worked as a partner at Innovation Endeavors and as an associate at Apple Inc.

Alexa von Tobel

Founder, Inspired Capital

Alexa von Tobel wanted to create the kind of venture firm she would have liked as an investor when she was building her startup LearnVest Inc. So, together with Penny Pritzker, former Secretary of Commerce under President Obama, she launched Inspired Capital, a firm that she says is "high on empathy and also high on --commitment" to founders. The New York firm invests in early-stage startups across the U.S. It's raising $200 million for its debut fund, according to a regulatory filing. Ms. von Tobel's firm is made up of operators, like her. She founded LearnVest, an online financial planning service, while attending Harvard Business School. Ms. von Tobel raised nearly $75 million for the company before it was sold to Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., in 2015. Ms. von Tobel joined Northwestern, where she became chief digital officer and chief innovation officer and later ran its venture investments. Throughout that time, Ms. von Tobel invested in and advised startups personally. Her new firm has backed companies like Chief, a network for executive women, and Rho, a mobile bank for small businesses. Inspired Capital invests across sectors, but financial services that help people better manage money continues to be dear to Ms. von Tobel's heart. "Some great technology solutions are on the radar, but it's something that still keeps me up at night," Ms. von Tobel said about America's financial literacy.

Lisa Wu

Partner, Norwest Venture Partners

Lisa Wu joined Norwest Venture Partners in 2012 and spent the first part of her career there initiating investments in the New York area. Ms. Wu sourced the firm's investment in Jet.com Inc., which was acquired by Walmart Inc. for $3.3 billion. Ms. Wu also led Norwest's investment in Ritual, a women's health brand. Last year, Ms. Wu was promoted to partner. She focuses on seed- to late-stage investing in consumer internet, digital commerce and future marketplaces. Previously, Ms. Wu scouted acquisition and investment targets for Amazon.com Inc. and worked at Bessemer Venture Partners, focusing on consumer and software investments. Before her rise as an investor, Ms. Wu got a taste of the business side she founded Banzai! Fresh, a small business providing nutritious foods to schools and hospitals in Northern California.

Before women made inroads among the ranks of private-equity deal makers, they had already established a strong presence within the limited-partner and fundraising communities. This year's honorees on our Women to Watch list include some of the most talented professionals involved on both sides of private-equity fund negotiations.

Alicia Cooney

Co-Founder and Managing Director, Monument Group

Alicia Cooney, a co-founder of placement agent Monument Group, has helped build two successful businesses during her more than 40 years in finance. Before co-founding Monument with John McLaren in 1994, Ms. Cooney spent 13 years building the research arm at Boston-based Cambridge Associates. She and Mr. McLaren launched Monument to create a placement firm grounded in analytics, an approach that wasn't common at the time. "I firmly believe that if you start a business, the most successful are ones that have a well-founded knowledge base and can perceive the opportunities," Ms. Cooney said. "I would love to start a restaurant because I love to cook, but that would be completely foolhardy on my part. I don't know about the restaurant business. I understood the pros and cons of the placement agents, because they were all calling on me [at Cambridge]." Ms. Cooney also served as a founding board member of the Tuck Center for Private Equity and Venture Capital at Dartmouth College and was a longtime member of the investment committee at Wellesley College.

Monica Davis

Director, L Catterton

Monica Davis, a director of investor relations at L Catterton, manages more than 300 limited-partner relationships across seven fund strategies in addition to focusing on capital raising. Before entering her present position at the beginning of the year, she spent seven years at KKR & Co., focusing on global capital raising and business development activities across alternative asset classes as a director in the client relations and partner group. Her experience also includes working as an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. as part of the private-equity funds group. While at Merrill Lynch, Ms. Davis moved to the spinout firm Mercury Capital Advisors, where she worked on private-equity fundraising. She earned M.B.A.s from London Business School and Columbia Business School after graduating summa cum laude from Howard University with a bachelor's degree in finance.

Anisa Javeri

Managing Director and Founding Member, Evercore Inc.'s Private Funds Group

Anisa Javeri, a founding member of Evercore Inc.'s private funds group, is one of the co-heads of the U.S. advisory team of theprivate-equity capital-raising arm of the New York-based investment bank. The role makes her responsible for all capital raises for U.S.-based private-equity clients in buyout, growth, infrastructure and credit. Some of the largest and most notable fundraisings she has worked on are infrastructure investor I Squared Capital's $7 billion second fund, which closed last year; Genstar Capital's three most recent funds, the latest of which closed in February at $5.5 billion; and software investor K1 Investment Management's $2 billion K4 Private Investors. Before joining Evercore, Ms. Javeri worked in Neuberger Berman LLC's alternatives advisory and placement group, and in the same group at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before that. She graduated from the University of Warwick in England.

Amanda Outerbridge

Managing Director, HarbourVest Partners

Amanda Outerbridge is a managing director in the primary partnership team at Boston-based HarbourVest Partners. Over the course of her career since joining the firm in 2000, Ms. Outerbridge has traversed the globe, including a year-long stint in the firm's London office and two years in Hong Kong. She has built a strong reputation, in particular for helping HarbourVest develop a world-class venture portfolio, according to Managing Director Scott Voss. "Amanda has been phenomenal at accessing new relationships and getting us in the top-performing managers," Mr. Voss said. Managing Director and Head of Investments Greg Stento added that the global perspective Ms. Outerbridge has gained has informed not only her investment judgment but also her ability to connect with other people. "She's not afraid to get into the analytics and look at the detailed numbers and models that get built around an investment," Mr. Stento said. "But she's also a terrific people person. She has a way of putting people at ease and building relationships with almost any type of person." Ms. Outerbridge herself said she believes that having a long-term perspective on relationship building has helped boost her career. "It's really a marathon, not a sprint," she added.

Imogen Richards

Partner, Pantheon

As partner and global head of Pantheon's investment structuring and strategy, Imogen Richards has made a direct impact on the pace and efficiency of investment deployment. Her team currently oversees more than 100 different client portfolios with about $11 billion of dry powder across all of Pantheon's strategies. The team also manages the allocations of all of the firm's deals between clients. In 2018 alone, the investment structuring team closed 136 transactions with a value of $5.2 billion. Her team is currently looking to close nearly 45 deals. Her advice to other women is to "always put your hand up for doing things you're interested in." She tells them, "Do your job really well so that people trust you and they're willing to allow you the space to do new and exciting things." Ms. Richards joined Pantheon from Anglo Irish Bank Corp. in Dublin and holds a master's degree in natural sciences from Cambridge University.

Jill Shaw

Managing Director, Cambridge Associates

As director of private markets for consultancy Cambridge Associates, Jill Shaw develops ideas for new private investments and builds portfolios for the firm's nonprofit clients and high-net-worth families ranging in size from $60 million to $4.5 billion. She also leads Cambridge's efforts on developing best practices for benchmarking private investments, a subject on which she has published several papers. A graduate of Babson College in Massachusetts, Ms. Shaw began her career at Cambridge in 2001 as a member of the firm's investment-performance group. She rose to manage that group, overseeing a team of more than 30 people responsible for analyzing more than 2,700 private-markets investments, and designed the firm's current version of quarterly performance reports for private clients. Ms. Shaw then returned to Babson for her M.B.A. before rejoining Cambridge in 2007 as an investment director. She began managing portfolios on a discretionary basis in 2012, and in 2014 was named managing director.

Digital human rights are next frontier for fund groups

Investors take a critical look at potentially damaging role of some technology in everyday lives

Politicians publicly grilling technology chiefs such as Facebook s Mark Zuckerberg is all too familiar for investors.

 There isn t a day that goes by where you don t see one of the tech companies talking to Congress or being highlighted for some kind of controversy,  says Lauren Compere, director of shareholder engagement at Boston Common Asset Management, a $2.4bn fund group that invests heavily in tech stocks.

Fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal that engulfed Facebook was a wake-up call for investors such as Boston Common, underlining the damaging social effects of digital technology if left unchecked. These are the red flags coming up for us again and again,  says Ms Compere.

Digital human rights are fast becoming the latest front in the debate around fund managers  ethical investments efforts. Fund managers have come under pressure in recent years to divest from companies that can harm human rights   from gun manufacturers or retailers to operators of private prisons. The focus is now switching to the less tangible but equally serious human rights risks lurking in fund managers  technology holdings.

Attention on technology groups began with concerns around data privacy, but emerging focal points are targeted advertising and how companies deal with online extremism.

Following a terrorist attack in New Zealand this year where the shooter posted video footage of the incident online, investors managing assets of more than NZ$90bn (US$57bn) urged Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet, Google s parent company, to take more action in dealing with violent or extremist content published on their platforms.

The Investor Alliance for Human Rights is currently co-ordinating a global engagement effort with Alphabet over the governance of its artificial intelligence technology, data privacy and online extremism.

Investor engagement on the topic of digital human rights is in its infancy. One roadblock for investors has been the difficulty they face in detecting and measuring what the actual risks are. Most investors do not have a very good understanding of the implications of all of the issues in the digital space and don t have sufficient research and tools to properly assess them   and that goes for companies too,  said Ms Compere.

One rare resource available is the Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index, established in 2015, which rates tech companies based on a range of metrics. The development of such tools gives investors more information on the risk associated with technological advancements, enabling them to hold companies to account when they identify risks and questionable ethics.

Another challenge is the pace of technological advancements.  The concern is that technological changes are being quickly driven through by companies but sometimes we don t stop and ask what is the human rights impact,  said John Howchin, secretary-general of theSwedish AP funds  ethics council. In future it will be seen as a wild west. 

This point is highlighted by the fierce debate surrounding artificial intelligence andfacial recognition software. Hailed as a way to make society more efficient, investors are grappling with the fact that facial recognition can also be used for unethical purposes. Critics of the software say companies that manufacture and sell it may not be aware of how it is being used, especially when adopted by governments for military purposes.

Facial and emotion recognition systems are notably deployed by the Chinese government for surveillance in the Xinjiang region, where an estimated 1m mostly Muslim minorities are held in internment camps. In the US, activists and privacy groups claim the technology is used in a harmful way by federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

There are also concerns about flaws and biases in facial recognition programmes.A test by the American Civil Liberties Union last year found that Amazon s facial recognition technology, Rekognition, wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as arrestees. Research has also shown that the software registers more cases of mistaken identity with women and minorities.

Carola van Lamoen, head of active ownership at Robeco, the  199bn asset manager, said:  We see the ability of AI to facilitate growth potential for technology companies but we also see the associated risks. 

Complicating the picture is the absence of harmonised regulations governing AI. Robeco recently embarked on a probe into the social impact of AI prompted by concerns that the advancements were outpacing the development of rules or principles.

In the US, for example, a handful of cities have banned local government and law enforcement agencies from deploying facial recognition software but federal agencies can still use it.

 What worries investors [about AI] is that the technology is being developed in a vacuum   we re not seeing a global norm around it,  said Ms Compere.

Several companies, including Google, Microsoft and IBM, have taken initial steps to protect against unintended risks by adopting codes of AI ethics.

Microsoft has been particularly vocal, calling last year for  a government initiative to regulate the proper use of facial recognition technology . This year the company declined a request from a California law enforcement agency to install facial recognition technology in officers  cars and body cameras over human rights concerns.

Despite Microsoft s decision, few companies have gone public on how risks to human rights influence their business decisions and affect which contracts they accept or decline.

Some investors are using their voice within companies to make a stand. The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of responsible investors managing more than $400bn in assets, this year filed a resolution at Amazon calling for it to stop selling Rekognition to governments until it had completed a review into whether it posed a threat to civil and human rights.

Other investors want companies to integrate human rights considerations into their formal risk management assessments and make senior executives accountable for this.  We want companies to do their homework,  said Ms van Lamoen.  They should know when and how AI is used, assess the potential impacts and actively monitor this at board level. 

 Technology companies have had issues involving human rights over the past few years,  said Mr Howchin. We think there s a need for the whole technology sector to better understand human rights and start hiring people who are specialist in human rights. 

This involves asking companies to train their AI designers to consider human rights during the product development process.  Unless concepts are baked in to the actual design of newer technologies from the get-go, it is a lot harder to control human rights implications,  said Ms Compere.

WeWork Was Wrestling With SEC Over Key Financial Metric Just Before It Scrapped IPO; Regulator raised numerous concerns about a metric WeWork called 'contribution margin' as it was trying to court investors, documents show

By Jean Eaglesham and Eliot Brown

Just weeks before WeWork expected its stock to begin trading publicly, the startup was still wrangling with the Securities and Exchange Commission over a controversial key financial metric and a litany of other concerns about its planned multibillion-dollar IPO.

On Sept. 11 after the initial public offering prospectus had been public for nearly a month, and after the SEC had already made dozens of demands about the document the regulator sent the shared-workspace company a list of 13 still-unresolved concerns, according to previously unpublished correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The back-and-forth shows that WeWork was scrambling to clean up big problems as its IPO was crumbling. The timing was indicative of the chaotic management that gave investors pause and ultimately led the company to pull the offering and Chief Executive Adam Neumann to step down under pressure.

We Co., as the WeWork parent is known, had filed its draft prospectus confidentially with the SEC for review in December 2018, giving the company months to negotiate with the agency behind closed doors about its contents before unveiling it to the public.

But as the IPO loomed, the SEC zeroed in on how WeWork framed its heavy losses, particularly through a bespoke profitability metric called "contribution margin," a version of which had formerly been known as "community-adjusted Ebitda." The agency had first ordered WeWork to remove the measure, before the company offered to substantially change it.

In mid-September, the day before WeWork had hoped to start the roadshow to peddle its IPO to investors, the metric was still mentioned in its revised prospectus more than 100 times. The company planned to amend the filing before starting the roadshow, according to a person close to WeWork but instead shelved the IPO, as investors questioned the company's worth and its corporate governance.

"It's highly unusual to have issues that are so important still being disputed while they are out there marketing the stock to investors," said Minor Myers, a law professor at the University of Connecticut who reviewed the correspondence at the Journal's request. As WeWork was battling the SEC over its metrics, its advisers were "figuring what they can sell using these numbers," Mr. Myers added.

WeWork deployed a battalion of Wall Street lawyers to try to win over the regulator, according to people close to the tumultuous process.

The SEC sent Mr. Neumann a nine-page letter on Aug. 30, telling WeWork to remove mentions of contribution margin. "As currently calculated and presented, we believe that your [contribution margin] measure could be misleading," the letter said. "Please remove disclosure of this measure throughout your registration statement."

The letter also questioned forecasts that assumed 100% occupancy of offices leased out by WeWork, and pushed for greater clarity on a $5.9 million payment WeWork made and later reversed to a company controlled by Mr. Neumann for rights to the word "We," which he had trademarked.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Neumann said he and the company "disclosed related-party transactions in the [prospectus] in accordance with applicable law and good governance."

WeWork fought back hard, especially on contribution margin, the correspondence shows. One version of the metric, which previously "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-and-lyft-get-creative-with-numbers-but-investors-arent-blind-to-the-losses-11557826202", was widely derided because it excludes costs to such an extent that it flipped WeWork's bottom line for 2018 from a net loss of about $1.9 billion using standard accounting, to a $467 million profit.

WeWork's resistance to removing the metric was directed by Mr. Neumann, people familiar with the discussions said. Mr. Neumann had previously boasted about the metric to reporters and investors, to show how the company's core business was profitable.

Within five days of receiving the SEC's Aug. 30 letter, WeWork's advisers at two top-tier Wall Street law firms, Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, sent responses totaling 45 pages, including a letter focused solely on two financial metrics, and filed a revised, 223-page prospectus.

The Cravath letter, from former senior SEC official John White, said WeWork still believed its metrics were fair but was willing to ax those the SEC most objected to excluding certain lease costs to try to "find a course forward." Mr. White and a Skadden spokeswoman didn't respond to requests for comment.

Many of the SEC's comments to WeWork "went straight to the heart of the issues that ultimately caused the IPO to unravel," said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado, who reviewed the correspondence for the Journal. "The SEC staff shined a laser light on many of the business metrics and spotted a number of the conflicts of interest and holes in the prospectus," he said.

An SEC spokeswoman said the agency doesn't comment on individual companies' filings.

Among other issues the SEC targeted was what the WeWork prospectus called "illustrative annual economics." The agency questioned how the company had arrived at some rosy numbers. "Please explain to readers and tell us how your assumed workstation utilization rate of 100% is realistic," its letter said. In reply, WeWork agreed to drop the illustrative economics section from the prospectus.

WeWork's liberal use of customized metrics that don't comply with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, was central to its wrangling with the SEC, according to people close to the process. The draft prospectus WeWork filed in December cited at least six non-GAAP metrics; by the time it issued the prospectus in August, the tally had fallen.

Despite going through several revisions, the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-investors-turned-off-by-sloppy-ipo-filings-11570440674" contained significant errors and omissions, the Journal has reported.

This past Friday, after markets closed, WeWork published a slide deck from Oct. 11 after Mr. Neumann resigned that showed financial results including a "location contribution margin" that appeared to be a renamed version of the metric at the center of its dispute with the SEC.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS

Which parts of the correspondence between WeWork and the SEC should have set off alarms for all parties involved? Join the conversation below.

The SEC is stepping up scrutiny of creative financial measures, lawyers said. Nearly all big companies now use at least one non-GAAP financial metric. Last year, 97% of S&P 500 companies used non-GAAP metrics, up from 59% in 1996, according to an analysis for the Journal by research firm Audit Analytics.

It isn't unusual for companies to go through several rounds of comments with the SEC in the run-up to an IPO. The stock can't be sold until the agency gives the green light to the prospectus, and SEC officials will nitpick details of the disclosure until they are happy, lawyers say.

Would you talk about your finances with a chatbot?

Artificial intelligence could bridge the advice gap for clients with basic needs. But human interaction is still required for more complex requirements, discovers Damian Fantato

Think of a financial adviser and the chances are you will think of a middle-aged man in a suit with a fondness for spreadsheets. But for a new generation of customers, a regulated adviser could take the form of a digital chatbot, powered by artificial intelligence with a penchant for emojis.

The traditional advice world is being digitally disrupted by a wave of financial advice services using artificial intelligence, which claim to provide clients with a personal recommendation the threshold which distinguishes advice from guidance without human intervention.

Billed by some as the solution to the UK's "advice gap", these "advisers" currently exist in the form of chatbots asking questions about our financial choices. Many think the technology will evolve even further which has mixed implications for traditional financial advisers but will clients really take advice from a robot? Mind the advice gap In the past 10 years, financial advice as we know it has gone through a serious shake up. The Retail Distribution Review in 2013 banned commission payments to advisers, beefing up cost disclosures and training requirements for advisers.

This may have increased the quality of advice, but it has been attributed to the number of financial advisers falling from more than 40,000 in 2011 to about 26,000 today. High street banks left the advice market although the rise of robo advice is now tempting some to come back in but the higher cost of regulation meant many traditional firms shifted their focus to the wealthiest, highest margin clients and away from the mass market.

This is the "advice gap" which advocates claim AI can now help fill.

Waiting to help them is MyEva, a "digital financial adviser" which uses algorithms to provide regulated advice on pensions, savings and investments through a chatbot, backed by a team of human advisers.

MyEva is the creation of digital advisory firm Wealth Wizards, which is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chief executive Andrew Firth says the app is aimed squarely at the "mass employed" who face similar financial issues one of which is the lack of access to straightforward, affordable advice. "The majority of our revenue is from employers who are buying MyEva for their employees," he says, adding that most offer it free as part of their wider staff benefits package.

Intriguingly, the firm plumped for a female chatbot because the financial advice profession is dominated by men and this was one way to "help address the balance". The name Eva was chosen because it is defined on slang website Urban Dictionary as "a person of extreme knowledge and high standards".

After an online "financial healthcheck", Eva will suggest ways that users can achieve their goals.

Mr Firth says younger employees tend to have quite straightforward questions about pension top-ups and Isa investing which can be handled by the chatbot in language they understand (MyEva's slogan is "no jargon, no pressure").

If users are debt free and have savings, they can access investment advice but only once their risk appetite has been assessed.

MyEva will then recommend passive funds from the Vanguard Lifestrategy range, chosen because they were considered appropriate for firsttime, "Middle Britain" investors. Conversations about retirement planning, decumulation and anything more complex will go through to a human adviser. "If Eva has something she is not sure about, she books an appointment for you with a phone adviser who will pick up the conversation," Mr Firth adds.

He estimates that about 80 per cent of MyEva's clients are handled by the chatbot, with the rest speaking to a human adviser on the phone.

Employers will pick up these advice charges, depending on their agreement, or individuals can pay up front. Services include a pensions "tidy up" to review and potentially consolidate company pensions, charged from 150 per pot. An investment planning report starts at 150. More complex tasks such as inheritance tax planning cost 1,500.

Wealth Wizards, in which insurer LV= has a minority stake, has already signed up more than a dozen clients including Unilever, Calvin Klein and some NHS trusts.

Individuals can subscribe to MyEva for 2 per month, though relatively few people have done so. "We are not marketing this version as we are concentrating on employers for the time being," Mr Firth adds.

Multiple options A different approach is taken by Multiply, a regulated advisory firm that gained FCA approval for its app in July. Already available on iOS, the Android launch is expected next year.

Multiply targets younger clients over traditional advisers workers in their twenties, thirties and forties who have "just got on top of their cash flow", according to chief executive Vivek Madlani.

Once users have downloaded the app, he says they are taken through "a similar process that an adviser will go through we assess attitude to risk and capacity for loss, where a customer is in terms of their finances, what they are investing towards."

Mr Madlani says Multiply's younger clients tend to be most interested in saving to buy a home, but plenty are interested in pensions and investments. This is where the app's "product engine" kicks in.

As well as savings tips, Multiply offers Isas, Sipps and general investment accounts and can recommend portfolios consisting of between one and three multi-asset passive funds.

In future, Multiply aims to offer access to products including mortgages and income protection policies. As well as providing advice to the mass market, Multiply also promises to do so for "free" though this is not quite as good as it sounds.

The company uses what advisers refer to as contingent charging model the advice is effectively free, but the adviser charges for implementation. So Multiply is only paid if clients go ahead with its recommendations.

Mr Madlani says this is clearly explained to users of the app, but he accepts there are limits to artificial intelligence-powered advice.

"To be honest, there is a boundary beyond which we don't want to accept the risks, such as final salary pension scheme transfers [or] buying an annuity."

About 25 per cent of those who use the app are not considered to be suitable investors for a variety of reasons; if, for example, they have high levels of debt. However, Multiply does not currently pass on their details to advisers such as debt charities something Mr Madlani says the company is looking to address.

TheUSdimension Ramya Joseph, the founder andchief executive of Pefin, which claimsto be the first company in the world tooffer AI advice, is more bullish aboutthe technology's ability.

The US company does not operatein the UK though it is in discussionswith potential partners to address this. Ms Joseph believes there are fewpersonal finance scenarios that AI cannot handle, but that this wouldnot necessarily mean the end ofhuman advisers.

'AI can complement a human adviser and allow them to spend more time focusing on both the client relationship as well as more specialised financial needs' such as complex business and trust structures."

Nutmeg, one of the UK's largeston line investment managers, is looking at how it can use AI to improve itsnascent advice service launched latelast year using human beings.

"We area technology-led businessand believe there is huge potential forAI to make advice more efficient andtherefore make it possible to servemany more clients," says Lisa Caplan,Nutmeg's head of financial advice.

"In the future, there will be agreater role for machine learning,which is already used to detectchanges in behaviour such as excessive account log ins."

There could be opportunities for"traditional" financial advice businesses to invest in AI to provide a cheaper service for parts of their business, with a human face attached.

Andy Thompson, chief executive of Quilter Financial Planning, the UK's second largest advice firm, says his company is investing in automation.

"In the US, AI is more advanced and they are moving away from the dichotomy of face-to-face advice versus robo-advice. A hybrid form of advice is becoming increasingly common, which is something I think the UK will also be embracing.

"The power of technology to improve efficiency and lower costs both for advisers and their clients is immense. Ultimately, the relationship between an adviser is intimate one and cannot be replaced by AI."

Regulatory worries Other commentators point out that advice chatbots are not replacing traditional advisers, but making it possible for regulated firms to serve a hitherto unadvised client base.

But regulators are concerned that the boundaries between regulated financial advice and DIY investment platforms where the risk is on the individual are becoming blurred, which could put consumers at risk.

Wanda Goldwag, chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel, says she is "concerned that regulated advice is not clearly distinguished from 'execution-only' transactions.

"Consumers need to know, when using robo-advice services, whether they will be protected by the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme when things go wrong," she says, adding that there is a need for greater transparency on costs and charges associated with advice.

The FCA declined to comment on whether it shared these concerns, but has previously highlighted "weaknesses" in the way some automated robo advice services support vulnerable consumers, such as those who had recently suffered a bereavement.

Yet one of the risks that AI advisers themselves acknowledge is the possibility that if something goes wrong, it will go wrong for a lot of people.

Mr Madlani, who is himself a qualified adviser, says: "We have put so much work into ensuring we have set up the right checks and balances into our advice engine. Ultimately I am not the guy who wants to go to jail for years for providing millions of people with unsuitable advice. It has taken us almost three years to launch, which says something."

Mr Madlani points out that Multiply employs regulated financial advisers, but to check that the advice it is providing is suitable, not to advise clients directly.

Ms Joseph says her company also spent years testing its advice model and employs human advisers to check its advice.

We need to talk AI advice is currently confined to chatbots, but some predict clients will soon be able to talk at home via their smart speaker.

"If you talk to a chat interface, then it is not that big a step to get voice recognition and voice-to-text," says Mr Firth of Wealth Wizards.

Ms Joseph agrees: "In five to seven years it will be possible for consumers to widely accept automated advice as a service interacting with voice recognition technology."

But will younger clients be happy with this form of advice? Adam O'Brien, a 30-year-old data scientist from south London, falls squarely into the target market he has accumulated cash savings, but has never considered investing them.

"I really don't know what products are out there apart from the Isas or savings accounts from the mainstream banks, and the interest rates seem so low now that it doesn't seem worth the effort to spend too much time looking into it," he says.

He has signed up to Multiply and is in the process of trying it out.

"If the advice from pre-determined algorithms takes the risk of receiving advice from a less skilled or experienced adviser, or one just having an off day, then I have no issues with the lack of human oversight."

However, the traditional advice industry isn't unduly worried by AI.

"Given the communication skills and empathy needed to fulfil the entire role of a professional financial adviser, it is unlikely that AI will be able to replicate this any time soon," says Keith Richards, chief executive of the Personal Finance Society.

The services he stresses the robots cannot replicate are those that older and richer clients are prepared to pay for "understanding [a client's] goals for themselves and their wider family; how their finances fit in with their career; educating them about investments and helping them understand how they will manage different risks."

For younger generations with less complex financial needs who are already comfortable asking Amazon's Alexa to buy things for them, perhaps that doesn't matter.

Good day. Valuations in Silicon Valley remained strong in the third quarter, but seem to have flattened for 2019, according to a new report from Fenwick & West. We will be watching to see if valuations pick up or drop off in the fourth quarter.

Valuations increased 88% in the third quarter, up from 77% in the prior quarter and the highest average price increase since the third quarter of 2015, the report said.

However, there were some small signs of cooling, with the median valuation price increase dipping to 54% in the third quarter, from 58% in the second quarter. And 'up' rounds made up 81% of deals in the third quarter, down from 86% in the second.

And continuing a trend, Series B and C valuations increased while later-stage Series D and E valuations decreased showing weakness in the pre-IPO rounds.

And now on to the news...

In the News

IPO push. Alibaba Group Holding is aiming to raise $10 billion to $15 billion in a second listing in Hong Kong this month, according to people familiar with the matter, reviving the planned offering even as the city's political climate remains unstable.

* Separately, China is making a fresh attempt to attract technology listings, after previous plans to connect overseas-traded behemoths including Alibaba Group with mainland investors fizzled, The Wall Street Journal reports.

* The original plan, which focused on large companies, ran aground last year after Alibaba and others dragged their feet, trade tensions put pressure on mainland Chinese stocks, and regulators failed to garner enough political will.

* Securities regulators and stock-exchange officials could unveil new rules for public consultation as soon as in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter.

From poker to venture capital. Starting Line has its eye on the 99%. The Chicago-based venture-capital firm, which was recently launched by former professional poker player-turned-investor Ezra Galston, is looking for startups developing technology for the everyday consumer, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports. Starting Line, which closed on a $17 million first fund, has backed six companies.

WeWork's Wall Street Ties. With its money and credibility, Wall Street fed WeWork's breakneck growth and its image as a superhot technology company. WeWork's model leasing office space, outfitting it with touches like free beer and fruit-infused water, then subleasing it required a constant supply of credit. Yet, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group and other banks arranged giant fees and strict protections that reflected their concerns about WeWork's unproven business model and its CEO's unpredictable behavior.

Exits

Customer data-management platform Amperity Inc. acquired Custora Inc., which provides customer-analytics software for retail, for an undisclosed amount. Amperity scored a $50 million Series C round in July from investors including Tiger Global, Goldman Sachs, Declaration Partners, Madera Technology Partners and Madrona Venture Group. Custora, based in New York, was backed by General Catalyst Partners, Foundation Capital, Greycroft Partners and others.

VC Funds

Acton Capital closed its Acton Fund V at $215 million to make growth-stage investments in Europe and North America. Limited partners included European Investment Fund, KfW Bank, Hubert Burda Media, as well as family offices and entrepreneurs. So far, the fund has invested in startups including telemedicine provider Maple, business-to-business photo platform LemonOne and intimate apparel brand Knix.

Gormley's Take: Biotech and Tech VCs Have Different Views on AI-Based Drug Discovery; Even so, the two approaches to drug discovery aren't always in competition

Two recent commentaries by biotechnology industry insiders highlighted a divide among venture capitalists: those who see artificial intelligence powering a revolution in drug discovery, and those who don't.

Venture firms have financed several startups applying AI to drug discovery, including Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Atomwise Inc., and twoXAR Inc., betting the technology will help uncover a new generation of novel medicines.

Articles by David Shaywitz, a senior partner with the venture arm of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., and Recursion co-founder and Chief Executive Chris Gibson analyzed how tech and biotech venture investors view the sector.

While several tech investors see AI as a missing link in drug development, Dr. Shaywitz noted that many biotech venture investors on the other hand have a skeptical view and question the business models and impact potential of startups in the sector.

But he also suggested that if a pharmaceutical company buys a high-profile AI-drug startup it could trigger a wave of subsequent acquisitions.

Meanwhile, Dr. Gibson, who heads such an AI drug startup, pointed out that the goal of these companies isn't a quick flip, but to establish a brand new kind of independent, technology-enabled drug company capable of executing on all aspects of drug discovery and development.

One point missing from this debate: conventional and AI-based drug-discovery strategies aren't always in competition. Frequently, AI-based startups aim to solve longstanding problems in the pharmaceutical industry, such as drugmakers' inability to develop compounds that bind effectively to the vast majority of proteins in the body.

For example, Atomwise uses its AI capabilities mostly to search for compounds that hit protein targets that haven't been drugged before. Its ability to find those hits has enabled it to raise $51 million from tech and life sciences investors such as Khosla Ventures and Data Collective.

Atomwise and some other startups are producing tangible results now, but the ultimate proof of the value of AI will come when drugs discovered with the help of the technology earn regulatory approval, a process that remains lengthy because of the need for clinical testing.

"There's a long path to get to medicines, everybody agrees on that," Atomwise co-founder and CEO Abraham Heifets said.

Would you reveal your money wishlist to a chatbot?

Think of a financial adviser and the chances are you will think of a middle-aged man in a suit with a fondness for spreadsheets. But for a new generation of customers, a regulated adviser could take the form of a digital chatbot, powered by artificial intelligence with a penchant for emojis.

The traditional advice world is being digitally disrupted by a new wave of financial advice services using artificial intelligence, which claim to provide clients with a personal recommendation   the threshold which distinguishes advice from guidance   without human intervention.

Billed by some as the solution to the UK s  advice gap , these  advisers  currently exist in the form of chatbots asking questions about our financial choices. Many think the technology will evolve even further   which has mixed implications for traditional financial advisers   but will clients really take advice from a robot?

Mind the advice gap

In the past 10 years, financial advice as we know it has gone through a serious shake up. The Retail Distribution Review in 2013 banned commission payments to advisers, beefing up cost disclosures and training requirements for advisers.

This may have increased the quality of advice, but it has been attributed to the number of financial advisers falling from more than 40,000 in 2011 to about 26,000 today. High street banks left the advice market   although the rise of robo advice is now tempting some to come back in   but the higher cost of regulation meant many traditional firms shifted their focus to the wealthiest, highest margin clients and away from the mass market.

This is the  advice gap  which advocates claim AI can now help fill.

Waiting to help them is MyEva, a  digital financial adviser  which uses algorithms to provide regulated advice on pensions, savings and investments through a chatbot, backed by a team of human advisers.

MyEva is the creation of digital advisory firm Wealth Wizards, which is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chief executive Andrew Firth says the app is aimed squarely at the  mass employed  who face similar financial issues   one of which is the lack of access to straightforward, affordable advice.

We need to talk

AI advice is currently confined to chatbots, but some predict it will soon come to life in a form clients can actually talk to at home via their smart speaker.

 If you talk to a chat interface, then it is not that big a step to get voice recognition and voice-to-text,  says Mr Firth of Wealth Wizards.

He adds that converting the spoken word to written text has benefits for digital financial advice firms because if everything the client says can be written down, you can store it and do a lot of analysis.

Ms Joseph agrees:  In five to seven years it will be possible for consumers to widely accept automated advice as a service interacting with voice recognition technology. 

She cited Amazon s Alexa and Apple s Siri as examples of how the public had come to accept talking to a machine.

But will younger clients be happy with this form of advice?

Adam O Brien, a 30-year-old data scientist from south London, falls squarely into the target market   he has accumulated cash savings, but has never considered investing them.

 I really don t know what products are out there apart from the Isas or savings accounts from the mainstream banks, and the interest rates seem so low now that it doesn t seem worth the effort to spend too much time looking into it,  he says.

Instead, he has signed up to Multiply and is in the process of trying it out.

 If the advice coming from pre-determined algorithms takes the risk of receiving advice from a less skilled or experienced adviser, or one just having an off day, then I have no issues with the lack of human oversight. 

However, the traditional advice industry isn t unduly worried by AI.

 Given the communication skills and empathy needed to fulfil the entire role of a professional financial adviser, it is unlikely that AI will be able to replicate this any time soon,  says Keith Richards, chief executive of the Personal Finance Society.

The services he stresses the robots cannot replicate are tellingly those that older and richer clients are prepared to pay for    understanding [a client s] goals for themselves and their wider family; how their finances fit in with their career; educating them about their investments and helping them understand how they are going to manage different risks. 

For younger generations with less complex financial needs who are already comfortable asking Alexa to buy things for them, perhaps that doesn t matter.

My brush with a digital adviser

My interaction with artificial intelligence-generated advice started with a conversation during my lunch break with chirpy chatbot MyEva who used plenty of emojis to colour her text.

The chirpiness was slightly undercut when she provided me with terms and conditions and an Financial Conduct Authority registration number   but it was a necessary step, as this app provides regulated advice.

After asking for my email address and if I wanted to receive promotional material in my inbox (I did not), Eva prompted me to start my  financial health check  by asking me to click a button labelled  Let s do this! .

Essentially a fact find, I was asked questions on the chat stream about my employment and marital status, if I owned my own home, if I tended to spend more than I earn and whether I was in significant debt.

This generated a checklist, most of which wasn t rocket science   pay into a pension, build a savings buffer and then save towards buying my first home (if only it were that easy). There was also some stuff which might be less intuitive for some people, such as writing a will and checking who gets my death-in-service benefit.

The majority of MyEva users have the service provided free by the company they work for. As an individual user, if I wanted to access certain services   such as saving into a pension   I would have to sign up and pay 2 a month.

But the service to help me buy a home was free and, being a millennial, I was intrigued.

It transpires that Eva has  teamed up  with mortgage broker Alexander Hall. After I provided details of my savings and a rough idea of how much a house was likely to cost me, Eva decided I would benefit from speaking to a broker and asked if she could pass my details on to them.

It turns out robots are not going to be replacing humans just yet.

Cyber Daily: Walking the Privacy Tightrope

Hello. Privacy is fast becoming an expensive and time-consuming legal problem for companies of all kinds. Protecting customer privacy is one way companies are seeking competitive advantage.

Facebook hasn't complied fully with subpoenas and other requests for information about its privacy practices, according to the California attorney general in a lawsuit unveiled Wednesday. The tech company says it has provided thousands of pages of written responses and many more documents.

Also today: A New York medical center agrees to a $3 million settlement over patient privacy violations; Apple released details about how it handles privacy protections on its iPhones; and IBM and Bank of America released details about a cloud service that includes encryption and other security measures to guard banking data.

Privacy Investigation

California seeks to force Facebook to comply with subpoenas. California is investigating Facebook's privacy practices, the state's attorney general revealed Wednesday in a lawsuit that accuses the Silicon Valley tech giant of failing to adequately comply with information requests, the WSJ reports. California prosecutors began probing Facebook in 2018, shortly after the company said data from as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct British political consulting firm.

Looking for email: California said in its legal filing that it doesn't believe Facebook has searched the emails of either Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg or Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in response to subpoenas. The office of Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that it issued a first round of subpoenas to Facebook on June 4, 2018, and waited more than a year for responses. A second round of information requests was issued this past June. In that case, the company didn't answer 19 of 27 written questions, gave only partial responses on six others and didn't provide any documents to six document requests.

Facebook says it has complied with requests: "To date, we have provided thousands of pages of written responses and hundreds of thousands of documents," said Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local policy.

News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook.

Big Number

$29 Million

Amount an employee of Nikkei America Inc. wired to a fraudster's account in September in response to an email message from someone posing as an executive of the Japanese media company. Nikkei said it is working with authorities in the U.S. and Hong Kong to investigate.

Huawei and 5G Security

Huawei founder says Chinese giant doesn't need the U.S. The Chinese telecom giant hasn't yet received any expressions of interest from U.S. companies to buy the intellectual property underpinning its 5G technology a workaround floated earlier this year after years of being blocked in the U.S., the WSJ reports. In an interview, Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei Huawei's 75-year-old founder, struck a defiant tone on the Trump administration's recent moves against the company, while also praising the U.S.'s entrepreneurial spirit.

No biggie: "We can survive very well without the U.S.," Mr. Ren said. "The China-U.S. trade talks are not something I'm concerned with." Mr. Ren said he would welcome a visit from President Trump now or after he has left office. "We would certainly give him a warm welcome," Mr. Ren said.

Context: In May the U.S. added Huawei to a Commerce Department "entity list," preventing many American suppliers from doing business with the Shenzhen-based company. Huawei, which last year bought $11 billion of technology from American suppliers including software from Alphabet and Microsoft, and chips from an array of manufacturers has moved to find backup sources, while also working on its own chips and software.

More Cyber News

Apple outlines iPhone privacy processes. The company issued papers for researchers and developers about how privacy is handled in its photo app, Safari web browser, location-based services and a sign-in process for third-party apps, Reuters reports. Apple's machine-learning technology helps guard against the creation of fake accounts and other systems for preventing developers from bypassing safeguards.

IBM, Bank of America collaborate on cloud, security tools. The companies are building a public-cloud computing service for banks that includes automated security tools and top-level encryption, the WSJ's CIO Journal reports. The service, unveiled Wednesday, is intended to protect banking data. "Even people at IBM with deep access to the cloud will not have access to the key" to unlock a bank's encrypted data, said Arvind Krishna, IBM's senior vice president for the cloud.

New York-based medical center settles privacy case. University of Rochester Medical Center said it will pay $3 million to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to settle a probe into violations of patient privacy, Becker's Hospital Review reports. The medical center reported the theft of an unencrypted flash drive in 2013 and an unencrypted laptop four years later. Each contained sensitive personal data. An investigation by the Office for Civil Rights at HHS found inadequate security and risk management procedures.

Good day from chilly New York. We're lucky here in Manhattan that the season so far has been mild compared with other parts of the country. In New England, snow lurks in the forecast while parts of the Intermountain region and upper Midwest have already been through the deep freeze treatment. But on to business.

Today we have a look at how the sluggish deal market has provided a kind of blessing in disguise as WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reports that one of the biggest U.S. public pensions has saved millions in expenses on carried interest. As we have reported elsewhere, top executives at Carlyle Group expect the M&A drought to begin lifting next year.

But at least one deal looks like it will conclude sooner than that, as WSJ Pro's Laura Kreutzer reports that the Federal Trade Commission has given early clearance to Kelso & Co.'s acquisition of a couple of marine insurers. As S&P Global Market Intelligence noted this week, deal volume which fell to a six-year low in the third quarter was aggravated over the summer by geopolitical events, from trade tensions, slowing growth and the dragging Brexit debate to the destruction of Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure and even a market crash in Argentina. As we keep our fingers crossed, we have collected a full plate of news below, so please, jump in...

Today's Top Stories

Calstrs Carried-Interest Payments Fall as Private-Equity Exits Slow

The pension fund for California schoolteachers saw its payments to private-equity managers decline last year, one of several recent signs that buyout firms are having more trouble profitably selling investments. The California State Teachers' Retirement System, which at $238 billion is the second-largest public pension fund in the U.S., reported that its investment costs fell 14% in 2018 from the year before, mainly because of a 36% decline in the amount of overall carried interest it paid, to $463 million, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reports. The report is the latest sign that successful private-equity exits are becoming harder to find. For pensions like Calstrs, the trend if it continues would likely reduce both investment costs and returns.

Kelso & Co. Cleared to Back Marine-Focused Specialty Insurers

Midmarket private-equity firm Kelso & Co. received regulatory clearance to take stakes in two insurers that serve the commercial and recreational marine industries. Kelso received early antitrust clearance to buy stakes in Gowrie Group Inc. and Maritime Program Group Inc., according to the Federal Trade Commission.

APC Automotive's Debt Deal Cuts Harvest, Audax Ownership Stakes

Aftermarket auto supplier APC Automotive Technologies LLC expects to dilute the ownership stakes of Harvest Partners and Audax Group's private-equity arm in a debt restructuring deal to cope with rising costs stemming from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions. APC Chief Financial Officer Marc Weinsweig told WSJ Pro's Alexander Gladstone that the company's private-equity owners and lenders agreed to provide a $40 million capital infusion while converting $125 million of junior debt into equity. But the private-equity firms will retain majority control of the company, Mr. Weinsweig said.

The Massachusetts state pension fund may soon be taking applications for a private-equity consultant. The investment committee of the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, which manages about $75 billion, last week voted to issue a call for private-equity consultants. The pension fund's contract with its current consultant, Hamilton Lane Inc., expires at the end of next September. The full board has to approve the decision before it can go forward, a spokesman for the pension said. Mass PRIM has been the top-performing private-equity investor among U.S. public pension funds for four straight years, according to a ranking released earlier this year by the American Investment Council, a private-equity lobbying group. The pension fund's portfolio was worth about $32 billion and recorded a net internal rate of return of 13.53% as of the end of September, pension documents show.

Investcorp, the Bahrain private-equity firm, is moving on multiple fronts to advance its presence in China.

They will also examine establishing a follow-on vehicle under the same team. On Thursday, Reuters reported that Investcorp had agreed to a three-way partnership with Hong Kong-based Fung Group's investment arm and state-owned China Resources to set up a $500 million investment pool focused on Asian food brands and manufacturing sites. The firms expect to supply rising demand for foreign foods in China's expanding middle class.

Chesapeake Energy Corp. said it may be unable to stay in business if oil and natural gas prices remain depressed, underscoring the challenges faced by drillers still trying to regain their footing after a collapse in commodity prices in 2014 and 2015. In a regulatory filing Tuesday, the Oklahoma City-based company said there was "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern, barring an increase in prices, and suggested that the situation could become increasingly dire over the next four quarters. The company said it was pursuing various alternatives to refinance debt, cut spending and raise cash through asset sales.

Real-estate technology startup Snapdocs Inc. has raised $25 million to further improve artificial intelligence on its mortgage processing platform.

The San Francisco-based startup provides software that enables the various parties involved in arranging a mortgage to interact, with the goal of simplifying the process. Some of the company's offerings use AI technology to perform tasks such as scanning documents for errors.

Numerous startups are attempting to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-providers-look-to-ai-to-process-home-loans-faster-11552899212" to streamline the mortgage and homebuying process, which is notorious for including heavy paperwork. These startups are building platforms for the parties concerned lenders, titleholders and notaries to share documents and reduce the time borrowers spend waiting for a mortgage approval.

Snapdocs' new Series B round was led by F-Prime Capital, with David Jegen, managing partner of F-Prime's Tech Fund, joining the company's board. Previous investors Sequoia Capital, which led Snapdocs' Series A, as well as Freestyle Capital and Founders Fund returned for the new round.

The company has raised about $43 million since it was founded in 2013 by Aaron King.

Snapdocs processes roughly 750,000 mortgage closings a year, licensing its software and charging closing transaction fees. Lenders, titleholders and notaries can use Snapdocs' platform for a variety of functions, including managing documents, scheduling loan signings and communications.

The startup's AI functions can detect errors in paperwork, which often varies between states and lenders, F-Prime's Mr. Jegen said.

Snapdocs fits into F-Prime's broader interest in real-estate technology, Mr. Jegen said. There are opportunities for investors as more aspects of the real-estate sector move online, he said. In particular, he is interested in startups working on automated real-estate investing technology that allows for "buying homes like traders are buying stocks."

F-Prime's previous investments in the real-estate sector include home financing startup Real Estate Equity Exchange Inc., commonly known as Unison.

Good day. SoftBank Group's Vision Fund has learned lessons from the WeWork debacle, but plans little changes in its second fund, the firm's finance chief said in an exclusive interview with WSJ Pro.

One lesson learned from WeWork, Vision Fund CFO Navneet Govil said: "Things like founders having super veto rights or super voting rights is not something that necessarily makes sense," he said.

Meanwhile, the firm plans small changes in its second fund, such as limiting the amount of investment in each sector or company, and investing in a more diverse group of companies than the first fund, he added.

Despite the various problems at WeWork, morale at the Vision Fund is "great" and "remarkable," Mr. Govil said.

Much more in our story below.

Vision Fund CFO. SoftBank Group's Vision Fund will do little to change its investment strategy, the fund's finance chief said, despite losses and missteps with We Co., WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports exclusively.

* "Nothing's changed," said Navneet Govil, chief financial officer for SoftBank's Vision Fund, in an interview. SoftBank will continue to invest in technology companies that are on the cusp of going public.

* The Vision Fund is in the process of soliciting investors to commit to a second investment fund. Mr. Govil said SoftBank hasn't finalized outside commitments for the second Vision Fund.

* Limited partners wanted to "see how the WeWork situation unfolded" before making additional investments, he said. "Nothing's been locked in yet," Mr. Govil said. The company previously said it had pledges of more than $100 billion.

* The Vision Fund has drawn scrutiny for its check sizes and also for its investment strategy. Mr. Govil said his fund doesn't use large checks as a means to success. "There was never the belief that more money would make a company successful," he said.

* The Vision Fund reported nearly a $9 billion operating loss its first for its latest quarter on Wednesday. Overall, SoftBank reported a $6.4 billion net loss in the latest quarter, and took billions of dollars in write-downs of the value of it its investments in WeWork, Uber and about 20 other companies. "This is clearly a challenging and difficult quarter for us," Mr. Govil said.

* Still, the Vision Fund isn't changing how it values startups. "Our valuations are in line with accounting guidelines," he said, referring to international accounting rules that help companies determine asset values.

Animal organ donors. A pair of corporate venture arms are joining a $100 million bet on technology to enable animal organs to be transplanted into humans, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Fresenius Medical Care Ventures is leading an investment into eGenesis Inc., a startup seeking to use gene editing to clear technical hurdles to using animal organs in humans. Leaps by Bayer, the venture group of German life-sciences company Bayer, joined the financing.

Kalanick's new venture. Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund has pumped $400 million into Travis Kalanick's new company CloudKitchens, the Journal's Rory Jones and Rolfe Winkler report, citing people familiar with the situation. The deal could value the operator of so-called ghost kitchens at about $5 billion and reunites the former Uber chief with one of his biggest backers. Mr. Kalanick has kept many aspects of CloudKitchens a secret.

Mortgage startup. Real-estate technology startup Snapdocs Inc. has raised $25 million to further improve artificial intelligence on its mortgage processing platform, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. Numerous startups are attempting to introduce AI to streamline the mortgage and homebuying process, which is notorious for including heavy paperwork.

Health data. Behind Google's $2.1 billion deal for wearables maker Fitbit Inc. is the search giant's dream to become a major player in health data after a failed attempt to establish a foothold in it years ago, the Journal's Sarah E. Needleman and Rob Copeland report. Analysts say it's logical that Fitbit and others would find ways to make money from the data by partnering with health-care companies to monitor chronic conditions among users and developing new health-care services, among other methods.

Ballot box. A regulatory crackdown is on the way for Airbnb Inc. and other similar short-term rental companies in Jersey City, N.J., the Journal's Joseph De Avila reports. Voters in Jersey City overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure Tuesday by a margin of 69% to 31% to beef up rules for operating short-term rental properties in the city. It was a blow to Airbnb, which had spent more than $4 million opposing the measure, flooding the television airwaves with commercials and inundating residents with mailers.

Ikea and H&M bet big to weather online disruption

Ikea and Hennes & Mauritz have ploughed hundreds of millions of euros into venture capital investments in bets on technologies and products to help them weather the disruption in the retail sector.

The world's biggest furniture retailer and second-largest clothing store have been taking minority stakes in smaller companies, making venture capital investments in start-ups from fintech and recycling to sustainability and food.

Ingka Group, the Ikea retailer, has led the way, investing  200m in 21 companies in the past three years, including Ori Living, a robotic furniture maker, RetourMatras, a mattress recycler, and Livspace, an Indian interior designer.

H&M has spent more than SKr500m ($52m) on stakes in 16 businesses involved in developing more sustainable ways of making clothes, among them Colorifix, the dye group, and Klarna, Europe's largest private fintech.

Ikea and H&M are in the middle of one of their biggest turnrounds as they react to the increasing popularity of online shopping as the rise of ecommerce competitors such as Amazon and Alibaba that has led to widespread disruption and bankruptcies in retail.

Jesper Brodin, chief executive of Ingka, said Ingvar Kamprad, Ikea's founder, had saved a significant sum "for a rainy day". The retailer had invested much of that in bonds "in case we run into trouble" but had recently made a number of venture capital investments and acquisitions.

"Ingvar was always talking about the long-term needs and saving money for when you need it. Partly, we need it now as our business is transforming," he said. "We have made venture investments in interesting companies, particularly in sustainability and digital."

Karl-Johan Persson, H&M's chief executive, said his venture capital investments had been a "good financial journey but for us the most important thing is they are [businesses] we believe that can really help the company".

H&M had invested a lot in "sustainable material innovations" such as Renewcell, a Swedish start-up that produces clothes from recycled textiles. Mr Persson said: "It will not change us now, but in the future I think it will do a great amount of good for the world, and hopefully also for the company. I believe many of the conventional materials today will be replaced by these sustainable materials with quality and prices that are as good or better."

H&M has also invested in companies developing new business models such as Thread, a menswear fashion start-up that uses artificial intelligence and personal stylists to offer tailored recommendations to shoppers, and Sellpy, an ecommerce platform for second-hand clothes.

Ingka has gone beyond mere venture investments by making its first acquisitions, snapping up TaskRabbit, the oddjobs service, and Traemand, the kitchen installer, in the past three years. The flat-pack furniture retailer expected to make four to five venture capital investments a year as well as the occasional outright acquisition.

"In many aspects, we are also learning from the collaborations to help us ... as we transform our business to be even more accessible, convenient, and sustainable," it added.

Repo ructions call attention to failure of post-crisis policy

Afailure of post-crisis financial policy was laid bare when the US repo market buckled in September. Many have debated why the market went wrong so fast.

The US Federal Reserve was so spooked, it didn't wait for answers before stepping in.

Its gross cumulative support for the market which allows banks and investors to borrow cash in exchange for Treasuries and other high-quality collateral will top $11.5tn by the end of January. The Fed didn't just stabilise the repo market; now, it is the repo market.

Repos were once the liquidity-providing plumbing of the system. Now they have taken on another role: post-crisis rules demand that financial institutions hold far bigger balances of safe assets at a time when yields on such assets are low or negative. The only way to comply while eking out a profit is to squeeze each dime out of safe-asset holdings through repo market financing. Borrowers use high-speed funding flows from repo transactions to boost profitability through derivatives trading and other higher-return activities.

This transformation in repos was presaged by the equity market. The Fed's bond-buying and rate-cutting programme initially supported the macroeconomic recovery. But extension of quantitative easing changed its nature from an output-boosting policy to an equity-market stimulus. Yield-chasing became a market imperative, creating strong incentives for participants that hold safe assets such as Treasuries to boost returns by leveraging their positions through the repo market. None of the rules demanding large safe-asset holdings is necessarily wrong, but each has consequences that the Fed failed to anticipate. At the same time that the demand for repos grew, banks' capacity to meet the demand ebbed. Tougher post-crisis requirements made big banks safer but no bank is willing to enter the repo market if that jeopardises compliance with intraday liquidity standards or the broader rule book.

Exposing the repo risks in such dramatic fashion would ordinarily lead participants to run for cover. Instead, the market is so vibrant, the Fed has had continuously to increase sums with which it backs overnight and even longer-term deals. The explanation for this insouciance? De facto nationalisation.

Desperate to keep short-term rates in its desired range, the Fed chose not to use its backstop the discount window, where it provides higher-cost loans to banks backed by eligible collateral or other emergency-liquidity powers. Using these transparent fallbacks would have allowed the repo rate to settle in an orderly and perhaps smaller marketplace. Instead, the Fed opened its vault. What should have been a learning experience is a powerful incentive for moral hazard. Speculative bets can be made with the understanding that taxpayers, through the central bank, will bail out bad calls. The old guarantee of the Greenspan put stabilising equity prices is buttressed by a Powell promise: fear not, in the dollar-based global funding market, the Fed is there for you. The central bank was once supposed to be lender of last resort, backing banks which had no other way of funding. The safety net was designed so that banks could take households' deposits and turn them into savings that enabled wealth accumulation and loans to back growth. But after 2008, the Fed became market-maker of last resort, lowering rates whenever equities trembled. Now it is market lender of last resort, too.

To be sure, its current repo backstop puts the Fed in a supporting role it steps in only after primary lenders step back. The market could run without the Fed, but it doesn't because lenders love having this backstop and the central bank is always there to provide it.

The Fed also offers reverse repos, a longstanding operation designed to keep market interest rates in the central bank's target range, no matter the risks participants take. The central bank is considering making its repo operations permanent through a standing facility. In for a penny, in for a pound, and if you are a central bank, in forever.

But with central banks providing a backstop for both equity and funding markets, what's next? Some governors have decided they must add digital currencies to their payment systems, not just to protect the globe from Facebook's Libra but as a tool that might better transmit monetary policy. It could curtail lending, but some central banks have the cure: they would lend too, at least for projects such as sustainable energy that suit policymakers' idea of what constitutes useful economic activity. The market's trains would run on time. But central bankers not market forces would dictate who got on and who was pushed off.

Nielsen to Spin Off Global Connect Business; Market- analytics  segment has been a weak spot for company, hampered by changing retail environment

Nielsen Holdings PLC said it plans to spin off its market-analytics business that measures retail and consumer behavior following a strategic review as it faces rapidly changing consumer habits.

Following the transaction, Nielsen shareholders would own shares of both Nielsen, which would hold the company's global media business, and the new entity holding the Global Connect business, the company said.

Nielsen, which measures how people shop and consume media such as radio and TV, said the spinoff would allow for more flexibility in investment and the adoption of capital structures aligned with growth plans.

Nielsen Chief Executive Officer David Kenny said the split would also help each resulting company better cater to its clients. "They're both going to move faster," he said. "The direction is clear on each side."

Last year, activist investor Elliott Management Corp. took a stake in Nielsen and pushed the TV-ratings company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-elliott-management-to-push-nielsen-holdings-to-sell-1534131900".

Elliott said in a news release Thursday that Nielsen has significantly improved its performance over the past year and that it supports the separation.

"By separating into two independent companies, Nielsen is better able to position both its media and retail measurement franchises for long-term success with differential investment, profitability, capital return and strategic frameworks," said Jesse Cohn, an Elliott partner.

According to FactSet, Elliott owns 3.94% of Nielsen's shares outstanding.

Shares of Nielsen were down about 3.5% in afternoon trading.

The Global Connect segment has been a weak spot for the company, hampered by the changing retail environment and challenges that consumer-product companies face from new consumer tastes and shopping habits.

Mr. Cohn said the separation could unlock value for the company's media business "as a faster-growing, more profitable and market-leading franchise, allowing it to garner an appropriate valuation multiple reflective of its significant value."

As part of the spinoff, the Global Connect business is expected to raise debt that would go toward reducing debt at Nielsen, the company said.

With the separation, Nielsen said it is reducing its cash dividend payment to six cents a share from 35 cents a share.

The New York-based company said it expects the deal to close in nine to 12 months.

CISOs Search for Startup Gold in Mountain of Cybersecurity Pitches; Talent shortage, startups' AI prowess mean executives feel compelled to sort through vendor offers

LISBON Chief information security officers are inundated by pitches from small cybersecurity companies, but they increasingly find they can't ignore them because they need the niche services that high-quality startups offer.

"There literally is not enough time in the day to respond let alone evaluate every single technology company," said Shardul Shah, partner at venture-capital firm Index Ventures, speaking on the sidelines of the Web Summit technology conference.

Still, "A lot of CISOs at major organizations feel they have to look at earlier-stage companies more now than five years ago," Dennis Smith, partner and founder of venture-capital firm Evolution Equity Partners, said at the same conference. The trend is driven by a shortage of in-house cybersecurity experts and startups' use of artificial intelligence to address specific problems, he said.

When considering pitches from startups, corporate cybersecurity professionals should ask for details about security practices, including how long it takes the company to patch security problems after receiving alerts from software and hardware providers, Mr. Smith said.

France-based power-equipment supplier Schneider Electric SE tests technologies from security startups for one to two years before deciding whether to deploy them, Chief Innovation Officer Emmanuel Lagarrigue said.

The company works with many cybersecurity startups to solve complex security issues in internet-connected industrial devices, he said: "One startup will solve one type of problem, but you don't find a startup that will solve all the problems you need to solve in the Internet of Things."

Cybersecurity startups seeking to stand out in a sea of vendor pitches might have an advantage if they received funding from In-Q-Tel Inc., the venture-capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Rashmi Gopinath, managing director at M12, Microsoft Corp.'s venture-capital fund. In-Q-Tel vets cybersecurity startups that provide services to federal agencies, which might help to convince companies that their technology is trustworthy, she said.

Referrals go a long way for corporate CISOs considering products from a startup, Mr. Shah said. They might come from cybersecurity executives at other companies, investors or employees within a CISO's team, he said.

Mr. Lagarrigue said Schneider Electric often receives referrals about cybersecurity startups through industry forums and associations. Some of his staff speak to counterparts at competing companies about startups, he added.

Startups can boost their credibility with potential enterprise customers if they proactively offer information about the types of sensitive data they have access to and how they protect it, Ms. Gopinath said.

"It's always really valuable for a startup to &be upfront about what they're doing to ensure data security and to ensure they're not at risk of being breached or hacked," Ms. Gopinath said.

Companies processing health-related data in the U.S., for example, should provide certification that they comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, Ms. Gopinath said. If startups handle personal data in the European Union, she said, they should tell potential customers which tools they use to comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.

Cybersecurity experts should ask startups whether they depend on cloud providers to secure data, Mr. Smith said. If startups don't have a strategy for how they provide additional security, that is a red flag, he said. Under the EU data-protection law, any company that holds EU residents' personal information is responsible for protecting it.

FICO Rolls Out AI Tools for Digital Authentication; Software is aimed at helping banks authenticate new and existing customers

Fair Isaac Corp., creator of the widely used FICO credit score, on Wednesday is set to unveil two artificial-intelligence tools designed to help banks authenticate customers and reduce fraud.

FICO is known for selling credit scores that help financial firms make lending decisions, but two-thirds of its revenue comes from selling software for business functions, including fraud detection. The new offerings are powered by technology from EZMCOM Inc., a company that FICO acquired for an undisclosed amount in August but didn't announce until Wednesday.

One of the new tools lets banks authenticate new customers, while the other is for existing customers. Over time, FICO plans to market the tools to retailers and telecommunications companies.

Many businesses already use multifactor authentication as an extra layer of security on top of a username and password. Users are prompted to enter an additional piece of information, such as a code sent to their phones, to gain access to an account. While the method is effective, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/multifactor-authentication-can-stop-hacks-but-also-annoy-employees-11568799001". Only 30% of people use multifactor authentication to log into accounts, according to a poll of 1,223 adults in the U.S. "https://www.chubb.com/us-en/individuals-families/agent-marketing/online-you-protected/pdf/Chubb_Cyber_Survey.pdf" by Chubb Ltd.

The need for authentication that is "frictionless" is growing, said Liz Lasher, vice president of fraud and financial crimes at FICO.

"Right now it's an everything-mobile world," Ms. Lasher said. "So when you think about the need to digitally onboard customers seamlessly without any face-to-face verification, there's an element of being able to prove, secure and establish a digital identity. And this technology allows us to do that."

The first tool, FICO Identity Proofing, is meant to make it easier to authenticate new customers. The bank asks a customer to take a picture of his or her government ID as well as a selfie. The software scans the ID to make sure the hologram and data formatting is consistent with other IDs for that jurisdiction. It uses facial-recognition technology to compare what is known as a facial-point map between the selfie and the ID. That allows the technology to work even if a person's appearance changes, such as through weight gain or a hairstyle change.

Banks can use the second tool, the FICO Authentication Suite, to verify customers' identities during certain activities, such as logging into a banking app or transferring a large sum of money. On top of the usual multifactor authentication, the tool can add extra layers of security: biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or voice recognition, and behavioral authentication.

That latter component can track behavior patterns such as how fast a person types or the mobile device and language setting used for logging in. Machine-learning algorithms recognize patterns over time and, if the system suspects something awry, the software can prompt additional verification.

Clients can customize which FICO Authentication Suite features to use and how to use them, Ms. Lasher said, including whether to store facial-recognition data locally on the device or on a remote server.

FICO executives said EZMCOM has about 40 clients, mostly banks outside the U.S., serving about 60 million customers. Pricing for the new products will depend on usage and whether the purchase is bundled with other FICO tools, the company said.

Authentication software is a multibillion-dollar market, with players including Microsoft Corp., Okta Inc., Symantec Corp., and HID Global Corp., said David Mahdi, a senior research director at Gartner Inc. But FICO might have an edge with financial institutions given its relationships in that sector, he added: "You could very well see financial institutions say,  Well, we already do a lot of business with [FICO]. Why are we using these other narrowly focused vendors?'"

Industry News

As the bull market enters its 11th year, state and local pension plans are piling on risk, as they try to make up shortfalls, according to the Journal. Public plans had a median 47.3% of their assets in U.S. equities at the end of the third quarter, according to database Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service. That is more than they have had since 2007 and up from 44.1% a year earlier.

Hamilton Lane Inc.'s earnings fell 9% in its fiscal second quarter, which ended Sept. 30, as incentive fees dropped 38% in the period to $9 million from $15 million a year earlier. The Bala Cynwyd, Pa.-based firm said adjusted net income fell to about $26.6 million, or 50 cents a share, from roughly $29.2 million, or 55 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Hamilton Lane shares fell as much as 7.3% in New York trading after the firm posted its results. Assets under management rose 13% to $66 billion compared with a year earlier, while management and advisory fee revenue climbed 11% to $59 million and fee-related earnings advanced 14% to $49 million. Hamilton Lane said total revenue rose 15% to about $64.3 million. Net income climbed 14% to 56 cents a share, the firm added.

Global private-equity firm EQT AB said fund exits plunged in the third quarter, with just  800 million ($885.6 million) in realizations, mainly from its real assets segment. During the first half, exits by EQT funds totaled about  4.8 billion by comparison. The firm also said that preparations for raising commitments for EQT IX are "intensifying" with formal fundraising expected to begin early next year. It said that EQT VIII was between 65% and 70% invested, and noted that fundraising for successor vehicles normally begins when the predecessor fund is 80% to 90% deployed. The firm said its assets under management were little changed at  40.5 billion at the end of September, compared with  40.1 billion at the end of June.

Carlyle Group LP co-founder and Co-Executive Chairman David Rubenstein said if he were starting a new private-equity firm today, he'd most likely locate it in Singapore, not Washington, where Carlyle is based, according to Japan's Nikkei news service. Mr. Rubenstein said Asia is outstripping the U.S. and Europe in terms of growth rates, according to Nikkei. "If I were starting all over again, I'd probably be based in Singapore, because, you know, the greatest growth in the world is going to be in Asia," he said at the Greenwich (Conn.) Economic Forum on Tuesday, Nikkei reported.

Bruin Sports Capital, an investment firm and global holding company founded in 2015 by George Pyne, said it has formed a partnership with private-equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Jordan Co.

Coveo Solutions Inc., an enterprise and data analytics software startup, raised $227 million in new funding to expand its ability to use customer data in industries such as online retailing.

Coveo is aiming to grow its personalization and recommendations platform, which, among other things, uses artificial intelligence to cater search functions to specific customers, Coveo Chief Executive Louis Tetu said.

The startup sells subscriptions to its software, which companies can use to analyze data about their customers to boost sales.

OMERS Growth Equity, part of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, led the equity round, which represents a 15.5% stake in Coveo at a valuation of $1.46 billion, according to a company statement. Mark Shulgan, managing director and head of growth equity, will join Coveo's board, according to the statement.

Coveo's primary customers are banks, technology companies and manufacturers and include Tesla Inc. and Visa Inc., Mr. Tetu said, adding that subscriptions account for roughly 90% of the company's revenue, with a smaller amount coming from licensing agreements and other minor revenue streams.

The funding is the third major funding round for the Quebec City-based company since it was founded in 2005, Mr. Tetu said. Coveo has raised roughly $332 million in total.

Mr. Tetu said that the company isn't looking to list on public markets or get acquired. "We're not in this to exit, we're in this to build," Mr. Tetu added.

Evergreen Coast Capital, IQventures and other investors also participated in the deal.

AI startups have drawn significant investor interest this year. They raised $4.3 billion of venture capital in the third quarter over 140 deals, up from $2.8 billion over 125 deals in the same period a year earlier, according to a PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree report.

Good day. The venture industry has focused on enterprise software startups this year, with numerous big exits and large funding rounds. The latest is data analytics startup Coveo Solutions Inc., which raised $227 million at a $1.46 billion valuation.

Meanwhile, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said he showed "really bad" judgment while investing in WeWork.

In health care, AstraZeneca plans to raise up to $1 billion to invest in Chinese health-care startups, and CODA Biotherapeutics Inc. has raised more funding to make gene therapy applicable to a broader group of patients.

Plus, Jim Lanzone, head of CBS Corp.'s Interactive unit, is leaving to join Benchmark Capital as an executive in residence.

And now on to the news...

Landscape is shifting for Hong Kong's property tycoons

INSIDE BUSINESS ASIA

O ne reason Hong Kong protesters have turned their focus so quickly from a controversial extradition law to income inequality is simmering anger at the cost of housing in the world's least affordable market by far. A target of their resentment is the territory's property tycoons, who with the help of a pliant local government have for years kept housing supply far lower than demand, amassing land holdings but developing them at a rate that ensured rising prices.

That formula is now at risk, with even Beijing starting to criticise the most prominent developers. But while neighbouring Shenzhen gives rise to some of the world's most innovative companies, helping its economy eclipse that of the former British colony, few Hong Kong businesses are trying to adapt to tomorrow's world.

Even Beijing is starting to criticise the In seminars on the "Greater Bay Area", the megaproject to create a vast business and innovation hub by linking southern Chinese cities with a combined population of 70m, it has little more to offer than its capability in providing buildings for incubators although there are not many Hong Kong start-ups to occupy them.

most prominent developers An exception is Nan Fung, which is putting its success on the line by forging an entirely new path for itself.

Property was not always the only route to prosperity in the city. When millions of immigrants arrived in the wake of the 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese civil war, the wealthiest of the new residents were industrialists from the eastern cities of Shanghai and Ningbo. These manufacturers transformed the colony's economy, building the city's fortunes along with their own. Among them was Chen Din Hwa who fled to Hong Kong in 1949, established a series of textile mills and, five years later, founded Nan Fung.

The textile mills were shuttered just over a decade ago, long after they became uneconomic, in part because Mr Chen was reluctant to move his operations to the mainland as costs rose in his adopted home. Some of the buildings that housed the operations have been turned into a museum and a centre to encourage technological innovation in fashion. And the company is now known primarily as a property group.

Nan Fung is one of a group of developers that has been marginalised over time as the biggest including Cheung Kong, Henderson Land, New World Development and Sun Hung Kai became ever more dominant.

Now the third generation of the family is trying to change the group's identity for the third time by using its capital to buy into the entirely new field of life sciences.

property group. Nan Fung is buying into the entirely new field "We started thinking about what should be next," says Vincent Cheung, the Nan Fung managing director and chief operating officer who is spearheading the shift. It initially spent $1.5bn acquiring expertise, first investing in funds five years ago and then establishing its own venture capital funds in 2017.

of life sciences Nan Fung has invested in 45 companies and 27 funds to date, as well as its own funds operating out of Shanghai and San Francisco.

The dramatic switch in focus came after the family decided to bring in an outsider as chairman, hiring Antony Leung, whose career has included stints as a banker, finance secretary in the Hong Kong government and, most recently, chairman of Blackstone's China operations.

It was Mr Leung who recommended that Nan Fung change course. "China was an entirely clean slate," Mr Cheung says. "But AI and big data give China a competitive advantage."

Nan Fung increasingly resembles US private equity firms such as Bain Capital whose founders embrace philanthropy, writing huge cheques to life sciences, but also invest through their family offices and make biotech part of their core buyout businesses. It helps that the DH Chen foundation, Nan Fung's largest shareholder, is not listed.

"Especially in young volatile markets like China, you need long-term, patient capital," says Peter Bisgaard, who is in charge of the business's US portfolio. "If the market dips you need ample reserves."

Eight of Nan Fung's portfolio companies have already gone public, he adds. Whether biotech will be as profitable as property remains to be seen but at least Nan Fung is now focusing on a public good.

Business & Technology: AstraZeneca to Raise $1 Billion To Invest in Chinese Startups

By Preetika Rana

HONG KONG -- AstraZeneca PLC plans to raise up to $1 billion for a new fund that would invest in Chinese health-care startups, making it the latest drug giant to place a bet on the world's second-largest pharmaceuticals market.

The fund -- a joint venture between AstraZeneca and a Chinese investment bank -- has drawn interest from investors such as Sequoia Capital, the drugmaker's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in an interview. The fund plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million this year, and as much as $1 billion over four years.

A Sequoia spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Soriot said AstraZeneca is separately building a new research center and an artificial-intelligence lab, both in Shanghai, to develop drugs for diseases that are more widespread in China. Johnson & Johnson and Novartis AG have opened similar Shanghai-based centers in recent years.

"I think that every multinational I know" is eyeing China, Mr. Soriot said. U.S. drugmaker Amgen Inc. last week said it would pay $2.7 billion in cash for a 20% stake in Beijing-based BeiGene Ltd.

For years, foreign drugmakers were locked out of selling their most lucrative drugs in China. But a host of new policy measures there has opened the door for the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies. China is approving nongeneric drugs at a record pace, particularly those to treat cancer, while slashing import duties and placing some drugs on a national reimbursement list.

China revenue has exploded at foreign drug companies. In the first quarter of 2019, AstraZeneca for the first time earned more revenue there than in Europe, making China its second-largest market after the U.S., according to Mr. Soriot. Merck & Co. last week reported that third-quarter China sales grew by 90%.

Beijing has spent the past decade encouraging homegrown innovation. It set up a state-run program that lured back many Western-trained Chinese scientists, poured billions of dollars into technology parks dedicated to biotech startups and granted conditional approvals to promising local drugs.

Chinese biotechs focusing on innovative products have flourished under those policies, attracting investors at home and abroad. Private-equity and venture-capital funds last year poured more than $17 billion into China's life sciences sector, up from $1 billion in 2013, according to Shanghai-based consultancy ChinaBio.

Flush with cash, Chinese biotechs are increasingly recruiting U.S. talent and setting up offices from Greater Boston to Silicon Valley. The first innovative Chinese drug -- a BeiGene cancer treatment -- could be approved in the U.S. as early as next year.

Mr. Soriot said he wants AstraZeneca to be part of China's growth. The life-sciences fund -- a first for the company -- will invest in areas ranging from traditional drug development to artificial intelligence in China.

AstraZeneca also is interested in partnerships with companies the fund invests in, Mr. Soriot said. Eli Lilly & Co., Merck and J&J have struck multimillion-dollar deals to license experimental Chinese drugs in recent years.

Indianapolis-based Lilly carved out a venture-capital fund focused on investing in Asia in 2008. The majority of the fund's investments are in China, according to a Lilly Asia Ventures partner.

China has been a bright spot for AstraZeneca, which returned to growth last year for the first time since 2014. While its overall sales rose 18% in the third quarter from a year earlier, its sales in China grew 40%.

Mr. Soriot expects AstraZeneca's China sales growth to soften in the fourth quarter, as hospitals switch to Chinese copies of old multinational drugs. Beijing has been raising standards for domestic drugmakers, closing the gap in quality with multinationals. Earlier this year, the government rolled out a policy aimed at getting large public hospitals to switch to Chinese generics over multinational drugs.

Still, Mr. Soriot says he expects China to remain the company's second-largest market. "What the China team is wondering is, when can they be No. 1?" he said.

IBM, Bank of America Team Up on Public Cloud Aimed at Banks; Service is designed to meet the sector's regulatory and compliance requirements

Bank of America Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. have teamed up to develop a public-cloud computing service for banks, which have been reluctant to store customers' financial data outside their in-house systems.

The tool, unveiled Wednesday, features measures designed to meet the banking sector's regulatory and compliance requirements, IBM and Bank of America officials said. They include automated security tools and top-level encryption a process of preventing unauthorized access by converting data into code.

"Even people at IBM with deep access to the cloud will not have access to the key" to unlock a bank's encrypted data, said Arvind Krishna, IBM's senior vice president for the cloud.

The two companies have been working on the project for more than a year.

With a public cloud, businesses rent computer capacity from third-party providers including IBM, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and others. Unlike a company's own private cloud, a public cloud is shared by other businesses. Mr. Krishna says he hopes the move catches the attention of other banks in the months ahead.

An important benefit of public-cloud computing is cutting the cost of running on-premise data centers and servers, Mr. Krishna said. A public cloud also offers more storage and the flexibility to access a wider range of applications and emerging technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.

He said AI could enable banks to speed up lending decisions, such as mortgage applications, by quickly parsing a range of applicants' financial data.

Most banks have been hesitant to shift payments and other back-end systems to public-cloud services, in part due to concerns over security and data privacy.

That is giving less-regulated financial-technology upstarts an edge over banks in online payments, digital lending and investing, and other fast-growing markets.

Venmo, a digital money-transfer service operated by PayPal Holdings Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-has-40-million-users-outnumbering-most-big-banks-11556142906" for the first three months of 2019. Over the same period, Bank of America reported 37 million active digital users, while Wells Fargo & Co. counted 29.8 million. Among large U.S. banks, only JPMorgan Chase & Co. surpassed Venmo, reporting 51 million digital users for the first quarter.

Bank of America said the move to a public cloud is part of a plan launched in 2012 aimed at paring down the use of its own data centers and servers.

As of October, the bank is running 80% of its IT workloads in its private cloud, cutting the number of on-premise servers to 70,000 from 200,000 seven years ago. It operates 23 data centers, down from 60 in 2012. The bank said it now spends $2.1 billion less per year on infrastructure than it did in 2012. It now plans to gradually shift many of these workloads into the public cloud.

Cathy Bessant, the bank's chief operations and technology officer, said the move to IBM's public-cloud service is "one of the most important collaborations in the financial services industry cloud space," according to a statement.

General Atlantic Leads $165 Million Riskified Funding Round; Riskified helps merchants prevent fraud and verify customer identities with software developed using machine learning  and artificial intelligence

Private-equity firm General Atlantic led a $165 million funding round for Riskified Ltd., giving the Israeli data-security company a valuation of more than $1 billion.

The fresh capital will be used for product development and expansion into new markets, Riskified said on Tuesday. The company's software helps merchants secure their payment systems and guard against fraud in online commerce while improving customer experience and minimizing sales lost to payment failures.

Growth-equity investor Winslow Capital Management and mutual fund giant Fidelity Management & Research Co. also participated in the deal. In addition to the new investors, firms that previously backed Riskified also contributed to the Series E funding round, including Qumra Capital, Pitango Venture Capital and Entre Capital, a spokeswoman said.

Riskified, founded in Tel Aviv in 2013, has developed its products using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms based on analysis of millions of e-commerce transactions. The company says its products help prevent payment failures and make customer verification easier and less annoying to shoppers, while also helping weed out phony buyers.

While e-commerce fraud is expected to cost retailers $6.4 billion annually by 2021, false declines, where valid transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent, are projected to cost retailers $443 billion in lost sales each year, according to recent research from Aite Group and Miami-based ClearSale LLC.

Fraudulent transactions cost online retailers $2.94 for each $1 in such sales, according to a LexisNexis study released last year. The study cited surging incidents involving fraud tied to alternative transaction methods and increased "botnet activity." Costs are even higher for digital products sold online, the study said.

As a percentage of revenue, fraud accounted for almost 2.4% of 2018 e-commerce sales, LexisNexis said, up from about 2.2% in 2017. For retailers, fraud accounted for 1.8% of overall sales last year, up from nearly 1.6% the year before.

The study also said a major source of transaction friction came from verifying customer identities, calling it a challenge for online retailers that sell digital goods such as media, games and digital images. Newer payment methods add to the difficulties, it said.

The potential $2bn listing of Hyundai's credit card unit looks set to slip towards 2021 as the South Korean group tries to boost its value via expansion into south-east Asia and the launch of a new artificial intelligence system.

Last month, Hyundai Card, majority owned by Hyundai group companies, invited brokerages to pitch for roles in a possible IPO, spurred by a group of international investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. However, Ted Chung, chief executive of the credit card business and Hyundai Capital, the carmaker's automotive finance unit, told the Financial Times that his preference would be for the listing to be deferred until 2021 to reach a "more favourable IPO price".

Mr Chung would not be drawn on pricing other than to say the valuation "may be more" than the $2.1bn reported in October. "We will be IPOready before the end of 2020. However, it doesn't mean that we will do it before the end of 2020," he said.

Under Mr Chung the company has increased its share of the country's credit card market from 1.7 per cent to 14.3 per cent. But it has struggled at home and its operating profit last year shrank 22 per cent to Won202bn ($174m). As a result, Hyundai Card is seeking to expand offshore. Last week it sealed a deal to buy half of Vietnam's retail bank Finance Company Limited For Community for $41.9m. It is in talks about a venture in Thailand, and plans to push into Indonesia and Malaysia.

However, Mr Chung believes a bigger gain will come from the launch next year of a new AI-based "engine", developed in-house for $300m. From 2020, Hyundai will "drop the concept of market segmentation" and tailor offers for each customer using thousands of data points processed by the system, he said.

Major U.S. Clearinghouse Names New Chief Information Officer; Lynn Bishop, previously DTCC's chief development officer, succeeds Robert Garrison

Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., one of the largest clearinghouses in the U.S., has named a new chief information officer as it works to modernize systems critical to the clearing and settlement of securities transactions.

Lynn Bishop, previously DTCC's chief development officer, took on the CIO role last week. She reports to Chief Executive Michael Bodson and manages a staff of 3,500.

Ms. Bishop, who joined the New York-based company in 2004, succeeds Robert Garrison, who has assumed the role of managing director of technology until he retires in February.

The new CIO said her priorities will include upgrading underlying systems to ensure that post-trade market infrastructure is functioning smoothly.

"We continue to explore how technologies like distributed ledger technology, robotics, cloud and machine learning, along with enhanced processes, can enable us to deliver increased stability and resiliency to protect the marketplace and investors," she told CIO Journal in an email.

The company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-backs-blockchain-for-savings-on-derivatives-1483979438" the use of distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchain, for its Trade Information Warehouse to increase efficiency of derivative trades and lower costs and risks for banks and other users of the system. DTCC is moving the system from a mainframe to a cloud-based distributed ledger network.

DTCC "http://www.dtcc.com/dtcc-connection/articles/2018/july/26/dtccs-journey-of-cloud-enlightenment" some operations and analytics to cloud services including Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services, highlighting a shift from a mainframe-oriented technology culture.

DTCC facilitates the exchange of securities such as equities and bonds. The company said that last year, it processed securities transactions valued at about $1.85 quadrillion. It also provides data and analytics services.

The CIO role at DTCC is important in maintaining the stability of the company's technology infrastructure, which is critical to the U.S. financial markets, said Larry Tabb, founder and research chairman of Tabb Group, a New York-based capital-markets research and advisory company.

For a company like DTCC, new initiatives typically require a lot of testing before being turned on, Mr. Tabb said. "It's the exact opposite" of Silicon Valley's mantra to move fast and break things, he added.

Another key initiative for Ms. Bishop is the creation of developer marketplaces for employees and clients.

The internal marketplace will provide a one-stop shop for DTCC developers to access reusable assets, applications, shared services and other content for their projects.

The external marketplace will give clients, such as dealers and brokers, access to a single, simplified portal to the company's data and services.

"It's taking the digital platform model of Netflix or Amazon and applying it to the processing of financial transactions," Ms. Bishop said.

As part of its technology-modernization effort, DTCC is building a strategy for application programming interfaces, or APIs, pieces of software that enable apps, platforms and systems to connect with each other and share data.

AI Helps Lender Pinpoint Fraudulent Applications; Company focused on customers with bad or no credit uses technology from TransUnion to flag suspicious transactions

Finance company Acima Credit LLC is using artificial-intelligence software from credit-ratings firm TransUnion to identify fraudulent applications, partly based on the device used.

The Salt Lake City-based lender extends financing to consumers with bad, little or no credit, allowing them to rent items such as furniture or appliances. Acima pays for the item, then leases it to the customer with an option to buy.

The company handles about 150,000 applications a month. Many of these are submitted at stores, while some relate to e-commerce purchases.

Before deploying the antifraud system, the company had few tools for catching fraudulent online applications early in the underwriting process, said Robert Christiansen, Acima's president and chief information officer.

The company typically offers financing ranging from $300 to $5,000 over 12-month terms, but a bad actor with multiple fabricated identities can cause significant damage. "So we're talking about relatively low [amounts] on our end, but with a high degree of velocity, we can experience pretty substantial losses quickly," Mr. Christiansen said.

Synthetic identity theft is one of the fastest-growing forms of fraud and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-id-theft-thousands-of-credit-applicants-who-dont-exist-1520350404". Fraudsters combine fake names with Social Security numbers that haven't been assigned yet or those tied to children who have no credit history to obtain credit cards or loans and build credit. Because the person borrowing the money isn't real, there are no consumer victims to alert lenders.

A TransUnion study last month found that U.S. synthetic-ID fraud totaled roughly $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2019, up slightly from a year earlier.

Julie Conroy, a research director at consulting firm Aite Group LLC, said some lenders don't have a sense of how big the problem is, because it is tough to distinguish between legitimate loan losses and those associated with fake identities. "So they spend valuable collector time hunting down someone who doesn't exist," she said.

To combat the fraudsters, Acima in 2017 started using antifraud technology from iovation Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transunion-to-acquire-anti-fraud-startup-iovation-1526680132" last year for an undisclosed sum and embedded its technology into a platform now dubbed IDVision with iovation.

Businesses including financial firms use the platform to evaluate online transactions, such as credit or loan applications. The technology identifies the device behind the transaction without needing to know any personal information about the user, tapping machine-learning algorithms trained to analyze hundreds of attributes related to the hardware, software or network being used. It also uses algorithms to create risks scores for devices, based partly on whether that device has been previously used to commit fraud or whether its user has engaged in suspicious activity, such as accessing multiple accounts in a short period.

Iovation said it tracks approximately 6 billion devices globally, and its platform is connected to a consortium of more than 35,000 businesses that submit reports when they encounter bad actors.

Mr. Christiansen said some consumers who borrow from Acima don't have credit histories, so the company wanted a way to point out perpetrators, including those using fictitious identities.

"When we launched our e-commerce platform we knew that we had to go beyond the face-to-face applications that we had in place," he said, "and have something that offers more visibility into the device."

Earlier this year, he said, the tool was able to help his team spot someone based in Arkansas who attempted to lease items, mostly laptop computers. He said that person had sent in about 100 applications using multiple fake identities and tried to make it seem as if the applications were coming from other states. The company hasn't taken steps to identify the fraudster, but it has denied that person's applications, he said.

"We know based on iovation that the applications he's sending in are originating from his [internet service provider] in this particular city," Mr. Christiansen said. "But we see [the device] within minutes jumping all the way across the country. So we'll see absolutely different applications appearing, but his device remains the same."

Overall, Mr. Christiansen said, the software is flagging about 10% of the roughly 70,000 applications that are screened monthly by iovation's technology. For those transactions that are flagged, Acima might ask additional verification questions, he added.

Hybrid funds smooth path between active and passive strategies

Non-transparent products will let equity managers keep their strategies hidden from rivals, writes Andrew Whiffin

The rise of passive allocation reached a milestone at the end of August as assets by value in US indexed funds passed those in actively managed funds for the first time.

Smart beta funds have played a pivotal role in that shift. The hybrid creations fill a space between traditional active management and broad index investing. Cost-conscious investors can choose between a huge variety of these strategies but a slowdown in fund launches last year hints that the market is becoming saturated.

Employing insights from active management, smart beta funds use rules-based methodologies alongside value, momentum, low volatility and quality. Investors increasingly seek out the latter criterion as concern grows over the economic outlook.

"Since the start of the year, there has been a strong preference for defensive and risk-mitigating factors," says Manuela Sperandeo, managing director at iShares, BlackRock's exchange traded fund provider.

New systematic strategies typically include characteristics targeted at outperformance. IShares' Edge range of ETFs screens stocks using four factors in the index-creation process. 'Advancements in data allow a very granular picture of companies' and the ability to get deeper insights for index creation," says Ms Sperandeo. As with traditional indices, reweighting typically takes place at quarterly or semi-annual intervals, whichhelpskeepcostslow.

The slowdown in fund launches in 2018 was accompanied by a pause in "Thegrowth of US assets under management to slightly less than $900bn says Morningstar, the data provider.

New US and European fund launches slowed to 103, down from 184 in 2017. The trend looks to have continued in 2019, with only 54 funds launched to date. A shift into value and dividend funds this year has, however, helped to push smart beta assetsover the $1tnmark.

Active managers are also fighting to stem the flow of funds to lower-cost alternatives.

The approval by US regulators of the first "non-transparent" ETF is raising hopes that traditional active managers will be able to compete on a less uneven playing field. The design of the ActiveShares ETF by Precidian Investments allows for portfolio holdings to remain undisclosed for up to 90 days, the same as disclosure times for mutual funds combined with the lower costs of an ETF.

"One factor cited for holding back active equity managers from taking advantage of these structures is that they are worried about revealing their picks to the rest of the investment community," says Grant Engelbart, director of research at CLS Investment which oversees over $9bn of assets .

A major advantage ETFs have over mutual funds is lower tax liabilities. "ETFs have always been a more taxefficient way to package an investment strategy. Unlike traditional mutual funds structures, they can avoid capital gains taxes as the sale of instruments takes place outside the funditself," says Mr Engelbart.

The new ETF structure could present unique challenges for those who run markets. "Detailed knowledge of holdings will not be fully known to participants like market makers who would hold large amounts of such an ETF's shares. That makes risk management more difficult, and if non-transparent ETFs do become a 'go to' for active strategies, we could see wider spreads quoted to take account of this," adds Mr Engelbart.

The new ETF structure is expected to add pressure to smart beta fund flows but is likely to cannibalise flows into existing mutual funds too. Not everyone is convinced of the need.

"The hype around so-called nontransparent ETFs has been a little overblown. There is little sign that retail investors are calling for these products, although some portfolio managers are," says Kip Meadows, chief executive of US-based fund administrator Nottingham.

Other managers betting on a shift of active strategies into ETF wrappers include Eaton Vance and T Rowe Price. Both await approval from the US Securities and Exchanges Commission for their non-transparent ETF structures.

Traditional active managers are not the only ones hoping to capture a portion of the funds going into lowercost products. Advances in big data and artificial intelligence could remove humans from stock selection altogether. Robert Tull, president of Procure Holdings, thinks data science can bring hedge fund-style returns to low- cost index products.

"Ensemble data techniques have been successfully used outside of finance over 40 years. Applying them to the mutual fund universe we can build a portfolio of high-conviction stock picks to generate outsized returns," says Mr Tull.

A fund using the techniques developed by Ensemble Asset Management and Turing Technologies is yet to come to market. An AI actively managed ETF portfolio was launched in 2017 by EquBot but returns have failed to keep up with the S&P500.

Doubts remain over whether AI funds will be a hit with investors. "An opaque machine that selects stocks on criteria derived from big data and analytics makes traditional managers wary," says Mr Engelbart.

Over 100 companies interested in working on ambitious Lloyd s of London transformation plan

Some of the biggest names in technology are pitching for a role in thetransformation of one of the world s most traditional insurance markets.

John Neal, chief executive of Lloyd s of London, told #fintechFT that Apple, Google and Amazon areamong over 100 companies interested in working on an ambitious transformation plan that he laid out in September.

Lloyd s is a market where insurance underwriters and brokers meet face to face to iron out the finer details of policies covering everything from spacecraft to cyber attacks. But it has been under pressure to improve its performance, cut costs and attract more business.

In September,Mr Neal published what he calls a  Blueprint  detailing six ways he plans to turn Lloyd s around. They include new platforms to arrange insurance for bothcomplex and commoditised risks, and a more automated claims process. He hopes that, over time, these changes will help double the amount of business done in the market from last year's 36bn.

Although much of the more complex business at Lloyd's will still be negotiated face to face, the new platforms should help to process the policies more efficiently, helping Mr Neal in his goal to sharply cut down the 40p cost of every 1 of premium sold at Lloyd's.

 Overall, the (proposed) change is massive,  said Greg Brown, partner at consultancy Oxbow Partners.  And a lot of it is technology   only one of the six areas in the blueprint doesn t talk about building a platform for 2020. All of them are major large-scale platform builds or buys. 

Mr Neal says it s easier to implement such major changes now than it would have been three or four years ago.  The advent of the cloud allows you to build in a step by step way with an open architecture,  he said, referencing technology that allows companies to access computing power on demand rather than relying on their own servers.

Mr Neal saidthat in a  modern world  there was no need to build everything from scratch, and companies can instead adapt what already exists.

That is where the outside help comes in. As well as the giants of the tech world, Lloyd s has been approached by exchanges such as London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and insurtech start-ups which all believe they can play a role in the marketplace's transformation.

Of the big tech companies, Mr Neal says:  They are platform companies, and we are a platform business as well. How much of what they have fits in with an insurance platform remains to be seen. 

Technology experts say work on building or adapting the core systems is likely to go to experienced companies rather than start-ups.

Nevertheless, Mr Neal saysstart-ups will have an important role to play in the future. He has been a strong supporter ofLloyd s Lab, the incubator set up by his predecessor Inga Beale. Much of the work on the Blueprint was done by people based in the Lab on the fourth floor of the Lloyd s building in the City of London.

He says that in future, companies in Lab should be  completely aligned  with the changes that he has proposed in the Blueprint.

The brokers and underwriters at Lloyd s are often perceived asresistant to change, so delivering all the reforms will be a big challenge.

 One of our questions is 'can the market deal with the change, do they have the resources for it?'  said Mr Brown at Oxbow.  Everyone s worrying about it but nobody can do anything at the moment. 

Mr Neal insists that there will be assistance available, especially for the multitude of smaller insurers and brokers which operate at Lloyd s.  We ll help them both physically and financially,  he said.  It is the only sensible way we can move at the speed we want to.

Robin Wigglesworth applauds an account of one of the more enigmatic figures in financial markets

T he profound and the inane alike are debated on Quora, a website where the curious (or plain bored) can pose questions to the internet hive mind. Renaissance Technologies, a fabled yet secretive hedge fund, is one of the subjects that occasionally piques interest. Last year, a rival recounted how he had once nearly poached someone from Renaissance, only to be stymied at the last minute. "I read about him years later," the Quora contributor wrote. "He bought an Alp. As in ... an actual mountain in Austria."

The story has no doubt grown in the retelling. Nonetheless, it is a vivid example of the awestruck fascination that Renaissance commands in finance. Machines and algorithms have taken over swaths of markets, supplanting the grizzled traders of public perception, and no one has harnessed computer science and vast data sets to invest as successfully as Renaissance. "It's the gold standard of computer trading," one rival once ruefully admitted to me.

Despite its success, the hedge fund and its founder Jim Simons have largely remained an enigma. Even most people in finance would struggle to identify Simons out of a line-up of similarly disheveled octogenarians. Indeed, his chain-smoking, silver beard, wryness and reluctance to wear socks all make him seem more like a Coen Brothers character than a colossus of investing.

There has been the odd carefully chosen interview, but a quip to Seed Magazine in 2006 captured his views on fame.

Quoting Benjamin, Animal Farm's wise old donkey, Simons said: "'God gave me a tail to keep off the flies. But I'd rather have had no tail and no flies.' So, that's kind of the way I feel about publicity."

Yet in The Man Who Solved the Market, Gregory Zuckerman lifts the lid on the most fascinating man in financial markets: a liberal mathematician who once motorcycled from Boston to Bogot, was ejected from the Soviet code-cracking team at the Institute for Defense Analyses for opposing the Vietnam war, and then built the most relentless of moneymaking machines.

Zuckerman estimates Renaissance has generated over $100bn in trading profits since 1988 more than any other hedge fund in history making millionaires of many of its employees, and several billionaires. Forbes puts Simons' fortune at above $21bn, leaving other hedge fund magnates and financiers such as Ray Dalio, George Soros and Stephen Schwarzman trailing.

Quantitative finance as it is dubbed may seem a recondite subject to many people, but it is profoundly reshaping the investment industry, and thus capitalism itself. And Renaissance is the shining example of what can be achieved by applying modern technology, big data and lots of brainy people. More broadly, however, Renaissance is also emblematic of an era where technology helps money and power accrue to an increasingly small number of people. The choices that these people make can reverberate globally. While Simons has become one of the world's biggest backers of scientific research and philanthropy and a host of Democratic politicians his former colleague Robert Mercer has funnelled his billions into the far-right Breitbart News, the election of Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy.

The Wall Street Journal journalist details many of the bumps, personal and professional, along the way. Renaissance's first years were spent in a poky office in a Long Island strip mall. Regu-lators once came calling after recommendations spat out by the early algorithms saw Renaissance nearly cornered the potato market.

Failure often loomed. When Renaissance's first foray into bond markets turned into big losses, Simons admitted to a colleague that "sometimes I look at this and feel I'm just some guy who doesn't really know what he's doing". Later, the increasing notoriety of Mercer caused consternation internally and externally. More tragically, two of Simons' sons died in accidents, leaving the hedge fund manager devastated.

Yet Renaissance has enjoyed a golden run the likes of which investing has never seen. When it notched up its first $1m one-day profit in 1990, Simons handed out champagne but $1m oneday gains quickly "became so frequent that the drinking got a bit out of hand", according to Zuckerman. Today, it wouldn't create a murmur at Renaissance's East Setauket headquarters, let alone the clink of champagne glasses.

For all Simons' undoubted brilliance, the book makes clear that his skill was not inventing complex trading models and algorithms himself. His talent was to spot, nurture and harness beautiful but often combustible minds such as James Ax, Lenny Baum, Elwyn Berlekamp, Henry Laufer, Peter Brown and Mercer. One person describes Renaissance's motley group of scientists and mathematicians as "a bunch of Sheldons", a reference to the socially inept but brainy star of The Big Bang Theory.

The book has some imperfections primarily that Zuckerman does not use his detailed reporting as a scaffolding to tell an even bigger story of how the business of investing has evolved over the past half-century.

While Simons was still toiling away as a codebreaker and frustrated academic, a bunch of brilliant financial economists were laying the groundwork for today's era of algorithmic markets. Simons may be the quant industry's paragon, but he is far from its only giant. Yet aside from a sprinkling of historical context, The Man Who Solved the Market is overwhelmingly focused on Simons, Renaissance and its eclectic eggheads. An occasional nod to the broader perspective would have enhanced a vivid tale of one of the biggest actors in one of the biggest stories of our time: how machines conquered financial markets. For years Simons has been the white whale of many financial reporters. In Zuckerman he has met his Ahab.

U.S. News -- Analysis: Health Plan To Leave Mark On Economy

By Richard Rubin

Sen. Elizabeth Warren's new Medicare for All plan would leave a sizable imprint on the U.S. economy, altering consumer spending and business investment while upending the health-care sector.

Nearly $20 trillion in new taxes over the next decade on corporations, investors and wealthy individuals would damp business profits. Households would see their costs reduced by $11 trillion, boosting their ability to spend on other goods and services. The plan also includes immigration-policy changes that would expand the labor force and consumer base.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, who advised the Democratic presidential candidate's campaign on the plan, said he hadn't yet conducted a full analysis of Ms. Warren's proposals. "My sense is at the end of the day, from a macroeconomic perspective, it's probably going to be a wash, give or take," said Mr. Zandi, who wasn't paid and hasn't endorsed the Massachusetts senator. "By itself, the tax increases are a negative. But in the context of all the moving parts, it's not clear."

Ms. Warren detailed her Medicare for All plan on Friday. The health-care side had been mostly clear before. Private insurance and the associated premiums and out-of-pocket costs that consumers pay would vanish in the shift to asystem where health payments pass through the government.

The tax proposals to make that happen, however, had been unknown before Friday, their absence a source of controversy for the lawmaker, who has risen to the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates because of her "plan for everything" tagline.

Ms. Warren offered several tax proposals that would mark a major policy shift. Taken together, they would greatly enlarge the federal government.

Health-insurance premiums paid by employers would be converted into a new "employer Medicare contribution" to the government, starting at an amount just below what employers pay now and adjusting toward national averages over time. The smallest businesses would be exempt. Economists generally believe that workers bear the cost of such taxes, so the total economic burden of taxes on households would rise even if they have lower total costs for taxes and health care combined.

"This is a tax plan to build a better Denmark," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who has advised Republicans.

The plan relies on aggressive assumptions about savings on administrative costs in the health system that haven't yet been vetted by private-sector and government economists. And the net harm or benefit is likely to be the subject of interparty and partisan debate. But analysts said several features have generally clear economic implications.

Ms. Warren would raise the corporate tax rate to 35% from 21% and require U.S. companies to pay that amount on their world-wide profits, instead of much lower minimum taxes in place now. She would also lengthen depreciation schedules, reversing a core piece of the 2017 GOP tax law. That combination would reduce after-tax returns on investment and could make businesses less likely to invest in the U.S.

However, middling business investment since the 2017 tax cut complicates this argument. Democrats now have an easier time saying tax changes won't have major effects on business investment.

Ms. Warren now calls for a 6% annual wealth tax on billionaires, up from the 3% she had earlier proposed. She also would impose so-called mark-to-market taxation on capital gains, so that people would have to pay each year on their assets' increase in value even if they don't sell them.

Those changes could all damp investment by lowering after-tax returns. And they could make investors wary about the future path of corporate profits.

Mr. Zandi, however, said the most important move Ms. Warren made was showing that her plan's revenue matches its costs. If she hadn't done that, the resulting larger federal budget deficits would lead to higher interest rates and cause a drag on the economy, he said.

WSJ Pro
European Cloud Project Draws Backlash From U.S. Tech Giants; Move toward  digital sovereignty' will restrict data services along national borders in a global economy, Amazon and Microsoft say

Germany and France are introducing a government-backed project to develop European cloud infrastructure in an effort to help local providers compete with U.S. technology giants, which dominate the global cloud market.

Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. criticized the initiative announced this week, called Gaia-X, saying the project will restrict data services along national borders.

The reach of Amazon, Microsoft and other U.S. giants worries European politicians and corporate executives. Companies in Germany and France, the continent's economic powerhouses, and in other European Union countries are concerned about depending on technology providers that must comply with the U.S. Cloud Act, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-wants-homegrown-cloud-services-to-rival-amazon-microsoft-11571909400". The 2018 law requires American firms to provide law enforcement with customers' personal data on request, even when the servers containing the information are abroad.

"There's no answer to the question of how secure our data really is," Frank Melzer, chief technology officer of Festo AG, a German company that makes robots and other industrial products, said this week at a German digital conference where Gaia-X was announced.

Cloud providers taking part in Gaia-X will be required to certify to their corporate customers that their information remains secure and provide guarantees about where it is stored and how it is processed. Participating in the project would require cloud providers to use the same standards, letting businesses easily move their data from one provider to another.

French and German government officials are set to meet this month with companies interested in participating and the plan is to create a governance structure for the initiative before the end of the year, the German Economy Ministry said. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate.

Some European companies that use large American cloud providers say those services are more competitively priced than cloud services in Europe, WSJ Pro previously reported. Gaia-X could lower transaction costs by standardizing contracts and processes between cloud providers and customers, the German Economy Ministry said. It didn't provide details about how much governments plan to invest in the project.

Gaia-X is an "important initiative" but details about performance, services and cost will determine whether European cloud providers can compete with non-European suppliers, a spokeswoman for German bank Commerzbank SA told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity in an email. Commerzbank uses cloud services from Alphabet Inc.'s Google and International Business Machines Corp., she said.

Another goal of the infrastructure plan is to help European companies in industries such as manufacturing and health care in their efforts to develop algorithms and artificial intelligence without relying on foreign technology providers, government officials said.

"We need something like an Airbus for artificial intelligence," German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said at this week's conference.

Roberto Viola, a European Commission official focused on communication and technology, also compared Gaia-X to Airbus SE, the European multinational plane maker that is the main competitor to U.S.-based Boeing Co.

"Europe remains open to the world, but with an ambition &to have digital sovereignty," he said, speaking at the same conference.

Microsoft and Amazon said they are able to host corporate data securely and criticized the German and French governments' approach.

A Microsoft spokesperson said digital sovereignty is a legitimate goal, adding, "in the cloud age, however, we think it is wrong to define sovereignty solely along territorial borders." Instead, sovereignty needs "the most powerful cloud solution."

Microsoft is interested in participating in Gaia-X, the spokesperson said.

The German Economy Ministry said non-EU companies will be able to take part in the initiative if they "share our goals of data sovereignty and data availability." A ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on whether U.S.-based companies can meet those goals if they comply with the U.S. Cloud Act.

A spokesperson for Amazon's cloud provider Amazon Web Services said that Germany and France's plan "removes many of the fundamental benefits of cloud computing for customers it restricts freedom of choice, flexibility, and ability to scale globally, without increasing security."

Good day. Business activity and confidence are declining at the macro level, but the venture and startup world has still been extremely active, according to a new report.

Venture funds of a billion dollars or more, so-called "megafunds," keep growing in size and number, per Silicon Valley Bank's fourth quarter report. There is $26.8 billion in dry powder waiting to be invested from megafunds raised in 2018 alone. That should help insulate some startups in a potential downturn, the report states. Now 33 venture firms have raised at least one megafund and 74 total megafunds have been raised.

Meanwhile, despite the warnings and fear of overvaluing startups from many investors, investors continue to put high prices on startups. There were more than 50 unicorns created in 2019. And there is still a backlog of unicorn companies that need to exit.

Even after Uber, Lyft and others going public this year, there is now a record total value of private unicorn companies still waiting to exit $385 billion worth, matching 2018's record level.

And now on to the news...

In the News

New money. AI Capital, a new venture-capital firm targeting artificial intelligence-based enterprise software startups, is raising a $100 million second fund which it expects to close next year, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports.

* The Boulder, Colo.-based firm has been investing out of a $10 million pilot fund launched in 2017.

* The firm has just led its first venture financing, a $7 million round made out of its pilot fund into startup Link3D Inc., which builds business software to streamline equipment manufacturers' production and supply-chain management.

Fixing SoftBank Vision Fund. Having put the SoftBank Vision Fund together, Rajeev Misra is now the man in charge of keeping it from falling apart. A finance whiz who cut his teeth on Wall Street, he pads around the Vision Fund's London headquarters barefoot, often chewing on betel nuts, a mild stimulant. He recently changed the layout of his office after consulting his astrologer. Inside the Vision Fund, investment decisions often are made in minutes, said people familiar with its operations. A consultant's report last year quoted employees describing a "chaotic" and "personality driven" firm with few controls, where people are "incentivized to gamble to look good" and build their own personal brands.

Immunotherapy funding. Tmunity Therapeutics Inc. has raised a $75 million Series B funding led by Andreessen Horowitz to propel a series of cancer-fighting cellular therapies through clinical trials, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Philadelphia-based Tmunity and other companies are developing novel cell therapies that could potentially treat a range of solid-organ tumors in addition to blood cancers. Andreessen's funding stems from an investment thesis that it is becoming increasingly possible to engineer medicines for very specific purposes, general partner Jorge Conde said. Other cell-therapy startups raising recently include Arsenal Biosciences Inc., which in October disclosed an $85 million Series A raised from Westlake Village BioPartners and others. Westlake Village also invested in this round for Tmunity. In addition to Andreessen Horowitz and Westlake Village, investors in the Tmunity financing include Be the Match BioTherapies, BrightEdge, Gilead Sciences and the University of Pennsylvania. Tmunity has raised a total of $231 million.

Write down. Altria Group Inc. wrote down its investment in Juul Labs Inc. by more than a third and now holds it at a price that values the e-cigarette maker at about $24 billion. The tobacco giant cited unexpected shifts in Juul's market, including proposed U.S. bans on e-cigarette flavors and regulatory crackdowns abroad, for its decision to book a write-down of $4.5 billion. Altria also disclosed Thursday that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company's role in the resignation of Juul's former chief executive officer and his replacement by an Altria executive, along with other hires from the tobacco company.

VC Funds

Courtside Ventures, which makes early-stage investments in sports-related media and technology companies, seeks to raise $100 million for its second fund, according to a regulatory filing. The New York- and Los Angeles-based firm includes cycling computer maker Hammerhead, personal coaching app Freeletics and sports news provider The Athletic in its portfolio.

Inne, a Berlin-based women's health startup, raised  8 million ($8.9 million) in Series A funding. Blossom Capital led the round, which included participation from Monkfish Equity and others.

TetraScience Inc., a Boston-based data integration platform for life sciences research and development, snagged an $8 million Series A round from Waters Corp., Floodgate Capital, First Round Capital, Underscore VC, Founder Collective and Y Combinator.

Mainline, a Houston-based esports tournament software and management startup, landed $6.8 million in Series A financing led by Work America Capital.

Point 72 throws weight behind fitness start-up

Steven Cohen, the hedge fund billionaire, is putting money into Mirror, a fitness start-up, and joining its board after its founder made a pitch during his workout.

Mr Cohen's Point72 Ventures joined investors including clothing group Lululemon, model Karlie Kloss and LionTree, the media adviser, in backing the start-up.

Mirror, which is based in New York, delivers fitness classes via a wallmounted, internet-connected screen that it calls the first "nearly invisible, interactive home gym".

Brynn Putnam, who founded Mirror, said: "I met Steve because he was a Mirror member and fan. I actually made my pitch to him while he was on the treadmill for his workout session."

Point72 is leading a $34m funding round, which takes the amount Mirror has raised so far to $72m.

The company declined to comment on the valuation the new money puts on Mrs Putnam's company, but Delaware filings from April suggested Mirror aimed to sell shares valuing it at almost $300m.

The company did not say how much of the $34m came from Mr Cohen. In a statement on Wednesday, it said it would use the proceeds to "expand into new areas and content verticals".

Point72 Ventures, which invests money from Mr Cohen and employees of Point72 Asset Management, his $14.6bn hedge fund, has typically focused on fintech and artificial intelligence start-ups. Its investments include Acorns, a personal finance app, and Quantopian, a crowdsourced algorithmic trading fund.

Mr Cohen opened Point72 Asset Management to outside capital last year after serving a two-year ban from managing money for investors, part of a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over insider trading charges at his previous hedge fund.

He was never personally charged with improper trading.

Mirror is one of several start-ups aimed at the fitness industry. The company sells a $1,495 product, which appears to be a mirror when it is not streaming video fitness classes, with a celebrity following that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, the actor, and other clients of Tracy Anderson, the fitness trainer.

Peloton, one of the sector's leaders, raised $1.2bn during an initial public offering last month before dropping more than 11 per cent on its debut. The company's shares are trading about 20 per cent below the IPO price.

China's blockchain frenzy, which sparked rallies in an array of companies, has catapulted one academic into the limelight.

Meet Chen Chun, a 63-year-old computer-science professor and an expert at a government-backed think tank. At a meeting last week, it was his job to brief Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials at the Communist Party's Politburo on the merits of blockchain the open-ledger technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

After Mr. Chen's briefing, Mr. Xi announced that China should "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-and-chinese-tech-stocks-surge-after-xi-jinping-touts-blockchain-11572259762", according to a report released late last week by the country's official Xinhua News Agency.

While Beijing has previously been skeptical about cryptocurrencies, some investors and experts had expected cautious support for blockchain technology as part of a broader competition with the U.S. over financial firepower. China's central bank is also in the midst of developing its own digital currency. Yet the fact that such an endorsement for blockchain came from Mr. Xi himself took the market by surprise.

On Monday, stocks that had even a tangential connection to blockchain soared. The share prices of more than 150 blockchain-related listed companies were forced to suspend trading because they hit the upper 10% daily limit allowed in China's stock market, according to data provider Wind.

The price of bitcoin also jumped by about a third and briefly topped $10,000 after Mr. Xi's comments were publicized, before falling back in recent days. The world's most popular cryptocurrency recently traded around $9,100, according to research site CoinDesk.

For many of those companies, their rallies lost steam throughout the week. An index that tracks blockchain-linked stocks in mainland China rose just 3.1% for the week, after initially rising nearly 9% on Monday alone.

"This is classic speculation among retail investors," said Tony Gu, founding partner at NGC Ventures, a blockchain investment fund. "When you see rallies like this, the trend almost always dies off because there's no substance to it." He said the vast majority of companies claiming to have blockchain exposure don't actually make any money off the technology.

Among companies that maintained their share gains were some with ties to Mr. Chen or companies he has had stakes in.

One of them is Insigma Technology Co., whose shares rose 26% over the past week. Mr. Chen co-founded the company in Hangzhou in eastern China decades ago; he left it in 2014. Insigma announced on Wednesday it holds a 2.8% stake in a private company Mr. Chen established two years later, Hangzhou Qulian Technology Co.; it didn't disclose whether Mr. Chen still holds stakes in Insigma.

Another winner in this week's rally is property developer Xinhu Zhongbao Co., which said in a Thursday filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange that it owns nearly half of Qulian. It surged by the daily 10% limit all five days. Its market cap is currently $5.7 billion, according to FactSet, up from $3.4 billion a week ago.

There is no indication Mr. Chen directly profited from the market's sharp rally. He couldn't be reached for comment.

Mr. Chen's connection with these companies is well-known in the industry, four blockchain and cryptocurrency investors told The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Chen was listed in 2017 by China's Ministry of Science and Technology as a member of an artificial-intelligence-strategy advisory committee, which was designated to support the country's megaplan for high-end manufacturing development, dubbed "Made in China 2025."

Investments are intricate in this knowledge-intensive industry, and often involve scholars and experts. According to public filings, Mr. Chen is a shareholder of at least four private companies and chairs the board of another two besides Qulian.

Qulian partnered with several state-owned enterprises including the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the power giant State Grid to develop blockchain platforms. It also runs research projects with Zhejiang University, where Mr. Chen directs a blockchain research center.

Chinese state media have warned about the risks of speculation in the blockchain business. Investors, meanwhile, worry that speculators might use the blockchain push to step up practices such as shadow lending or cross-border transfers that could eventually trigger a regulatory crackdown and hurt the industry as a whole.

The multiple stock-exchange filings this week by Insigma and Xinhu Zhongbao, in which they clarified their associations with Mr. Chen's company, were an indication of their desire to stay ahead of speculation around their dramatic market-cap gains.

Diamond Miners Sag As Global Demand Cools; Investors are increasingly skeptical of independent suppliers like Petra Diamonds and Dominion Diamond Mines amid a global weakening in rough diamond prices

Slumping diamond prices are punishing the industry's investors and pushing some independent mining companies, such as recently bankrupt Stornoway Diamond Corp., into dire financial straits.

While diamond production boomed after the financial crisis, slowing economic growth and trade tensions across the globe are now dampening consumer spending on luxury goods. Swollen inventories in India, where roughly 95% of the world's diamonds are processed and polished, have further depressed prices.

A price index based on a global aggregate of rough diamonds has declined 3.2% year-to-date and is down more than 12% over the past five years, according to Paul Zimnisky, the founder of research firm Diamond Analytics.

A multibillion-dollar bank fraud in India linked to a prominent diamantaire has also unsettled the industry, shrinking credit available to Indian diamond processors. The street protests rocking Hong Kong, home to Asia's largest diamond fair, have cooled one of the world's fastest-growing jewelry markets. Going forward, the rise of lab-grown diamonds and lower marriage rates among young adults worldwide pose additional threats, according to industry analysts.

The weakening market has taken a toll on smaller, independent mine operators. Montreal-based Stornoway Diamond, owner of the Renard Mine in Quebec, was forced to seek protection from creditors in September under Canada's equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In court papers, Stornoway's bankruptcy administrators said a "market price correction" last year crimped the company's cash flows and cited a weakening Indian rupee, a credit crunch among Indian diamantaires and an excess of polished inventory in the country.

Investors have also fled Jersey-based Petra Diamonds Ltd., valuing its $650 million bond due in 2022 at 71 cents on the dollar Thursday morning, down from 94 cents in August, according to MarketAxess. A $550 million bond issued by Calgary-based Dominion Diamond Mines changed hands at 50 cents this week, down from 66.5 cents in August, according to MarketAxess.

Bonds issued by Toronto-based Mountain Province Diamonds are also trading below their par values. Earlier this month, the company said it sold rough diamonds in the third quarter at an average price of $52.5 per carat, down 27.6% from $72.5 per carat a year earlier.

The diamond industry is dominated by Anglo American PLC's De Beers Group, which represents 35% of global extraction, and Alrosa Group, which is part-owned by the Russian government and accounts for an estimated 29%, according to Diamond Analytics.

Rio Tinto, Dominion Diamond, Petra and Mountain Province have less than 6% of global market share each. Other miners include the governments of Angola and Zimbabwe. Many of the smaller suppliers mine only diamonds and are highly vulnerable to pricing swings.

"At the current market prices some of these companies' assets are probably only marginally profitable," Mr. Zimnisky said. "When you model any asset that's in that situation, it's highly susceptible to price volatility."

Diamond mining requires high levels of capital expenditures, said Matthew Farwell, a managing director at Imperial Capital LLC who trades in commodity-backed debt securities. "To the extent that these companies need capital to operate, the pricing pressure has a large impact on cash flow."

Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts earlier this month predicted diamond pricing would get worse before it gets better and said that lab-grown diamonds pose a real threat to the natural stone industry.

Last year's revelation of an alleged $2 billion bank fraud involving Nirav Modi, India's onetime jeweler to the stars, has made banks less willing to extend credit to Indian diamond processors, further pressuring demand for rough stones, Mr. Zimnisky said. After months as a fugitive, Mr. Modi was arrested in London in March and faces potential extradition to India on allegations he orchestrated a web of illegal loans guaranteed by India's state-owned Punjab National Bank.

A court-appointed examiner has linked the alleged fraud to Mr. Modi's U.S. businesses, which filed for bankruptcy after PNB uncovered it.

AI Capital, a new venture-capital firm targeting artificial intelligence-based enterprise software startups, is raising a $100 million second fund which it expects to close next year, Managing Partner Neville Teagarden said.

The Boulder, Colo.-based firm has been investing out of a $10 million pilot fund launched in 2017.

The firm has just led its first venture financing, a $7 million round made out of its pilot fund into startup Link3D Inc., which builds business software that is meant to streamline equipment manufacturers' production and supply-chain management.

Link3D's technology fits squarely into AI Capital's investment strategy. The startup's software incorporates artificial intelligence to automate business processes such as work orders, price quotes, product scheduling and data analytics. The software can be used in industries including aerospace, defense, automotive, consumer, medical, and oil and gas.

In the automotive industry, for instance, Link3D's software can help manufacturers scale industrial 3-D printing supply chains, leading to cost reductions.

AI Capital targets growth-stage startups that already have at least a couple corporate customers to which they are selling product, Mr. Teagarden said.

"That's a pretty key benchmark for us," Mr. Teagarden said, adding that the intent is to write checks in the $2 million to $2.5 million range.

Software startups focusing on business processes, analytics and performance management raised between $960 and $1.13 billion in the third quarter, putting the sector among those receiving the most venture funding, according to a PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree report.

Meanwhile, the report ranked the AI startup sector as receiving the most venture funding between $2.2 billion and $5 billion in total over roughly 165 deals.

AI Capital taps mainly wealthy families and family offices as its limited partners, Mr. Teagarden said.

Link3D will use the funding to spur growth in North America, Europe and Japan.

VC Daily: Startups Support Addiction Care; Greatscale's Hands-On Approach; SoftBank-backed Fair CEO Resigns

Good day. Venture capitalists are continuing to pay up for access to startups at most stages of their development, despite broader economic and political uncertainty.

Pre-money valuations in the third quarter rose for Series A, B and D and later rounds, while falling at the Series C and seed stages, according to a new report by law firm Cooley LLP.

While fears of trade wars and questions about initial public offerings persist, venture firms have large cash reserves and are putting their capital to work. Median Series A valuations rose to $30 million in the third quarter from $25 million in the prior quarter. Meanwhile, median seed valuations ticked down to $8 million from $9.5 million in the second quarter.

"Up" rounds made up 87% of the firm's 264 reported deals in the third quarter, little changed from the second quarter, Cooley said. Meanwhile, startups continue to have leverage with deal terms. Less than 7% of deals had full participating liquidation preferences, according to the report.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Stopping addiction. Startups are designing new tools and services that are intended to make access to addiction care easier, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. With millions of people battling substance abuse and not receiving treatment, venture-backed companies aim to lower those barriers by opening treatment centers and providing online services.

* They include CleanSlate Centers Inc., which operates outpatient treatment centers in 11 states, and startups that provide digital-treatment programs such as DynamiCare Health Inc.

* "There's no one magic answer," said Garheng Kong, managing partner of HealthQuest Capital, which has invested in the sector. "The demand is not anywhere near being fully met."

* Companies providing addiction care face regulatory hurdles in extending the reach of their services. And startups pursuing new, digital treatments have the challenge of building a body of research that persuades insurers, employers and consumers to use their products.

New firm alert. The public market stumbles of unprofitable, highly valued startups have prompted some investors to take a more hands-on approach toward early-stage businesses. Greatscale Ventures hopes to dispel the growth-at-all-costs ethos with its debut venture capital fund, which targets $60 million, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports exclusively. The newly launched firm intends to walk entrepreneurs through the entire process of company creation, hiring and go-to-market strategy. The firm's investment structure involves investing less capital than a typical venture firm, while essentially taking on a co-founder role in the companies. As a result, in a typical exit, Greatscale expects to have 40% equity in a company.

Fair CEO out. The founder and chief executive of troubled car-leasing startup Fair resigned Wednesday, following widespread layoffs as the company seeks a path to profitability and considers changes to its business model, the Journal's Heather Somerville reports. Scott Painter said in a memo to employees that he would step down as CEO and remain chairman of the board of directors. Adam Hieber of SoftBank, one of Fair's largest and most involved investors, will take over as interim CEO. Mr. Painter's resignation follows layoffs at Fair that eliminated about 40% of the Santa Monica, Calif-based company's workforce. In early 2018, Fair bought Uber Technologies's car-leasing program, known as Xchange Leasing. As part of that deal, Fair signed an exclusive agreement to lease cars to Uber drivers. SoftBank invested in Fair at the end of last year, leading the largest-ever equity financing round for the leasing company and pushing the startup's valuation to about $1.2 billion from about $450 million.

LA suspends Uber scooters. Los Angeles has temporarily suspended Uber Technologies's permit to offer dockless scooters for rent, amid a deepening disagreement over the city's data-collection efforts. The ride-hailing company, which offers scooters through its Jump business, was asked to show that it could comply with the requirements of the Mobility Data Specification, a platform city officials developed to track the number and movements of scooters around the city. Uber said that it wouldn't comply with the requirements, calling them invasive to customer privacy.

Exits

Customer experience technology company UserTesting acquired Truthlab, a provider of machine-learning-based video analysis, for an undisclosed amount. San Francisco-based UserTesting is backed by Accel Partners and OpenView Venture Partners.

Workforce Logiq, a provider of workforce-management software and services to large companies, acquired predictive analytics and artificial intelligence software provider Engage Talent for an undisclosed sum. Orlando, Fla.-based Workforce is backed by private-equity investor Carlyle Group. Engage counted Revolution's Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Refinery Ventures and Grand Ventures among its investors.

ShareGrid Inc., a peer-to-peer marketplace for filmmakers and photographers, is expanding to the U.K. with the acquisition of London-based film and camera rental community BorrowFox. Terms weren't disclosed. Based in Seattle, ShareGrid is backed by MHS Capital and Archer Gray.

Carrick Capital Partners Profits From Grow-and-Split Strategy; The lower-midmarket firm scored a lucrative exit strategy with Axiom Global Inc. by expanding, splitting and then selling the company in pieces

Private-equity firms often join businesses to make them larger and more attractive to buyers.

Carrick Capital Partners, however, is cashing out of legal services provider Axiom Global Inc. by taking a different approach. It first grew the company before splitting it to sell it off in pieces.

Two out of three exits the lower-midmarket firm produced during the third quarter involved sales of companies that trace their roots to an original investment in Axiom in 2013. At that time, Carrick committed $36 million to the New York-based company, said Jim Madden, a Carrick co-founder and managing director.

Carrick first expanded Axiom by developing two additional businesses separate from its core lawyer-on-demand services and then spinning them off. One of the two, Axiom Managed Solutions, focuses on high volume, repetitive legal processes that companies can outsource, such as the elaboration of nondisclosure agreements. The other, Knowable Inc., uses machine learning and other tools to extract data from contracts.

"We concluded last summer that the way to maximize value &was probably separate [Axiom] into three pieces so investors can understand them differently," Mr. Madden said. "But there was a lot of planning and discussion before that."

The strategy is paying off for Carrick, which sold down 90% of its stake in Knowable when the company formed a joint venture, announced in July, with legal and regulatory information provider LexisNexis. Mr. Madden estimates the stake sale generated a roughly 35% net internal rate of return and a sixfold multiple of Carrick's investment.

More recently, the firm "https://www.wsj.com/articles/axiom-global-to-get-investment-from-permira-drops-ipo-plans-11567708003?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=9"to fellow private-equity firm Permira, after dropping plans to take the company public. That sale, announced in September, produced a roughly 22% net IRR, Mr. Madden said. Carrick still owns Axiom Managed Solutions.

During the third quarter, Carrick exited at least one other portfolio company that didn't originate from the Axiom deal. In July, it sold InstaMed Holdings Inc., an operator of health-care payment networks the firm backed in 2016, to bank giant JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Carrick scored a roughly 35% internal rate of return and a 2.7 multiple of invested capital with the sale of the Philadelphia-based company to JPMorgan, according to Mr. Madden.

"We're not done. We're working on more sales and more exits right now," he said.

Founded in 2012, Carrick invests in companies that use technology to make business processes more efficient. The firm focuses on three areas: software as a service, business process outsourcing and transaction processing. The firm in 2017 was seeking $400 million for its latest fund, Carrick Capital Partners III LP, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Capital One Gets the Entire Bank Involved in AI; Cross-team collaboration helps advance projects, multiplying the reach of its AI center of excellence

Capital One Financial Corp.'s machine-learning team has increased its ability to deploy artificial-intelligence projects by collaborating more closely with other parts of the company.

The 50,000-employee bank has an AI center of excellence, which it opened in 2015, but the hub began operating with little involvement from other divisions. Business units essentially asked the center to solve specific problems and left it up to the AI team to develop a system.

The hub, dubbed the Center for Machine Learning, was essentially an outsourced AI service, said David Castillo, Capital One's managing vice president of machine learning. Virtually all the development work fell to the center, limiting the number of projects it could take on, said Mr. Castillo, who has been in his role since June 2018.

Last year, Mr. Castillo decided to change the model and have the business units take a bigger role in AI development. The switch multiplied by 10 the number of projects the hub can participate in, he said, declining to give specifics.

"We only had the capacity to absorb so many projects," he said about the old model. "And the way that we work now is collaboratively with all the teams, so our reach is much larger."

Few companies are realizing a return on their AI investments. While about nine of 10 corporate executives have made an investment in AI technology, fewer than two in five report any business gain from their AI efforts in the past three years, according to a recent study from MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group. The report is based on a survey of more than 2,500 executives world-wide.

The use of centers of excellence that collaborate with business units under a "hub-and-spoke" model is an effective strategy for bringing AI projects to life, said Ritu Jyoti, IDC's program vice president of artificial intelligence strategies, speaking at the AI World conference in Boston last week.

At Capital One, the center started off as a sort of think tank and prototyping hub, used by the bank's four main business units retail banking, commercial banking, credit card and auto finance.

For AI projects under the old model, the interaction with the business units mostly consisted of weekly update meetings and demos.

Today, the process is far more collaborative, with machine-learning experts and data engineers from Mr. Castillo's team working side-by-side with business-unit data scientists, subject matter experts and software engineers. The team members hold daily meetings lasting 10 to 20 minutes to deal with day-to-day issues. Product managers from both sides participate in weekly meetings for bigger-picture issues.

Overall, the typical development process for a system takes no longer than 12 weeks. The goal is to get to a "minimum viable product," or an AI application with the core features, which team members can start testing, Mr. Castillo said. At that point, the center begins to disengage from the project.

One of the first projects deployed under the new approach was a fraud-detection AI application for the credit-card unit, released earlier this year. Its machine-learning algorithms predict the likelihood that cardholders took out the credit card to scam the bank, and that they intend to run up bills and simply not pay them.

Mr. Castillo declined to say what factors feed into that prediction beyond saying that the algorithms are trained on credit-card-fraud data. The application is designed to identify accounts where user fraud is likely, enabling bank employees to intervene by, for instance, scrutinizing transactions or lowering credit limits.

Private employers in the U.S. nonfarm sector added more jobs in October than economists expected, according to the ADP National Employment Report.

The nonfarm private sector added 125,000 jobs this month, according to the report. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting 100,000 new jobs.

The service-producing sector drove the increase, accounting for 138,000 new jobs, while the good-producing sector lost 13,000 jobs.

"While job growth continues to soften, there are certain segments of the labor market that remain strong," Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in prepared remarks. "The goods producing sector showed weakness; however, the healthcare industry and midsized companies had solid gains," he said.

Large businesses, or those that have at least 500 employees, added 44,000 jobs. Midsize businesses created 64,000 new jobs and small businesses, or those with 49 employees or fewer, added 17,000 jobs.

Of the 138,000 jobs the service-producing sector added, the growth was across all industries. The education and health services industry added 41,000 jobs, while trade, transportation and utilities added 32,000 jobs.

Within the goods-producing sector, the construction industry lost 4,000 jobs and the natural resources and mining jobs also fell by 4,000. Manufacturing lost 4,000 additional jobs.

The ADP Research Institute puts out the monthly report with Moody's Analytics.

Good day. Despite widespread talk of wanting to devote more capital to emerging startup hubs, venture capitalists are still overwhelmingly spending their money right where they always have: California, New York and Massachusetts.

While we continue to see firms like Revolution which just closed $150 million for its second Rise of the Rest Seed Fund to back startups located outside of Silicon Valley and group efforts by local governments and the business communities of cities like Houston, Buffalo or Milwaukee to spark entrepreneurial activity, the data doesn't lie.

In fact, even though venture capitalists are investing more money than ever into startups, they are devoting an increasingly smaller percentage to the other 47 states, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. A decade ago, venture capitalists committed just over half of the roughly $34 billion total invested to those top three states. By 2018, when total venture funding into U.S. startups hit a record $135 billion, 78% of it was going to California, New York and Massachusetts.

With a quarter left to go in 2019, that top-funded trio is on pace to eclipse everyone else even further.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Faire business: San Francisco startup Faire has made a billion-dollar business providing mom-and-pop stores with an Amazon-like marketplace for wholesale items at a time when many of the biggest retailers have been struggling, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports exclusively.

* Faire, officially known as Indigo Fair Inc., has raised $150 million at a $1 billion post-money valuation. Lightspeed Venture Partners and Founders Fund co-led the round. Existing investors Forerunner Ventures, Y Combinator and Khosla Ventures also participated.

* The investment represents a bet that local shops will thrive and will be aided by e-commerce rather than thwarted by it.

* Faire said it processes more than $1 million in transactions a day at times. The company wouldn't disclose specific revenue figures.

As you read this, I will be kicking off the keynote interviews at our WSJ Pro Private Equity event on developing women leaders with Blackstone Group's Joan Solotar and Vista Equity Partners' Ren Yang Stewart. WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper will also moderate a panel with Goldman Sachs' Olga Kaplan and Edison Partners' Jennifer Lee. If you couldn't make it to the event, stay tuned for our coverage!

In this morning's news, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming writes of another private-equity firm stake sale, although this time the buyer, Mitsui & Co. (U.S. A.), wasn't one of the usual suspects we see in these types of deals. Meanwhile, Luis Garcia writes of a new bet by Brazil-focused private-equity firm DXA Investments in the cybersecurity sector. And Silver Lake led a funding round that lifted vacation-rental management company Vacasa LLC to unicorn status.

Now on to the news...

Industry News

Discovery Capital Management LLC urged Frontier Communications Corp. to file for bankruptcy as quickly as possible as the broadband provider prepares for negotiations with bondholders.

The letter came shortly after Frontier began preparing a detailed plan to slash its roughly $17 billion debt load.

Backed by Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic as well as Dubai-based Emirates NBD, Network International provided a one-time gain of 4.4 billion dirhams ($1.20 billion) with its initial public offering in April, the lender said Monday, according to Reuters. The news service noted that Network International has grown to become the largest payments processor in Africa and the Middle East. The two private-equity firms agreed to acquire their 49% stake in the business from Abraaj Group about four years ago in a deal that valued Network International at more than $1 billion, sources told WSJ Pro at the time. PitchBook Data Inc. said at the time of the IPO that the firms were selling at least 25% of the company's shares in the deal. Stock worth about 1.1 billion ($1.4 billion) was sold in London, at 435 pence a share, giving the company a market value of $2.8 billion, the London Stock Exchange said at the time.

Private-equity firms in the U.S. that are trying to acquire companies and other assets in the U.K. have begun to make bids and payments in dollars instead of British pounds because of Brexit-related risks, the Financial Times said on Sunday. The newspaper cited offers made recently for satellite company Inmarsat and cybersecurity specialist Sophos as examples. In the past, U.S. buyout firms operating in the U.K. would do business in pounds and use the markets to hedge any currency risk, the Times said. It cited Preqin Ltd. data showing no dollar-denominated bids for U.K. assets from 2009 to 2017, while noting that Preqin said most U.S. firms still do their U.K. business in pounds.

Good day. Beyond Meat continues to serve up strong signals for the plant-based foods sector with news that the company turned its first quarterly profit, as The Wall Street Journal's Jacob Bunge reports. The company, whose May initial public offering brought the sector increased attention, reported its sales more than tripled to $92 million in the latest quarter.

Retailers and consumers want even more options, giving other food startups an opportunity to stand out. Deal making in the meat-alternatives sector has continued since Beyond Meat's IPO, with CRV backing Wild Type and S2G investing in Future Meat Technologies, both of which are developing lab-grown meats. In addition, food-focused venture firms Fifty Years and Powerplant Ventures have raised new funds.

"The competition is going to be great because hopefully we'll wind up getting better products," Steve Lieber, the head of business development for gourmet hamburger chain BurgerFi, told the Journal.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Billion-dollar gaming startup. Scopely Inc., a developer of mobile games based on popular franchises, has raised $200 million to focus on growth including through acquisitions, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports.

* The funding round valued Scopely at $1.7 billion, up from a Series C round in 2017 that valued the startup at $710 million, according to a person familiar with the deals.

* Venture investors have shown a willingness to commit large sums to videogame makers with successful titles based on well-known intellectual properties. Niantic Inc., the publisher of the popular "Pokmon Go" mobile game, raised $245 million last December at a valuation of nearly $4 billion.

Medivation leader's next move. Venture capitalists are investing $275 million in Nuvation Bio Inc., an oncology startup founded by an entrepreneur who previously led cancer-drug maker Medivation Inc. to a $14.3 billion acquisition by Pfizer Inc., WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. David Hung founded and was chief executive of Medivation, which Pfizer acquired in 2016 to secure access to the prostate-cancer treatment Xtandi. Now he is CEO of Nuvation, which formed in 2018 and has raised a Series A financing led by Omega Funds.

Layoffs. Juul Labs Inc. plans to cut roughly 500 jobs by the end of the year, the Journal's Jennifer Maloney reports, citing people familiar with the matter. The move reverses the embattled e-cigarette maker's rapid expansion amid a mysterious vaping-related illness and a proposed ban on flavors that make up more than 80% of its U.S. sales.

More from Vision Fund. Greensill has received a further $655 million investment from SoftBank Vision Fund, which it will use to accelerate the company's international expansion plans and finance acquisitions, Dow Jones Newswires reported.

FreeUp develops technology that enables workers to receive early payment for earned, but unpaid, wages at zero cost to the employee. In the past 14 months, Greensill has raised more than $1.7 billion from investors including General Atlantic and SoftBank Vision Fund, it said.

The company, which raised more than $40 million in financing over the years from backers that include majority shareholder Oak Investment Partners, has cut its workforce to four staffers.

Chernova's Take: Unicorn Shine Starts Coming Off in Job Market

By Yuliya Chernova

For a while, being a newly minted unicorn had a big perk: The startup instantly became more attractive to potential hires.

More such companies, including WeWork, Uber and car-leasing company Fair, are announcing layoffs and face financial struggles, which is starting to affect recruitment and how candidates perceive stock options across the board.

As attitudes shift, highly valued private companies might find it harder to use stock options as a significant part of compensation, observers say. That would complicate their hiring and retention efforts, as well as potentially add costs.

China Presses Ahead On Silicon Valley Deals

By Heather Somerville

Chinese investors are pressing ahead with investments into startups and venture-capital funds, emboldened in part by ambiguities in U.S. efforts to limit foreign access to technology deals.

Key rules for implementing a 2018 U.S. law intended to curb foreign access to sensitive technologies are yet to be defined, often leaving investors and entrepreneurs to determine which deals are permissible. For their part, U.S. tech entrepreneurs want to nurture connections to China.

Investment ties between the two countries thus remain tight despite political and trade tensions, say technology investors, entrepreneurs, attorneys, and current and former government officials.

The sources of Chinese-affiliated money vary widely, as do investors' motivations. Both can be hard to discern.

Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hone Capital was set up in 2015 with about $200 million from China Science and Merchants Investment Management Group, a Chinese private-equity firm known as CSC Group that nearly two years ago was delisted from a Chinese stock exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter and public documents.

Since the law was passed, Hone has continued to invest in the U.S., including in artificial-intelligence startups. Last year, Canadian private-equity firm Whitehorse Liquidity Partners gave Hone about $50 million to invest, people familiar with the matter said.

Hone hasn't received funding from China in more than two years, said founder Veronica Wu. Yet Hone employees still report to CSC Group, which recently emphasized that the long-term strategy is to bring U.S. technology companies to China, the person familiar with the matter said.

Last month, more than 10,000 people flocked to a technology conference in Santa Clara, Calif., an annual gathering of mostly Chinese and U.S. tech workers and investors known as the Silicon Valley Innovation & Entrepreneurship Forum. Speakers included scientists affiliated with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. national labs.

"Some people in Washington want to decouple the two economies. We disagree," Ren Faqiang, China's deputy consul general in San Francisco, told the audience.

The 2018 law expanded the power of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to probe minority investments in critical tech companies through which foreign investors could influence a company's business decisions.

The law mandates that certain startups fundraising from foreign investors report their deals to Cfius for approval, and that Cfius do a better job sniffing out unreported foreign investments in sensitive technologies.

Cfius has broad authority to unwind deals after they have closed if it determines the technology should be restricted, so not reporting a foreign investment can be risky, said William Newsom, an attorney with law firm Cooley LLP.

The law prompted an initial pullback. The amount of Chinese venture investment in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 declined about 27% in dollar terms from the second half of 2018, according to research firm Rhodium Group.

"We were seeing a very conservative approach from investors initially," said Larry Ward, a Cfius attorney with law firm Dorsey & Whitney LLP.

But Cfius appears ill-equipped to police the venture-capital industry, current and former government officials said.

The government also hasn't codified which technologies are off-limits to foreigners, so some startups and investors don't see the need to file with Cfius, Mr. Ward and other lawyers said.

Palo Alto, Calif.-based Amino Capital said it received funding from a local government in eastern China a couple of years ago. The firm, which also manages a venture fund in China, hasn't changed its U.S. investment strategy in response to the Cfius law, said co-founder Jun Wu, who left the firm in August. He said the government phased out its support for Amino, but the firm is still mostly backed by Chinese investors. About 80% of the funding now comes from executives and owners of Chinese businesses seeking to move their money outside China, Mr. Wu said.

Amino managing partner Larry Li said the firm's partners are U.S. citizens and none of its backers have access to private information about startups, nor can they make investment decisions on behalf of the firm.

Last year, Amino incubated and funded DataBeyond, a Palo Alto company that provides data analytics on fashion trends. One of Amino's partners briefly served as its chief executive. The startup's new CEO, Xiaoxi Zhang, and its top technology officer, Adrian Wang, said the relationship provided Amino with more access and influence over the company's business strategy and growth plans than an average investor. They said their lawyer told them they didn't have to alert Cfius.

Some Chinese investors are choosing different tactics, including taking pains to conceal their identity, U.S. defense officials and venture capitalists said. Other Chinese investors have been content to make only passive investments.

"Investment that is purely passive is inherently low-risk from a national security standpoint and in most cases should be welcomed," said David Hanke, a partner at law firm Arent Fox who was the lead staff architect of the Cfius legislation while working for its sponsor, Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas). "We didn't want to shut off the flow of truly benign investment."

"The policies we have put in place have not been all that effective in limiting China's technology ambitions," said Nicholas Eftimiades, a retired senior U.S. intelligence officer whose work has focused on China.

Vc Daily: SoftBank Vision Fund Shifts Focus; Progyny Makes Public Debut; Sequoia's Valentine Dies at 87

Good day. Technology investor Insight Partners announced leading an $11 million Series A round for Fairmarkit, a Boston startup selling software to procurement departments. It's one of at least seven Series A rounds led by Insight this year.

After raising a $6.3 billion growth fund last year, why is the New York-based firm taking a lead on Series A rounds?

"The reality is enterprise-software companies, which Insight focuses on, are raising larger funds later and require a lot of capital as they scale," an Insight spokeswoman said. Venture deals represent about 15% of the firm's portfolio.

Insight isn't alone. Numerous firms that manage large multi-stage funds are continuing or even increasing their activity in early stages, including Series A and seed rounds. This offers investors a chance to get into companies early and avoid being priced out of later stage rounds.

Separately, Insight Partners, which has backed companies such as Twitter Inc. and e-commerce platform Shopify Inc., has set up its first overseas office in Tel Aviv.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Focus on Governance: After suffering billions of dollars of losses on its investment in WeWork, SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund is scaling back its high-risk investing strategy and focusing more on improving corporate governance of portfolio companies.

* Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's chairman and CEO who also runs the Vision Fund, has told staffers at the fund to push the companies in which it owns stakes to generate cash, people familiar with the matter said. A drastic shift from his earlier demands that they spend aggressively to drive sales growth.

* Roughly a dozen of the fund's investment staff have left on their own since spring, many unhappy about what they see as a toxic culture with competing teams, inexperienced investment executives, and poor communication, people familiar with the structure said.

Public debut: Fertility-benefits company Progyny Inc. began trading on the Nasdaq, marking a first for the industry. The startup, which already is profitable, is looking to raise its profile by going public, said Chief Executive David Schlanger. The company began trading under the ticker symbol PGNY on Friday at an opening share price of $13. It closed at $15.94, up 23%.

Pioneer investor: Don Valentine, a pioneer among venture capitalists who struck it rich with investments in companies including Apple Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Oracle Corp. and Atari, died on Friday. He founded Sequoia Capital, and stepped away from its leadership in 1996. Yet the firm still operates in his image: that of a tough-guy investor who instills fear in boardrooms and walks with a swagger.

China's has more unicorns: The number of private startups valued at more than $1 billion in China has just edged ahead of the U.S., according to a report published by Deloitte and research firm China Venture. But that doesn't mean it is easy going for horned horses in the Middle Kingdom funding has been drying up, and exit opportunities are disappearing. Even big corporate investors like Tencent and Alibaba, which have invested in a lot of late-stage startups, have turned more cautious. That means startups have to start figuring out sustainable business models sooner.

Exits

Social-media management platform Sprout Social Inc. publicly disclosed its filing for going public. The S-1 filing revealed that Goldman Sachs owns a 35.5% stake, New Enterprise Associates owns 30.9% and Lightbank holds 21%. WSJ Pro Venture Capital reported last month that the Chicago-based company had submitted a confidential filing for its IPO.

Cabaletta Bio Inc., which is developing a treatment for pemphigus vulgaris, priced its initial public offering of 6.8 million shares of common stock at $11 a share, below the initial price range of $14 to $16 a share. Prior to the offering, 5AM Ventures, Adage Capital Partners and Baker Bros. Advisors each held a 19% stake in Cabaletta, and Boxer Capital and Deerfield Management held 5.5% stakes. The company will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol CABA.

Hub goes live in push towards greater automation of fixed income markets

Intercontinental Exchange has launched a new hub to help create and redeem exchange traded shares. hoping to steal a march on rivals and accelerate a move towards greater automation in fixed income.

The platform went live last week in the US after a year of preparation. It has the backing of industry heavyweights like investment banks JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as well as BlackRock, the world s largest asset manager and one of the biggest ETF providers.

The hub offers a platform to help create and redeem baskets of bonds in ETFs, as well as assemble baskets of fixed income ETFs, a fast-growing sector that has spurred some modernisation of the underlying market. It has already gone live with equity-focused ETFs.

Over the past 25 years, the ETF market has mushroomed to 2,000 US funds with $3.9tn in total net assets at the end of August, according to ICI, an investment trade body, with investors lured in by the ease of trading what were previously complex baskets of securities.

Most ETFs are based in equities, which accounts for about 9 per cent of the US equities market, according to BlackRock. But the investment house also said it believes bond ETF assets will double over the next five years from the current level of about $1tn.

That is a tricky task; governments and companies all have multiple outstanding bonds at various different maturities and backed by diverse sets of rules and regulations. Up to now, bundling them together into tradable units has been a cumbersome process involving manual construction of baskets of bonds.

Portfolio trading in fixed-income ETFs has emerged as way to move large, multibillion dollar blocks of debt quickly between investment banks and asset managers. There were $43bn worth of portfolio trades in 2018 compared to a negligible amount in 2017, BlackRock found.

ICE s new platform is aimed at institutional investors and at brokers creating and redeeming the shares. It will streamline the portfolio trading process further and remove the need to package the underlying securities together manually.

ICE faces competition from some of the industry s biggest providers, such as Bloomberg, MarketAxess and Tradeweb, which has facilitated corporate bond deals worth $21bn in the nine months to September.

Ben Jackson, ICE president, said it had developed its hub following industry pressure for a venue that could standardise the industry s disparate data, analytics and execution protocols. He described the fixed income ETF market, which has had a compound annual growth rate of 30 per cent over the past 10 years, as  red hot .

 What this initiative is all about is how can we create some innovation in that primary trading space to help enable and help support the further growth that we ve seen in the passive investing space,  he said.

The industry is also hoping to benefit from a ruling last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US markets regulator, that will allow more ETF providers to come to market, and far quicker. In the past asset managers had to apply for so-called  exemptive relief  from existing US mutual fund rules, a cumbersome process that took several months.

The first trades on ICE s new platform were in equities. Fixed income is expected to be online before the end of the year. In August, ICE agreed to buy Bank of America s MOVE benchmark indices, which track volatility in fixed income markets.

Merrill Lynch predicts an Aston Martin profit warning and a cash call

Monday 13:00 GMT

What s happening

% HSBC slipped on weaker than expected earnings and a cautious outlook statement that abandoned 2020 targets. Third-quarter adjusted profit before tax was 6 per cent below consensus expectations at $5.35bn as worse than expected revenues and credit losses were only partly offset by better costs.

A deteriorating environment for revenue meant HSBC scrapped a target of delivering at least an 11 per cent return on tangible equity, though consensus forecast had already anticipated the miss.

Management also announced a strategic review due by the time of full-year results, saying parts of the group such as in continental Europe and its UK non-ringfenced bank were not generating returns worth the capital they consumed. The review  could result in significant [goodwill] impairment and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and beyond , said Credit Suisse.

% Cairn Energy slipped on news that a tribunal investigating its long-running dispute with the Indian government over a $1.4bn tax refund was not expected to conclude until summer 2020, between six and nine months later than previously hoped. The oil explorer also announced its first well offshore Mexico was dry.

Morgan Stanley called the tax case  a wild card for Cairn s net asset  with a value of between 0p and 200p a share. On the failure in Mexico, RBC said the prospect  was a key well in an important new basin for Cairn that could have added around 30p per share to our valuation .

Sellside stories

% HSBC upgraded Drax, the power station owner, from  hold  to  buy  with a 360p target price.

The upgrade came after the European Commission last week confirmed that a UK power capacity market scheme complied with EU state rules. The European Court of Justice had ordered the suspension of the capacity market in mid November to review its legality. Companies that missed out on historical payments would be refunded, the UK government said.

 This is a significant reduction in 2019 earnings uncertainty for Drax,  said HSBC. The 75m of 2019 capacity payments due to the company compared with an operating earnings target of about 410m, the broker said. The return of the capacity market would also clear the fog around Drax s expansion plans, in particular whether a new fleet of gas-fired turbines would be economic, it added.

% Merrill Lynch downgraded Aston Martin from  neutral  to  underperform  with a 400p target price. It said to expect a warning from the automaker at third-quarter results, saw longer-term guidance as unachievable and noted that a rights issue was looking inevitable.

Weak near-term demand has hit Aston Martin s profitability and another cut to margin guidance  looks very likely , said Merrill. As well as a tough macroeconomic environment, Merrill cited competition from Porsche s recently relaunched 911 and argued that Aston Martin s DB11 and Vantage cars were  already showing a mid-cycle ageing .

It forecast Aston Martin to deliver a 4.3 per cent earnings before interest and tax margin this year, compared with the company s own guidance of 8 per cent and a consensus expectation of 6.2 per cent. That meant, ahead of Aston Martin s third-quarter results, the broker cut 2020 and 2021 earnings forecasts by up to 50 per cent.

Aston Martin s recent debt sale revealed  significant liquidity issues  with the automaker agreeing an interest rate of about 15 per cent, Merrill said. Another $100m drawdown contingent on securing 1,400 orders for its soon-to-launch DBX model,  is only a temporary fix , added the broker.  Aston may need to raise more equity in 2021. 

Further cash burn expected in the coming years meant Aston Martin s net debt should rise to 1.1bn in 2021, or 3.5 times adjusted trading profit, Merrill said, adding:  With significantly increased leverage, we think the company would not be well positioned for any external shock with close to no more borrowing capacity. 

Trading at an enterprise value of 1.6 times 2020 sales and 15.4 times adjusted earnings, Aston Martin might look cheap versus sector peers such as Ferrari but  much weaker financials and execution  made the comparison wrong, said Merrill.  [With] another tough set of results, significantly higher cash burn and likely very low guidance, when 2020 guidance is first set, the name will see further downgrades,  it said.

% Goldman Sachs downgraded Informa, the publishing and events group, from  neutral  to  sell  with a 723p price target.

Businesses across industries  are facing an inflection point in the mainstream adoption of data analytics tools , said Goldman. Informa s current suite of intelligence and analytics products are  still at an early stage and skewed towards end-markets that are facing their own structural challenges.  Informa therefore requires another investment cycle that will temper margin expansion in the medium term, particularly as the benefit of synergies from its 2018 merger with UBM reduce, Goldman said.

Softer macro conditions and trade tensions also made Goldman  incrementally more negative  on growth from exhibitions, which provided 39 per cent of Informa s total revenue last year. The broker also argued that Informa s high level of debt would hinder its ability to make acquisitions, particularly as it would be competing with private equity players for data and analytics companies.

Technology
Workforce Retrains Itself for Cloud

By Vanessa Fuhrmans

COLUMBUS, Ga. -- Warren Atchley spent more than 30 years working with mainframe databases, technology that many in his field call "the dinosaur." Then, about three years ago, he found out his job risked extinction.

His employer, TSYS, one of the world's biggest processors of credit-card and other cashless payments, was future-proofing its business with a shift away from mainframes to the cloud -- and asked its aging workforce to do the same. Mr. Atchley considers himself an avid learner but was still wary.

As a veteran of the old mainframe team, the 59-year-old Alabama native often gave advice to his manager. Yet in his side role on an early cloud-computing team, he was stumped about how to best connect to Amazon Web Services to do his cloud work. "I had to go to someone who is younger than all of my children and say, 'Can you help me get this done?' " Mr. Atchley said.

From banking to manufacturing, industries are embarking on a digital transformation akin to the Industrial Revolution, but at a much faster speed. Getting the kind of workforce needed to survive in a more automated world will require companies to retrain or replace tens of millions of midcareer workers, labor economists say. People in all sorts of jobs will have to learn new skill sets or risk obsolescence.

"Most of us are going to have to face this rebuilding, revamping, reinventing question -- and at frequent intervals in our careers," said William Kerr, a Harvard Business School professor and co-director of the school's Managing the Future of Work project.

Many companies opt to replace people rather than invest in retraining. Two-thirds of U.S. executives recently surveyed by McKinsey & Co. said they anticipated new technologies would upend the jobs of 25% of their workers over the next several years. More than a third said they would mostly hire new workers with the skills they need.

The trouble is, "you just won't find enough of them," Mr. Kerr said, especially in a labor market already in short supply of emerging high-tech skills such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

That was a problem for TSYS, based in a former textile-mill hub 100 miles southwest of Atlanta. The company's geography, and its lack of a tech brand like an Amazon or Google, made it challenging to recruit the thousands of cloud-skilled workers it would need. So TSYS turned itself into a laboratory for reskilling a workforce en masse.

To retrain its more than 4,500-strong tech staff, or 35% of employees, TSYS had many of them take dozens of hours of online courses. Many also have gone through an immersive two-week digital boot camp, where they use the online training to create a new product or feature.

For nearly a year, Mr. Atchley often arrived at work at 6 a.m. and left around 9 p.m.

He would come home, say a quick hello to his wife, Elaine, who is also a TSYS employee who has retrained, and then sign onto one of the many online courses he was required to take.

Mr. Atchley spent much of a family road trip to New Mexico in the passenger seat, doing coursework on his laptop or his phone while Ms. Atchley drove. His coffee intake, around six cups a day, doubled to 12 on many days in the office. "This is what I need to do to stay in the game," he told his spouse.

Mr. Atchley now works full time in the cloud, helping more recently retrained colleagues learn the ropes. He has since received his certification as an Amazon Web Services solutions architect-associate, which required even more hours of studying.

"I like being out there, learning something someone else might not feel bold enough to try," Mr. Atchley said.

Early on in the process, though, enthusiasm for training wasn't as easy to muster with some of his cohorts. TSYS leaders said they expected hundreds of workers to sign up for one of the first digital boot camps. Fewer than 50 applied. Many veteran employees feared that if they struggled with the training, they would end up with no job, or a pay cut if they were moved into an entry-level cloud-computing position, company officials said.

Some new-product launches for clients were delayed as the first team of retrained engineers had to do their new jobs while also helping retrain the second and third waves of co-workers behind them. Having employees pull double duty, though, meant TSYS spent just $1.5 million a year to reskill.

"This is not easy, going away from what many people here have done for 20-something years," said Patricia Watson, who as TSYS chief information officer spearheaded the retraining effort. "But we knew what we had to do, and it was important that we take our people with us on this journey."

The message she delivered to staff boiled down to this: We're facing the biggest technological shift in our history. We will give you the tools to retrain, but it's up to you to decide and put in the time.

"We've been very transparent, that 'If you still want to do what you're doing, that's OK,' " she said. "Just know that in about five, six years, we plan to be doing something completely different, and there are certain jobs that will go away."

Ms. Watson is leaving the company at the end of October. Last month, more than two years into the retraining, a rival payment-technology provider, Global Payments Inc., bought TSYS for $21.5 billion in an all-stock deal.

The combined company, with dual headquarters in Atlanta and Columbus, aims to cut $300 million in annual costs by 2022. Executives say there is little overlap with the part of the TSYS business that supports card issuers, where much of the retrained technology staff works, and the reskilling will continue.

Darrel Schumm, 63, is among the 9% of the original TSYS tech staff who chose not to retrain. Now a few years away from retiring, he hopes his mainframe job exists until then. He figures that he can add more value keeping the old technology humming while younger colleagues transition to the new.

"I can concentrate on what I'm doing, make sure there are no slip-ups," he said. "The others can progress."

From Woodford to Fisher   fund managers struggle with key-person risk

Investment companies that rely too heavily on stars can come undone when they fall

 Never buy a fund named after someone: [you get a] total failure of risk control,  former Standard Life Aberdeen chairman Gerry Grimstone told the Financial Times this year.

The events of the past few weeks show that Sir Gerry s words were eerily prescient. This month the UK fund industry was rocked by the implosion of Neil Woodford s eponymous investment business. At the same time, investors on the other side of the Atlantic began draining billions of dollars from Fisher Investments in response to controversial remarks made by its billionaire founder, Ken Fisher.

Mr Woodford, who shot to fame for being able to transform 1,000 of investor money into 25,000 over 25 years, met his demise after bad bets and heavy exposure to risky hard-to-sell stocks devastated his performance and sent investors fleeing.

Mr Fisher, who has been the face of Fisher Investments since he founded it in 1979, lost the trust of clients for very different reasons. At a conference in San Francisco this month, the veteran investor was reported as making offensive remarks about women. He compared winning over clients to  trying to get into a girl s pants , according to attendees.

Mr Fisher subsequently apologised, saying that the comments he made were clearly wrong  and that thiskind of language has no place in our company or industry .

But this did not stop large investors redeeming money from Fisher Investments. At the time of reporting, the company has bled more than $2.5bn, losing mandates from clients including Fidelity Investments and several US state pension schemes. A spokeswoman for Iowa s state pension system said Mr Fisher s comments had  damaged the credibility of the firm and its leadership  and may lead to staff turnover, which could have a big impact on investment performance.

The controversy has hit Mr Fisher s reputation and that of the company with which he is synonymous. A regular commentator for the financial press, Mr Fisher was dropped as a contributor by the Financial Times following his remarks.

Unlike the crisis affecting Woodford Investment Management, the incident has not led to Fisher Investments  demise. The sums pulled from Fisher Investments so far represent just a fraction of the $112bn the company managed at the end of June, but are a sizeable chunk of the $10.9bn in assets the company manages for US government clients.

But the events at both companies underline how asset managers can be undone by slip-ups made by key individuals with outsize influence over the company.

 Key person risk  is prevalent in an industry that has long been in thrall to the cult of the star manager.  Neil Woodford and Ken Fisher come from a long line of managers who have gone from hero to zero,  said Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research.

Asset management s past fallen stars include Legg Mason s Bill Miller, Fidelity s Anthony Bolton and Pimco s Bill Gross.

In these situations, former star managers and their organisations often see client assets stream out the door as quickly as they flowed in, while previously gleaming reputations can evaporate. When Mr Gross left Pimco in 2014, his flagship Total Return fund   once the world s largest bond fund   haemorrhaged nearly 25 per cent of its assets due to outflows over the subsequent five years, according to data analytics group Flowspring.

Mr Rajan noted that many of the companies hit by a shock linked to a key individual later managed to reverse the trend of negative flows.  But in each case, key person risk took its toll on the corporate brand and the bottom line alike,  he said.

Some asset managers have learnt lessons from earthquakes such as Mr Gross s exit from Pimco, choosing to move away from promoting individual stars and focusing on developing a more team-focused culture.

But star culture has not been consigned to history yet, said Mr Rajan.  Retail investors in particular [still] like big names to manage their money. 

As the examples of Mr Woodford and Mr Fisher show, companies whose star manager is also their owner or founder can pose a particular problem.In such cases, the dominance and status of this individual can make them  untouchable , preventing colleagues or stakeholders from challenging their behaviour.

Jim McCaughan, former chief executive of Principal Global Investors, the US asset manager, said such companies sometimes have a looser approach to compliance and risk controls, together with adverse traits in culture . He added that investorswho entrust their cash to these companies need to apply greater scrutiny to prevent the emergence of excesses.

Other founder-led investment houses whose flaws have recently been exposed are Carmignac and H2O Asset Management. Investors have fled Edouard Carmignac s eponymous company en masse in recent years after several of the former star s high-conviction bets fell short. Bruno Crastes s H2O, meanwhile, has suffered outflows in response to concerns about its exposure to risky, hard-to-sell assets.

Businesses that revolve around their founder are not inherently dangerous.Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway is often hailed as a positive example of a company centred on its founder. Even in cases where this individual continues to serve as the symbol of the company, key person risk can be mitigated if the founder delegates authority and puts in place a succession plan for when they step down, said Mr Rajan.

For example, Jeffrey Gundlach,DoubleLine Capital s founder, has sought in recent years to prove his outfit is more than a one-man show by entrusting his key lieutenants with more power, while remaining the company s public face.

However, it is impossible to eliminate the threat of a key individual crossing the line completely. As with Mr Gross before him, Mr Fisher became well-known because of his outspoken and eccentric personality. But this personality trait later became a liability for both investors.

In a recent LinkedIn post, Ken Fisher s son excused his father s comments, saying that his  brain is wired differently from most people s and that is part of why he s been successful at what he does . The executive  relates to people differently and doesn't always interpret social cues in conventional ways , said Nathan Fisher.

 Part of the reason that founder-led companies succeed in the first place is because of the strong personality of the founder,  said Tim Wright, partner at PwC.

Mr McCaughan agreed: Confidence is the good side of the coin, arrogance is the bad side. 

For Mr Rajan, this is another sign that the cult of personality in asset management is on its last legs.  The spectacular falls of Neil Woodford and Ken Fisher have shown once again that all that glitters is not gold,  he said.  We are witnessing the last gasp of star culture.

What JetBlue Is Doing in Silicon Valley; The airline started a venture-capital arm to invest in startups looking to bring fresh ideas to air travel

JetBlue Airways Corp. has gotten into a business that is far removed from flying planes: venture capital.

In 2016, JetBlue took an unusual step for an airline: establishing a hub in Silicon Valley to invest in startups that bring fresh ideas to air travel. JetBlue Technology Ventures is working with the startups on technologies for better customer service, a smoother overall travel experience and timely plane maintenance. Since its launch, the venture operation has scanned around 3,000 companies and invested in 28.

The airline sees technology as a way to attract and retain passengers in a market driven by pricing. For instance, the airline is testing a better way of predicting airport weather to help redirect flights and notify customers of possible delays, and personalizing travel by remembering where passengers left off in a movie or show between flights. Another focus is on automating check-in, bag drop and boarding via biometrics, such as facial recognition.

Eash Sundaram, chief technology officer of JetBlue and investment-committee member for the venture operation, spoke to The Wall Street Journal about JetBlue's presence in Silicon Valley and how it fits into the airline's future. Here are edited excerpts.

WSJ: Why does an airline need a presence in Silicon Valley?

MR. SUNDARAM: The speed to market at which new-generation companies are coming in travel, hospitality and tech spaces is super amazing. When you think about the last five to seven years, companies like Airbnb and Uber, even the supercharged growth of Expedia, is happening through the tech space in the valley. We want to have a seat at the table and be the disrupter into the future.

WSJ: Why is JetBlue Technology Ventures a good way to invest in technology as opposed to having your own tech team?

* "https://www.wsj.com/articles/colin-powell-reminisces-about-it-overhaul-at-the-state-department-11571779489"

MR. SUNDARAM: When you think about future-proofing JetBlue, you have your own challenges running a large $8 billion company in terms of the operational and commercial complexity. Innovation has been in our DNA, but the pace at which the innovation is happening today, it makes it incredibly difficult for the mother ship to just put a process in place to evaluate these startups and make sure there are focused teams around ingesting these startups within the company. This venture-capital unit is driving the innovation within JetBlue by bringing products in our portfolio that do not exist now.

WSJ: Are certain innovations crucial to you?

MR. SUNDARAM: One is the way we manage customer experience. It's also very critical for JetBlue to preserve our cost base and manage it better. Maintenance planning not only drives significant cost but also is key to the safety and security of the airline. A lot of advancements in AI and machine learning are changing the way these planes are maintained, how these planes are scheduled.

WSJ: What kind of startups are helping improve the customer experience?

MR. SUNDARAM: Gladly [a customer-service messaging startup in San Francisco] provides a 360-degree view of customer interaction via multiple channels such as voice, chat or text. When a customer contacts us via phone or email or text during the course of booking through the day of travel, the tool consolidates all these communications into one integrated story line. Customers used to call us or chat or send a message it never synchronized together in one single view.

So our customer-support response time to solve a problem is much shorter compared to the past I would say 30% to 40% faster in minutes to close that problem. The savings across tens of thousands of interactions a day is a big deal for us in terms of how efficient that contact center could be. We started rolling this out to customer-support crew members in Salt Lake City about three years ago. Now we're looking at an enterprisewide rollout in the next year or so.

Making the call

WSJ: Are there any interesting ideas you didn't fund?

MR. SUNDARAM: We have said more no than yes. There's a lot more, "It's not the right thing for us, it's not ready for us" than "We made the investment." There are technologies that have come to us that go deeper into customer data. We typically stay away from those kinds of companies. Most companies leverage customer data extensively, and our legal teams are very cautious in terms of how we approach these companies.

WSJ: What's the role of your team in the selection process of the startups and technologies?

MR. SUNDARAM: Shape Security is one of our first unicorns, an investment that we made about two years ago. It's a Silicon Valley-based internet security software company. Security is huge for JetBlue, whether it's physical security or digital security, so we chose to make this investment in this company. My team was involved in early stages investigation of the company, the investment process, but now my team completely manages that relationship along with my presence on the board, as a board observer. And the product has grown dramatically in the last two years into a much larger portfolio of products that we have worked with Shape to co-develop some of the platforms. Being forefront in this development process gives us a significant strategic advantage for us to competitively work with these companies in the future.

WSJ: Can you give an example of addressing plane maintenance with respect to JTV?

MR. SUNDARAM: If you think about the new-generation planes that are coming out, they have an enormous amount of data in their engines and in the cockpit that doesn't come back to the base real time. Think about the diagnostics that you can run while the plane is flying, so that when the plane arrives at the airport, you are ready for any type of fixes that need to be put in place.

We're thinking about companies like Lumo [a JTV investment], where maintenance planning could be better, which can significantly increase [the time that we utilize planes]. Lumo looks at aircraft maintenance systems within JetBlue, and it also takes information from the aircraft and gives us long-range predictive planning scenarios for us as to what we need to look for.

WSJ: Could you talk about new technologies JTV plans to bring to the airline?

MR. SUNDARAM: We have a company called ClimaCell. ClimaCell predicts weather by a few hundred feet. Think about a thunderstorm coming into JFK. ClimaCell uses cell towers to track the transmission from one cell tower to another to monitor precipitation and predict weather to that precise location. It's being tested in a few airports, in parallel to our current systems.

If you can predict weather at an airport to the level of the 15- to 30-minute range, multiple diversions can be prevented, our gates can be much more ready. There's a huge impact to our operations in terms of keeping people safe and secure, but also keeping our customers informed on what's going to happen and how to avoid certain diversions and things like that. It's currently in testing phase. We're working with the FAA on a certification path. These kind of technologies you wouldn't know if you weren't in the valley.

WSJ: Do you make technologies from startups available to other companies? When do you actually take them in?

MR. SUNDARAM: JetBlue Technology Ventures has something called the partnership program. Air New Zealand partners with us where they get access to our entire ecosystem. When it comes to JetBlue making an investment, we promote to our partners to try this out. It gives us a wide range of geographic regions and business models to try their product out versus just having access to JetBlue.

How a Company's Aging Workforce Retrained Itself for the Cloud; We will give you the tools, a company told its tech staff, 'but it's up to you to decide and put in the time'

COLUMBUS, Ga. Warren Atchley, 59, spent more than 30 years working with mainframe databases, technology that many in his field call "the dinosaur." Then, about three years ago, he found out his job risked extinction.

His employer, TSYS, one of the world's biggest processors of credit-card and other cashless payments, was future-proofing its business with a shift away from mainframes to the cloud and asked its aging workforce to do the same. Mr. Atchley considers himself an avid learner but was still wary.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS

Do you feel pressure to upgrade your skills to be relevant in tomorrow's workforce? How is your company helping you retrain? Join the conversation below.

The Alabama native attended a town hall meeting in 2017 with nearly 400 co-workers, many over 45, and asked executives whether he would ever get to use the intense retraining his bosses wanted him to take on.

"Or am I the old sheep dog you're going to take out back and shoot in the head once you've got some young puppies ready?" he said.

From banking to manufacturing, entire industries are embarking on a digital transformation akin to the industrial revolution of the 19th and early 20th centuries, but at a much faster speed. Getting the kind of workforce needed to survive in a more automated world will require companies to retrain or replace tens of millions of midcareer workers, labor economists say. People in all sorts of jobs will have to learn entirely new skill sets or risk obsolescence, even in the autumn of their careers.

"Most of us are going to have to face this rebuilding, revamping, reinventing question and at frequent intervals in our careers," said William Kerr, a Harvard Business School professor and co-director of the school's Managing the Future of Work project.

Many companies opt to replace people rather than invest in retraining. Two-thirds of U.S. executives recently surveyed by McKinsey & Co. said they anticipated new technologies would upend the jobs of 25% of their workers over the next several years. More than a third said they would mostly hire new workers with the skills they need.

The trouble is, "you just won't find enough of them," Mr. Kerr said, especially in a labor market already in short supply of emerging high-tech skills such as cloud-computing and artificial intelligence.

That was a problem for TSYS, based in a former textile-mill hub 100 miles southwest of Atlanta. The company's geography, and its lack of a tech brand like an Amazon or Google, made it challenging to recruit the thousands of cloud-skilled workers it would need. So TSYS turned itself into a laboratory for reskilling a workforce en masse.

To retrain its more than 4,500-strong tech staff, or 35% of employees, TSYS had many of them take dozens of hours of online courses. Many also have gone through an immersive two-week digital boot camp, where they use the online training to create a new product or feature.

Mr. Atchley took an even more intense route. Months after putting his bosses on the spot at the town hall, he was toggling between two jobs, his old one as a senior mainframe expert and a side role on an early cloud-computing team.

For nearly a year, Mr. Atchley often arrived at work at 6 a.m. and left around 9 p.m. After putting in 12- to 15-hour days, he'd come home, say a quick hello to his wife, Elaine, who is also a TSYS employee who has retrained, and then sign onto one of the many online courses he was required to take.

He spent much of a family road trip to New Mexico in the passenger seat, doing coursework on his laptop or his phone while Ms. Atchley drove. His coffee intake, around six cups a day, doubled to 12 on many days in the office.

"This is what I need to do to stay in the game," Mr. Atchley told his spouse.

As a veteran of the old mainframe team, he often gave advice to his manager. Yet in his side gig, he was stumped about how to best connect to Amazon Web Services to do his cloud work. "I had to go to someone who is younger than all of my children and say, 'Can you help me get this done?' " Mr. Atchley said.

Mr. Atchley, an early adapter, made the transition and now works full time in the cloud, helping more recently retrained colleagues learn the ropes. He has since received his certification as an Amazon Web Services solutions architect-associate, which required even more hours of studying.

"I like being out there, learning something someone else might not feel bold enough to try," he said.

Early on in the process, though, enthusiasm for training wasn't as easy to muster with some of his cohorts. TSYS leaders said they expected hundreds of workers to sign up for one of the first digital boot camps; fewer than 50 applied. Many veteran employees feared that if they struggled with the training, they'd end up with no job, or a pay cut if they were moved into an entry-level cloud-computing position, company officials said.

Some new-product launches for clients were delayed as the first team of retrained engineers had to do their new jobs while also helping retrain the second and third waves of co-workers behind them. Having employees pull double duty, though, meant TSYS spent just $1.5 million a year to reskill.

New Jersey mall tests consumer faith in the American Dream

Megacomplex opens following years of delays and to a changed retail landscape

The man-made snow was piling up on the 16-storey indoor ski slope and workers were testing rides at the theme park. These were some of the surest signs that the opening of the American Dream Meadowlands megamall was finally at hand some 16 years after the starcrossed project was initiated on the New Jersey marshlands, just across the river from Manhattan.

We have been here before. "It's been a very difficult process but we're reaching the culmination of all our hard work and efforts," said Don Ghermezian, president of Triple Five Group, the family-owned development company overseeing the project. That was seven years and nearly $3bn ago.

Assuming there are no hitches, the first phase of the American Dream was due to come to life yesterday with a grand ceremony to kick off the opening of its theme park. That will be followed with the christening of North America's largest indoor water park, the ski slopes, and hundreds of shops and restaurants.

Much has changed since the project, originally known as Xanadu, was born in 2003. New Jersey has seen five governors since then. The pastel tiles that prompted one of them, Chris Christie, to call it "the ugliest damn building in New Jersey" have been replaced.

The original developer, Mills Corp, dropped out long ago after running into financial trouble. So did its successor, Colony Capital. Triple Five agreed to take control of the project in 2011.

Above all, the shopping mall, once the mainstay of US retail commerce, is under pressure as never before thanks to the rise of ecommerce. Vacancies in shopping malls hit an eight-year high in the third quarter, according to Reis, a division of Moody's Analytics, with vacancies at their worst level since the financial crisis. As consumers shop online and department stores buckle, many malls are grappling with a glut of space. It would not appear to be the best of times to open a 3m sq ft jumbo mall.

"This was conceived 20 years ago, and the world has changed a lot for retail since then," said a well-respected real estate investor. Another questioned whether any department stores, the traditional anchor tenant for shopping malls, would even exist in 10 years.

Nor do the mall's trio of helipads overcome the challenge of luring shoppers from Manhattan to a traffic-clogged corner of New Jersey. "How do you get a large number of people from Manhattan to this property in an efficient way?" asked Vince Tibone, a retail specialist at Green Street Advisors, a property research group.

Still, the Ghermezians have not lost their faith in American Dream. They pledged as collateral 49 per cent of the two other megamalls they own the West Edmonton Mall in Canada and the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota to secure a $1.67bn construction loan from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to realise their vision.

Their conviction is that so many superlative attractions will make American Dream a destination in its own right. Among them: the world's largest indoor wave pool, with a 1.5m gallon water park and beach heated to 31C, a Nickelodeon theme park featuring the world's steepest rollercoaster, a Lego Discovery centre, a Sea Life aquarium, two miniature golf courses, a kosher food hall, an aviary featuring local birds, a KidZania children's village, a regulation National Hockey League skating rink, and the aforementioned Big Snow indoor ski hill, with two slopes, a chairlift and an Alpine village.

Soon to come is a London Eye-style Ferris wheel with a view of Manhattan and perhaps a luxury hotel. On their way to those activities, guests will be funnelled past luxury shops, including a two-storey Herms. "It is obviously a very unique retail property, to say the least," Mr Tibone said.

The Ghermezians, a family of Iranian Jews, have a history of defying expectations. The family relocated to Montreal in the 1950s and entered the rug trade. They expanded their business until, eventually, they were holding auctions all around the US and Canada, including well-attended sessions at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan.

Drawn by an oil and gas surge in western Canada, the family ploughed their money into thousands of acres of Alberta prairie, opening a mall in 1981 that featured submarine rides and a man-made lagoon. Five years later, after a visit to Minnesota, they set about repeating the trick on an even bigger scale. These days, the Mall of America pulls in more than 40m visitors a year.

"People didn't understand [the concept] and thought it would fail," Mr Ghermezian told Women's Wear Daily in 2012.

American Dream will feature the best of those projects, as well as new baubles for an "interactive" generation. One of the reasons construction was so costly is because the Ghermezians ripped out virtually everything from the nearly finished Xanadu when they took over. But this time the Ghermezians are not building in "middle-of-nowhere Canada", as one observer put it. Rather, they will be competing for visitors in one of the busiest urban areas in the world.

Moreover, New Yorkers and affluent tourists seeking a luxury mall have a brand new palace at the Related Companies' $25bn Hudson Yards on the west side of Manhattan. It had its own grand opening in March.

As if all that were not enough, American Dream is in New Jersey's Bergen County, where trading regulations do not permit Sunday shopping.

"It's so big and there's just no infrastructure to make it work," one rival developer said of American Dream's prospects. But, knowing the Ghermezians, he could not bring himself to bet against them: "They have a tremendous will not to fail."

'This was conceived 20 years ago, and the world has changed a lot for retail since then'

Reporter's Notebook: Goldman Executive on How to Drive Machine-Learning  Projects; Charles Elkan, Goldman's head of machine learning , offers insights learned at the bank and at Amazon

Companies that want to succeed in artificial intelligence should think big, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive told an audience at this week's AI World conference in Boston.

Charles Elkan, managing director and global head of machine learning at Goldman, is tasked in part with applying AI techniques to commercial opportunities.

Today, few AI projects succeed. A "https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/winning-with-ai/" by MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group showed that nine of 10 executives said they have made some investment in the technology, yet fewer than two of five reported any business gain from their AI efforts in the past three years. The report is based on a survey of more than 2,500 executives.

Mr. Elkan, who headed Amazon.com Inc.'s machine-learning team from 2014 to 2018 before joining Goldman, leads the bank's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/large-companies-centralize-ai-resources-11549620001", established in March 2018. This year, Goldman launched "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-rolls-out-new-etfs-focused-on-artificial-intelligence-11551978432" that rely on indexes built with artificial intelligence.

At the Boston event, Mr. Elkan offered the audience a number of insights from AI projects he worked on at Amazon and Goldman.

Here are edited excerpts of his remarks.

On the big picture: "You want to start with a big opportunity. Our biggest win [at Amazon] was several billion dollars in revenue, which translates to maybe $100 million in profit because the retail business is actually a relatively low-margin business. How do we get a win of several billion dollars in revenue? We improve a business that already has several tens of billions of dollars in revenue. There's no secret there: Start with something big and then, if you can improve it, you get a big improvement."

On project managers: "What I've learned is that you really need a project manager. And if there's a small project, maybe you don't need somebody who's designated as a project manager, you just need somebody who acts as a product manager. So when I interview someone for my team, I'm always trying to figure out: Is this somebody who can be their own product manager?

A product manager is the voice of the user when talking to the developers and the voice of the developer when talking to the users. You need to be realistic when talking to users or customers, and you need to be imaginative also.  Here's this technology, we can do something cool with it. Would that be useful to you?' The developers should always be thinking about the customer, asking:  What we're building, is it useful to the customer?'"

On metrics: "[One] of the things that a product manager does is quantify the size of the business opportunity. When developing machine-learning applications, figure out exactly what metrics should be maximized.

Just as an example, something my team worked on at Amazon was video recommendations. Product recommendations are a pretty mature field at Amazon, but video recommendations are more open-ended.

So what do we try and optimize when we do video recommendations? One idea was, we wanted to maximize the number of minutes that people watch movies and TV shows. But, actually, that's really not a good objective if you already have someone who's watching 200 minutes a day, then it's probably not beneficial for anyone to drive them from 200 minutes to 300 minutes per day.

What we really wanted is customers who weren't watching videos to start watching videos. So we actually spent a long time going back and forth trying to figure out the right metric for that. We ended up on something like the number of weekly active users. So if someone is watching video at least once a week, they're a good customer. And if they're not watching video at least once a week, then they're a less good customer.

The number of weekly active users is much closer to the metric that we wanted to maximize than the number of minutes watched. A product manager needs to take the lead in figuring out what you are actually trying to achieve."

Happy Friday! It's the most wonderful time of the year here in the land of Salem witches and Edgar Allen Poe. In other words, Halloween week is coming! This year, I'm thinking of getting a fake lobster claw and hot gluing it to the back of a T-shirt so I could go as a "clawback." But I fear, only you, dear readers, could appreciate that one.

This morning's top news is less scary than it is disturbing. As Simon Clark and Will Louch report for The Wall Street Journal, federal prosecutors are investigating whether Arif Naqvi, the founder of bankrupt private-equity firm Abraaj Group, bribed senior politicians in Pakistan. Mr. Naqvi, who was arrested in London after U.S. prosecuters indicted him on fraud charges, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Stay tuned for more of this unfolding saga.

In other news, Carlyle Group has collected billions of euros for its latest European fund, and bankrupt retailer Barneys New York is moving closer to selling its assets and brands to private equity-backed Authentic Brands Group and investment firm B. Riley Finanical.

Today's Top Stories

U.S. Investigating Whether Ex-Abraaj Chief Bribed Pakistani Politicians

Federal prosecutors are investigating whether the founder of the bankrupt private-equity firm Abraaj Group bribed senior politicians in Pakistan, The Wall Street Journal's Simon Clark and WSJ Pro's William Louch report, citing people familiar with the matter. Arif Naqvi was arrested by U.K. police in London in April after U.S. prosecutors indicted him on charges of fraud. Prosecutors later added racketeering charges against Mr. Naqvi, who has repeatedly denied the allegations. The prosecutors in New York also added accusations of paying bribes to Pakistani politicians. Part of their current investigation focuses on an alleged bribe they suspect may have been paid via an intermediary to former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shehbaz in 2016, the people said.

Carlyle Raises  6.4 Billion for Latest European Buyout Fund

Carlyle Group LP collected  6.4 billion ($7.1 billion) for its fifth Europe-focused buyout fund, which closed almost  1 billion above its target, the private-equity firm said Thursday. Carlyle Europe Partners V LP brought in commitments from more than 300 investors in 37 countries, the firm said. The new vehicle is roughly 70% larger than the firm's previous Europe-focused fund, which closed in 2015 at its  3.75 billion hard cap with 140 investors. A person familiar with the firm's plans said in 2017 that its fifth Europe-focused fund would target  5 billion.

Barneys Moves Forward on Sale to Authentic Brands Group

Barneys New York Inc. is moving forward with the sale of its brand and assets to a licensing company, but the bankrupt retailer hasn't completely shut the door on a rival bidder that would keep its stores open. A lawyer for the luxury retailer, which filed for chapter 11 protection in August, said Barneys will cancel an auction next Monday after no other qualified bidders emerged to challenge a $271 million offer from Authentic Brands Group LLC and investment firm B. Riley Financial Inc.

Virgin Australia Aims to Sell $425 Million in Notes for Velocity Buyback

Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd., the operator of Australia's second-largest airline, plans to sell $425 million in five-year notes to fund the repurchase of a 35% interest in its Velocity frequent-flyer program from Asia-focused private-equity firm Affinity Equity Partners. In a news release, Virgin Australia said it plans to raise more cash with an Australian dollar-denominated offering. The company also said it had obtained a necessary approval for the transaction from the country's Foreign Investment Review Board. The airline sold the minority share to Affinity in 2014 for about 335 Australian dollars ($228 million), Reuters reported last month, when it said the carrier was expected to pay A$700 million to buy it back.

BC Partners-backed waste-management company GFL Environmental Inc. has filed for an initial public offering of shares, saying it could raise as much as $2.11 billion at the $22 a share midpoint of the offering price range. BC Partners controls about 52% of the Vaughan, Ont.-based company's equity, alongside the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Singapore's GIC sovereign-wealth fund. None of those entities plans to sell any of its shares in the offering, registration documents show.

Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. has agreed to acquire a $50 million stake in publicly traded NextDecade Corp., through a private placement of stock. The investment at $6.27 a share is expected to help the company's efforts to construct its Rio Grande liquefied natural gas shipping terminal to export output from Permian Basin wells in Texas and New Mexico. The LNG facility under development is in Brownsville, Texas. The company is also developing a pipeline to carry gas from the Aqua Dulce area to the Brownsville plant. NextDecade shares closed Wednesday at $6.25 in New York and were little changed Thursday to close at $6.26.

H.I.G. Capital's European arm has agreed to acquire Meyra Group SA and Alu Rehab A/S and intends to combine the companies to form a larger producer of wheelchairs, orthopedic devices and other mobility aids. The companies have manufacturing operations in Germany, Poland, Norway, Denmark and China.

Vance Street Capital has acquired Eirtech Aviation Services through a recapitalization of the Shannon, Ireland-based company. Founders Niall Cunningham and Gerry O'Shea, who have led the business since its founding in 2009, will retain ownership positions in the provider of design, engineering and compliance services to airlines and aircraft leasing operations. David Kerr will lead the business as deputy chief executive.

HCAP Partners has invested in Lone Star Analysis, a Dallas-based provider of predictive data analytics and analysis software for operations in a variety of industries, from transportation logistics to aerospace and defense. The company expects to use the investment for product development and increasing its market reach.

Tiger Global Management has led a $15 million investment in business software provider Ally Inc. Participants in the Series B financing round also included previous investors Accel, Vulcan Capital and Founders Co-op. The Bellevue, Wash.-based software maker's products are used to enhance performance of businesses including Facebook and Nike. The startup, launched last year, said it had received $8 million through a Series A fundraising in July.

Funds

BC Partners has paid out $2.5 billion to investors from its ninth flagship fund after making its biggest exit with the  3.25 billion ($3.61 billion) sale of Antelliq, Barrons reported, citing a person close to the situation. The U.S.-European buyout firm led by Chairman Raymond Svider returned the cash from its BC European Fund IX, which closed in 2016, raising  7 billion. BC declined to comment. Europe-focused private-equity funds distributed $43 billion to investors in this year's first quarter, according to data from Preqin Ltd. That compares with $152 billion distributed in all of last year.

Private-equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners is forming a minority equity partnership with Stonyrock Partners, a new private-investment firm backed by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. Stonyrock, led by veterans of buyout firms Blackstone Group Inc. and Carlyle Group LP, targets investments in midsize alternative-asset managers. Craig Schortzmann, previously a managing director with Blackstone's Strategic Capital Holdings Fund, and Sean Gallary, formerly a Carlyle managing director and head of partnership strategy, set up Stonyrock earlier this year in partnership with Leucadia Asset Management, a unit of Jefferies.

People

Halifax Group has hired Doug Hill as a partner, helping to lead sourcing, evaluation and execution of investments. He joined from Nautic Partners, where he was a managing director, and previously worked for H.I.G. Capital and Bain & Co. In addition to hiring Mr. Hill, Halifax promoted David Calder to principal from vice president.

General Atlantic has hired Kell Reilly as a managing director. Based in Palo Alto, Calif., he will focus on the technology sector. Mr. Reilly joins the New York growth-equity firm from D1 Capital Partners, where he was co-head of technology, media and telecommunications.

KKR & Co.'s Frances Lim has returned to New York to lead portfolio management and asset allocation for the firm's strategic partnerships, the firm said Thursday. Ms. Lim spent the previous five years leading Asian macro efforts. Before joining KKR, Ms. Lim was a vice president with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Growth-oriented private-equity firm Sorenson Capital has promoted Burke Davis to principal. He focuses on high-growth software companies and joined the firm in 2014 from Samsung NEXT, where he was a senior financial analyst.

Industry News

Private-equity investments outperformed all other asset classes in Harvard University's endowment for the fiscal year that ended June 30, Harvard Management Co. said in its annual review. The company oversees investments of the school's $40.9 billion endowment. Private equity returned 16% for the year, compared with 9.3% for real estate, 5.9% for public equity and 5.5% for hedge funds. While bonds fared better than hedge funds, returning 5.9%, natural resources and other real assets fell 12.4% and 8.3%, respectively.

Noting the substantial outperformance of private-equity investments, which included the endowment's commitments to venture-capital funds, Harvard Management Chief Executive N.P. "Narv" Narvekar said the endowment's venture investments are "notably small" compared with peers. Greater exposure to the sector "would have resulted in a significantly higher return" this year, he added. "Our central concern is that HMC's allocation to buyouts, growth, and venture capital continues to be low relative to what likely makes sense for Harvard," he said. The endowment's target allocation to private equity is 20%.

Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc. won court approval Thursday for a bankruptcy plan that ousts owner Ronald Perelman and puts senior lenders in control of the video services company. With the decision, the implementation of the plan will install Sound Point Capital Management, CION Investments, CIFC Asset Management and Invesco Ltd. as the Los Angeles-based company's major owners.

Wall Street Democrats are fretting among themselves at work meetings, cocktail gatherings and industry events about the success of Elizabeth Warren, the 2020 presidential candidate who has spent her long academic and more recent political career calling for tighter financial regulation. Interviews with dozens of Democrat-supporting bankers, lawyers and others in New York's finance sector revealed growing anxiety and a sense of powerlessness about the Massachusetts senator, who is now one of the front-runners in national and early state polls. Some may hop on the anybody-but-Warren train, while others may simply abstain from voting if she becomes her party's candidate next year.

The Wall Street Journal digs into the fall of WeWork and its quixotic founder Adam Neumann, a cliff dive that has little precedent, even in the boom-and-bust world of venture capital.

Insurance Startup Young Alfred Raises $10 Million in Early-Stage Funding; The New York company bucks a trend as more venture capital for insurtech has shifted to late-stage investments

Young Alfred Inc., a New York startup that helps consumers shop for insurance, has raised $10 million in early-stage funding, when the overwhelming majority of venture investment in insurance startups is going to more mature businesses.

Young Alfred is an insurance agency with a website where consumers can shop for homeowners' and other types of insurance. It now works with more than 30 insurance carriers, including long-established providers such as Progressive and newer digital carriers like Lemonade and Hippo.

Google-backed Gradient Ventures led the Series A round. But, initially, finding investors wasn't easy despite the company's fast business growth, co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer David Stasie said. Many venture firms had already invested in other insurance-technology startups and didn't want to take on another bet in the space, he said.

Indeed, venture capital in insurtech is gravitating to late-stage rounds. More than $1 billion was allocated to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-insurance-raises-250-million-from-munich-re-11570442400" through the third quarter, representing 81% of the total invested in the sector in that period, up from 44% in all of 2018, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones & Co.

The number of late-stage insurance deals is likewise growing, representing 40% of the sector's 30 deals done through Sept. 30, the data show. That is compared with about 26% of the 34 deals done in all of 2018.

Zach Bratun-Glennon, who led the Young Alfred deal as a partner for Gradient, said it was his third early-stage deal in the insurtech sector in recent months. He acknowledged that "we are not at the beginning of the wave" of insurtech startups raising capital, but said there are many opportunities to invest early.

"It's a pretty rich space for applied machine learning," Mr. Bratun-Glennon said. "With data you can augment and improve multiple aspects of the insurance business," such as underwriting, risk management, the claims process and customer acquisition.

The new financing will help Young Alfred form partnerships with online home-buying companies, mortgage providers and other real-estate players who are eager to add insurance-shopping as a service, said Jason Christiansen, the startup's other co-founder and co-CEO.

Messrs. Stasie and Christiansen met as students at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where their pitch for Young Alfred failed at every school startup competition in which they participated. Despite the rocky start, they founded the startup in 2016 and raised $2.35 million in seed funding.

Young Alfred now has sent more than 50,000 quotes to potential customers and sold more than 7,000 policies, according to its founders. The company is selling $10 million in premiums annually, they said.

Shopping for insurance is often a bad experience for customers, the co-founders said. Unlike some other players, Young Alfred doesn't resell customer information and is able to keep transactions entirely digital by providing binding offers. Insurers pay the company a commission for each policy it sells.

Existing investors Pear Ventures, Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator and Newfund Capital returned for the company's new round.

VC Daily: Insurance-Tech Startup Bucks Late-Stage Shift; The Fall of WeWork; Fair Plans Layoffs

Good day. Insurance technology has become a hot area for venture investors. That is particularly true at the later stages, where more than $1 billion has been invested this year in insurtech. But Google-backed Gradient Ventures is still interested in backing early-stage startups in the sector. Much more below.

Plus, read on for another jaw-dropping yarn from The Wall Street Journal on the company formerly known as WeWork. It involves surfing in the Maldives, the heads of Nasdaq and NYSE putting in their best offer for We's IPO business, John Legend and even a dispute over the type of recycled paper the S-1 would be printed on.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Young Alfred Inc., a New York startup that helps consumers shop for insurance, has raised $10 million in early-stage funding, at a time when the majority of venture investment in insurance startups is going to more mature businesses, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports exclusively.

* Young Alfred is an insurance agency with a website where consumers can shop for homeowners' and other types of insurance. It now works with more than 30 insurance carriers, including long-established providers such as Progressive and newer digital carriers like Lemonade and Hippo.

* Google-backed Gradient Ventures led the Series A round. But, initially, finding investors wasn't easy despite the company's fast business growth, co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer David Stasie said. Many venture firms already had invested in other insurance-technology startups and didn't want to take on another bet in the space, he said.

* Indeed, venture capital in insurtech is gravitating to late-stage rounds. More than $1 billion was allocated to late-stage U.S. insurance startups through the third quarter, representing 81% of the total invested in the sector in that period, up from 44% in all of 2018, according to VentureSource.

We story. The story of how $40 billion was lost, as WeWork's valuation plunged from $47 billion in January to less than $8 billion this week. The cliff dive by WeWork and its quixotic founder has little precedent, even in the boom-and-bust world of startups. It's especially stark given Mr. Neumann's boundless ambitions: He said WeWork's mission was to "elevate the world's consciousness" and he told people he hoped to be its first trillionaire. Little had changed in WeWork's business between the Hamptons audition and the company's bailout by SoftBank Group Corp. But by filing to go public, WeWork put its inner workings on display.

Layoffs in store. Fair, the online car-leasing startup, is the latest company backed by SoftBank Group Corp. to announce sweeping layoffs as it struggles to find a path to profitability, the Journal's Heather Somerville reports. The Santa Monica, Calif., business will shed about 40% of its workforce, a company spokeswoman said Thursday. The cuts are equal to close to 300 people, said a person with knowledge of the matter.

Gallant, which provides a stem-cell bank for dogs, acquired the veterinary division of Cook-Regentec for an undisclosed amount. Los Angeles-based Gallant has raised a total of $11 million in funding from investors including Maveron, Bold Capital Partners, Bling Capital and Science Inc.

Publicly traded Cision said that Falcon.io, its social-media management division, acquired social media marketing insights provider Unmetric Inc. for an undisclosed sum. The New York-based company was backed by investors including Jafco Asia and Nexus Venture Partners.

Educational software provider PowerSchool, which is backed by private-equity firm Onex Corp., agreed to purchase Schoology Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The New York-based company offers a K-12 learning management system, and counts JMI Equity, FirstMark Capital and Intel Capital as backers.

America s craziest shopping mall finally opens after 20 years

The retail landscape has darkened but will consumers come along for the rides?

The man-made snow was piling up on the 16-storey indoor ski slope and workers were testing whizzing rides at the theme park.

These were some of the surest signs that the opening of the American Dream Meadowlands megamall was finally at hand some 16 years after the star-crossed project was initiated on the New Jersey marshlands, just across the river from Manhattan.

We have been here before.  It s been a very difficult process but we re reaching the culmination of all our hard work and efforts,  Don Ghermezian, the president of Triple Five Group, the family-owned development company overseeing the project, told a reporter.

That was seven years and nearly $3bn ago.

Assuming there are no last-minute hitches, the first phase of the American Dream will come to life this Friday with a grand ceremony to kick off the opening of its theme park. That will be followed in the months to come with the christening of North America s largest indoor water park, the ski slopes and then hundreds of shops and restaurants.

Much has changed since the project, originally known as Xanadu, was born in 2003. New Jersey has seen five governors since then. The pastel tiles that prompted one of them, Chris Christie, to call it  the ugliest damn building in New Jersey  have been replaced. The original developer, Mills Corp, dropped out long ago after running into financial trouble. So did its successor, Colony Capital. Triple Five agreed to take control of the project in 2011.

Above all, the shopping mall, once the mainstay of American retail commerce, is under pressure as never before thanks to the rise of ecommerce. Vacancies in US shopping malls hit an eight-year high in the third quarter, according to Reis, a division of Moody s Analytics, with vacancies at their worst level since the financial crisis. As consumers shop online and department stores buckle, many malls are grappling with a glut of space. It would not appear to be the best of times to open a 3m-square-foot jumbo mall.

 This was conceived 20 years ago, and the world has changed a lot for retail since then,  said a well-respected real estate investor. Another questioned whether any department stores, the traditional anchor tenant for shopping malls, would even exist in 10 years.

Nor do the mall s trio of helipads overcome the challenge of luring shoppers from Manhattan to a traffic-clogged corner of New Jersey.  How do you get a large number of people from Manhattan to this property in an efficient way?  asked Vince Tibone, a retail specialist at Green Street Advisors, a property research group.

Still, the Ghermezians have not lost their faith in American Dream. They pledged as collateral 49 per cent of the two other megamalls they own   the West Edmonton Mall in Canada and the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota   to secure a $1.67bn construction loan from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to realise their vision.

Their conviction is that so many superlative attractions will make American Dream a destination in its own right. Among them: the world s largest indoor wave pool, with a 1.5m gallon water park and beach heated year-round to 87-degrees Fahrenheit, a Nickelodeon theme park featuring the world s steepest rollercoaster, a Lego Discovery centre, a Sea Life aquarium, two 18-hole miniature golf courses, a kosher food hall, an aviary featuring local birds, a KidZania children s village, a regulation National Hockey League skating rink, and the aforementioned Big Snow indoor ski hill, with two slopes, a chairlift and an Alpine village serving hot chocolate.

 We re thinking a lot of people will do ski vacation prep there,  a guide explained during a recent tour.

Soon to come is a London Eye-style Ferris wheel with a view of Manhattan and perhaps a luxury hotel. On their way to those activities, guests will be funnelled past luxury shops, including a two-storey Hermes.

 It is obviously a very unique retail property, to say the least,  Mr Tibone observed.

The Ghermezians, a family of Iranian Jews, have a history of defying expectations. The family relocated to Montreal in the late 1950s and entered the rug trade. They quickly expanded their business until, eventually, they were holding auctions all around the US and Canada, including well-attended sessions at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan. (A New YorkTimes reporter who observed one in 1976 described Mr Ghermezian s uncle, Nader, as  mesmerising audiences of up to 800 with his glib chatter and entertaining chant .)

Drawn by an oil and gas surge in western Canada, the family ploughed their money into thousands of acres of Alberta prairie, eventually opening a mall in 1981 that featured submarine rides and a man-made lagoon. Five years later, after a visit to Minnesota, they set about repeating the trick on an even bigger scale. These days, the Mall of America pulls in more than 40m visitors a year.

 People didn t understand [the concept] and thought it would fail,  Mr Ghermezian told Women s Wear Daily in 2012.

American Dream will feature the best of those projects, as well as new baubles for an  interactive  generation. One of the reasons construction was so costly is because the Ghermezians ripped out virtually everything from the nearly finished Xanadu when they took over.

But this time the Ghermezians are not building in  middle-of-nowhere Canada , as one observer put it. Rather, they will be competing for visitors in one of the busiest urban areas in the world.

Moreover, New Yorkers and affluent tourists seeking a luxury mall have a brand new palace at the Related Companies  $25bn Hudson Yards on the west side of Manhattan. It had its own grand opening in March.

As if all that were not enough, American Dream is in New Jersey s Bergen County, where trading regulations   known as  blue laws    do not permit Sunday shopping.

 It s so big and there s just no infrastructure to make it work,  one rival developer said of American Dream s prospects. But, knowing the Ghermezians, he could not bring himself to bet against them:  They have a tremendous will not to fail.

Researchers Find Racial Bias in Hospital Algorithm; Healthier white patients were ranked the same as sicker black patients, according to study published in the journal Science

Black patients were less likely than white patients to get extra medical help, despite being sicker, when an algorithm used by a large hospital chose who got the additional attention, according to a new study underscoring the risks as technology gains a foothold in medicine.

Hospitals use the algorithm from Optum, UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s health-services arm to find patients with diabetes, heart disease and other chronic ailments who could benefit from having health-care workers monitor their overall health, manage their prescriptions and juggle doctor visits, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Science.

Yet the algorithm gave healthier white patients the same ranking as black patients who had one more chronic illness as well as poorer laboratory results and vital signs.

The reason? The algorithm used cost to rank patients, and researchers found health-care spending for black patients was less than for white patients with similar medical conditions.

"What the algorithm is doing is letting healthier white patients cut in line ahead of sicker black patients," said Dr. Ziad Obermeyer, the study's lead author and an acting associate professor of health policy at the University of California, Berkeley.

Optum advises its customers that its predictive algorithms shouldn't replace physician judgment, a company spokesman said. Efforts to use analytics in health care have only scratched the surface of their potential and should be continually reviewed and refined, he said.

Optum's algorithm is used by more than 50 organizations, according the company's website. Partners Healthcare in Boston is among those to have used it, according to published research. A Partners spokesman said the hospital system is vigilant about how well its algorithms perform. He added a Partners researcher co-authored the paper, which "is an important step in rooting out some of the flaws that exist."

The Washington Post and Science News earlier reported Optum is the algorithm's developer.

Algorithms, developed by computers crunching vast data sets, are increasingly shaping choices in medicine, from interpreting medical scans to "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2018/12/13/cignas-algorithms-aim-to-predict-opioid-abuse/?mod=article_inline", suffer a dangerous fall or "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-algorithm-aims-to-identify-at-risk-kidney-injury-patients-11564592448".

The technology can speed up and improve some decisions, leading to better treatment for patients, supporters say. But doctors who get suggestions to tweak their patients' care based on the findings of algorithms often don't know the details of the technology that led to the recommendation.

Poorly designed algorithms risk reinforcing racial and gender biases, technology experts caution, as studies of algorithms in nonmedical settings like credit scoring, hiring and policing have found.

Algorithms "can give the gloss of being very data-driven, when in fact there are a lot of subjective decisions that go into setting up the problem in the first place," said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor at Cornell University who is also a principal researcher at Microsoft Research.

Researchers behind the study said well-designed algorithms could help reduce bias that leads to wide disparities in health-care outcomes and access to care. They created an alternative algorithm that increased the percentage of those identified for extra help who were black to about 47%, up from 18%.

"It's a tool that can do a great deal of good and a great deal of bad, it merely depends on how we use the tool," said Sendhil Mullainathan, a University of Chicago computational science professor who was an author of the study.

Hospitals and health insurers across the U.S. use the Optum algorithm to spot patients who could benefit from extra help from nurses, pharmacists and case workers, the authors of the study said.

To identify those with the biggest medical needs, the algorithm looks at patients' medical histories and how much was spent treating them, and then predicts who is likely to have the highest costs in the future.

For the study, data-science researchers looked at the assessments made by one hospital's use of the algorithm. The study didn't name the hospital. The researchers focused on the algorithm's rankings of 6,079 patients who identified themselves as black in the hospital's records, and 43,539 who identified as white and didn't identify themselves as any other race or ethnicity.

Then the researchers assessed the health needs of the same set of patients using their medical records, laboratory results and vital signs, and developed a different algorithm.

Using that data, the researchers found that black patients were sicker than white patients who had a similar predicted cost. Among those rated the highest priority by the hospital's algorithm, black patients had 4.8 chronic diseases compared with 3.8 of the conditions among white patients.

The researchers found the number of black patients eligible for fast-track enrollment in the program more than doubled by prioritizing patients based on their number of chronic conditions, rather than ranking them based on cost.

The findings show "how a seemingly benign choice of label (that is, health cost) initiates a process with potentially life-threatening results," Ruha Benjamin, author of "Race After Technology" and an associate African-American studies professor at Princeton University, said in an accompanying commentary in Science.

Algorithms are playing an increasing role in medicine, though largely invisible to patients.

Doctors are using algorithms to read scans for lung cancer, for instance. Hospitals are deploying the technology to spot which critically ill patients are likely to worsen dramatically. Meantime, health insurers are using algorithms for reasons including to detect patients who are at risk of opioid addiction or who appear headed toward costly lower-back surgery.

Alan Muney, a former executive at health insurer Cigna Corp., said it is common for insurers to use the projected cost of care as a focus in selecting who might get extra outreach or support.

"It's troubling there was such a big difference" in the effects for black and white patients based on an algorithm focused on cost, he said.

Insurers are developing algorithms that include variables beyond medical costs, including issues that might signal barriers to accessing care, such as financial stress and food insecurity, he said.
