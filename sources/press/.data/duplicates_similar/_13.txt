Alibaba conceives online solution to sperm shortage; China: Fertility

Ecommerce group's marketing savvy helps increase donations

Alibaba has used the internet to revolutionise the country's retail, banking and transport markets, and now China's ecommerce juggernaut has turned its attentions to curing a shortage of sperm.

Amid spiralling infertility rates, sperm banks across China have been running dry. Both worsening environmental conditions and hectic work schedules have taken their toll on male fertility in China, experts say.

According to a 2012 study by the China Population Association, a state agency, 12.5 per cent of Chinese couples are infertile, or roughly 40m-50m.

Enter Alibaba, whose Groupon-like website Juhuasuan markets everything from underwear to insurance. The ecommerce group's move into boosting sperm donation features a big banner advertisement boasting a phallic cartoon candle exploding into a white cloud, bearing the Chinese character for "semen" in bold lettering.

"Avid concentration" the ad reads, with a pun on the character jing , which in Chinese means both "mind" and "sperm".

During the donation drive, Alibaba offered men payments of up to $800 for successful sperm donations.

Posted between July 15-17, the banner ads produced 22,000 new registrants for the seven participating provincial sperm banks, equivalent to nearly a year's worth of traffic for some of the centres.

"This exceeded all expectations," said Wang Zhiqiang, director of the state sperm bank for Guanxi province. "On average, we get about 300 donors a year, but during the three days of the Juhuasuan event, more than 1,000 people signed up. Assuming 20 per cent of them donate, that it 200 new donors."

The serious mismatch in supply and demand for sperm has prompted donation centres to overcome many taboos in tradition-bound China. In April, the shortage had become so dire in Hubei province that the regional sperm bank turned to Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, to broadcast: "Under-achievers! This is your opportunity! Hubei Sperm Bank is badly in need of sperm," it said.

The shortage of sperm donations is partly due to stringent requirements for donors - roughly one in five are acceptable - but mainly because men in China have "shyness about such topics", according to Mr Wang.

"We mainly try to get recruits by passing out flyers and holding awareness seminars, but we do not get enough qualified men," he said.

But Alibaba has made a speciality out of taking dysfunctional markets and overcoming everything from supply bottlenecks to onerous government regulations and low demand. It has done so in areas such as finance and taxis.

Matching sellers with the masses of online traffic is the company's speciality, usually combining with a bit of fun, marketing savvy, big data, and most importantly in the case of sperm donation, anonymity.

"People feel shy and embarrassed when we meet them face to face," said Mr Wang.

But he said that marketing via the internet added a layer of privacy that makes previously forbidden topics acceptable.

"Online, when they don't have to face a human being, they are more comfortable, and this is a major reason why this project is a success," he said, adding: "We don't know whether they will actually come in or not."

Markets
Moody s Earnings Buoyed by Strong U.S. Debt Market; Domestic performance helps offset weakness in Europe

Moody's Corp. reported better-than-expected results on Friday, as its ratings business rides a strong U.S. debt market to offset weakness in Europe.

U.S. revenue for its Moody's Investors Service unit, fueled by demand by corporate borrowers to pay for mergers and acquisitions, rose 17% during its second quarter. Its European ratings business slumped 17%, though the market is starting to rebound after a Greek bailout deal was struck this month, said Chief Financial Officer Linda S. Huber.

 The headline here is broadly divergent conditions between the U.S., which is quite strong, and Europe, which is a good deal weaker," said Ms. Huber on the company's earnings call.

U.S. investment-grade debt issuance had been expected to decline at the beginning of the year. But five of the first seven months of the year have hit record levels of issuance, Ms. Huber said. Full-year levels should hit $1.25 trillion, an increase of 15% from the prior year, she added.

Moody's, the world's No. 2 ratings firm by revenue and total number of ratings issued after Standard's & Poor's Ratings Services, gets paid by borrowers and banks to grade the credit risk of their debt deals. Ratings firms benefit when bond markets are active.

In the latest quarter, the company's ratings unit, its biggest revenue driver, saw a 2.2% uptick in revenue to $639.2 million. The U.S. total was also boosted by a 20% rise in structured finance, which includes complex bond deals made up of residential and commercial real-estate loans.

In the analytics division, which provides financial data and other types of market intelligence to investors and banks, revenue grew by 12% to $278.9 million. The division was helped by last year's acquisition of Lewtan Technologies. More of the company's overall revenues are derived from this analytics division.

In all, Moody's reported a profit of $261.7 million, or $1.28 a share, down from $319.2 million, or $1.48 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 5.1% to $918.1 million, or 10% excluding negative currency effects.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters projected earnings of $1.22 a share and revenue of $897.4 million.

U.S. revenue across all of Moody's business units grew 18% to $545.9 million, while foreign revenue fell 10% to $372.2 million.

Investors rely on the bond grades issued by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. Collectively, they issue about 95% of ratings globally a total virtually unchanged from before the financial crisis.

The company backed its full-year outlook for between $4.55 a share and $4.65 a share in earnings.

The  mixed issuance trends had tempered expectations heading into the quarter, so these results should be viewed positively," said Timothy McHugh, an analyst for William Blair & Co., in a Friday note to investors.

The U.S. growth pace is unlikely to be sustainable, though overseas growth should improve as  uncertainty related to the credit crisis in Greece eases," Mr. McHugh said.

MANSION --- Spread Sheet: Floods and Fires: What Insurers Pay --- An analysis of fire- and water-related insurance claims looks at payouts to affluent homeowners in the country's ritziest neighborhoods

JD Montgomery wanted a home near the water, not one underwater.

Early one morning in 2012, he woke up to discover the first floor of his Newport Coast, Calif., home covered in several inches of water -- the result of a burst pipe under the kitchen sink. The flood led to a six-figure insurance claim and an 11-week hotel stay for Mr. Montgomery, his wife, and their four children.

A six-figure payout is no surprise in coastal California, one of the most expensive real-estate markets in the country. In 2014, the average loss per claim was 82% higher in the country's 100 priciest ZIP Codes compared with overall claims in their respective states, according to the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE), a database of insurance-claims information maintained by LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a data and analytics provider.

For the analysis, Spread Sheet first looked at the 100 postal codes with the highest median home values, based on data from real-estate website Zillow. Then CLUE extracted insurance-claim totals from these ZIP Codes and compared them to statewide claim amounts.

In pricey ZIP Codes, water damage like burst pipes, overflowing washing machines and faulty faucets (as opposed to weather-related damage) accounted for 35.1% of all insurance claims filed in 2014. The average payment to these high-end homeowners was $16,224 in 2014, according to CLUE. In the states where these ZIP Codes are, the percentage of overall claims that were water related is similar: 31.2%. But the average payout was less than half as large, at $7,929.

Separately, fire-related damage accounted for only 2.3% of the claims filed in pricey areas. But these claims had the highest payouts, an average $119,424 per claim. That is 120% higher than the average amount paid out to all homeowners in their corresponding states, the CLUE data show.

Insurance experts say expensive homes aren't just bigger: They're filled with costly, custom fixtures and furnishings, some of which costs more to replace than install.

After his plumbing mishap, Mr. Montgomery, a 49-year-old adviser to family offices, replaced his French limestone floors with hand-chiseled stone and commissioned a new silk rug after an attempt to restore the water-damaged rug failed.

Another big-ticket item is relocation costs, because insurers typically find equivalent lodging for homeowners in areas where real estate is already expensive, says Gary Stephen of PURE, a White Plains, N.Y.-based insurer that focuses on the high-net-worth marketplace.

"We spend quite a bit of time trying to find a home that would most closely replicate the lifestyle that the [homeowners] enjoyed prior to the loss," he says.

At 78, He's Starting a Hedge Fund

George Zweig discovered the quark at age 26, assisted with a covert military operation during the Vietnam War and helped design one of the first cochlear hearing implants.

Now, at 78, he is starting a hedge fund.

"I've still got it," said the wiry, white-bearded physicist as he leaned back in a chair in a Midtown Manhattan conference room. Mr. Zweig said he accepted this new challenge as he nears his ninth decade because "life can be very boring" without work.

While many people his age already have retired, Mr. Zweig is hunting for office space in Manhattan and asking for investor commitments to Signition LP, the quantitative hedge fund he and two younger partners, 40-year-old Shane Haas and 49-year-old Ravi Chander, plan to launch late this year. Signition is a play on words including "signal" and "recognition."

"Quants" use mathematical analysis to find patterns in market data over a period of years, and Signition intends to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and trade thousands of stocks simultaneously in markets around the world using software that turns vast amounts of data into visual form. The aim is to find hidden patterns that can predict stock movements.

It is Mr. Zweig's first foray into the hedge-fund world since leaving the famously secretive and profitable quantitative hedge-fund firm Renaissance Technologies LLC in 2010. He agreed when he left not to compete against Renaissance for four years.

Mr. Zweig is trying to become one of the oldest-ever upstarts in an industry where many founders are in their 30s and 40s, the hours are long and the chances of startup success are low. More than 1,000 hedge funds opened last year, according to research-firm HFR, while 864 closed.

Launching a new hedge fund is the latest of multiple reinventions for Mr. Zweig, born in Moscow to Jewish parents who emigrated to the U.S. shortly before World War II.

He grew up in Detroit and earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the California Institute of Technology.

Work he and another scientist conducted independently of each other suggested that protons and neutrons are made up of smaller particles known as "quarks." The 1964 finding was initially dismissed by other scientists. but quarks have since come to be known as a fundamental building block of matter.

Mr. Zweig later migrated to government and academic projects that involved the search for signals amid noise.

He was one of a handful of academics to propose a system designed to stop the flow of troops and materials from North to South Vietnam by creating an electronic barrier consisting of sensors and mines. He eventually left the project amid his opposition to the war.

While teaching at CalTech he helped invent the algorithm that underpins cochlear hearing implants, electronic devices that can provide a sense of sound to the deaf. He also founded a company that leased software to the National Security Agency.

Mr. Zweig first turned to hedge funds as an investor while amassing a nest egg for his disabled daughter. In 2003, he interviewed for a job with East Setauket, N.Y.-based Renaissance, founded by former Cold War code breaker James Simons. Renaissance has achieved near-mythical status for the performance of its Medallion fund, which has averaged returns of more than 35% a year since the late 1980s through 2010.

After seven years at Renaissance, where he said he developed a system that allowed the firm to trade certain instruments for the first time, Mr. Zweig signed the noncompete agreement with Renaissance. Renaissance declined to comment.

The day after Mr. Zweig's agreement expired in 2014, Mr. Haas, an old acquaintance, pitched him on starting a fund reliant on quantitative strategies, they said. Mr. Haas earlier was part of such a group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., trading Goldman's own money as part of a "proprietary trading" desk.

Many such funds lost significant amounts in August 2007 as they sought to sell similar investments at the same time, but some have bounced back in recent years even as the larger hedge-fund industry has trailed total returns of the S&P 500.

Recently, established firms like Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management and Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates have been increasing the size of their quantitative teams or adding to their artificial-intelligence efforts.

Signition's founders aim to begin trading later this year. They declined to comment on whether any investor money had been committed yet but said they aren't using any ideas confidential to Renaissance or any of their prior employers at Signition.

"It's a fantastic challenge," Mr. Zweig said, of trying to create new quant strategies from scratch and finding order from the numbers and chaos in the markets.

Mr. Zweig acknowledged another motivation: He wants to keep working as a way of honoring those in his generation who didn't survive World War II. "It's a kind of survivor's guilt," he said. "I was fortunate enough to be given this opportunity to work, so I feel a special responsibility to not waste it."

Letters to the Editor
Patients' Health-Care Cost Squeeze

In "ObamaCare's Prices Will Keep Surging" (op-ed July 17), Stephen T. Parente warns of increasing premiums. Higher premiums leave less money to spend on the other "unintended" consequences of ObamaCare plans: higher deductibles, copays and coinsurance. The combination of growing premiums (currently about $25,000 for a family of four), plus thousands of dollars of out-of-pocket costs, has put patients, especially the middle class, who don't receive any subsidies, in a difficult situation. Supporters say that patients (now called consumers) have a choice on where to spend their health-care dollars. The evidence (according to Truven Health Analytics), however, is clear that patients with high-deductible plans have lower utilization rates and are less likely to receive care for professional visits, lab services and existing chronic conditions.

My physician colleagues are experiencing higher appointment-cancellation rates and patients not following up on ordered tests due to these costs. Physicians must sometimes choose between ordering an indicated test or delaying it due to the patient's wishes. Unpaid accounts for deductibles, copays and coinsurance are creating difficulties for office and hospital billers, which subsequently may cause further deterioration of the physician-patient relationship. Patients trying to save on costs are coming into doctors' offices equipped with Internet-based medical knowledge, spending valuable office time on diagnoses and treatments unrelated to their condition. This new concept of consumer-driven health care may save money, just not for consumers and not without consequences.

Fed's Capital Rules Aim To Force Banks to Shrink

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve sent a message to the largest U.S. financial firms: Staying big is going to cost you.

The Fed's warning, articulated in a pair of rules it finalized Monday, is among the central bank's starkest postcrisis regulatory moves pressing Wall Street banks to reconsider their size and appetite for risk.

The Fed completed one rule stating that the eight largest banks in the country should maintain an additional layer of capital to protect against losses, its plainest effort yet to encourage them to shrink. At the same time, it offered a reprieve to General Electric Co.'s finance unit from more-intensive regulation, after the company promised to cut its assets by more than half.

The moves reinforce the central mandate of the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law signed by President Barack Obama five years ago.

Regulators have pushed big banks to expand their capital buffers to better absorb losses, reduce their reliance on volatile forms of funding, improve their risk management and cut back on risky assets. "Stress tests" measure banks' resilience each year and can restrict shareholder payouts at firms that don't pass.

For Wall Street banks and their investors, the emerging policy presents a series of choices: specifically whether to pay the cost of new regulation, which will fall to the bottom line, or change their business models by shedding businesses or withdrawing from certain markets, such as owning commodities.

The Fed "clearly intends the very largest U.S. banks to buckle under this new capital regime, restructuring quickly and dramatically," said Karen Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, a policy-analysis firm.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank with assets of $2.449 trillion, will have to maintain more capital than any of its peers, with its minimum capital requirement raised by 4.5% of assets under management as a result of the new rule. J.P. Morgan has resisted calls from lawmakers and others to break up its operations, and instead has jettisoned or adjusted businesses to comply with the new mandates.

"Everything's doable; it just costs money," said Glenn Schorr, a banking-industry analyst with Evercore ISI, the research arm of investment bank Evercore Group LLC. Mr. Schorr said banks could hold less capital but would have to cut parts of their business.

Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, before voting to approve the new measure, said financial firms must "bear the costs that their failure would impose on others." She offered banks the choice of maintaining more capital to reduce the chance they would fail or get smaller and reduce the harm their failure would have on the financial system.

These kinds of restrictions on banks have prompted worries about unintended consequences, such as volatility in financial markets that some ascribe to banks being less willing to take on risk.

The Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group representing big banks, said the new capital rule adopted Monday will push banks to curtail lending. "Regulators should reasonably address risk, but this rule will keep billions of dollars out of the economy," said Tim Pawlenty, the group's president.

Unclear is how far regulators intend to push the biggest banks. Ms. Yellen and other officials left open the possibility that the capital rule finished Monday would be incorporated into the central bank's annual stress tests, a significant move that would make it harder to meet the test's targets without further changes to the banks' balance sheets.

Both Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have shed nearly one-quarter of their assets since 2007, cutting capital-intensive trading activities that no longer produce the profits that justify their costs. In Goldman's case, the firm has also sold ancillary businesses that don't fit into its long-term plans, such as insurance.

J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon has defended the bank's scale, citing its good returns and high customer satisfaction. "We still want that pre-eminent position, and we're not going to give that up for anyone," he said at J.P. Morgan's investor day in February. A J.P. Morgan spokesman on Monday said the bank is analyzing the rule.

Still, in 2014 the bank stopped operating about a dozen businesses, including physical commodities and student-lending origination. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that J.P. Morgan would begin charging large institutional customers fees for certain deposits, citing rules that make holding money for some clients too costly. Retail deposits weren't affected.

The other seven large banks covered by the new rule, including Citigroup Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., must maintain additional capital buffers of between 1% and 3.5%, the Fed said.

Already, firms have taken steps ahead of the Fed's move, issuing billions of dollars in preferred shares and long-term debt, beefing up capital by retaining earnings and bolstering profits from businesses considered safer, such as wealth and asset management.

"We're not capital short," James Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, said during a conference call on Monday before the Fed's final rule was released. "If anything, we're capital heavy."

Of the eight big banks, only J.P. Morgan doesn't have enough capital to meet the rule, which comes into full effect in 2019. The bank has a $12.5 billion shortfall, according to Fed officials. J.P. Morgan executives have said they believe they can cut businesses and take other actions to meet the deadline.

The size of each bank's additional capital requirement is tailored to the firm's relative riskiness, as measured by the Fed's formula, which considers factors such as size, entanglements with other firms and internal complexity. As those factors shrink or grow, so will a bank's surcharge.

In a sign of the central bank's preferences, on Monday it delayed until 2018 tough rules that would have fallen on GE Capital in 2017, giving the GE unit time to carry out its wind-down plan. GE Capital was under scrutiny because U.S. regulators in 2013 judged its failure could hurt the broader U.S. economy and designated it "systemically important," a label created under Dodd-Frank that brings stricter oversight to such firms from the Fed.

GE since said it planned to shed the very qualities -- and assets -- that made the finance unit subject to oversight in the first place. No company has been able to lose the label of "systemically important," and the Fed didn't promise GE would be able to, either. GE said Monday it was "grateful" for the Fed's action.

Mutual Funds at the Forefront of Puerto Rico Talks

Hedge funds are known as heavy buyers of Puerto Rico bonds, but as the U.S. commonwealth works to restructure about $72 billion in debt, it is a pair of mutual-fund firms that may take the lead in negotiations.

OppenheimerFunds Inc. and Franklin Advisers Inc. together owned about $10.8 billion face amount of bonds, representing 15% of Puerto Rico's debt, as of March 31, according to The Wall Street Journal's analysis of data from Morningstar Inc. Franklin has experience pushing aggressively to pare losses in restructurings, and the two firms' large stakes will give them added clout with Puerto Rico.

For more than a decade, Oppenheimer and Franklin packed Puerto Rico bonds into their municipal-bond funds because they pay high interest rates, wagering the commonwealth wouldn't default. The bonds' prices have fallen more than 30% since July 2013, amid fears that declining tax revenue would sap the government's ability to honor its debts.

Oppenheimer and Franklin have held on to most of their investments, in part because they own too many bonds to sell them all without depressing prices further. Franklin also is involved in a similar showdown with Ukraine over about $7 billion of bonds it bought that the war-torn European country says it can no longer pay.

"We have been managing investments in Puerto Rico for more than 20 years and remain steadfast in serving the long-term interests of our shareholders," a spokeswoman for OppenheimerFunds said. A spokeswoman for Franklin declined to comment.

The firms' outsize role in Puerto Rico reflects the growth of mutual funds since the financial crisis as individual investors hungry for yield piled in. Some firms have put this flood of money into large concentrated investments they can't quickly exit if prices fall. Franklin's assets under management have risen 40% to $880 billion in March from $523 billion at the end of 2009.

Rochester, N.Y.-based Oppenheimer owned about $7.4 billion in face amount of Puerto Rico bonds as of March 31, virtually unchanged from its exposure in June 2013. San Mateo, Calif.-based Franklin managed to cut its holdings by 35%, to $3.4 billion, from $5.2 billion over the same period.

Their largest investments are in bonds known by their Spanish acronym, Cofina, which are backed by tax revenue. The firms together owned $4.1 billion, or 27%, of outstanding Cofina bonds as of March, according to Morningstar data. The sum includes zero-coupon bonds, which are difficult to value.

Hedge funds have dominated trading of Puerto Rico bonds since the jitters of summer 2013 led many individual investors and mutual funds to sell out. Firms with expertise trading distressed debt, like Brigade Capital Management, Perry Capital and Stone Lion Capital, were among the largest buyers of the bonds.

Low default rates in corporate debt have led such distressed-debt specialists to instead focus on cash-strapped governments like Greece, Argentina and Puerto Rico. But while prices of Greek and Argentine bonds bottomed out at less than 20 cents on the dollar at the height of their debt crises, much of Puerto Rico's debt still trades between 50 and 70 cents, according to MSRB data. That means the hedge funds will need to recover more in a Puerto Rico restructuring than speculators in the Greek and Argentine defaults did to turn a profit.

Further complicating matters, Oppenheimer and Franklin paid much more for their bonds, which traded close to 100 cents on the dollar before 2013, than the hedge funds, meaning they will be less likely to accept a lower recovery than hedge funds might agree to.

"They're going to play an enormous role," said Robert Donahue, managing director at Municipal Market Analytics, a research firm in Concord, Mass. "To show any retreat now would be very surprising." Because Puerto Rico is neither a U.S. state nor a sovereign nation, the restructuring process is uncertain. All states are barred from filing for bankruptcy but state agencies and cities, such as Detroit, can seek protection under chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.

Puerto Rico is lobbying Congress for a law allowing some of its entities to file for bankruptcy protection. Unless such a law passes, the island's leaders must negotiate with creditors without the chapter 9 process.

"Things can get messy among creditors and different groups of creditors quickly," said David Hammer, executive vice president and municipal bond portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co.

Warning signs from the commonwealth have grown since Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla called for talks with creditors last month. The Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico announced plans early this month to attempt to exchange its old bonds at deep discounts for cash or new bonds.

Thanks to the rise of online shopping, counting and analysing the behaviour of visitors to physical shops is not the business it used to be.

Experian, the data company best known for its credit checking services, has sold Footfall, its well known division that tracks shop visits, to Tyco, a company that provides similar products, for 39m.

The UK group has owned Footfall since 2005, when it "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8b26ef2a-7d8f-11da-875c-0000779e2340.html" for what was believed to be 30m to 40m.

The business counts and analyses shoppers for retailers and mall operators, providing what it calls "intelligence" on aspects such as how long people stand in line and how the weather affects sales. It achieved $39m of revenues last year.

Experian's chief executive Brian Cassin said:

One of our key strategic priorities is to focus on our larger businesses and geographies, where we can most successfully combine our core strengths in data, analytics, software and expertise. Executing on this strategy, we concluded that FootFall lies outside our core strategy.

ECB easing raises fears on house price bubble; Monetary policy

Researchers say Germany, Norway and UK are most at risk from very low rates

The European Central Bank's quantitative easing programme risks fuelling house price bubbles across several European countries, according to research, as investors seeking higher returns pour cash into real estate.

Germany, Norway and the UK were judged most at risk as ultra-low interest rates and bond yields had made real estate look attractive by comparison, fuelling rapid house price growth in those countries, a report by Moody'sAnalytics said.

Anna Zabrodzka, the report's author, said that rising prices and the ECB's  ¬60bn-a-month asset-buying programme had caused "the risk of house price bubbles" to "resurface".

"While bond markets have experienced a correction and yields on German sovereign debt climbed recently, they are still extraordinarily low," she said.

"This has encouraged investment in the property market, which yields a higher return."

Since 2010 average house prices in Norway had risen by over 30 per cent, in Germany by nearly 25 per cent and in the UK by nearly 15 per cent, Moody'sAnalytics found. The rises were buoyed by rapid growth in cities such as Oslo, Munich and London, where properties were "becoming increasingly overvalued", it added.

Lucian Cook, director of residential research at property advisers Savills, said that "cash has become a much greater driver of house prices" across Europe in recent years because of low interest rates and weak returns on other asset classes.

The search for yield has also pushed a surge of money into the commercial property market over the past couple of years, sparking fears of a separate bubble. In 2014 global commercial property prices and yields hit levels last seen before the financial crisis, research published earlier this year showed.

The Bundesbank warned in late 2013 that average German house prices could be overvalued by as much as 10 per cent, and by 20 per cent in some cities. Moody'sAnalytics said this was "also evident in London and Oslo".

The greatest risk of a bubble lay in Norway, the researchers said. Concern had been mounting there for some time.

In 2012, the International Monetary Fund lowered the country's growth forecast, blaming rapid house price growth.

Earlier this year Norway's financial supervisory authority said that falling interest rates were pushing the country's housing market into an upward spiral but, despite this, the Norwegian central bank has continued to cut interest rates in a bid to prop up the economy in the face of low oil prices.

Germany's housing market has long had a reputation for being stable, with little if any price growth. Unlike most other large European economies it avoided a housing market slump after the global financial crisis.

But since 2009 prices there have been rising steadily because of Germany's reputation as an economic haven.

"Growing demand for German properties is leading to overvaluation, especially given the insufficient supply," Moody'sAnalytics reported. Construction had now begun to pick up but "it will take a few years before supply catches up to demand".

Although the Bank of England has halted its own quantitative easing programme, British house prices are still growing strongly. They rose by 5.7 per cent in the year to May.

This growth rate has slowed somewhat. In the same period the previous year prices rose by 10.4 per cent.

Last year the BoE introduced tougher mortgage lending rules and warned that a possible resurgence in the country's pre-credit crunch house price boom risked derailing Britain's economic recovery.

But Moody'sAnalytics said that loan standards in Britain were "still relatively loose", primarily because of the government's Help to Buy scheme, which subsidises home purchases.

In particular, the number of mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios has risen sharply since the programme was introduced in 2013.

The Conservative party's election victory in May "should unleash pent-up demand for residential properties" in Britain, Ms Zabrodzka said, meaning that the moderation in the rate of growth in recent months was not likely to last.

Real Estate
Condos Left Behind in Housing Rebound; Developers build few new units as demand is hit by post-crisis rules on condo mortgages

By Kris Hudson

California developer Intracorp Cos. built thousands of condominiums from 2002 to 2008. Since then, it has built none, opting for rental apartments and single-family homes even though they can be less profitable.

 I see demand for condos, because in California people want to live in urban environments," said Intracorp President Peter Lauener.  But there are constraints on getting off the ground at every turn."

With the housing market in its fourth year of recovery, construction of single-family homes and multifamily rentals is rebounding.

Not so for condo construction, which has been slammed by tough rules on condo mortgages enacted after the housing bust as well as stronger demand among young people for rentals and tight lending conditions for builders.

In the first quarter, condo construction accounted for just 5.5% of all construction of multifamily housing in the U.S. That was the lowest ratio since the Commerce Department started tracking the figures in 1974, and far below the 24% average.

That poses a dilemma for developers, who often reap better returns from building condos than from rental apartments. That is because condo prices are far more responsive to market moves than rents are, so in a strong market a developer can sell out of condos at rising prices faster than it would take to lease up an entire apartment building and sell it.

While there is strong demand now from investors for apartment buildings, condos still can offer better returns, said Peter Bazeli, senior vice president at the Weitzman Group, a real-estate consulting firm in New York.

 Many developers would rather be building condominiums," said Mr. Bazeli.  With condos, you're paying down debt with every closing and then putting money in your pocket right away."

Condos also play a critical role in the broader housing market. While some are bought by investors and second-home buyers, many serve as entry-level housing for young buyers, who use them to start building equity they can use toward later home purchases. The National Association of Home Builders estimates that first-time home buyers will account for just 18% of new-home purchases this year, well below the 27% rate logged in the more normal market of 2001 to 2003.

To be sure, the condo markets have come back strong in certain cities, such as New York and Miami, thanks in large part to affluent and foreign buyers who can pay for most of their condos' price in cash. The dropoff in construction has mostly taken place in the rest of the U.S. for projects targeted more at middle- and lower-income buyers.

Since the downturn, condo prices have lagged those of single-family homes in bouncing back. The median condo resale price in May, $216,400, remains $15,400 less than its pre-downturn peak set in June 2005, without adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, the median resale price for single-family homes in May, $230,300, is only $600 less than its pre-downturn peak set in July 2006.

Without a robust condo market, builders are left with fewer profit levers to push. Economists warn the current drought could reverberate through the housing market long into the future.

 Delays in homeownership mean less wealth accumulation for these households, given that housing is the primary source of wealth for most middle-class households," said Robert Dietz, an economist at the home-builder association.

The building slump comes after years of overbuilding and speculative flipping led to a historic bust. Foreclosure rates on condos hit a high of 5.2% in late 2010 and early 2011, the highest rate since CoreLogic Inc. began tracking the figures in 2000.

As a result, the Federal Housing Administration, which backs mortgages made to low-wealth buyers, tightened its lending standards in a series of moves from 2008 to 2012. Under the new rules, in order for the FHA to insure mortgages in a given condo complex, at least half of the units must be owner-occupied and no more than half can be FHA-insured, among other requirements. For condo projects under development, at least 30% of units must be under contract for sale before the FHA will start backing mortgages there. Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tightened their standards as well.

Some observers worry the stricter rules are constraining buying.  All of these things were undertaken during the throes of the crisis," said Steve O'Connor, senior vice president of public policy and industry relations for the Mortgage Bankers Association.  At that time, we supported many of these changes. But the environment has changed."

An FHA representative said the agency continually reviews its guidelines in light of changing market conditions.

Other factors have hindered the condo market. On the entry-level end, tepid job growth early in the recovery and the younger generation's affinity for flexibility have fueled demand for rentals. Apartment rents are up nearly 16% since 2010, according to Reis Inc.

Investors have shown a preference for rentals as well. Thomas Baum, president of multifamily developer Bozzuto Homes Inc. in Greenbelt, Md., said rising rents and scant vacancies have prompted investors to pay lofty prices for apartments. There were $113 billion in apartment-complex deals last year, the most since research firm Real Capital Analytics started tracking the market in 2000. Deal volume in this year's first half was 37% greater than the same period last year.

Another obstacle cited by developers: construction loans. Matt Allen, chief operating officer of the Related Group, a developer based in Miami, said he can get a construction loan for roughly 75% of the cost of building an apartment complex. But lenders will cover only 50%, on average, of a condo complex's cost because of the greater risk, he said.

Some developers now see hints of a condo revival on the horizon. Rising apartment rents provide renters more reason to buy instead of renting. Job growth is improving for young would-be buyers. And real-estate lobbyists say they are making inroads in Washington to build support for easing the FHA restrictions on condo mortgages.

Meanwhile, builders are adapting. In Chicago, Alan Lev's Belgravia Group has shifted to building smaller condo buildings with 40 to 60 units rather than the larger projects of several hundred units that it built before the downturn. Because young people aren't buying, he outfits his complexes with two- and three-bedroom units tailored to slightly older, better-heeled buyers.

For condo construction to revive,  the millennials need to start buying," Mr. Lev said.

Bangalore steps out of the world s back-office

Sitting in an open-air restaurant just round the corner from his home in Bangalore s start-up hub of Koramangala, Nandan Nilekani is full of beans. The billionaire co-founder of outsourcing giant Infosys remains perhaps the most recognisable face of India s technology sector. But having stepped down from the company in 2009, and following an abortive foray into politics last year, he now seems to be revelling in a new role as elder statesman of the city s flourishing internet scene   and Bangalore s re-emergence as a globally significant tech hub.

 Even start-ups that launch somewhere else are moving here,  he says with enthusiasm, painting a picture of Koramangala, in the south-east of the city, crawling with new online businesses, all pursued by eager foreign investors.  There are more start-ups here, more VC [venture capital] money here, that virtuous cycle is in full spate,  he says.  These entrepreneurs are very young, very ambitious, changing the world kind of people 	. 	. 	. 	And where I live is the epicentre, so it is good fun. 

Bangalore has long been synonymous with India s rise as a technology power, housing myriad giant outsourcers, call centres and high-end research facilities for western multinationals. But over the past year this teeming southern city of 10m has enjoyed what some dub a  second coming , amid rising excitement over the country s mushrooming internet economy.

Koramangala is a major tech cluster, but there are others, notably Whitefield and a group of business parks on the city s Outer Ring Road.  You see this second coming all around you,  says Naveen Tewari, the founder of "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7f69cc6c-df03-11e0-9af3-00144feabdc0.html", a fast-growing mobile advertising start-up that competes with Google and Facebook, and boasts a valuation above $1bn.  The number of ventures, the amount of money, the pace at which things are happening. Every space is being disrupted. 

That word    disruption    comes up quickly in discussions with Bangalore s buzzy tech entrepreneurs. It is a Silicon Valley clich. Even so, the notion that start-ups in cities such as Bangalore might shake-up large swaths of India s economy is far from fanciful, especially given the dilapidated condition of sectors from retail to urban transit.

Koramangala s quiet, leafy streets hide India s most potent collection of technological talent, beginning with ecommerce champion Flipkart. Founded in a nearby bedroom in 2007, the company is scrapping with Amazon for domination of the country s fragmented online shopping scene. Flipkart s next funding round could value the group at close to $15bn.

Taxi-hailing app Ola is just round the corner. On the fourth floor of an office building, dozens of young workers cram on to tiny desks two-at-a-time, hammering away at laptops and ignoring the various beanbags and table football game. With backing from SoftBank of Japan and a valuation north of $2bn, Ola is presently outrunning US-based Uber in India s booming ride-hailing sector.

These companies are just two of the neighbourhood s start-ups, which also include local language news aggregator NewsHunt and online health group Practo. Venture groups cluster here too, from local Helion Venture Partners to larger US-based players like Accel Partners.  Companies like Ola and others in Bangalore are definitely on the radar in Silicon Valley,  says former Vodafone chief executive Arun Sarin, who recently joined the taxi-hailing group s board. Mohandas Pai, a local entrepreneur and angel investor, says:  A tsunami is brewing here, one that will end up washing around the world. 

Bangalore s second coming stems from three main factors. The first is rising internet use, especially over mobile phones. India has roughly 150m smartphones users. But that could rise to around 750m by 2020, making it comfortably the world s second most populous online economy, after China.

Money is the second factor. Not long ago, big name Silicon Valley venture capitalists were packing up their Indian offices, complaining of regulations and infrastructure. Those that remained, however, are investing with renewed vigour. A new generation of funders has also turned up, from Asian giants like SoftBank and Alibaba to New York-based investor Tiger Global. Half a dozen secretive hedge funds are pitching in, many flush with cash from China s internet boom. All this pushed Bangalore up to fifth in the league of global technology investment by city last year, according to Crunchbase.

The effects of this influx are visible: roadside adverts are dominated by start-ups.  All this money means even small companies can compete with Google on salary,  says Anshul Rai, co-founder of Happay, a local mobile payments group.  If you are in Starbucks, you can assume half the conversations are about setting up a start-up, and the other half are about hiring. 

The people holding these conversations provide the third reason for Bangalore s renaissance. The city has one of the world s richest pools of coding talent, lagging behind only Silicon Valley, according to Vivek Prakash, co-founder of HackerEarth, a local software developers network. Many of those launching new ventures began their careers in Indian software groups, or the local offices of tech multinationals such as IBM or Google. This has helped strengthen the calibre of Indian entrepreneurs notes Subrata Mitra of Accel Partners.  That is a big shift, the people now are bolder and have better exposure. 

Bangalore s new tech scene stretches beyond ecommerce, to include cloud-based software groups like Freshdesk or social analytics venture Frrole. More familiar internet names play a role too. Twitter is planning a new research and development centre in the city. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, is setting one up too, along with more traditional companies including Britain s Rolls-Royce. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs is building its largest office outside New York, housing sophisticated software development and back office support.

Perhaps more than anything, though, is the ambition permeating Bangalore s new tech scene, one that is based on a rejection of the country s heritage as a hub for outsourced software development.  Some of those IT services entrepreneurs are respected, but the outsourcing companies they built are not,  says Sharad Sharma, co-founder of Indian technology think-tank iSpirt.  Many of the new guys resent the fact that for this older generation of companies, the nirvana was to be the back office of the world. They think India should dream bigger. They want to take over the world.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Asset management stuck in digital ice age; THE BIG PICTURE

The industry is concerned about the effect of technology, but its pace of change is glacial, says Sophia Grene

Ask anyone about asset management's progress towards a digital world and the response is likely to contain the word "glacial".

Although the industry is concerned about the disruptive and transformational potential of technology, it has yet to do very much about it, in particular with respect to sales and distribution.

"There is a lot of talk, but little action. Change comes at a glacial pace," says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the consultancy that published a report on this topic in February.

The fear is of disruption in the same way iTunes disrupted the music business or of an Amazon-style incomer, a new participant that has none of the legacy issues slowing down the incumbents. The success of Chinese asset manager Yu'E Bao , the money-market arm of Alibaba , the ecommerce giant, that has gathered assets of more than $90bn in just two years is the example causing anxiety for traditional asset managers.

That panic may be overdone. "It owes more to its status as an unregulated shadow bank than a digital superstar," says Mr Rajan. "This status allows it to offer [a return of] around 5 per cent - nearly twice the rate offered by regulated banks - and instant liquidity."

But even if there is no long-term threat from the likes of Alibaba, the asset management industry cannot ignore the changing environment.

"We talk about things happening at two speeds," says Neil Curham, executive director at Alpha Financial Markets Consulting. "First, we are seeing speedy changes because it is happening to the world we live in [with regards to improving processing time and efficiency; using big data; using social media for public relations]. More slowly, we are working with clients on more transformational change."

One such client is Woodford Investment Management , the company set up by star manager Neil Woodford. It is using digital technology to keep investors engaged and costs low. As well as internet and social media marketing and sales, it has been using chat and business-process management tools to enable growth without adding to its headcount or costs.

"Based on this transparency and efficiency, their digital business model has enabled them to offer a new charging model for the Patient Capital Trust, with fees only applied once minimum performance returns of 10 per cent a year have been achieved," says Mr Curham.

While it is impossible to forecast the precise shape of transformational change, just as there is no such thing as an expected shock to markets, Mr Curham believes he can identify the areas asset managers should focus on to create an advantage in a digital world.

These are transparency, frictionless servicing and interaction with the customer through channels where layers of intermediation have been set aside.

An example of this comes from the Netherlands. Robeco, the Dutch investment house, has had to deal with regulatory changes that banned commission payments to financial advisers by powering up its direct sales channels and adding new ones.

Robeco's Dutch retail customers can now use a mobile app to create an account linked to a bank account and start making transfers from that account into fund products tailored to their risk profile.

Robeco has 38,000 app users, which represents approximately 17 per cent of its direct retail client base. So far, most people use the app to view portfolio information rather than perform transactions, but the company has high hopes for the future.

The asset management industry's first steps into digital are mostly in the area of advice. In the UK, Aberdeen Asset Management hopes to position itself as a leader in this area, having brought Rob Hudson on board. The former head of Charles Stanley Direct, the broker, will develop its digital proposition.

"It is no secret that Aberdeen has been spending time with the tech giants , wanting to know how to improve access to customers," says James Verner, partner at Hymans Robertson, the consultancy that has gone into partnership with Aberdeen to offer algorithmic advice to savers thinking about retirement planning.

Mr Verner believes there will be an industry-wide struggle to settle on the winning formula for a digital presence. The companies that come out on top will have focused on a particular range of characteristics, he believes. "It is going to be less about financial performance, although that will still matter, and more about how it is accessed and the quality of the user experience," he says. "Users will place a higher value on the convenience of the service and the quality of information provided."

This poses a challenge for an industry that is "good at building technical tools that nobody can understand", he says.

In the US, there has been a rise in robo-advisers , online tools that guide would-be investors through an algorithmic process identifying their goals and risk profile, and then suggest a portfolio tailored to their needs.

Websites such as Betterment in the US and Nutmeg in the UK are independent of asset managers, but eschew the "advice" label. Instead they offer a range of portfolios, mostly based on index trackers or exchange traded funds that suit clients' profiles, as established by a questionnaire.

These digital service providers are attempting to sit between asset managers and clients, while asset managers are still struggling to come to terms with the concept.

"Most of the big-brand asset managers in the UK are trying to work out how they work with the direct market," says Holly Mackay, an industry expert and founder of Boring Money, an online consumer investment guide.

"However, demand is still relatively muted and I do not think anyone can see where that tipping point is, when suddenly the need to have a compelling direct proposition is number one on the to-do list instead of today's number four or five."

Although the risks of disruption are clear, Mr Rajan is optimistic that "the internet titans will not conquer asset management", on the grounds that asset managers "have better risk instincts than newcomers".

The way forward

Technology lessons from Africa

In 2009, Paul Volcker, former US Federal Reserve chairman, said the most useful financial innovation of the past half century was the ATM, the automated cash dispenser.

Asset managers are unlikely to set up convenient street kiosks for late night purchases of investment funds.

But Robeco's attempt to sell funds through an app tied to a bank account has strong similarities to the current contender for most useful financial innovation: mobile money in Africa.

Customers can use the Robeco ONE product with very little formality, because the Dutch central bank has agreed that tying it to a bank account offers sufficient security. In the same way, many African regulators allow mobile money providers to accept business from anyone who has satisfied a phone company they are eligible for a phone contract.

By piggybacking on the security processes of the bank in Robeco's case, and the phone company in terms of mobile money, these products have become much more accessible to a broad market that, at the moment, is hard to reach in a cost-effective way.

Mobile money has the power to change economies by empowering people trapped in poverty.

Ask anyone about asset management s progress towards a digital world and the response is likely to contain the word  glacial .

Although the industry is concerned about the disruptive and transformational potential of technology, it has yet to do very much about it, in particular with respect to sales and distribution.

 There is a lot of talk, but little action. Change comes at a glacial pace,  says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the consultancy that published a report on this topic in February.

The fear is of disruption in the same way iTunes disrupted the music business or of an Amazon-style incomer, a new participant that has none of the legacy issues slowing down the incumbents. The success of Chinese asset manager Yu E Bao, the money-market arm of Alibaba, the ecommerce giant, that has gathered assets of more than $90bn in just two years is the example causing anxiety for traditional asset managers.

That panic may be overdone.  It owes more to its status as an unregulated shadow bank than a digital superstar,  says Mr Rajan.  This status allows it to offer [a return of] around 5 per cent   nearly twice the rate offered by regulated banks   and instant liquidity. 

But even if there is no long-term threat from the likes of Alibaba, the asset management industry cannot ignore the changing environment.

 We talk about things happening at two speeds,  says Neil Curham, executive director at Alpha Financial Markets Consulting.  First, we are seeing speedy changes because it is happening to the world we live in [with regards to improving processing time and efficiency; using big data; using social media for public relations]. More slowly, we are working with clients on more transformational change. 

One such client is Woodford Investment Management, the company set up by star manager Neil Woodford. It is using digital technology to keep investors engaged and costs low. As well as internet and social media marketing and sales, it has been using chat and business-process management tools to enable growth without adding to its headcount or costs.

 Based on this transparency and efficiency, their digital business model has enabled them to offer a new charging model for the Patient Capital Trust, with fees only applied once minimum performance returns of 10 per cent a year have been achieved,  says Mr Curham.

While it is impossible to forecast the precise shape of transformational change, just as there is no such thing as an expected shock to markets, Mr Curham believes he can identify the areas asset managers should focus on to create an advantage in a digital world.

These are transparency, frictionless servicing and interaction with the customer through channels where layers of intermediation have been set aside.

An example of this comes from the Netherlands. Robeco, the Dutch investment house, has had to deal with regulatory changes that banned commission payments to financial advisers by powering up its direct sales channels and adding new ones.

Robeco s Dutch retail customers can now use a mobile app to create an account linked to a bank account and start making transfers from that account into fund products tailored to their risk profile.

Robeco has 38,000 app users, which represents approximately 17 per cent of its direct retail client base. So far, most people use the app to view portfolio information rather than perform transactions, but the company has high hopes for the future.

The asset management industry s first steps into digital are mostly in the area of advice. In the UK, Aberdeen Asset Management hopes to position itself as a leader in this area, having brought Rob Hudson on board. The former head of Charles Stanley Direct, the broker, will develop its digital proposition.

 It is no secret that Aberdeen has been spending time with the tech giants, wanting to know how to improve access to customers,  says James Verner, partner at Hymans Robertson, the consultancy that has gone into partnership with Aberdeen to offer algorithmic advice to savers thinking about retirement planning.

Mr Verner believes there will be an industry-wide struggle to settle on the winning formula for a digital presence. The companies that come out on top will have focused on a particular range of characteristics, he believes.  It is going to be less about financial performance, although that will still matter, and more about how it is accessed and the quality of the user experience,  he says.  Users will place a higher value on the convenience of the service and the quality of information provided. 

This poses a challenge for an industry that is  good at building technical tools that nobody can understand , he says.

In the US, there has been a rise in robo-advisers, online tools that guide would-be investors through an algorithmic process identifying their goals and risk profile, and then suggest a portfolio tailored to their needs.

Websites such as Betterment in the US and Nutmeg in the UK are independent of asset managers, but eschew the  advice  label. Instead they offer a range of portfolios, mostly based on index trackers or exchange traded funds that suit clients  profiles, as established by a questionnaire.

These digital service providers are attempting to sit between asset managers and clients, while asset managers are still struggling to come to terms with the concept.

 Most of the big-brand asset managers in the UK are trying to work out how they work with the direct market,  says Holly Mackay, an industry expert and founder of Boring Money, an online consumer investment guide.

 However, demand is still relatively muted and I do not think anyone can see where that tipping point is, when suddenly the need to have a compelling direct proposition is number one on the to-do list instead of today s number four or five. 

Although the risks of disruption are clear, Mr Rajan is optimistic that  the internet titans will not conquer asset management , on the grounds that asset managers  have better risk instincts than newcomers .

The way forward: Technology lessons from Africa

In 2009, Paul Volcker, former US Federal Reserve chairman, said the most useful financial innovation of the past half century was the ATM, the automated cash dispenser.

Asset managers are unlikely to set up convenient street kiosks for late night purchases of investment funds.

But Robeco s attempt to sell funds through an app tied to a bank account has strong similarities to the current contender for most useful financial innovation: mobile money in Africa.

Customers can use the Robeco ONE product with very little formality, because the Dutch central bank has agreed that tying it to a bank account offers sufficient security. In the same way, many African regulators allow mobile money providers to accept business from anyone who has satisfied a phone company they are eligible for a phone contract.

By piggybacking on the security processes of the bank in Robeco s case, and the phone company in terms of mobile money, these products have become much more accessible to a broad market that, at the moment, is hard to reach in a cost-effective way.

Mobile money has the power to change economies by empowering people trapped in poverty. Some believe the asset management industry has an opportunity to change things on a similar scale by facilitating the savings revolution needed in a developed world struggling to ensure its ageing population has security in retirement.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
UK investors feel reverberations of China's rollercoaster ride

China's stock markets have given investors a stomach-churning ride . After rising 150 per cent in a year, the Shanghai Composite index fell 32 per cent between June 12 and July 8, before bouncing back 8.5 per cent in the past week. Shenzhen's market has been more turbulent: its index rose 200 per cent from last June before dropping 40 per cent, then rising 10.7 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was less extreme but showed a similar pattern. Judith Evans looks at the implications for investors. Why did the bubble burst?

China's mainland markets are driven by retail investors, who piled in and sent valuations spiralling. Triggers such as a crackdown on margin financing, in which investors borrow money to buy stocks, reversed that in June. The government then intervened by limiting short selling and the central bank buying shares. Trading in more than 1,400 companies was suspended for several days.

What was the effect on UK portfolios?

Most UK investors with broadly diversified portfolios have China exposure, typically through Hong Kong-listed shares rather than "A" shares listed on the mainland, to which international investors have only recently gained access.

Of funds specialising in China, "the managers that have done the best in the year to date are more likely to be doing worse over the past month," says Wing Chan, director of manager research for Asia at Morningstar.

"Funds that are defensively positioned, such as First State's China Growth fund, haven't done so well in the year to date, but relatively well in the past month."

By contrast, Fidelity's China Special Situations investment trust fell 16.7 per cent in share price terms over the past month, but gained almost 40 per cent over a year, according to FE Analytics.

Dale Nicholls, the manager, says while the trust's discount to net asset value widened during the turmoil, his investment strategy has also come into play: "I find a lot of interesting ideas in the small to mid-cap space, and they tend to be more volatile."

How have UK fund managers reacted?

Chinese brokerage firms have been one loser. Douglas Turnbull, head of Chinese equities at Neptune Investment Management, says his funds have been selling Chinese brokers, while Mr Nicholls reduced his weighting this year. Both have also seen buying opportunities in the mayhem. Mr Nicholls added to positions in A-shares including home appliance firms, and smaller Hong Kong-listed auto dealers and home furnishings companies.

Are markets set to fall?

Mr Turnbull says: "We may see further downside before it stabilises". However, he characterises the crash as "a stock market correction that went too far, too quickly" rather than economic collapse.

Should we be afraid?

Chinese markets, still in the emerging stage, are known to be volatile. But fund managers were surprised by the level of government intervention.

"It's delayed the process of [market] liberalisation, which is on the disappointing side, but I think the overall trend is still towards markets opening up," says Mr Nicholls.

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says government actions can lead to "perverse outcomes". "For example, if you suspend half the shares in the market, people who want to leave have to sell whatever shares are still trading."

Mr Turnbull characterises the situation as "a tug-of-war between policymakers and a stampeding herd of domestic retail investors".

However, few analysts are predicting broader effects on the economy, which has slowed but is growing faster than any developed market.

"A cooling-off period is to be expected and doesn't take away from the longer-term drivers of value and growth we're seeing," say the team behind the Guinness Asian Income fund. What's the best approach to investing in China?

Morningstar's team rate the First State China Growth fund and also the Schroder China Opportunities vehicle. They believe both funds' managers are skilled at seeking out high-quality stocks from the huge variety listed in China.

They also note that as the onshore market bubble formed, international investors remained conservative. "It hasn't been a hot asset class internationally for a long time," says Mr Chan.

Mr Khalaf suggests UK investors may wish to access Chinese investments through a broader Asia-Pacific or emerging markets fund. First State's Asia Pacific Leaders product and Aberdeen's Asia Pacific Equity have both found favour with Hargreaves' analysts.

"We think they're both good funds, but neither is especially positive on China at the moment. Part of what you're paying them for is to take that view on the wider merits of the economy," says Mr Khalaf.

Mobius departure prompts look at alternatives; Fund management

Senior member of team appointed as lead manager

Investors should consider alternatives to the UK's biggest emerging markets investment trust, analysts said, as renowned fund manager Mark Mobius said he would step down after 26 years.

Mr Mobius, 78, said on Monday he would hand over the position of lead portfolio manager on the 1.6bn Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust (Temit) to Carlos Hardenberg from October.

Mr Mobius will remain as a portfolio manager on the trust and as leader of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group, part of Franklin Templeton, the US-based asset manager.

The switch follows underperformance at the trust, which has failed to beat its benchmark index over the past one, three and five years. It is trading at a discount to net asset value of 11.2 per cent.

Energy and materials holdings have dragged on performance. But over 10 years the fund has outperformed, returning 181 per cent to investors against 129 per cent for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, according to figures from FE Analytics.

Simon Elliott, head of research at Winterflood Securities, said the change in lead manager should be viewed as a step in the trust's succession planning rather than a response to its period of poor performance .

"This shouldn't be seen as a different investment approach. The way that they run their money has a collegiate element and Carlos has been a senior member of the team for some time. This is a positive development."

U.S. News: White House Takes Some Heat on Mortgage Lawsuits

By Joe Light

A rare coalition of mortgage lenders and left-leaning consumer advocates are calling on the Obama administration to ease up on lawsuits they say are driving banks away from making loans to borrowers with weak credit histories.

In three nearly identical proposals, the Mortgage Bankers Association, 15 left-leaning advocacy groups and researchers from the Urban Institute and Moody'sAnalytics are asking the administration to restrict one of the most powerful tools the U.S. government has used to punish banks for mortgage mistakes.

Some lenders say fears of being sued and hit with financial penalties have caused them to adopt more-stringent mortgage rules than what the federal government requires, shutting out borrowers near the margins.

The Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, has estimated that as many as 1.2 million more mortgage loans would be made annually if not for tight credit restrictions put in place by lenders in the years since the financial crisis as regulators and attorneys ramped up mortgage-related lawsuits and penalties.

But the new proposals, if they gain traction, could also limit the Justice Department's discretion in pursuing banks for mistakes.

At issue is the Federal Housing Administration, which is run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is responsible for backing more than one in 10 mortgage loans.

The FHA is a favorite program for first-time home buyers and borrowers with weak credit because it allows them to make down payments of as little as 3.5% with a credit score of 580 on a scale of 300 to 850.

The Justice Department has pursued lawsuits aimed at holding banks accountable for shoddy loans with errors -- such as misstating borrowers' credentials or inflating values of homes purchased -- that in part led to large losses at the FHA after the loans went bad.

The groups behind the new proposals say the problem is that under current rules, FHA lenders must promise that everything in the loan paperwork is accurate. If there are mistakes, even minor ones such as misstating a borrower's income by a tiny amount, the lenders can be liable for up to three times the damages.

"In all of these efforts, we're balancing access to credit and oversight. The best way to do that, the easiest way to do that, is to maximize clarity for lenders," said Julia Gordon, senior director for the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning group that didn't sign on to the broader proposal but supports many of its ideas.

The Justice Department has used the rules to extract multimillion-dollar settlements from banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and SunTrust Banks Inc., while litigation against other major lenders, such as Quicken Loans Inc., is continuing.

Justice Department officials say the cases they have pursued have been for significant violations, rather than for minor errors. In its lawsuit against Quicken filed this year, for example, the department cited an instance in which it said Quicken made a loan to a borrower who was having trouble feeding her family. At the time, Quicken Loans said the lawsuit relied "on a handful of out-of-context email conversations skimmed from the communication between Quicken Loans employees."

A spokeswoman said the Justice Department hadn't seen the new proposals but added, "The conduct that the government has pursued reflects clear, systematic, and knowing violations of meaningful and substantive FHA requirements, rather than isolated, good faith efforts to comply with those requirements."

HUD unveiled a preliminary draft of changes to the so-called certification in May. The three proposals -- from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Urban Institute-led group and the left-wing coalition, which included the Center for Responsible Lending, the NAACP, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights -- came in response.

Under the groups' plan, lenders would face liability for triple-damages claims only when they knowingly or recklessly make a mistake affecting the insurability of the loan. Lenders also could be held liable if they don't have a quality-control process that follows the FHA's guidelines or consistently fail to follow their own process.

A HUD spokesman declined to comment on the proposals but said the agency would respond to comments it received and then open another 30-day comment period before releasing final language on the new FHA requirements.

Opportunity knocks for doorstep lender; Financials: Credit start-up

Non-Standard Finance says its 'contrarian' stance can pay off in the age of online borrowing

A subprime lender backed by fund manager Neil Woodford and a clutch of other City figures is shunning the internet to offer old fashioned door-to-door loans.

Non-Standard Finance, which listed as an investment vehicle in February, has made its first acquisition, paying 82.5m for the home credit business of S&U, the Solihull-based consumer finance company.

The venture is also backed by Michael Spencer , chief executive of ICAP and a former Tory treasurer, and is chaired by John van Kuffeler , who spent 15 years at Provident Financial, the UK's largest doorstep lender.

Miles Cresswell-Turner , partner at private equity firm Duke Street, and Charles Gregson , chairman of ICAP, the interdealer broker founded by Mr Spencer, are also co-founders.

"It is a contrarian view . But while everybody else is going to internet lending, we believe there is a considerable opportunity here," said Mr van Kuffeler.

S&U's home credit business is the third largest after Provident and Shopacheck. It trades as loansathome4u and has about 100,000 customers.

Revenue rose 11 per cent to 38.3m last year, while profit before tax rose 7.7 per cent to 8.4m.

S&U is chaired by Anthony Coombs , a former Tory MP, and the Coombs family together own a 52 per cent stake. Mr van Kuffeler said the fact that some of NSF's backers also had Tory connections was "pure coincidence".

Home credit, more commonly known as doorstep lending, is used by about 2m people in the UK - but it is estimated that there are 12m people who are cut off from regular bank finance because they have low incomes or poor credit histories. It provides a typically cheaper alternative to payday lending - although many of its customers would not qualify for online loans.

Money is collected weekly by a team of agents visiting homes in some of the UK's poorest areas. Although interest rates are high - 180 per cent APR is typical for a 41-week loan - there are no charges for late payment and unlike with payday lending, borrowers are not allowed to roll over their debt.

Although the business is dealing with small loans and the administration costs of a team of agents, the personal nature of doorstep lending means it is considered low risk. Mr van Kuffeler said that even in a recession it had remained stable, with two-thirds of its book made up of renewals of existing loans.

One of the reasons Mr van Kuffeler is re-entering the market is to take customers from Provident, which he said had shrunk its customer base from 1.8m to about 1m since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. "There might be 400,000 who we wouldn't necessarily want because their payment record was poor. But even if we got a quarter of the other 400,000, that would double the size of the company we're about to own."

Mr van Kuffeler said he was anticipating further acquisition opportunities among smaller doorstep lenders with loan books of 2m to 10m, which are finding it hard to comply with tougher regulation. "We have 21 companies we think we might be interested in. Now of course we wouldn't buy them all, we would be hopeful of buying some of them."

Mr van Kuffeler planned to invest in better data analytics and his agents will be armed with handheld computers, which will avoid having to employ input clerks at head office. But the system is little changed in decades, with the lending and servicing of the debt still conducted across the kitchen table between agent and borrower.

Zeta Interactive valued at $1bn after Blackstone investment

Blackstone s GSO Capital Partners is investing $125m in Zeta Interactive, valuing the marketing data and analytics company at more than $1bn, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Zeta will use part of the round, which includes both debt and equity, to refinance its existing $50m in debt, with the remaining $75m expected to fund acquisitions, said David Steinberg, chief executive.

The investment is Zeta s first fundraising round since it raised about $28m in equity funding and a $50m debt facility in 2012. The company had more than $100m in revenue in 2014 and is on track to exceed $200m this year, Mr Steinberg said. He did not disclose the company s profits but said operating margins were  in the high teens .

Mr Steinberg founded Zeta with John Sculley, who replaced Steve Jobs as Apple chief executive in the 1990s. Its customers are some of the biggest multinational advertising spenders, including financial services, insurance, health, travel and automotive groups.

The company helps them track where their customers come from and what their attributes are, including age, gender, location, household income and media consumption habits. It then identifies similar prospects among a pool 350m people s data, most of which is obtained from large publishers, and helps clients find where to market to them.

 Most targeting on the internet is based on who clicks on what: if you click on this, you re more likely to click on it again. We look at who s buying our clients  products,  Mr Steinberg said.

He added that Zeta will continue to buy smaller technology companies that complement its existing services and allow it to expand internationally to meet global clients  needs. About 14 per cent of the company s revenue comes from sources outside the US, primarily western Europe.

 Zeta is one of the most successful and fastest growing companies focused on the big data and analytics space,  said Brad Colman, a principal at GSO Capital Partners.  This is a sector that we ve watched closely and we are very excited about. We are committed to helping Zeta grow their business organically and through acquisition. 

The expansion plans come as Zeta looks to capture a bigger chunk of marketers  budgets as they continue to shift online.

 This migration of analogue dollars to digital dollars is one of the single biggest drivers of our business,  Mr Steinberg said.  Our clients are out front. They say, if I am going to invest my money in a way that is most efficient, I need to understand who my customer is. 

While the company had previously funded itself through private financing, Mr Steinberg said he would not rule out an initial public offering.

 That would be a logical long-term capital strategy,  he said.  At this point we don t need to. We have access to a lot of capital. [But] I don t seen any reason that we couldn t. You want to do it when the company is in the right place to do it. 

He added the availability of private money has changed the equation for growing companies and entrepreneurs.  You used to need to take a company public to access capital. You just don t need to do that any more.

Blackstone s GSO Capital Partners is investing $125m in Zeta Interactive, valuing the marketing data and analytics company at more than $1bn, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Zeta will use part of the round, which includes both debt and equity, to refinance its existing $50m in debt, with the remaining $75m expected to fund acquisitions, said David Steinberg, chief executive.

The investment is Zeta s first fundraising round since it raised about $28m in equity funding and a $50m debt facility in 2012. The company had more than $100m in revenue in 2014 and is on track to exceed $200m this year, Mr Steinberg said. He did not disclose the company s profits but said operating margins were  in the high teens .

Mr Steinberg founded Zeta with John Sculley, who replaced Steve Jobs as Apple chief executive in the 1990s. Its customers are some of the biggest multinational advertising spenders, including financial services, insurance, health, travel and automotive groups.

The company helps them track where their customers come from and what their attributes are, including age, gender, location, household income and media consumption habits. It then identifies similar prospects among a pool 350m people s data, most of which is obtained from large publishers, and helps clients find where to market to them.

 Most targeting on the internet is based on who clicks on what: if you click on this, you re more likely to click on it again. We look at who s buying our clients  products,  Mr Steinberg said.

He added that Zeta will continue to buy smaller technology companies that complement its existing services and allow it to expand internationally to meet global clients  needs. About 14 per cent of the company s revenue comes from sources outside the US, primarily western Europe.

 Zeta is one of the most successful and fastest growing companies focused on the big data and analytics space,  said Brad Colman, a principal at GSO Capital Partners.  This is a sector that we ve watched closely and we are very excited about. We are committed to helping Zeta grow their business organically and through acquisition. 

The expansion plans come as Zeta looks to capture a bigger chunk of marketers  budgets as they continue to shift online.

 This migration of analogue dollars to digital dollars is one of the single biggest drivers of our business,  Mr Steinberg said.  Our clients are out front. They say, if I am going to invest my money in a way that is most efficient, I need to understand who my customer is. 

While the company had previously funded itself through private financing, Mr Steinberg said he would not rule out an initial public offering.

 That would be a logical long-term capital strategy,  he said.  At this point we don t need to. We have access to a lot of capital. [But] I don t seen any reason that we couldn t. You want to do it when the company is in the right place to do it. 

He added the availability of private money has changed the equation for growing companies and entrepreneurs.  You used to need to take a company public to access capital. You just don t need to do that any more.

Rare Coalition Urges Limits on Mortgage-Related Bank Lawsuits; Bankers, housing advocates team up in effort to ease mortgage access for borrowers with weaker credit

A rare coalition of mortgage lenders and left-leaning consumer advocates are calling on the Obama administration to ease up on lawsuits they say are driving banks away from making loans to borrowers with weak credit histories.

In three nearly identical proposals, the Mortgage Bankers Association, 15 left-leaning advocacy groups, and researchers from the Urban Institute and Moody'sAnalytics are asking the administration to restrict one of the most powerful tools the U.S. government has used to punish banks for mortgage mistakes.

Some lenders say fears of being sued and slammed with financial penalties have caused them to adopt more stringent mortgage rules than what the federal government requires, shutting out borrowers near the margins.

The Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., has estimated that as many as 1.2 million more mortgage loans would be made annually were it not for tight credit restrictions put in place by lenders in the years since the financial crisis as regulators and attorneys ramped up mortgage-related lawsuits and penalties.

But the new proposals, if they gain traction, could also limit the Justice Department's discretion in pursuing banks for mistakes.

At issue is the Federal Housing Administration, which is run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is responsible for backing more than one in 10 mortgage loans.

The FHA is a favorite program for first-time home buyers and borrowers with weak credit because it allows them to make down payments of as little as 3.5% with a credit score of 580 on a scale of 300 to 850.

The Justice Department has pursued lawsuits aimed at holding banks accountable for shoddy loans with errors such as misstating borrowers' credentials or inflating values of homes purchased that in part led to large losses suffered by the FHA after the loans went bad.

The groups behind the new proposals say the problem is that under current rules, FHA lenders must promise that everything in the loan paperwork is accurate. If there are mistakes, even minor ones such as misstating a borrower's income by a tiny amount, the lenders can be liable for up to three times the damages.

 In all of these efforts, we're balancing access to credit and oversight. The best way to do that, the easiest way to do that is to maximize clarity for lenders," said Julia Gordon, senior director for the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning group that didn't sign on to the broader proposal but supports many of its ideas.

The Justice Department has used the rules to extract multimillion-dollar settlements from banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and SunTrust Banks Inc., while litigation against other major lenders, such as Quicken Loans Inc., is continuing.

Justice Department officials say the cases they have pursued have been for significant violations, rather than for minor errors. In its lawsuit against Quicken filed this year, for example, the department cited an instance in which it said Quicken made a loan to a borrower who was having trouble feeding her family. At the time, Quicken Loans said the lawsuit relied  on a handful of out-of-context email conversations skimmed from the communication between Quicken Loans employees."

A spokeswoman said the Justice Department hadn't seen the new proposals but added,  The conduct that the government has pursued reflects clear, systematic, and knowing violations of meaningful and substantive FHA requirements, rather than isolated, good faith efforts to comply with those requirements."

HUD unveiled a preliminary draft of changes to the so-called certification in May. In response came the proposals from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Urban Institute-led group and the left-wing coalition, which included the Center for Responsible Lending, the NAACP, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

Under the groups' plan, lenders would face liability for triple-damages claims only when they knowingly or recklessly make a mistake affecting the insurability of the loan. Lenders also could be held liable if they don't have a quality-control process that follows the FHA's guidelines or consistently fail to follow their own process.

A HUD spokesman declined to comment on the proposals but said the agency would respond to comments it received and then open another 30-day comment period before releasing final language on the new FHA requirements.

 HUD is truly between a rock and a hard place," said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading in Washington, noting that Democrats worry about letting banks off the hook while Republicans are concerned about fiscal impacts of changing policies.

In presenting a united front, the groups hope to sway the FHA to change its policies. Joint efforts have been successful in the past, such as pushing for reduced FHA fees and changes to some proposed federal mortgage rules.

In response to frustrations with the FHA program, several banks already have pulled back sharply from making FHA loans.

Last summer, after J.P. Morgan paid a $614 million FHA-related settlement, Chief Executive James Dimon said the bank was considering leaving the program altogether. The bank, the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. overall, has largely followed through, making only $95 million in FHA loans in the first quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, down 86% from a year earlier.

Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender in the first quarter, and Bank of America, the fourth-largest, also have pulled back from FHA lending more sharply than the overall market.

As big banks have pulled out, nonbank lenders and smaller banks have poured in, picking up large chunks of market share.

Investors should consider alternatives to the UK s biggest emerging markets investment trust, analysts said, after renowned fund manager Mark Mobius said he would step down from running it after 26 years.

Mr Mobius, 78, said on Monday he would hand over the position of lead portfolio manager on the 1.6bn Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust (Temit) to Carlos Hardenberg from October.

Mr Mobius, a distinctive figure known for criss-crossing Asia in a private jet, will remain as a portfolio manager on the trust and as leader of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group, part of Franklin Templeton, the US-based asset manager.

The switch follows a period of underperformance at the trust, which has failed to beat its benchmark index over the past one, three and five years. It is trading at a discount to net asset value of 11.2 per cent.

Energy and materials holdings have dragged on recent performance during a tough period for emerging markets.

But over the past 10 years the fund has comfortably outperformed, returning 181 per cent to investors against 129 per cent for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, according to figures from FE Analytics.

Numis Securities, a broker, this week removed Temit from its recommended list in favour of Genesis Emerging Markets, a 700m trust that also takes a value-based approach to investing.

 We wouldn t necessarily say people who have got a holding in the Templeton fund should sell it because it s having a bit of a tough time,  said Ewan Lovett-Turner, director of investment companies research at Numis.  But for people who are looking to put some more money to work, it would be worth having a look at the Genesis fund. 

Simon Elliott, head of research at Winterflood Securities, said the change in lead manager should be viewed as a step in the trust s succession planning rather than a response to its period of poor performance.

 Certain shareholders have been questioning what s happening with the succession,  he said.

 This shouldn t be seen as a different investment approach. The way that they run their money has a collegiate element and Carlos has been a senior member of the team for some time. This is a positive development. 

Winterflood has previously recommended Temit to investors, but its current emerging markets trust recommendations are the JPMorgan s Emerging Markets Investment Trust and BlackRock s Frontiers Investment Trust, which specialises in less developed markets.

Canaccord Genuity, another broker, said in June it had been  underwhelmed  by a meeting with Temit s management and that its  buy  recommendation was  approaching  rabbit in the headlight  status .

Mr Hardenberg, who will be taking over at Temit pending regulatory approval, is a frontier markets specialist who joined Franklin Templeton in 2002. Based in Istanbul, he will relocate to London to run the trust. This should make him relatively accessible to UK investors, said Mr Elliott. Mr Mobius is based in Singapore.

Mr Mobius is seen as a pioneer of emerging market investing and had run the trust since its launch in 1989. He runs 19 funds, according to FE Analytics.

Peter Smith, the trust s chairman, said Mr Hardenberg s appointment  will provide renewed focus for the next stage in the company s development .

Workday Launches Data Science Venture Fund; Workday Ventures plans to invest in 10 to 12 seed and early-stage companies, and gain access to top data science talent

Workday Inc. is doubling down on data.

The provider of human-resources software, which helps more than 950 corporate customers predict which employees will be top performers and which are at risk of quitting, is launching a venture fund focused on data science and machine learning, the company said Tuesday.

 We think over the next 10 years of enterprise software, what will separate the winners from the losers will be the ability to be data savvy," said Dan Beck, senior vice president for Technology Products.

Like larger rivals IBM Corp., SAP SE and Salesforce.com Inc. all of which are racing to build data analytic services for corporate customers Workday is positioning itself for access to top data science talent and diverse sources. The company aims to be a one-stop shop for corporate software beyond its stronghold in human resources. The new Workday Ventures fund is one way to gain visibility into startups that could one day become rivals, partners or acquisitions.

Twitter, for example, a company much younger than Workday, launched a venture arm, "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/03/24/twitters-new-venture-capital-arm-quietly-opens-for-business/", earlier this year.

T.M. Ravi, director and co-founder of the Hive, an incubator for startups specializing in big-data analytics, said that while corporate venture funds have some structural challenges--namely conflicts between the fund, startup, other investors--Workday Ventures represents a bigger shift in the direction of corporate software.

 Every enterprise function is dominated by old style human workflow-based business process applications," Mr. Ravi said.  The emerging generation of enterprise applications will be event-driven, backed by a predictive analytics engine that recommends actions or automates them."

Workday Ventures plans to invest in 10 to 12 seed and early-stage companies this year. It announced investments in four startups. Metanautix enables users to combine many data sources to simplify supply chains. ThinAir detects patterns that could indicate fraud. Unbabel uses machine learning and crowdsourcing to provide translations of foreign languages. Jobr lets job seekers apply for jobs on their smartphones.

Workday didn't disclose the fund's size but said it wouldn't be a major investor or take a board seat in startups it funded.

Mr. Beck said the fund could lead to data-sharing partnerships. For example, Unbabel's translation capabilities could be useful to Workday's international customers. It could also help facilitate sales for the startups, which will be invited to pitch their products and services at Workday's annual conference for CIOs.

Connectivity and technology in Africa   ahead of the global game?

Mobile internet adoption in Africa is taking place at almost double the global rate, a trend that has sparked debate among development and tech enthusiasts as to whether this marks a radical shift in the way the internet of the future will be used and accessed. Has the range of innovative services currently available on mobile devices come about purely as a result of necessity, or through a deliberate decision to focus on the mobile solution by forward looking African companies and entrepreneurs?

Some recent examples of the level of digital sophistication evident in Nigeria, and in Africa s technology industry as a whole, can shed some light on this. In February this year, the BBC website announced with fanfare that RBS and Natwest, two UK banks, would be pioneering the use of Touch ID on the iPhone as a security enhancement for their mobile banking applications. What the BBC didn t know was that Touch ID was already going live across mobile banking networks, with some Nigerian banks incorporating the feature before their UK counterparts.

Perhaps more telling was the storm of media coverage out of Canada in May, announcing that the country s banks were now adopting Touch ID   three months after Africa, in a nation normally considered to be at the forefront of payment technology adoption. While Africa did not originate the technology, it clearly demonstrated the ability and the appetite to adopt and introduce it faster than the west. It also indicates a level of tech-savviness among consumers who demand the latest technology in both hardware and software.

The  needs must  argument   that mobile banking in Africa leapfrogged or even completely bypassed the internet banking phase of digital financial services due to a lack of fixed connectivity and a level of demand from discerning consumers already using their mobiles for transactions   is demonstrated by intelligence from our partner banks, who saw their internet banking customer base outstripped by the mobile channel in a matter of months.

But perhaps the Nigerian banks were quicker than their African counterparts to realise the value of the mobile channel? The reality is that the race towards mobile has been happening globally. In the US in the third quarter of 2013, the rate at which millennials were  switching  their bank was close to 20 per cent, with the primary reason being relative mobile banking capabilities. I dare say this percentage has increased dramatically as the momentum towards mobile has gathered pace. The reality is that more Africans use their mobiles to access the internet than their laptops, so the mobile channel became unavoidable.

Furthermore, Africa is not just focused on simple USSD and SMS menu based services, which are the solution focused on the feature phone. Within the mobile banking application development space, sophisticated analytics and two-factor authentication security underpin a complex software development cycle that can compare to many  first world  banking solutions. These are sophisticated solutions for an increasingly sophisticated market.

Where Africa can undoubtedly claim to be ahead is at the intersection between payments and mobile banking. What Africa lacks in access to credit through technology, it makes up for with the ability to pay for everyday needs directly through the application, and that ability lies at the intersection between mobile payments and mobile banking and mobile commerce. Across the Vanso network today, customers can buy airtime, pay for satellite television and ISP subscriptions and book and pay for flights. That is just the tip of the iceberg, with significant new integration expected over the coming 12 months.

At the moment, whether Africa is ahead of or behind global trends is not necessarily the point. Africa is ahead in some areas while in others it remains far behind, if catching up fast. The continent s ability to maintain its pace of development will depend largely on the telecom companies  ability to accelerate the roll out of stable, 4G mobile internet, and the simultaneous development of a fixed-line internet distribution system, similar to the one that has made BT so dominant in the UK. The revolution that has taken place in Africa over the past decade had been powered by the telecoms industry, which must continue to maintain the pace of growth.

Financiers are now beginning to take notice too, with 2015 seeing a wave of deals to fund growth across the sector. Most recently, Nigerian giant Interswitch announced that it intends to list in London and Lagos, making it potentially the first Nigerian tech stock in the UK. Last year, Kenya s Equity Bank announced the establishment of Equitel, to offer mobile money, telephony and data services, and rival Kenya Commercial Bank has followed suit in a partnership with Safaricom as the continent s first MVNO structures are rolled out. At the opposite end of the spectrum, a wave of startups funded by German fund Rocket Internet have exploded. The recent investment by private equity fund Leapfrog in AFB s growing micro-loans business, and the rumoured sale of Emerging Markets Payments, show that the world is beginning to recognise the potential that exists in the convergence between the African financial services and telecoms markets.

That potential is best qualified by looking at the penetration of smartphones across the continent, of which Nigeria remains the biggest market. Smartphone use is estimated at about 30 per cent of the country s 140m mobile lines, and growing fast, driven largely by the introduction of more affordable Android devices. From our own analysis we can see that our mobile banking apps are running on more than 900 different devices! Android is overwhelmingly the dominant operating system, best-selling quad core, dual sim models such as the Infinix series of smartphones are currently retailing for under N10,000, around the $50 mark. Competition is fierce in this entry-level market, driven by aggressive, domestic online retailers such as Konga and Jumia, and such pressure can only lead to a better deal for the smartphone-hungry consumer. Given that the sub $100 smartphone was hailed as a potential tipping point for the growth of inclusive digital financial services for Africa by the likes of Bill Gates, the momentum is definitely mobile!

The short term growth story is undeniable. With a number of banks already live on advanced Vanso mobile banking applications, and others in the testing phase, the demand is clear. Building on that installed base to bring new technologies in real time, if not ahead of the rest of the world, is the next challenge, and it s one we look forward to taking on.

Chinese Investment Fund Completes $1.44 Billion Investment in France, Belgium; China s largest state investment fund acquires 10 shopping centers in one of its biggest-ever deals

China's largest state investment fund has bought 10 shopping centers in France and Belgium for about  ¬1.3 billion ($1.44 billion), one of its biggest acquisitions in Europe.

China Investment Corp., along with affiliate AEW Europe, bought the portfolio of malls from CBRE Global Investors, according to company statements.

Chinese investors have been "http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-cic-gearing-up-investment-in-overseas-assets-1427456722?tesla=y" in a push to diversify their holdings. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-investment-corp-eyeing-3-35-billion-german-gas-station-firm-1435596046?tesla=y", they have purchased $4.7 billion of real estate in the past 12 months, including this latest CIC deal, according to Real Capital Analytics data.

The investment level is on par with the previous 12 months. But as Chinese investors become more familiar with the European market, they are increasingly considering assets beyond cornerstone cities like London and Paris.

Major Asian investors  are looking at a broader range of investments," said Sophie van Oosterom, Chief Investment Officer at CBRE Global Investors, which manages more than $87 billion of real estate assets.

 They are looking for sizable transactions, but they're not shying away from asset-management opportunities as well," she said.

CIC's latest deal includes two prominent shopping centers near Antwerp, Belgium. The other eight malls were in France, including La Vache Noire in Paris.

Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group earlier this month furthered plans to expand into European property, forming a joint venture with the U.K.'s Resolution Property Investment Management LLP. Shanghai-based Fosun in April bought an office building in Milan for $372 million, according to Real Capital.

Is Your Wall Street Analyst a Robot?

Each day, Wall Street churns out millions of words encouraging investors to buy or sell stocks, bonds and mutual funds.

In the future, more of those words might not be written by humans.

As automation in financial services grows, computers and algorithms have taken on some of the traditional work of traders, clerks and financial advisers. Now, a host of startups that use artificial intelligence to write news stories and other reports have set their sights on writing work at banks and financial-service companies.

Narrative Science Inc., which launched in 2010 with computer-generated news articles, added products for financial-services businesses in 2013. Those firms now account for 60% of the company's client base. Last year, Automated Insights added insurance company Allstate Corp. to a roster of clients that includes Yahoo! Inc. and the Associated Press. Other startups offering automated reports for financial-services firms include Yseop, Capital Cube and Goldman Sachs-backed Kensho Technologies Inc.

As artificial intelligence takes on ever more tasks, Wall Street is getting more comfortable putting it to use. Services launched in recent years are gaining traction now because the technology has become more sophisticated and banks are looking for ways to cut costs and increase efficiencies.

Programs such as Narrative Science's essentially take data from filings, databases or internal documents and then use algorithms to synthesize the information for corporate presentations or product descriptions. The banks and the mostly private firms dealing in automated writing declined to discuss details such as cost. But in general, the software can produce information summaries quickly and cheaply, enabling businesses to publish more reports and marketing materials.

Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG is using automated writing to provide clients with corporate summaries on thousands of companies. Fund companies T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and American Century Investments are testing automated-writing products that would tell customers how the companies' funds invest money in a variety of stock-market strategies.

Still, the abilities of automated writers remain limited, critics say. Research experts say computers still have trouble processing the qualitative information central to most analysts' jobs. Analysts, for instance, work to maintain relationships with company executives and clients, and look for nuances in executives' comments that an algorithm wouldn't necessarily pick up.

Research reports that don't add insight simply increase the noise, says Barry Hurewitz, chief operating officer of UBS AG's investment-research division, noting that large brokerage firms already produce more than 30,000 research reports each year.

"Analysts need to advance clients' thinking with their research, not report on what is happening," he said.

Some say it is a matter of time before the computers catch up. Bigger swaths of the investing world now use computers and algorithms to find relative value in stocks or to tell investors how they should divvy up their nest eggs.

"It's a very hot debate about whether the financial analyst community is going to be decimated by algorithms," said William Trout, a senior analyst at research and consulting firm Celent. While analysts may not be concerned today, he said, "disruption, when it happens, happens very fast."

The discussion of which jobs may ultimately be replaced by robots has been a hot topic lately. A 2013 study by two Oxford University professors ranked about 700 occupations by their likelihood of such elimination. Financial analysts were ranked as safer than about 70% of the occupations, but technical writers were ranked as more endangered, safer than only 25% of jobs.

Some large brokerage firms in recent years have cut the number of analysts they employ, but smaller firms have been hiring, according to a paper by Cornell University assistant professor Kenneth Merkley. The research expert predicts the number of analysts will continue to fall at larger firms, in part because of the push to automate. "Anyone that doesn't bring something to the table" will be displaced, Mr. Merkley said.

Companies providing the technology to Wall Street insist that the goal isn't to replace jobs. "Analysts are overwhelmed with the work they typically have to do," Narrative Science chief executive Stuart Frankel said. Automation "frees them up to do higher-value work."

Credit Suisse uses Narrative Science's platform, Quill, to generate company summaries for its research database HOLT.

At a financial technology conference in 2013, Credit Suisse managing director Tim Bixler said Quill helps the 20-person HOLT writing team to spend more time meeting clients. Since then, Quill has increased the number of written summaries Credit Suisse's HOLT platform provides to 5,000 companies, up from 1,500, a spokeswoman for Narrative Science said.

American Century Investments is incorporating Quill's ability to write up rudimentary fund recaps, while T. Rowe Price is working on using Quill in some of the firm's investment-strategy descriptions. A unit of Fidelity Investments is exploring Quill and similar technologies to see if they can turn data into personalized communications for consumers, Senior Vice President Sean Belka said.

Meanwhile, Allstate is looking into how it can use mechanized writing with customers. It currently uses Automated Insights to measure internal sales performance and issue recommendations for improvement.

"There is no way that Allstate could produce what we are doing today having analysts do all of that," product-operations manager Ryan Dunn said. "We thought it was a novel idea and we wanted to jump on it."

WSJ.D Technology -- CIO Journal: Network Reliability, a Relic of Business? --- A standard of 99.999% reliability with just five minutes of downtime a year rarely exists today

Say what you will about Plain Old Telephone Service, but it worked. The functionality of POTS, as it was known, was limited to making calls, and they were expensive. But many traditional phone companies offered 99.999% reliability, which allowed for about five minutes of downtime a year.

Today's networks are far less expensive, infinitely more capable and nowhere near as reliable as the wired-to-the-wall phone, as a spate of network outages on Wednesday demonstrated. The New York Stock Exchange halted trading, citing a technical problem. United Airlines was grounded because of an IT issue. The NYSE outage lasted about four hours, or nearly 50 years of allowable downtime using the "five nines" standard.

In the age of artificial intelligence, smartphones, cloud computing and robotic cars, how can this be?

To some extent, contemporary networks suffer from inattention. The old phone system worked so well because regulators in certain countries like the U.S. said it had to, and enough money was set aside to fund an army of technicians and engineers to oversee it. That generally isn't the case with modern, digital networks and IT infrastructure, and companies often neglect this nuts-and-bolts technology.

"Until there's a day like today, everybody invests in other things," said Thomas Bayer, chief information officer at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, on Wednesday. "When you have a day like today, people start to concentrate on their infrastructure."

Yet reliability problems are persistent even in industries such as finance, where a considerable amount of time, money and pressure from regulators and customers require investments in network technology and IT infrastructure. They can cost a company $5,000 to $10,000 a minute, researcher Gartner Inc. estimates.

Today's problems with reliability are more fundamental, a reflection of the complexity of contemporary networks, the volume of data, the pace of change, insufficient organizational and cultural practices, and a legacy of arcane and poorly written business software that traditionally put little emphasis on usability or customer experience.

Outages persist because of the interdependency of computer systems, fueled by the rise of digital services across all industries, particularly those with customer-facing software such as mobile apps, according to former NYSE Euronext CIO Paul Cassell, now CIO of Pico Quantitative Trading LLC.

"Data is going to more places than ever before," he said. "The level of complexity . . . has increased tenfold. The IT organizations need to be ahead of the curve." He says solid, well-documented and automated processes for building, testing, upgrading and configuring IT are essential.

That process seemed to break down at the NYSE, which issued a statement Thursday saying that customer gateways weren't properly configured for a software release, leading to communication problems with a trading unit.

In a fragmented market like finance, if one exchange or network goes down, another is supposed to pick up the slack. No single network bears the world on its back anymore, so the pressure to be perfect isn't as high. Unless, of course, it is. "When I was there, if you had interruption for a second, it feels like an hour. It's an eternity," said former NYSE Euronext CIO Steve Rubinow, now CTO at data-marketing firm Catalina.

Underneath it all, the economics of falling prices carry a trade-off. Consumers get more for their money in the mobile, digital era, but that often leaves margin-stretched companies with fewer resources to invest in robustness and maintenance. Reliability is as much a function of business and risk management as it is about tech.

"I don't know if people are sweating that detail as much as they used to," said Mr. Bayer, previously CIO of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

At the SEC, hurricane season was a chance to practice disaster recovery. The agency would intentionally bring down local area networks at regional offices to protect them from storm damage.

S&P had redundant capabilities when Mr. Bayer joined the company in February. Now, he's looking to cloud providers to increase redundancy and resilience across the country. Real-time metrics can now show companies if a circuit is about to be overloaded or if a particular machine is about to fail. But something may also be lost amid the shift to automation.

Retailer Best Buy Co. spent millions of dollars upgrading its IT systems over the past three years, hiring its own staff to develop better internal systems of handling sales and tracking inventory. The chain also hired Internet specialist Akamai Technologies Inc. to make sure its website could handle the waves of online shopper traffic that usually hits stores before the holidays. That still didn't stop the company's website from crashing on Black Friday under the weight of visits from people using smartphones.

Time Warner Cable Inc. cut off its entire subscriber base for more than an hour in August when an employee misconfigured the network's internal system for maintaining Internet addresses. A TWC spokesman said the company later added more safeguards and worker training to protect its network from the suffering the same problem again.

It is very difficult for any company to account for all that can go wrong. And sometimes the smallest detail can lead to a big problem.

When the United and NYSE incidents occurred Wednesday, Time Inc. CTO Colin Bodell put information security staff on high alert and monitored social media and government sites.

Time has disaster recovery systems that protect the company in the event of a catastrophic failure. If a primary system goes down, Time can switch traffic to a redundant system in a different location.

Mr. Bodell faced a "backhoe dug up a fiber connection" situation a few weeks ago. He realized the incident had occurred when the system notified staff that it had failed over successfully.

It is difficult to build every backhoe into a disaster recovery plan. And even if you could, would you want to? Could you afford to?

Former NYSE Euronext Chief Operating Officer Lawrence Leibowitz told the Journal last year the public shouldn't expect market technology to function perfectly, a goal that would be too expensive to implement even if it were technically feasible.

"When you go through a lot of change, there is a higher probability of error. That is just what happens, and that means we need to do a better job of managing change," he said.

On a Busy Day, a Glitch Halts the NYSE

Technical trouble halted trading for nearly four hours on the New York Stock Exchange, jarring investors and traders already unnerved by recent volatility across global financial markets.

It was the first major market glitch since the Securities and Exchange Commission completed more stringent safeguards on U.S. stock and options markets last fall, in response to a dramatic increase in computerized trading in recent years and the ensuing technical troubles that have plagued markets and harmed investor confidence.

The shutdown was isolated to specific trading venues, and investors could still buy and sell NYSE-listed stocks on other venues, such as NYSE's own Arca exchange. NYSE is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

NYSE was quick to dismiss speculation that the trading disruption was caused by hacking. On Twitter, it said the problem "is not the result of a cyber breach."

The suspension came in the middle of a broad selloff in U.S. stocks that was spurred by a deepening rout in China's stock markets. It came on a day when the Federal Reserve disclosed minutes from its last meeting, a release that in the past has prompted swings in stocks.

Floor trading resumed about 3:20 p.m. in New York, roughly 40 minutes before the scheduled close of trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 261.49 points at 17515.42, the S&P 500 fell by 34.65 points, or 1.7%, to 2046.69. The Nasdaq Composite weakened by 87.70 points, or 1.8%, to 4909.76.

NYSE told floor traders that the problem originated in a software update it installed last night, according to Peter Costa, a floor trader and president of Empire Executions. "They told us they did some software updates overnight and tested it without problems, but this morning something happened," Mr. Costa said.

A NYSE spokeswoman wasn't immediately available to comment on the source of the glitch.

Before the full trading suspension, NYSE officials told brokers they were investigating a "reported issue with a gateway connection" affecting trading in some 200 stock symbols, according to emails reviewed by the Journal, including the shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc., Federated Investors Inc. and Time Warner Cable Inc. The "gateway" is a network of computers that institutions and traders use to connect to the system that matches buyers and sellers.

Despite the suspension, trading at Seaport Securities Corp., which has operations on the NYSE floor, didn't stop. Instead, orders were redirected to the firm's operations at 60 Broad Street, just down the street from the exchange.

"It's an inconvenience, it's annoying, but it has not interrupted our business," said Ted Weisberg of Seaport Securities. "It could be nothing more than a simple glitch," he said, but added that people "tend to think the worst" when something comes off the rails.

Regulators and lawmakers in Washington said little except that they were monitoring the situation. SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White said her agency, which oversees NYSE, was in contact with the exchange and was "closely monitoring the situation and trading in NYSE-listed stocks."

A Treasury spokesman said the department was in touch with the SEC, adding the glitch was "primarily a matter for the SEC and NYSE."

Rules finalized in November require trading venues to implement procedures to safeguard computer-trading systems. They were written in response to a series of glitches -- from the "flash crash" of May 6, 2010 to the August 2013 Nasdaq breakdown. The rules give the SEC greater teeth to punish exchanges for failing to quickly recover from a major disruption, said Christopher Nagy, chief executive of KOR Group LLC, a market-structure analytics and consulting firm.

White Houses press secretary Josh Earnest said on Wednesday that President Barack Obama had been briefed on the situation at the NYSE and that federal officials were monitoring it. Mr. Earnest said there was so far "no indication" that malicious actors were responsible for the computer glitch.

U.S. stock market malfunctions have plagued exchanges over the past several years. The biggest outage hit Nasdaq in August of 2013, when a technical problem prevented it from accurately condensing and broadcasting the best bids and offers for Nasdaq-listed stocks. Their system, one of three Securities Information Processors for the stock market, went down for three hours on August 22. Nasdaq halted all trading of Nasdaq-listed stocks during the period, which caused a major disruption for investors.

On Wednesday, Nasdaq said its systems were operating normally and were trading all securities, including those listed on the NYSE.

BATS Global Markets Inc., another major exchange operator, had an issue with one of its markets on Monday. Trading was halted on its EDGX exchange for 30 minutes.

In 2012, a technical error by Knight Capital Group led it to send a stream of incorrect orders into the market. The mistake cost it more than $450 million and laid the groundwork for the firm to be acquired by Getco LLC.

BATS was forced to cancel its own initial public offering in March 2012 because of a technical issue on its exchange.

Fed Throws the Book at Santander --- Regulator scolds bank's U.S. holding company for not fixing previously identified deficiencies

The Federal Reserve issued a stinging lecture to Spanish bank Banco Santander SA, faulting the lender's U.S. unit for failing to meet regulators' standards on a range of basic business operations.

Santander had previously told investors that the Fed was preparing an enforcement action. The one that arrived Tuesday, however, was unusually broad in scope for a bank of Santander's size. It represents the latest crackdown by U.S. regulators, who have been pressing the largest U.S. banks to improve their risk management.

The Fed's recent actions against other banks have typically targeted discrete problems, such as anti-money-laundering controls or mortgage underwriting, rather than reaching across an organization, such as in Santander's case.

Regulators said they found deficiencies, including in how the holding company manages its capital, its daily funding needs and corporate governance. It also faulted risk management at a consumer-lending subsidiary, Santander Consumer USA, Inc.

The chief executive of Santander Consumer abruptly stepped down last week.

The Fed said it identified the issues in its "most recent inspection" of Santander's U.S. holding company.

The regulator doesn't typically pursue public enforcement actions unless a bank repeatedly fails to fix issues the regulator identifies. Separately, Santander Consumer has faced multiple federal inquiries into its auto-lending practices.

The Fed didn't fine the bank but reserved the right to do so later and required the bank to write a series of remedial plans.

"This written agreement underlines how much work we have to do to meet our standards of excellence and our regulators' expectations," a Santander spokesman said in a written statement.

The U.S. holding company has begun "a comprehensive, multiyear transformation project within our organization," the spokesman added, and the company is "confident this project will address the concerns the Federal Reserve has cited."

Santander is the eurozone's largest bank by market value and its U.S. unit has about $123 billion in assets.

Santander's U.S. holding company, which accounted for 14% of the bank's total net profit in the first quarter, has been an outsize regulatory headache for new Executive Chairman Ana Botin. Since she took the helm of the bank last September, she has appointed at the holding company a new chairman, chief executive and board members.

"I cannot fix the U.S. without the right team," Ms. Botin told The Wall Street Journal in early June.

Ms. Botin met three times with Fed governor Daniel Tarullo between October and December 2014, according to a copy of Mr. Tarullo's schedule obtained through a Freedom of Information request.

That was more than any foreign-owned bank executive during the period from May to December of 2014.

The problems disclosed Tuesday are similar to those identified in Fed "stress tests" in both 2014 and 2015. Santander's holding company failed the Fed's annual exams both years because of what the regulator said were "widespread and critical deficiencies" in governance and its inability to identify and plan for potential risks. Santander executives think the U.S. holding company will likely fail the 2016 tests, too, the Journal reported in June.

Tuesday's agreement starts with the basics, requiring Santander's U.S. holding company to describe "the duties and responsibilities" of its top officers and "actions that the board of directors will take to maintain effective control over, and supervision of, the consolidated organization's risk management."

Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., said the move is consistent with regulators' focus on corporate governance.

She said, however, the broad action is "unusual at a time in which the regulators are focused typically on individual lines of business at individual institutions."

The Fed on Tuesday also faulted Santander for failures in "liquidity risk management," indicating the bank may not have satisfactory programs for projecting future cash flows. The regulator suggested Santander isn't complying with the Fed's risk-management guidelines, including those for internal audit programs and computerized risk models.

Another part of the action stated that the bank must comply with federal rules governing executive severance packages and requirements to notify regulators about changes in bank leadership.

Ms. Botin inherited the problems at the U.S. unit from the previous chairman, her father, Emilio Botin, who died in September after nearly three decades at the helm, and has been heavily involved in trying to fix its problems.

On Oct. 9, less than one month after she was named Santander executive chairman, she and then-Chief Executive Javier Marin met for an hour with Mr. Tarullo, the U.S. central bank's regulatory point man, inside the Fed's Washington headquarters, according to Mr. Tarullo's schedule.

During Ms. Botin's brief tenure leading up to that meeting, the Fed had already scolded Santander for paying an unauthorized dividend earlier in 2014 without the Fed's required permission.

Ms. Botin spoke for 15 minutes by phone with Mr. Tarullo on Nov. 10.

She met with him again in Washington on Dec. 10, when they talked privately for an hour, the schedule indicates.

Markets
Firms Analyze Tweets to Gauge Stock Sentiment; Parsing Twitter and others to discern subtle trends is a new frontier

Every day, iSentium LLC, a little-known Florida-based technology company, analyzes one million tweets from traders, investors and market commentators to try to find out whether sentiment for a particular stock is generally high or low.

The answer is simple: either a +1 or a -1 for each stock. Yet a handful of banks, hedge-fund firms and high-frequency traders have signed up for the daily indicator, at a cost of $15,000 per month per stock symbol.

ISentium and several other  sentiment analysis" startups are trying to tap Wall Street's growing desire to harness the world's vast amount of data to make predictions about the movements of stocks and other securities and derivatives.

Traders and certain investors for years have subscribed to products from companies such as Dataminr Inc. that help them scan Twitter and other social media to detect events. But the ability to parse those posts to discern subtle trends is a new frontier.

TheySay Ltd., co-founded by a professor of computational linguistics at Oxford University in the U.K., has started selling its sentiment-analysis products to research analysts, banks and hedge funds, executives at TheySay noted. There are a host of others, including PsychSignal, Guidewave Consulting and Tashtego LLC, a Boston-based asset manager that plans to launch a sentiment-driven fund later this year.

 What we're telling you is what does the mob or the crowd say today," said Gautham Sastri, president and chief executive of iSentium.  Twitter is a big pipeline of emotion and we're providing a snapshot."

The idea of using Twitter as an investing guide has plenty of skeptics, with some pointing to the failure of $40 million Derwent Capital Markets. The investment firm, which made bets based on Twitter analysis, closed after just a month of trading in 2012.

Executives from iSentium and other firms say Twitter can provide a useful signal to investors but generally shouldn't be relied on as the sole reason to make an investment.

ISentium said it has 10 clients paying on a monthly basis. They include large quantitative hedge funds, which use computers to find statistical relationships between data that help predict price movements, as well as traditional hedge funds, family offices and high-frequency-trading firms that use the indicators for market-making strategies.

The company's system breaks down sentences into their key components and analyzes adjectives and actions associated with subjects mentioned in tweets, as well as their location in sentences, among other factors.

It also can identify situations where a person may convey both a negative and a positive in a single utterance.

For instance, on June 24 activist investor Carl Icahn sent the following tweet about Netflix Inc. and Apple Inc.:  Sold last of our $NFLX today. Believe $AAPL currently represents same opportunity we stated NFLX several years ago."

Instead of giving it a score of zero, a negative canceling out a positive, iSentium's system created a -65 sentiment score for Netflix and a +57 score for Apple, the company said. After aggregating data from other Twitter users discussing those companies that day, iSentium came up with an overall indicator of -1 for both companies. The positive sentiment of Mr. Icahn wasn't enough to change the overall signal, according to the company.

Social-media-analytics companies use different techniques to drive market insights. TheySay co-founder Stephen Pulman, a professor at Oxford, said that what sets the U.K.-based company apart is a focus on  compositionality," a principle that examines not only the meaning of words but their arrangement in relation to each other.

 Words in isolation may have a positive or negative sentiment but once you put them together they can often mean something else," Mr. Pulman said.

PsychSignal employed several individuals with Ph.D.s in psychology to create an engine that can track 12 different emotions, including anger, sadness and love. Clients receive two scores bullishness and bearishness and the company plans on introducing more in the coming months.

In addition to popular websites like Twitter and Stocktwits, PsychSignal's universe of social media data also covers information shared on private chat rooms frequented by traders, said founder James Crane-Baker, giving their inputs more of a trading focus.

Twitter Inc. itself also sells data directly to a range of businesses, including hedge funds and banks, a person familiar with its sales said. Some of those buyers have data scientists who conduct their own analysis of tweets, including of sentiment around companies, the person said.

Twitter also signed an agreement with International Business Machines Corp. granting the computer company access to the full  fire hose" of tweets sent from around the world every day.

IBM said the applications went beyond predicting moves in the markets. Its analysts were finding ways to help large banks and retailers create better products and services for their customers.

Mutual funds also are exploring such tools.

Franklin Templeton Inc. has hosted two conferences for fund managers, including in March of this year, to meet with companies that provide novel data sets and analytic tools. A session on social media was titled:  Is it Signal or Noise? Determining Sentiment and Identifying Trends."

Franklin Templeton said it came to a major realization when Russia annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in March 2014. The most granular and fastest news came out of Twitter, rather than traditional news sources, said David Lewis, the firm's head trader.

 We're looking at different things to help us improve our decision making," he said.

U.S. stocks rose Wednesday after Greece sent a fresh bailout proposal to its creditors, fueling hopes of a deal being reached.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 94 points, or 0.5%, to 17715 at midday. The S&P 500 gained nine points, or 0.5%, to 2072, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 15 points, or 0.3%, to 5002.

Even though the proposal for budget cuts and policy overhauls from Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was dismissed by European officials Wednesday, stock markets were cheered by news of the latest offer. The proposals were contained in a letter dated June 30, in which Mr. Tsipras offered to accept a draft proposal disclosed on the commission's website with a handful of changes.

Greece defaulted on a payment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.

"You're starting to see dialogue . . . and see this hard-line stance from the Greek government start to soften," said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. "That is very encouraging."

The largest-ever deal between two insurance companies also added to Wednesday's positive tone.

ACE agreed to buy fellow property-and-casualty insurer Chubb for $28.3 billion in cash and stock. ACE shares rose 1.9% and shares of Chubb jumped 29%.

Shares of insurer Travelers advanced 2.3%, rising the most of the Dow industrials' components.

European stocks rose sharply. France's CAC-40 rose 1.9% and Germany's DAX advanced 2.2%, extending gains after it emerged that Mr. Tsipras had sent creditors a new proposal. The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 1.5%.

The twists and turns in Greece's financial situation have driven markets recently.

Stocks ended higher Tuesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 rebounding from their biggest losses of the year. The uncertainty about Greece's future in the eurozone has propelled the CBOE Volatility Index, which reflects S&P 500 options prices, to nearly five-month highs.

"We're not getting a lot of company news right now that might shift this focus away from some of these political headlines," said Jack Caffrey, equity portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.

Private payrolls in the U.S. increased by 237,000 jobs in June, according to the national employment report released Wednesday by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody'sAnalytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 220,000 gain in jobs.

The week culminates with Thursday's release of the June employment report. Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast employers added 233,000 jobs in June. The U.S. stock market is closed Friday for Independence Day.

Lloyd's chief warns that other sectors have tools to snatch customers

Insurers are in danger of being "Uber-ised" as technology allows companies from Google to Walmart to undermine the sector's role of managing risk, the chief executive of Lloyd's of London is to warn.

Inga Beale will tell the inaugural Financial Times Future of Insurance Conference today that big data analysis threatens to disrupt the industry, just as the taxi trade has been shaken by Uber, the ride-hailing mobile app.

The comments from the head of the 325-year-old insurance market underscore how established operators in a widening range of sectors are braced for technological change.

She joins a growing chorus of insurance executives concerned about disruption. Last month the chief executive of Generali, Europe's third-largest insurer by premiums, said insurance companies " will disappear " unless they embrace the changes.

Insurers are gathering more data on customers, by monitoring their driving through recorders in cars and assessing exercise with wearable devices. This allows them to predict whether policyholders will make claims.

However, executives are increasingly anxious they could be usurped by companies in other sectors - from supermarkets to social media networks - that have larger customer databases they could deploy to provide insurance.

Ecommerce is also threatening insurers' sales channels: Ms Beale is to say that online brokers now account for a fifth of the motor insurance market.

Lloyd's takes on specialist risks for companies - from civil unrest in emerging markets to oil rig disasters. In her speech, Ms Beale argues that insurers that sell more mainstream retail and wholesale policies will be especially exposed to unconventional competitors.

"We need to focus on covering the complex, bespoke and innovative risks that no one else can - because the less complex risks are going to become commoditised pretty fast," she says in her speech.

"We have already seen the impact of better data and new platforms in motor insurance. Insurers will be Uber-ised unless we find new ways to add value."

Ms Beale, formerly chief of Lloyd's franchise Canopius before it was bought by the Japanese insurer Sompo, became the first female chief executive of the market 18 months ago.

Her speech also seeks to address concerns that the historic institution is in danger of losing business to overseas rivals, particularly those in emerging markets. She will make clear that London will "remain Lloyd's pre-eminent hub". However, she plans to add that Lloyd's - which this year opened a hub in Dubai and obtained a licence to open a branch in Beijing - "accepts the need" for a bigger physical presence elsewhere.

"Lloyd's will need an increasingly local presence as new financial centres continue to emerge," Ms Beale will say. "Businesses will not want to fly into London at the drop of the hat."

ON MANAGEMENT
Selecting a know-all chief executive is just plain dumb

When Deutsche Bank named John Cryan as its new chief executive three weeks ago, the commentary had an insidious subtext . He has "an enormous brain", one friend told the FT. "Very thoughtful," said a former colleague. Ominously for Mr Cryan, these comments echoed those made about Vikram Pandit when he unexpectedly stepped down as Citigroup's CEO in 2012. He was "too cerebral", said critics of the Citi boss.

The implication in both cases is that being a brainbox is a disqualification for running some of the largest and most technically complex companies. I was brought up to respect and pursue academic success, but while it grates that the world believes analytically minded swots rarely make great business leaders, the world is right (even if Mr Cryan ultimately turns out to be one of the few exceptions).

No less an intellect than Bill Gates told an invited FT audience last week that his background (learning about the world by reading an encyclopedia, starting at A for Aardvark) made him think at first that the obvious corporate hierarchy would be one based on IQ, with the brightest at the top.

It took only a few years running a business for Mr Gates to realise he had made a colossal error, one that would have doomed Microsoft had he pursued it. "By the age of 25, I knew that IQ comes in different forms," he said. "[Understanding] sales and management seems to be negatively correlated with writing good code or understanding physics equations. That was befuddling for me."

Mr Gates was brought up in an age when IQ testing was popular, before it was revealed that the tests themselves could disadvantage some groups and that such tests measured attributes that were irrelevant in some workplaces. Would you, for instance, rather be rescued by an out of condition firefighter with Mensa membership or a fit one of average IQ with a decade of experience in extinguishing infernos?

The FT asks successful people in its weekly Inventory feature if they have ever undergone an IQ test. Many have. But none that I can recall has said the result had any bearing on their later success. There is a reason why the description of Enron's senior executives as "the smartest guys in the room" was a harbinger of dysfunction and disaster and not a qualification for flexible leadership.

Yet even though the idea that chief executives are omnipotent is fading, the myth of the omniscient corporate boss persists. Leaders remain reluctant to admit publicly that they simply cannot know everything about their business, until an operational blunder or a scandal reveals the truth.

One reason CEOs try to appear all-knowing is that their public appearances - the analyst briefing, the television interview, the conference panel - place unrealistic pressure on imperfect individuals to demonstrate perfect knowledge. At such events, executives are preoccupied with not appearing thick. It would be far more realistic and refreshing if they admitted that, day to day, they often call on lieutenants to answer tricky questions.

The best chief executives do not spend hours alone, applying their "enormous brains" to business problems. When academics from Warwick and Oxford Sad business schools followed leaders in the healthcare sector for a study published in the latest MIT Sloan Management Review , they found that each built a "personal knowledge infrastructure", which consisted of many elements. This infrastructure includes time for thought - one health manager had what he called a "train pile" of research that he could read while travelling. But it also allows for visits to the wards in off-hours to spot problems, analysis of a data "dashboard" of corporate performance and consultations with an inner circle of colleagues.

I see two intelligent ways that clever leaders can apply their IQs: as entrepreneurial founders and as part of a balanced team. Mr Gates did not propose snuffing out bright sparks in business, or switching them for executives with the more modish "EQ" of emotional intelligence. He talked instead about the importance of fishing from three different "IQ pools". To meet his current philanthropic goals, he says, he tries to mix managers with "scientific understanding, business analytics and a passion for being out in the field". The same should go for all organisations: leading them in any other way would be plain stupid.

Inside the winners' circle; FT BIG READ: SILICON VALLEY

Eager to avoid Wall Street 'short-termism' and voracious activist investors, tech entrepreneurs are shunning the IPO market. But this means the wealth they create goes only to those with the right access.

By Richard Waters and Stephen Foley

When he last turned to investors to raise cash a year ago, tech entrepreneur Ken Lin thought a stock market listing was looming on his company's horizon. A rite of passage for many capital-hungry businesses, it seemed only a short period of time before he would follow the well-trodden path to Wall Street.

Last week, however, Mr Lin was back instead for another $175m round of private money for Credit Karma, the personal finance website that he co-founded. "There is a lot more you can do as a private company," says Mr Lin, echoing the views of a generation of tech entrepreneurs who have learnt to shun the public stock market for as long as they can.

By staying private, there is no need to waste time on sweating over quarterly earnings reports. "In public markets, you can lose the long-term view to focus on the short term," says Mr Lin. And with investors lining up to pour cash into companies like Credit Karma, which has sucked in nearly $370m so far, the pressure to conform to Wall Street is off. "You can still raise the dollars in relatively short order, and still have the benefits of being a private company."

Silicon Valley is in the midst of another investment boom, and it is unlike any that has gone before. The tech bubble at the end of the 1990s spilled out on to Wall Street as new companies with no record queued up to do initial public offerings . This time, with valuations once again soaring, the party is raging behind closed doors.

The risk that another bubble is being inflated is only one of the anxieties. The surge of private investment has also raised questions about how well equity markets function on such a large scale without the high levels of disclosure and other checks and balances seen in the public markets.

The exclusive nature of the tech industry 's private investment frenzy has also stirred concerns about how widely the profits from the boom are being shared - and whether the investment game is only for privileged insiders with the right connections or the strongest investment clout.

As a demonstration of the new supremacy of the private markets, last week was noteworthy. It began with news that Uber was on track to increase its total capital raising to $10bn, a record for a private tech company. That was followed by the revelation that Palantir , a secretive artificial intelligence company, was in talks to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a valuation of $20bn, potentially putting it second only to Uber (value: $50bn) in the pecking order of private tech groups.

Palantir's new status was shortlived. By the end of the week, Airbnb was on the brink of a new investment round of its own , valuing it at $24bn, more than double the $10bn it was deemed to be worth 15 months ago. At $1.5bn, Airbnb's fundraising involves more money than was raised in all but the five largest tech IPOs in history.

The surge in private capital has left a dearth of IPOs. Last year, 59 tech companies went public, compared with 258 in 1999, though one was Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce group that raised a record $25bn in its IPO .

One result has been the proliferation of so-called "unicorns", private companies that claim a valuation above $1bn, which number more than 144 globally, with 69 in the US.

The renewed burst of private capital-raising has provided fresh evidence of how the tech industry's financing boom has been limited to a charmed circle of investors able to get a foot in the door of the hottest new prospects. All the risks of this tech cycle are being shouldered by a far narrower circle of investors - but so are the rewards.

'Self-fulfilling prophecy'

Fast-growing tech start-ups once had little choice but to beat a path to Wall Street. "If you needed to raise $100m 10 years ago, there really was only one way to get it," says Andrew Boyd, head of capital markets at mutual fund group Fidelity, one of the most active private market investors. "Now if you need to raise [funds], there is a sizeable group of investors making late-stage investments and it is not super clear that you should go public. Choice is good, and that choice is here to stay."

And with the global economy still struggling, investors have found themselves with few alternatives when they are looking for high-growth businesses. "Growth has never been more valuable to investors than it is today," says Jim Davidson, co-founder of tech private equity firm Silver Lake. Mutual funds, which are judged on their performance relative to their peers, are hungry for any edge they can get.

Hedge funds, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds have also joined the rush, hoping to secure a piece of promising start-ups at just the moment their businesses really take off.

"It's a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy: the only way to be part of the meteoric growth part of the curve is to be in the private market," says Dylan Smith, co-founder of Box, an online storage company that rode the private market for 10 years before going public this year.

Wall Street short-termism has long been a complaint of tech companies, echoing Mr Lin's barb about quarterly reports. Now they can point to a new embodiment of their fears: the activist investors such as Carl Icahn and Paul Singer's Elliott Management who have taken to prowling Silicon Valley, putting pressure on underperforming public tech companies to cut costs, split up their businesses or sell themselves.

The long product cycles of many tech companies require patient investment and make them vulnerable to opportunistic attacks like this, says Scott Kupor, managing partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. That makes staying private for longer a form of self-preservation.

This has shaken up the normal order of the equity markets. Investors who once expected a considerable discount to invest in the illiquid shares of private companies now seem prepared to risk paying a premium, as shown by the IPOs of companies like Box, big data company Hortonworks and software company New Relic, each of which went public recently at a valuation below its last private round.

With investors still clamouring for a piece of the most disruptive new tech start-ups , this inversion of the normal state of affairs could well persist. The belief in the tech world is that the boom has longer to run, even if valuations look extravagant. Yet how this boom in opaque financial markets will unfold is now the subject of intense debate.

To some, it has already accentuated a rise in prices. "When ginormous institutions do a little dabbling in a small asset class, they have a large price impact," says Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners, which acts as a broker for investors looking to buy private company shares.

Adding to this upward pressure on prices, says one investor, is the lack of any ability to "short" the stocks of private companies. That removes one of the public market's main mechanisms for tempering the excessive enthusiasm that sometimes breaks out in equities.

High rollers' table

There is also heated debate about the essential fairness of the new market structures that are emerging. Companies that are able to pick and choose between potential backers are often selecting groups like Fidelity, T Rowe Price and Wellington, leaving smaller institutions and private investors out in the cold. This has led to a "bifurcated market", says Mr Kupor at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the VCs that has invested most aggressively in the boom. "We're certainly closing off a large part of the market to the broader retail [investor] base." Private investors like Andreessen, he adds, will benefit "disproportionately".

If the previous tech boom sucked naive personal investors into a bubble, the opposite is now the case. Under US regulations, only "accredited investors" - those with substantial personal assets - are allowed into private investments.

But even most of these have no way of investing, unless they are clients of a powerful investment bank or want to take their chances buying on one of the private secondary marketplaces that have started to spring up.

Those forced to wait until hot companies like Uber go public are likely to miss out on the biggest gains. "By the time a deal gets to the public, it will be a shallower growth curve," says Lise Buyer, an adviser on IPOs who worked on Google's public listing a decade ago.

There is also a danger that new incentives engendered by the private market will create unanticipated risks. The greatest risk, according to experts, may stem from the terms that private investors often demand to protect themselves in the event that a company goes public at a lower valuation. Under an arrangement called a "ratchet", these investors receive extra shares to compensate for any shortfall, diluting the interests of other shareholders.

Companies that grant ratchets are not really valued as highly as they claim, says Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. In effect, they have given investors a free insurance policy - a sweetener that is not reflected in the headline numbers.

Claiming a valuation of $1bn, a level that brings the much-desired status of "unicorn", has become a way to attract attention in the absence of a full public listing. That many companies claim to have just reached or narrowly topped this level suggests that they have granted special backroom terms like ratchets to get an extra lift, according to law firm Fenwick & West.

Those who suffer from this are likely to be tech company employees who are paid partly in stock that does not have any downside protection, says Ms Buyer. Investors who buy in secondary markets and are misled by the headline valuations into overpaying could also be hurt.

Cashing in the chips

The last and most important chapter in the tech boom is yet to be written. Even as venture capitalists and other private investors watch the notional value of their holdings soar, they cannot escape the fact that none of it means anything until they cash in their chips. With companies staying private longer, the "liquidity events" that cap successful start-up investing have been delayed indefinitely.

"At some stage every investor will want to take liquidity, whatever their horizon is," says Mr Smith at Box. Certainly, the mutual funds that have crowded into the private markets have made it clear they are there with an expectation of IPOs in the near future.

"Our opportunities are in those that will typically IPO," says Mr Boyd. "We do not look at assets that will get flipped to a strategic buyer."

The day of reckoning for hot private tech companies has been pushed back. But all investment cycles turn. The older this one gets, the greater the risks.

Jobs Act

Law to cut red tape offers incentive to stay private

One of the main forces behind the upending of the usual order in US equity markets has been a piece of legislation that backers claimed would encourage companies to go public, but has had the opposite effect.

The Jumpstart Our Businesses Act was intended to cut the regulation on companies looking to go public. Signing it into law three years ago, President Barack Obama said it was important for more growing companies to list their shares on Wall Street. Public companies tend to expand and hire more workers, he said, and they "operate with greater oversight and greater transparency".

Buried in the legislation, however, was a provision that turned out to be a gift for companies preferring to escape the rigours of being publicly listed.

Previously, private companies had to publish detailed financial information about their operations when their shareholder numbers hit 500, a requirement that was often a catalyst for an initial public offering, since it removed one of the main attractions of staying private.

Facebook's IPO in 2012, triggered after it hit the 500 shareholder limit, drew attention to the rule. By lifting the limit to 2,000, the new law has removed the pressure to list.

Critics argue that this has barred ordinary stock market investors from investing in the hottest new tech companies. "The outcome of the Jobs Act was to widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots," says Lise Buyer, an IPO adviser in Silicon Valley.

Other pieces of financial regulation have had a bigger effect on discouraging companies from seeking a listing, market participants say. Much of the criticism has been levelled at the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed in the wake of the Enron scandal and has been widely attacked in Silicon Valley for imposing excessive regulation on young companies.

"The infrastructure on which our public markets are built is all from the 1930s, and the patches on top of that operating system have led to a situation where companies do not want to be public," says Rett Wallace, founder of Triton Research, a private company research firm.

Speed read

Mediaocean, a software supplier to advertising agencies, has agreed to sell a majority stake to Vista Equity Partners in a deal that values the company at roughly $720 million.

The New York-based company provides software to help advertising firms manage tasks from planning and analyzing advertising campaigns to billing. Mediaocean's software processed $108 billion of ad spending in 2014, including for television, print, out-of-home, radio and digital, Bill Wise, the company's chief executive, said in an interview.

Mediaocean was formed in 2012 through the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204422404576592923419587268"Donovan Data Systems Inc. and MediaBank LLC, which were led by Michael Donovan and Mr. Wise, respectively. Messrs. Donovan and Wise will retain stakes of around 17.5% and 2.5% respectively, following the deal with Vista, Mr. Wise said.

Vista, a private-equity firm that focuses on investments in software, data and technology-based companies, last year raised some $5.8 billion for its latest fund.

Mr. Wise agreed to meet Vista's co-founder and President Brian Sheth and after exploring other options including an initial public offering, agreed to a deal, he said.

 We see Vista more as a holding company for software companies than a private-equity firm," said Mr. Wise. He and Vista's Mr. Sheth say advice from Vista and this investment will help Mediaocean consolidate its traditional and digital products, develop new products and enter new markets.

 While traditional media is inherently local, digital media is global. It took Mediaocean four decades to enter six markets but I believe it'll take us four years to enter the next 60," Mr. Wise said.

The company competes in some areas against Google Inc.'s ad-serving arm DoubleClick, Facebook Inc.'s ad-serving and management unit Atlas and Comcast Corp.'s media software maker Strata Marketing Inc., he said. Its offshore competitors include Australia's BCC AdSystems and France's MBS.

Mediaocean has struck a number of partnerships and last month "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/05/21/moat-and-mediaocean-partner-to-help-marketers-buy-viewable-ads/" in a deal designed to enable advertisers to purchase only ad inventory that has been determined to be actually viewable on a Web page.

When he last turned to investors to raise cash a year ago, tech entrepreneur Ken Lin thought a stock market listing was looming on his company s horizon. A rite of passage for many capital-hungry businesses, it seemed only a short period of time before he would follow the well-trodden path to Wall Street.

Last week, however, Mr Lin was back instead for another $175m round of private money for Credit Karma, the personal finance website that he co-founded.  There is a lot more you can do as a private company,  says Mr Lin, echoing the views of a generation of tech entrepreneurs who have learnt to shun the public stock market for as long as they can.

By staying private, there is no need to waste time on sweating over quarterly earnings reports.  In public markets, you can lose the long-term view to focus on the short term,  says Mr Lin. And with investors lining up to pour cash into companies like Credit Karma, which has sucked in nearly $370m so far, the pressure to conform to Wall Street is off.  You can still raise the dollars in relatively short order, and still have the benefits of being a private company. 

Silicon Valley is in the midst of another investment boom, and it is unlike any that has gone before. The tech bubble at the end of the 1990s spilled out on to Wall Street as new companies with no record queued up to do initial public offerings. This time, with valuations once again soaring, the party is raging behind closed doors.

The risk that another bubble is being inflated is only one of the anxieties. The surge of private investment has also raised questions about how well equity markets function on such a large scale without the high levels of disclosure and other checks and balances seen in the public markets.

The exclusive nature of the "http://www.ft.com/companies/technology" s private investment frenzy has also stirred concerns about how widely the profits from the boom are being shared   and whether the investment game is only for privileged insiders with the right connections or the strongest investment clout.

As a demonstration of the new supremacy of the private markets, last week was noteworthy. It began with news that Uber was on track to increase its total capital raising to $10bn, a record for a private tech company. That was followed by the revelation that Palantir, a secretive artificial intelligence company, was in talks to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a valuation of $20bn, potentially putting it second only to Uber (value: $50bn) in the pecking order of private tech groups.

Palantir s new status was shortlived. By the end of the week, Airbnb was on the brink of a new investment round of its own, valuing it at $24bn, more than double the $10bn it was deemed to be worth 15 months ago. At $1.5bn, Airbnb s fundraising involves more money than was raised in all but the five largest tech IPOs in history.

The surge in private capital has left a dearth of IPOs. Last year, 59 tech companies went public, compared with 258 in 1999, though one was Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce group that raised a record $25bn in its IPO.

One result has been the proliferation of so-called  unicorns , private companies that claim a valuation above $1bn, which number more than 144 globally, with 69 in the US.

The renewed burst of private capital-raising has provided fresh evidence of how the tech industry s financing boom has been limited to a charmed circle of investors able to get a foot in the door of the hottest new prospects. All the risks of this tech cycle are being shouldered by a far narrower circle of investors   but so are the rewards.

 Self-fulfilling prophecy 

Fast-growing tech start-ups once had little choice but to beat a path to Wall Street.  If you needed to raise $100m 10 years ago, there really was only one way to get it,  says Andrew Boyd, head of capital markets at mutual fund group Fidelity, one of the most active private market investors.  Now if you need to raise [funds], there is a sizeable group of investors making late-stage investments and it is not super clear that you should go public. Choice is good, and that choice is here to stay. 

And with the global economy still struggling, investors have found themselves with few alternatives when they are looking for high-growth businesses.  Growth has never been more valuable to investors than it is today,  says Jim Davidson, co-founder of tech private equity firm Silver Lake. Mutual funds, which are judged on their performance relative to their peers, are hungry for any edge they can get.

Hedge funds, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds have also joined the rush, hoping to secure a piece of promising start-ups at just the moment their businesses really take off.

 It s a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy: the only way to be part of the meteoric growth part of the curve is to be in the private market,  says Dylan Smith, co-founder of Box, an online storage company that rode the private market for 10 years before going public this year.

Wall Street short-termism has long been a complaint of tech companies, echoing Mr Lin s barb about quarterly reports. Now they can point to a new embodiment of their fears: the activist investors such as Carl Icahn and Paul Singer s Elliott Management who have taken to prowling Silicon Valley, putting pressure on underperforming public tech companies to cut costs, split up their businesses or sell themselves.

The long product cycles of many tech companies require patient investment and make them vulnerable to opportunistic attacks like this, says Scott Kupor, managing partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. That makes staying private for longer a form of self-preservation.

This has shaken up the normal order of the equity markets. Investors who once expected a considerable discount to invest in the illiquid shares of private companies now seem prepared to risk paying a premium, as shown by the IPOs of companies like Box, big data company Hortonworks and software company New Relic, each of which went public recently at a valuation below its last private round.

With investors still clamouring for a piece of the most disruptive new "http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Tech_start-ups", this inversion of the normal state of affairs could well persist. The belief in the tech world is that the boom has longer to run, even if valuations look extravagant. Yet how this boom in opaque financial markets will unfold is now the subject of intense debate.

To some, it has already accentuated a rise in prices.  When ginormous institutions do a little dabbling in a small asset class, they have a large price impact,  says Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners, which acts as a broker for investors looking to buy private company shares.

Adding to this upward pressure on prices, says one investor, is the lack of any ability to  short  the stocks of private companies. That removes one of the public market s main mechanisms for tempering the excessive enthusiasm that sometimes breaks out in equities.

High rollers  table

There is also heated debate about the essential fairness of the new market structures that are emerging. Companies that are able to pick and choose between potential backers are often selecting groups like Fidelity, T Rowe Price and Wellington, leaving smaller institutions and private investors out in the cold. This has led to a  bifurcated market , says Mr Kupor at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the VCs that has invested most aggressively in the boom.  We re certainly closing off a large part of the market to the broader retail [investor] base.  Private investors like Andreessen, he adds, will benefit  disproportionately .

If the previous tech boom sucked naive personal investors into a bubble, the opposite is now the case. Under US regulations, only  accredited investors    those with substantial personal assets   are allowed into private investments.

But even most of these have no way of investing, unless they are clients of a powerful investment bank or want to take their chances buying on one of the private secondary marketplaces that have started to spring up.

Those forced to wait until hot companies like Uber go public are likely to miss out on the biggest gains.  By the time a deal gets to the public, it will be a shallower growth curve,  says Lise Buyer, an adviser on IPOs who worked on Google s public listing a decade ago.

There is also a danger that new incentives engendered by the private market will create unanticipated risks. The greatest risk, according to experts, may stem from the terms that private investors often demand to protect themselves in the event that a company goes public at a lower valuation. Under an arrangement called a  ratchet , these investors receive extra shares to compensate for any shortfall, diluting the interests of other shareholders.

Companies that grant ratchets are not really valued as highly as they claim, says Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. In effect, they have given investors a free insurance policy   a sweetener that is not reflected in the headline numbers.

Claiming a valuation of $1bn, a level that brings the much-desired status of  unicorn , has become a way to attract attention in the absence of a full public listing. That many companies claim to have just reached or narrowly topped this level suggests that they have granted special backroom terms like ratchets to get an extra lift, according to law firm Fenwick & West.

Those who suffer from this are likely to be tech company employees who are paid partly in stock that does not have any downside protection, says Ms Buyer. Investors who buy in secondary markets and are misled by the headline valuations into overpaying could also be hurt.

Cashing in the chips

The last and most important chapter in the tech boom is yet to be written. Even as venture capitalists and other private investors watch the notional value of their holdings soar, they cannot escape the fact that none of it means anything until they cash in their chips. With companies staying private longer, the  liquidity events  that cap successful start-up investing have been delayed indefinitely.

 At some stage every investor will want to take liquidity, whatever their horizon is,  says Mr Smith at Box. Certainly, the mutual funds that have crowded into the private markets have made it clear they are there with an expectation of IPOs in the near future.

 Our opportunities are in those that will typically IPO,  says Mr Boyd.  We do not look at assets that will get flipped to a strategic buyer. 

The day of reckoning for hot private tech companies has been pushed back. But all investment cycles turn. The older this one gets, the greater the risks.

Jobs Act: Law to cut red tape offers incentive to stay private

One of the main forces behind the upending of the usual order in US equity markets has been a piece of legislation that backers claimed would encourage companies to go public, but has had the opposite effect.

The Jumpstart Our Businesses Act was intended to cut the regulation on companies looking to go public. Signing it into law three years ago, President Barack Obama said it was important for more growing companies to list their shares on Wall Street. Public companies tend to expand and hire more workers, he said, and they  operate with greater oversight and greater transparency .

Buried in the legislation, however, was a provision that turned out to be a gift for companies preferring to escape the rigours of being publicly listed.

Previously, private companies had to publish detailed financial information about their operations when their shareholder numbers hit 500, a requirement that was often a catalyst for an initial public offering, since it removed one of the main attractions of staying private.

Facebook s IPO in 2012, triggered after it hit the 500 shareholder limit, drew attention to the rule. By lifting the limit to 2,000, the new law has removed the pressure to list.

Critics argue that this has barred ordinary stock market investors from investing in the hottest new tech companies.  The outcome of the Jobs Act was to widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots,  says Lise Buyer, an IPO adviser in Silicon Valley.

Other pieces of financial regulation have had a bigger effect on discouraging companies from seeking a listing, market participants say. Much of the criticism has been levelled at the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed in the wake of the Enron scandal and has been widely attacked in Silicon Valley for imposing excessive regulation on young companies.

 The infrastructure on which our public markets are built is all from the 1930s, and the patches on top of that operating system have led to a situation where companies do not want to be public,  says Rett Wallace, founder of Triton Research, a private company research firm.

UK COMPANIES
Sophos unlocks 1bn valuation for IPO; Technology

Cyber security venture taps UK interest in sector with plan to raise $125m

Sophos has revealed the pricing of its initial public offering, valuing the Oxfordshire-based cyber security company at 1bn in what would be one of the largest flotations by a technology company in the UK.

The company, which is majority-owned by the private equity group Apax Partners, said yesterday that its shares would be priced at 225p. The offering will raise $125m, substantially more than it had planned when the company this month announced its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange.

Sophos goes public at a time of heightened interest in the cyber security sector, following a number of high-profile hacking attacks on companies including Sony Pictures Entertainment and Target. This week it emerged that Palantir , a Silicon Valley big data company that does some work in protecting computer networks, was looking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars.

Sophos is offering close to 35 per cent of its shares, but will have an overallotment option of a further 15 per cent that could raise an extra 52.8m. The free float will take place on July 1.

The IPO will create a rare, publicly listed big UK technology group. Other public companies in the sector include Arm Holdings, the chip-design company, and Sage, the accountancy software business.

Megabuyte, the research group, said it was "a little perplexed" with the "toppy" valuation for Sophos, saying such a high level was sustainable only if it could continue to accelerate its revenue growth. "If it can't, then it may be a bit of a disappointing ride for investors."

It is the third time Sophos has attempted an IPO. It was forced to pull plans to list at the last minute in 2007 when the financial crisis hit.

Two years later it considered a float again, but co-founders Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer opted instead to sell a majority stake to Apax in 2010 in a deal that valued the company at $830m.

The company is operating in the fiercely competitive cyber security sector, dominated by US companies such as McAfee and Symantec. But Sophos has developed a niche by targeting products at small and medium-sized companies, which typically cannot employ large IT teams on-site and require simpler and cheaper options than those adopted by large corporate entities.

Sophos said the proceeds of the IPO would help reduce its net debt, which stood at $318m at the end of April, as well as give it "greater financial flexibility to drive the future growth of the business".

The Abingdon-based company reported billings of $476m in the year to March - a 22 per cent increase from the previous year. It posted cash earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $101m. Sophos generates just over half of its sales in Europe, about a third in the US and the rest in Asia-Pacific.

Apax has a 65 per cent stake in the company, which will fall to just over 40 per cent after the IPO. The remainder is owned by management and investors.

FT REPORT - RECRUITMENT
Banks become wise to the age of data; STERN ON BOARDS

"Perhaps, not before time, boring banking is starting to make a comeback," observed John Kay last week in the light of big announcements at Deutsche Bank and HSBC. Yet the next day John Gapper, also of this parish, reported that Goldman Sachs was about to start offering loans to consumers and small businesses through an online banking platform: a muscular new entrant into the peer-to-peer lending world.

Which of the two Johns is correct? Is it time for safety first in this controversial and highly politicised sector? Or will fortune favour the brave in an age of turbulence and disruption?

A new paper called "Making the future now" published today by Egon Zehnder (EZ), the search firm, offers some sharp commentary on coming changes in the financial services industries. There is a lot for boards (and not only in the financial services sector) to grapple with. Boring it is not.

"Financial services companies now are in the crosshairs of transformation," the report states. Banks and other financial services players have been living in a "walled garden", where a lack of outside competition and customer inertia have allowed businesses to remain essentially unchanged for decades.

That steady-state era is coming to an end, rapidly. Digital technology and empowered customers are the reason why. Not surprisingly, as a search firm EZ has had some thoughts as to what this means for key roles inside firms.

Their report contains a striking list of new posts which might need to be filled: not merely a chief digital officer, of course, but a "head of user experience", a "head of analytics", a "head of engineering", and a "head of talent and culture" - this last one not being a new role, but one that has new significance.

As Axelle Sznajer, a member of EZ's financial technology team, says: "Financial services firms will need to bring in new competencies, and hire people who are 'transformational' - they may come from other sectors and have very a different approach."

But, she adds, this is not just about making the odd new hire. "The changes have to go company wide, including at board level . . . people at the top have to embrace these changes and structure it into a broader conversation about talent," she says.

This does not sound like a very boring proposition. In the financial services sector compliance remains an unavoidable issue, and the sober respectability that bankers once possessed is urgently being sought.

But with new entrants ready to disrupt the market, safety first does not make much sense. And the lessons here have an impact beyond elegant marble banking halls.

"Every company is ultimately a tech company, a data company," EZ's Ms Sznajer says. A good sound bite, but also a call for boards to adapt.

Palantir, the big data start-up company that began life catering to the intelligence services, is raising funds at a $20bn valuation, more than doubling its worth in a year and a half.

The CIA-backed company is fundraising as its bookings   forward revenue   have more than doubled this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The investors participating in this round are not known.

The fundraising would make Palantir one of the most valuable private companies in Silicon Valley   behind Uber, which is seeking a $50bn valuation, according to other people familiar with the matter, but more than Snapchat, which was last raising funds at a $16bn valuation.

Palantir has moved beyond its original business of providing intelligence and analytics to government agencies, which won it initial funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA s not-for-profit venture capital firm.

It is now selling its software globally to industries from banking to the media. It offers anti-fraud services, warnings about insider trading threats and programmes to accelerate research and development in pharmaceuticals.

The company raised money at a $9bn valuation in December 2013, according to people familiar with the matter, and is reported to have been valued at roughly $15bn late last year.

Palantir is one of a new generation of highly valued start-ups in Silicon Valley that are remaining private for longer. The 11-year-old company was founded by chief executive Alex Karp; Peter Thiel, the ex-PayPal venture capitalist; Joe Lonsdale, now at VC firm Foundation 8; Nathan Gettings; and Stephen Cohen.

Mr Karp said in 2013 that the company would not pursue an initial public offering because it would make running a company like Palantir  very difficult .

Investors include Mr Thiel s Founders Fund, 137 Ventures, and Reed Elsevier Ventures. The fundraising was first reported by BuzzFeed.

Palantir has denied that its "http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2013/06/palantir-prism/", which it licenses to the financial industry for research, is the same as the US government programme of the same name that was exposed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Global Finance: Suit Lifts Lid on Secret Trading Sauce

A legal dispute in San Francisco is shedding light on the secret tools that some of the biggest quantitative hedge funds, including WorldQuant LLC and Two Sigma Investments LLC, use to predict stock prices.

In the lawsuit, Ashbury Heights Capital LLC, a small investment company founded by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates, has accused a former data partner of underreporting revenue and misusing intellectual property. This month, a judge ruled against a motion from the defendants to move the case to confidential arbitration and set a trial for September 2016.

The case has provided a rare look inside some of the most private firms on Wall Street and the data and analytical techniques they use to trade stocks.

At the core of the dispute is a methodology designed by Ashbury that helps predict "how stock prices would move, largely based on economic information and extrapolations from companies' network of customer-supplier relationships," the complaint says.

Ashbury's system helps an investor accurately model the impact of disparate events on publicly traded companies using supply-chain analysis, according to court documents. For instance, it might help a company predict what would happen to Intel Corp.'s share price if International Business Machine Corp. sees a drop in sales.

A 2010 white paper by its creators said the system uses similar tools to how Google Inc. ranks pages on the Internet alongside a branch of mathematics called graph theory to "provide a meaningful, consistent analysis of the economy over the long term and ultimately provide a basis for alpha generation."

An innovation in the system was its ability to estimate values that weren't publicly available, Ashbury said in court documents.

Founders Eric McGill and Paul Mingardi met at MIT, where they both received degrees in the university's joint master of business administration and master of science program, and later formed Ashbury in San Francisco. The firm operates a small hedge fund and conducts analysis.

In 2010, Ashbury formed a partnership with a data company called Revere Data. In the partnership, Revere licensed Ashbury's system to several hedge funds alongside its proprietary data set, the documents say.

The new product, described by Revere as its "Relationship Analytics Engine," boosted sales and brought in new clients, court documents say.

WorldQuant and Two Sigma were among Revere's quantitative hedge-fund clients, which also included Renaissance Technologies LLC and BlueCrest Capital Management LLP, court documents show. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also signed up for a trial of the data, the documents show.

Quantitative investors rely mainly on mathematical models and use computers to bet on statistical relationships among securities prices and other sets of data.

Representatives of the hedge funds and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.

Ashbury alleges that Revere broke the terms of its contract by not reporting all the revenue it received from licensing and misused Ashbury's intellectual property. Revere was sold to FactSet Research Systems Inc., a publicly traded analytics company, in 2013 for $15 million. FactSet is a defendant in Ashbury's suit.

Rachel Stern, a senior vice president of FactSet, declined to comment.

Jonathan Bass, a lawyer representing Revere and former co-chairman of the company Douglas Engmann, said in a statement that his clients "performed their contractual obligations to Ashbury Heights Capital."

Mr. Engmann, now the chairman of Sage Brokerage Holdings in San Francisco, is a former chairman of the now defunct Pacific Exchange.

Banks' ageing IT systems buckle under strain; Failures mount for costly and unwieldy platforms as hacking attacks and regulator demands for data add to pressure

Igor Feitoza, a Brazilian-born entrepreneur, left an angry message on his bank's Facebook page this week.

"I want to see if you guys will pay my overdue bills and my employees as I can't access my money which I . . . deposited last Friday to pay them," he wrote following a "ridiculous" three hours spent at the bank.

Mr Feitoza is not one of the many frustrated Royal Bank of Scotland customers hit by the latest technology failure this week. He is a client of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country's biggest bank by market capitalisation, which had its reputation as one of the most digitally advanced lenders tarnished by an outage in its payment and online systems late last week.

As well as provoking outbursts on social media, the technology glitches at RBS, which caused some 600,000 payments and direct debits to go missing, and CBA underline how the world's biggest banks are often failing to get to grips with the growing demands being placed on their IT platforms.

Banks spent about $188bn on IT last year and that figure is expected to grow at close to 5 per cent a year, taking it above $200bn by next year, according to Celent, the research company.

Many banks, such as RBS, are plagued by computer systems that have been built up over several decades through acquisitions and new product launches to form a costly and complex patchwork of systems.

"A lot of these programmes get three-quarters done," says a senior technology executive at one of the largest US banks. "It's one of these technical debt problems that builds up over the course of time. If you have one thing happen it might cause the whole thing to fall down."

The cost of maintaining these often ageing and unwieldy systems eats up three-quarters of banks' IT spending, according to Celent. That leaves only a quarter to spend on innovations to keep up with the rapidly emerging threat from the many technology groups and start-ups trying to steal market share in areas such as payments.

"For a sector that spends significantly more on technology than most other sectors in the world, it is the least innovative, so there is a paradox here," says Bill Michaels, head of financial services in Europe at KPMG.

As many banks struggle in the post-financial crisis environment to generate returns above their cost of capital, these spiralling costs and inefficiencies are becoming increasingly unacceptable to both managers and shareholders.

RBS, which last year paid a record fine to regulators for a bigger systems outage in 2012, hoped to solve its problems by replacing its core processing engine at a cost of 750m. But in a recent interview , chief executive Ross McEwan conceded there was still a big job to reduce the number of systems and applications at RBS from more than 3,000.

Asian banks spend more than Europeans or US rivals on IT; their spending is growing faster; and more of their IT money is going on new projects than on maintenance. However, they are hardly glitch-free.

In January, a problem in the system linking accounts at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's largest lender, with securities brokerages, disrupted Rmb4.9bn in fund transfers, affecting nearly 55,000 customers at 90 brokerages.

As regulators make ever growing demands on banks to provide them with vast amounts of data covering areas from stress tests to anti-money laundering checks, banks are racing to keep their systems up to speed.

Deutsche Bank insiders blamed its failure in this year's US stress test on years of under-investment in IT that made it unable to meet US regulators' demands.

Concern is growing about cyber security after high-profile hacking attacks, such as last year's theft of data on 76m customers from computer systems at JPMorgan Chase.

Executives say this focus on cyber security is a catalyst for change, pushing banks to simplify and upgrade their IT systems. "Making something secure requires it to be consistent and clean and up to date and well managed," says the US tech executive.

James O'Neill, senior analyst at Celent, predicts that within a decade most big banks will have switched from using costly mainframe computers for overnight processing of customer data to using much more flexible cloud-based services.

If nothing else, the shortage of developers trained in the Cobol programming language that drives most bank mainframes will force them to make the switch. Australia's CBA has moved to a cloud-based system, while Deutsche recently outsourced many of its applications to a cloud provider.

"The story about legacy systems impeding innovation is a bit oversold," says Mr O'Neill. "I'm not saying they will go on for ever, but they have done a pretty decent job of supplying new products and services."

Like many sectors, however, banks are realising the need to harness the power of "big data" to offer better digital services to their customers.

Mr Michael at KPMG says his banking clients know the stakes are high. "They have seen what technology has done to music and home shopping and so far they have been relatively slow to adapt - but the longer they wait the harder it will get."

Legacy systems

BBVA head says lenders must replace 'spaghetti'

Francisco Gonzlez, the former software engineer who is now chief executive of Spain's BBVA, is scathing about the messy compromises many banks make to patch their IT systems together.

"Most of the banks have started at the rooftop. How did they manage to work without the foundations and the floors? Just middleware - more spaghetti on the spaghetti," he says in an interview with the Financial Times.

After rounds of acquisitions, many large retail and commercial banks are tangled up in legacy systems which risk breaking or presenting opportunities for intruders to gain access.

Banks are building on yet more features to present an attractive digital product to consumers. At the same time, financial technology start-ups are nibbling away at the business, presenting what Mr Gonzlez asserts is an existential challenge for lenders.

"My view is that many of them won't make it," he says. "We are ahead of the pack and we aspire to be the disrupter."

BBVA has spent more than  ¬850m annually on technology for the past few years, including the painful and expensive decision to replace legacy systems - Mr Gonzalez's loathed spaghetti - with a modern data centre .

He now feels ready to tackle the US, where he has the country's 33rd largest bank by assets, branded BBVA Compass, which last year acquired Simple , a digital bank.

The US is "the largest market in the world, one of the most digital societies in the world, and the retail banking system is quite elementary, Mr Gonzlez says. "The gap has to be filled by someone and we want to be one of the guys," he says.

Demis Hassabis

Game on at Oxford

Artificial intelligence pioneer Demis Hassabis has emerged as one of several additions to the advisory board of Oxford Sciences Innovation, City Insider hears.

OSI is entering a joint venture with the University of Oxford and its tech subsidiary Isis Innovation, to develop science and technology businesses. Fundraising for the venture - one of the largest attempts to commercialise intellectual property in the UK - has hit 320m.

Fresh backing is coming from Google Ventures and Sir Charles Dunstone, Carphone Warehouse founder. Sir Charles and Google Ventures' Tom Hulme and Dr Krishna Yeshwant are also joining the advisory board, which is chaired by Dave Norwood, founder of IP Group, and includes Pete Davies and Alex Snow from the Lansdowne Partners hedge fund.

The OSI partnership will provide seed capital to companies that are spinning out from the university's maths, physical and life sciences division and medical sciences. It is already backed by investors including Lansdowne, Neil Woodford Investment Management and the Wellcome Trust.

Bringing Mr Hassabis on board is a coup for the venture. He became a chess master at the age of 13 and was described by the organisers of the Mind Sports Olympiad as "probably the best games player in history". He founded DeepMind, an AI company, with the aim of making "machines smart" and sold it to Google for 400m a year ago.

Simon Danczuk

Courage rewarded

Simon Danczuk has been awarded the Contrarian Prize, which aims to recognise individuals in public life who "stand up for what they believe in and suffer as a result".

The Labour MP for Rochdale, who exposed the alleged paedophilia of Cyril Smith, the former Rochdale MP, saw off competition from other nominees including George Galloway, London mayoral candidate and former MP.

Ali Miraj, who founded the prize, is an ING banker and DJ, who runs a monthly night in Shoreditch called Decks and the City. He tells City Insider: "Danczuk has displayed considerable courage in taking on the establishment."

Charles Stanley

Year of changes

Mixed fortunes this week at Charles Stanley. On Wednesday its rival Panmure Gordon announced that it had exchanged contracts to acquire the troubled City stockbroker's investment banking division.

For Charles Stanley the disposal is part of an overhaul in its business model. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Yesterday the group reported a 6.1m loss for the 12 months to March 31, down from a 6.1m profit the previous year.

Paul Abberley , the group's new chief executive, said this was a year of "substantial change", one of the most significant since its creation in 1792.

Summer parties

Bash clash

The summer party season has kicked off in earnest, bringing with it the inevitable clashes.

This week the bashes of the British Bankers' Association and The CityUK coincided. Next Tuesday the Financial Times and PR impresario Sir Alan Parker, chairman of Brunswick, go head to head.

For those lucky enough to be invited to both, City Insider has a handy solution. A (pink?) champagne cruise service to whisk guests along the Thames from the FT party on the Southbank to Sir Alan's bash in the Chelsea Physic Garden (and back again).

SEC Pacts Set On Muni-Bond Disclosures

By Aaron Kuriloff

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged 36 municipal underwriting firms, including units of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., with making false statements or omissions in bond documents, the first penalties for underwriters under the agency's voluntary self-reporting program targeting inaccuracies in those documents.

Between 2010 and 2014, the firms violated federal law by selling municipal bonds with offering documents that "contained materially false statements or omissions about the bond issuers' compliance with continuing disclosure obligations," the SEC said. The firms also failed to conduct due diligence to identify those inaccurate statements or omissions before selling the bonds, the agency said.

The 36 firms settled the cases for a combined total of around $9 million, without admitting or denying the findings, and agreed to cease and desist from such actions in the future, the SEC said. Under the terms of the Municipal Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative, the largest firms will pay civil penalties of up to $500,000, and smaller firms will pay up to $100,000, based on the number and size of the offerings. They also agreed to retain an independent consultant to review policies and procedures for underwriting municipal bonds.

"The MCDC initiative has already resulted in significant improvements to the municipal securities market, including heightened awareness of issuers' disclosure obligations and enhanced disclosure policies and procedures," said Mary Jo White, chairman of the SEC, said in the release. "This ongoing enforcement initiative will continue to bring lasting changes to the municipal securities markets for the benefit of investors."

The program began in 2014, offering favorable settlement terms to underwriters and issuers who voluntarily reported disclosure problems tied to bond sales. Those included such issues as failing to disclose missed filings of financial reports or filing them late.

Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said the settlements reflected the firms' cooperation and self-reporting of possible violations, which he said already had improved disclosure practices in the $3.7 trillion market for debt sold by U.S. state and local governments. Those involved underwrote about 70% of the dollar value of all municipal bonds issued in the U.S. in the past four fiscal years, he said.

"Municipal investors are the big winners here," he said in a call with reporters.

Representatives for J.P. Morgan and Bank of America declined to comment, and a Citi spokesman said they are "pleased to have the matter resolved." All three firms paid the maximum $500,000.

Matt Fabian, partner at Concord, Mass., research firm Municipal Market Analytics, said it remains to be seen what the SEC will do with government entities that also made misstatements or omissions in bond documents. The program has made both issuers and underwriters more aware of the importance of disclosure, which will be helpful to investors, he said.

"Any time you have that kind of impact, even if it's small individually, it's a big deal for the market," he said.

Real Estate
Some Homeowners Go Solo to Sell Their Real Estate; Emboldened by a rebounding market, some luxury homeowners are bypassing real-estate agents and trying to sell their own homes.

Verley Platt, a 72-year-old Philadelphian, decided to go solo. In April, she listed her stone Colonial home sans real-estate agent for $1.1 million.

A quick sale at asking price, she figured, could save her $66,000 in agent commissions worth all the hard work.  That's a lot to spend for someone else to sell your house," says Ms. Platt, who runs an online business selling hats to cancer patients.

In the past few years, more luxury homeowners like Ms. Platt have taken the  for sale by owner," or FSBO, route, according to data from real-estate website Zillow. In April, 3.5% of high-end listings defined as the top 5% priciest homes in their respective cities were listed by the owners, almost double the percentage in April 2012, but still a small segment of the overall market.

High-end homeowners, emboldened by a rebounding luxury market, now have digital tools that help with posting and marketing their properties. Sellers can place free listings on websites like Zillow and Trulia or pay to list on sites like ForSaleByOwner.com and Owners.com, which will place their properties on the Multiple Listing Service, a collection of local databases managed by real-estate professionals.

 Sellers believe when there is a lot of activity, it's easier to sell houses, and when it's easier to sell a house, then certainly you're less likely to need the assistance of an agent," says Eddie Tyner, general manager of Chicago-based ForSaleByOwner.com.

Still, the do-it-yourself approach is far from a sure thing. With her $1,000 investment, Ms. Platt created a website, had professional photographs taken, bought a book on staging, and radically decluttered and depersonalized her home. She also specified that showings would only be for buyers preapproved for financing and hosted a broker's open house.

The house got zero offers the first month. In May, Ms. Platt hired an agent, which had been part of her plan if her house didn't sell quickly. The agent added flowers and colorful throws for the sofa to perk up the interiors. New professional photos were taken. The agent then posted the home on MLS.

Within a week, Ms. Platt's house had more showings than it did in the previous month. She is now in discussions with a prospective buyer.

Looking back, Ms. Platt says she underestimated how long it would take to sell her home.

In a 2014 survey of home sellers by the National Association of Realtors, a trade group that represents agents, 47% of homeowners who decided to forego listing through an agent did so to avoid paying a fee or commission typically 6%, split between the listing and buyer's agents. The survey also indicates that homes listed by owners sell at a lower price than agent-brokered sales.

 To expose [a luxury home] properly to the correct pool of buyers, you need a broker who has contact with those people to disseminate the information appropriately and correctly," says Stan Smith of Teles Properties, a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based brokerage.

The for-sale-by-owner market is a small slice of the real-estate pie. Only 9% of sales at all price points took place without an agent in 2014 a number that hasn't budged since 2012 and is down from 14% a decade earlier, according to the NAR survey. And only 2% of sellers first tried to sell their homes solo before using an agent, the survey found.

Sellers with multimillion-dollar properties are among those likely to want to control the process.  Owners of those properties tend to be professionals lawyers, as an example and they feel well-equipped to handle and self-manage their own sale," says Steve Udelson, president of online real estate for Altisource, the company behind Owners.com, a FSBO listings website.

In terms of Web traffic, ForSaleByOwner.com had almost 2 million unique visitors in April and Owners.com had 189,000, according to comScore, an Internet analytics company. (Mr. Udelson says the number was closer to 319,000.)

By comparison, real-estate website Zillow had 55.2 million unique visitors in April. Realtor.com which pulls listings from 800 MLS's but does not let individual homeowners advertise their homes without an agent followed with 33.8 million unique visitors. No. 3 Trulia had 29.6 million unique visitors, the comScore data show. (News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, owns Move Inc., which operates realtor.com and mobile products for NAR.)

Mr. Udelson says more sellers have embraced the  quasi-FSBO" approach: They skip the listing agent but pay a commission often 3% to the agent who brings the buyer.

Six months ago Goldman Sachs was a lead underwriter on the initial public offering of Lending Club, the biggest and brashest of a new breed of online lenders. Now the Wall Street titan is seeking to disrupt the disrupters, launching its own web-based business offering loans to consumers and small businesses.

In an internal memo last month the bank said it had hired a senior executive from Discover Financial Services to lead a new business providing "digitally led banking services . . . without the burdens of legacy costs and fixed infrastructure".

In doing so, Goldman joins a cluster of firms using online platforms to provide capital to borrowers quickly and directly, bypassing bricks-and-mortar lenders. Such online operators have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years, amid rapid development of data-crunching software and a surge of interest from yield-starved investors. San Francisco-based Lending Club is now extending close to $2bn of loans a quarter; its nearest rival, Prosper, is doing almost $1bn.

Goldman's new business is led by Harit Talwar, who left his job as head of card services at Discover, the direct banking and payment services company, in April. In a mark of the importance Goldman has attached to the move, Mr Talwar has joined as one of Goldman's 400 or so partners - a distinction rarely awarded to lateral hires and even more rarely to those launching new businesses.

Announcing Mr Talwar's appointment, chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and operating chief Gary Cohn said "the traditional means by which financial services are delivered to consumers and small businesses is being fundamentally reshaped by advances in technology, maturity of digital channels, use of data and analytics, and a focus on customer experience".

Goldman's research division published a report in March on the future of finance and the effect of technology, identifying $1.7tn of consumer and small-business loans that it said could be "served more efficiently through the online lenders".

Rather than using a peer-to-peer model, matching borrowers and investors through the online platform, Goldman will seek to fund loans directly via its New York State-chartered banking subsidiary , set up after Goldman became a bank-holding company in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The unit, with $128bn in assets at the end of March, has so far mostly provided loans to private clients and institutions.

A figure in the online lending industry welcomed Goldman's entry but said its size was no guarantee of success.

Tech
Fitbit IPO Is Tracking a $3.7 Billion Valuation; Excitement about the wearable fitness-tracking company s success is driving strong demand for the shares

Fitbit Inc. and the market for technology IPOs are about to get a timely checkup.

The pioneer in "http://www.wsj.com/articles/health-data-at-hand-with-trackers-1403561237" and its shareholders are set to raise more than $600 million as soon as Wednesday evening, in an offering that is shaping up as the fifth-largest U.S. IPO this year, deal tracker Dealogic said.

Shares of the San Francisco company are generating strong buzz among investors, thanks to an increasingly rare combination for a technology initial public offering: A highly recognized consumer brand, strong revenue growth and annual profit. Fitbit would be just the second company out of 12 tech IPOs this year to report net income in its latest fiscal year, after data-analytics firm Inovalon Holdings Inc., according to Dealogic.

At the same time, the IPO will face a double-barreled challenge. Fitbit's strong results are viewed with skepticism by some investors who question whether the company can maintain market share amid a head-on challenge from Apple Inc.'s Apple Watch.

 The question is, will Apple come in and blow them out like it did Nokia in the smartphone market," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co.

 Other investors are questioning the relevance of tech IPOs. Many of the most sought-after companies, from ride-sharing service Uber Technologies Inc. to Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. to mobile messaging app Snapchat Inc., remain in private hands following venture-capital funding rounds at 11-digit valuations.

For now, the excitement about Fitbit's success is driving strong demand for the shares. The eight-year-old company on Tuesday boosted the number of shares it and its shareholders are selling to 34.5 million and raised the estimated price range to $17 to $19 a share. At the midpoint of the revised size and pricing, Fitbit would be valued at $3.7 billion.

The deal is being led by Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Corp. Shares are expected to begin trading Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol  FIT."

Fitbit makes wearable devices that track the wearer's daily steps, calories burned and floors climbed, as well as sleep duration and quality. Some of its products also track heart rate and collect information about speed, distance and exercise routes. The result is a trove of data that users can track and, if they so wish, share with friends. Users include Shaquille O'Neal and President Barack Obama.

 It's such a hot trend right now," said Laura Starr, senior research analyst at Nuveen Asset Management.

The company had net income of $132 million for 2014 on $745 million in revenue, according to regulatory filings. Revenue is projected to hit $1.4 billion this year and $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion next year, according to investors who spoke to bank analysts or sales representatives about the IPO.

Between 2013 and 2014, Fitbit more than doubled the number of devices sold to 10.9 million from 4.5 million. In the same period, revenue nearly tripled.

To be sure, there are some shadows over the Fitbit IPO. Last year the company received a series of complaints from consumers about one of its tracking wristbands, the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304275304579397250102593142", which it recalled in February 2014. The product caused some Fitbit customers to experience an allergic reaction on their wrists.

But bankers are comparing Fitbit to wearable video-camera maker GoPro Inc. GoPro made its stock-market debut a year ago, with its stock more than tripling by October. The shares have since come down a bit, though they are still more than double their IPO price of $24.

Some analysts say GoPro's performance bodes well for Fitbit, given Fitbit's lower valuation. At the midpoint of its expected IPO pricing range, Fitbit shares would trade at 21.6 times the past year's reported earnings through March 31, compared with 82 times for GoPro, FactSet data show.

Some even see a silver lining in the looming competition of the Apple Watch.

 The negative is yes, Fitbit will likely lose some market share because it cannot compete against the Apple juggernaut, but the positive is it has people recognizing this is a pretty cool category," said Paul Meeks, a technology analyst at Saturna Capital, which manages about $4 billion.

Over the Hill: Retirees Yank 401(k) Funds --- Net outflows signal 'inflection point' in retirement planning; asset managers put hopes on millennials

Withdrawals from 401(k) plans are now exceeding new contributions as baby boomers age, a shift that could have profound implications for the U.S. retirement industry.

Investors pulled a net $11.4 billion from tax-deferred savings plans in 2013, according to an analysis of government data provided to The Wall Street Journal by BrightScope Inc., ending decades of expansion. Complete industry information for 2014 isn't yet available.

The movement out of 401(k)s is expected to accelerate in the coming decade as more baby boomers retire, squeezing large money-management firms that rely on fees charged to employers and investors as a chief profit engine, some analysts said.

Asset managers hope they can replace the outflows with a new surge from millennials or other products, such as individual retirement accounts. One industry data provider said most funds leaving 401(k)-style plans are migrating to IRAs.

It is "an inflection point" for the U.S. retirement industry, said J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. analyst Ken Worthington in a research note in April.

Large money managers will be forced to cut fees, offer different products or consolidate operations, Mr. Worthington added in an interview. "It changes the dynamic of the business itself."

Tax-deferred 401(k) retirement accounts came into wide use in the 1980s as big companies embraced them as a replacement for costly pension funds. Baby boomers were the first generation to rely heavily on the savings plans and helped create a multitrillion-dollar industry that supported hundreds of investment firms and financial planners.

Assets held by 401(k) plans ballooned to $4.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 171% from $1.7 trillion in 2000, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade organization for mutual funds.

Now the 401(k) generation is ready to take its money out as the number of Americans reaching retirement age this year is expected to hit 3.5 million, up from 2.7 million in 2010, according to J.P. Morgan Chase and Census Bureau data.

One investor preparing to begin his exit is Dave Bernard, 56 years old, who retired three years ago as a consultant to startups in Cupertino, Calif. He and his wife, an office manager, both have a sizable amount invested in their 401(k)s, but in the coming months, when his wife retires, Mr. Bernard will start pulling money out of his plan for living expenses.

He expects to make withdrawals for about 10 years until he can access the full amount of Social Security benefits.

"We're going to end up using a good portion of our 401(k) to subsidize us," Mr. Bernard says.

The biggest 401(k) operators in the U.S. noticed the shift first since they generally serve older workers, according to BrightScope. In the past four years, investors pulled a net $12.8 billion from the top 25 plans by assets, according to BrightScope.

Estimates vary on how long the 401(k) net outflows will last and how severe they will become. Financial-services research firm Cerulli Associates projects outflows will persist at least until 2019 when investors will pull an estimated $51.6 billion, according to a December report. J.P. Morgan predicted in its April note the trend will last through 2030, with outflows peaking at $40 billion in 2019.

That money could stay with the retirement industry if baby boomers move 401(k) funds to IRAs. Contributions into IRAs are expected to reach $546 billion by 2019, up from $205 billion in 2003, according to Cerulli.

Some money managers are banking on another demographic group to reverse this shift: millennials. But they acknowledge that will require some convincing.

"Millennials haven't moved into a higher savings rate yet," said Douglas Fisher, Fidelity Investment's head of policy development on workplace retirement. Fidelity is one of the largest providers of 401(k)s, managing accounts for 13 million people across 20,000 companies.

"We need to start getting them to the right level," he said.

But even if millennials boost their savings, it will take some time for asset managers to see the benefits, said Mr. Worthington of J.P. Morgan.

"Redemptions in the industry are actually going to get worse for the next four to five years," he said.

Scott David, the head of U.S. investment services for fund firm T. Rowe Price Group Inc., says the key to offsetting outflows from retirement plans is to move older workers into different products at the firm. T. Rowe also is among the largest 401(k) providers.

"Their distribution from a 401(k) plan just means they're entering a different part of their life," he says. "They still have investment needs, but their investment needs will change a bit."

Some money-management firms are expected to lower fees in an attempt to keep market share.

Vanguard Group and Fidelity recently made moves to cut fees in retirement products, and 401(k) participants invested in stock mutual funds paid an average expense ratio of 0.58% in 2013 as compared with 0.63% a year earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute and Lipper Analytics, a mutual-fund research firm. Other fee rates in mutual funds also dropped that year.

One investor who is ready to pull money even though she doesn't need it is Denise Dobkowski Hammond, 68, who retired about seven ago from her post as treasurer of West Bloomfield, Mich. Ms. Hammond says she saved as much as she could her entire life, putting the maximum amount into her retirement accounts and paying off her house.

Ms. Hammond said she doesn't need her savings to live on, but a federal law requires her to start withdrawing money from her 401(k) at age 70 1/2.

"I'll pull out the minimum unless the kids need something," she said.

Corporate News: Spark Software Nabs Hadoop's Spotlight

Silicon Valley investors have poured $2 billion into companies based on the data-collection software known as Hadoop. But a newer big-data program is stealing Hadoop's thunder. The software, known as Spark, has attracted the attention of startups and established companies alike. This week's Spark Summit in San Francisco is likely to draw 2,000 coders and entrepreneurs -- or 82% more than last year -- to explore its potential.

International Business Machines Corp. said it expected to spend $300 million over the next few years to put 3,500 coders on Spark-related projects in analytics, commerce and machine learning. Silicon Valley venture-capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates have put $47 million into Databricks Inc., a startup that on Monday made widely available an online service built on the software.

Spark helps visual bookmarking site Pinterest Inc. offer up relevant images and Airbnb Inc. price rooms for rent. Startups based on Hadoop, including big-data software companies Hortonworks Inc. and Cloudera Inc., have rolled it into their product lines. It is part of a growing collection of free software that is chipping away at businesses long dominated by Oracle Corp., Teradata Corp., and other traditional database and data-warehouse competitors.

"Anyone that's going to be using data in the future is going to be leveraging Spark," said Rob Thomas, vice president of product development for IBM analytics.

Like Hadoop, Spark is used to analyze massive amounts of data. However, it is significantly faster than a core Hadoop component called MapReduce. That makes it handy for analyzing data as soon as it is generated, rather than needing to wait for data to accumulate and then processing it in a batch.

Technologists such as Mr. Thomas don't expect Spark to replace Hadoop, which is a grab bag of big-data tools that often includes and works together with Spark. But they do expect it to dramatically accelerate the extraction of insights from the flood of information generated by Twitter feeds, fitness trackers, online ad auctions, weather sensors, electric turbines and other consumer and industrial systems.

"Spark replacing MapReduce is like a car replacing a bicycle," said Christopher Nguyen, chief executive of Adatao Inc., which offers a software platform for data-driven decision making that includes both programs. That is, each has its uses, but one is many times faster than the other in many situations.

Like Hadoop, Spark is freely available under an open-source license, creating a challenge for businesses that aim to commercialize it. Databricks on Monday expects to offer widely a Web-based service that enables companies to take advantage of Spark's number-crunching power without having to install or maintain the software in their own facilities. The company has made a point of trying to corner Spark engineering expertise in hope of making it a natural choice for the software's growing user base, a common strategy for companies based on open-source software. It says it has 150 trial customers and 60 paying customers.

Other startups relying on Spark include Qubole Inc., founded by former members of Facebook Inc.'s data team, and ClearStory Data Inc. Qubole and ClearStory Data each provide big-data software and services.

Even as it promises to deliver big-data insights more quickly, Spark threatens to complicate an already thorny landscape, said Stefan Groschupf, CEO of Datameer Inc., which makes software based on Hadoop. Code written to work with MapReduce might not work with Spark. And Spark, which Mr. Groschupf said isn't yet reliable enough for corporate use, could someday be replaced by other emerging software. The complexity is bound to confuse corporate managers, he said.

"You have different vendors hurting the overall market, trying to get people locked into their products," he said.

Spark is the brainchild of Matei Zaharia, who conceived it to overcome Hadoop's limitations in 2010, when he was a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. In early 2013, Mr. Zaharia's adviser, Scott Shenker, told venture capitalist Ben Horowitz about the software. Mr. Zaharia, he said, was the best computer-science systems researcher to come out of Berkeley in a decade.

The last time Mr. Shenker had tipped off Mr. Horowitz, the result was Nicira Networks, a company whose founders included virtual-network visionary Martin Casado. Nicira Networks eventually sold for $1.26 billion in 2012.

"He said, 'This guy is the Martin Casado of big data,'" Mr. Horowitz recalled.

The Spark tip prompted Mr. Horowitz and his colleagues to set about building Databricks.

Although Spark makes some programming jobs much faster and easier than they used to be, it will take some time before the bulk of Oracle database customers become convinced that they need it to run their businesses, said Nick Heudecker, an analyst with the research firm Gartner Inc. "Hadoop was not the first data platform," he said. "Spark will not be the last."

It is 'survival of the richest' at the top US firms

Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs

By Lauren Rivera (Princeton, 24.95/$35)

Every winter, hundreds of young American football stars from the nation's colleges descend on Indianapolis for the NFL Scouting Combine. At this event, receivers, defenders and quarterbacks submit to drills, interviews and even cognitive testing. Teams know that casting a wide net for players, many of whom do not attend famous football colleges, can make the difference between being a championship-winning team and an also-ran.

Another group of competitive employers - Wall Street investment banks, law firms and top management consultancies - runs a far less exhaustive talent search. In doing so, they potentially miss out on hiring some very talented individuals. And it is this latter world that Lauren Rivera - a sociologist and former management consultant - investigates in Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs.

Her study into the hiring practices of what she calls "elite professional services" companies finds that nearly all the recruits at places such Goldman Sachs, McKinsey or Cravath come from a handful of ultra-prestigious institutions. But her contention is deeper: that these EPS firms are employing a double-filter. She writes: "Firms define talent in a manner that excludes high-performing students from less privileged backgrounds."

Rivera interviewed 32 students who were gunning for consulting, banking, and law jobs along with 120 interviewers at various firms who shared their thoughts on the basis of anonymity. Most interestingly, she embeds herself in the human resources team at a consulting firm (given the alias "Holt Halliday") while it is recruiting at a top university.

The first cut in EPS interviewing is effectively completed four years in advance by school admissions committees who decide who is worthy of the Ivy League or a similar education. Without attending one of a short list of targeted schools it is virtually impossible to secure an EPS job. One of the lawyers conducting candidate interviews summed up the attitude as: "Number one people go to number one schools."

Once the pool of applicants has been narrowed based on candidates' college choice, the interview process tends to emphasise the fuzzy idea of "fit". But a fit with what or whom? Rivera finds that the concept often reflects the implicit comfort that comes from meeting someone with a similar upbringing, hobbies and interests. That focus on "fit", she contends, is what pushes down the recruitment rates for female applicants and anyone from non-wealthy and non-white backgrounds who has not done the "right" extracurricular activities.

It is not obvious, however, that EPS firms are damaged either reputationally or by their clients because of their insularity. Rivera's survey shows that her banking and consulting sources were largely satisfied with recruiting outcomes (although only a third of lawyers were pleased with the present system). The data gathered at "Holt Halliday" show that the female and black candidates who did get to the interview stage received offers at rates higher than white males.

Much of the research in Pedigree was conducted before the financial crisis, back when the elite college- to-Wall Street conveyor belt trundled along smoothly. Since 2008, the fallout from the crisis and the rise of Silicon Valley means there is serious competition for the most able students. And the start-up ethos is less concerned with pedigree and more on ability and accomplishments.

Pedigree is nicely juxtaposed against another recent book about elite employment by Google's Lazlo Bock. Work Rules! describes the data-driven approach to hiring at the internet juggernaut. Bock has, refreshingly, acknowledged that Google finds plenty of good employees at colleges where Goldman would never set foot.

The large tech companies are facing their own questions about workforce homogeneity. Still, it is difficult to imagine the human resources function at a bank or law firm ever becoming empowered enough, in the way Google has, to impose guidelines for candidate evaluations. But in a "big data" world, with a spotlight shining on fairness and an intensifying competition for talent, it may be time for a revolution in elite professional services.

Lossmaking music streaming group says it has 20m paying customers

Spotify has raised $526m in a funding round that values the lossmaking music streaming company at $8.5bn, days after Apple launched its own service and ramping up the pressure on the Swedish business.

The market leader in streaming has raised more than $1bn since it was founded nine years ago, making it one of the best-funded start-ups in Europe. It also revealed new user numbers yesterday, saying that it had 20m paying customers, up from 15m in January, and a further 55m users who listen to a free advertising-supported version.

However, Spotify faces the prospect of a significant increase in competition as Apple, which 12 years ago revolutionised the music businesses with the launch of the iTunes download store, enters the subscription streaming market this month.

Investors in the round included Nordic mobile operator TeliaSonera, British asset manager Baillie Gifford, and Canadian hedge fund Senvest Capital, according to a person close to the deal. Goldman Sachs, which Spotify hired to raise the funds, also contributed.

TeliaSonera said it had invested $115m for a 1.4 per cent stake in the company. The businesses announced that they would work together to develop areas such as media distribution, data analytics and advertising.

Some observers said the move to raise more cash privately could further delay long-touted plans to launch an initial public offering for the world's most popular music subscription service.

Apple Music will be available on hundreds of millions of connected devices in 100 countries when iOS 8 is updated this month. But antitrust authorities in the US are investigating the company's licensing negotiations with music labels over the new service.

Apple has a cash pile approaching $200bn and is expected to spend significant amounts of money promoting its new music service.

Jeremy Silver, a digital media consultant at Media Clarity, said that the raising of a $500m "war chest" was vital for Spotify to compete with Apple's vast scale. "Spotify has first mover advantage but to maintain that position they'll need to innovate much faster than they have in the past," he said.

Financial statements filed in Luxembourg last month showed that Spotify's revenues rose 44 per cent to just over  ¬1bn in 2014. However, its operating losses widened to  ¬165m as it invested in technology and marketing, while paying out the bulk of its revenues to rights holders.

In an attempt to fend off Apple and other rivals such as Google and Deezer, a French streaming service, Spotify plans to use the proceeds of the fundraising to invest in technology and media content, including adding videos and podcasts .

Spotify's valuation has risen sharply since last year, when investors placed a $5bn figure on the company. At $8.5bn, Spotify is worth more than twice as much as Pandora, the US-listed internet radio service, which has also been consistently lossmaking.

Spotify declined to comment on the fundraising, but it published figures yesterday about its role in the global music industry. It revealed it had paid more than $3bn in royalties to artists, songwriters and rights holders.

Spotify AB raised $526 million in a new funding round that values the music-streaming company at $8.53 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, as investors bet it can fend off a new threat from Apple Inc.

The fundraising drew in investment funds in Europe and the U.S. and included a $115 million investment from Nordic telecom operator TeliaSonera AB, which said the two companies would work together on areas such as media distribution, data analytics and advertising.

Spotify's latest funding round comes as the Swedish company invests in expansion and new forms of content.

It is facing a growing set of challengers that now includes Apple Music, a subscription-based streaming-music service and a 24-hour global Internet radio station unveiled by the tech giant on Monday.

The latest financing, which The Wall Street Journal first reported on in April, closed on Tuesday.

As well as TeliaSonera, investors in Spotify's new round include British asset managers Baillie Gifford, Landsdowne Partners and Rinkelberg Capital and Canadian hedge funds Senvest Capital and Discovery Capital Management, the person familiar with the matter said.

U.S. investors in the round include Halcyon Asset Management, GSV Capital Corp., D.E. Shaw & Co., Technology Crossover Ventures, Northzone and P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, the person said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which Spotify hired to raise the new funding, also invested through its Global Private Opportunity Partners fund.

Abu Dhabi's sovereign-wealth fund also agreed to invest in the round, a person familiar with the matter said in April.

Spotify is now valued at more than double Pandora Media, which has a market capitalization of about $3.5 billion. Part of the new funding may be used to fuel Spotify's push into new forms of media.

At an event last month in New York, the company announced a plan to add videos and podcasts from partners including ESPN, NBC, Conde Nast, and Comedy Central.

Spotify was valued at more than $5 billion last September, according to filings by GSV Capital.

Foreign Buyers Plant Roots in Ireland --- Short-term players have been bought out by longer-term investors in Dublin

Years after Ireland's cataclysmic property bust, long-term investors from beyond the Emerald Isle are buying into the revival of its capital city.

Two of the biggest property sales in Dublin this year went to U.S.-based Starwood Property Trust and Germany's Union Investment Real Estate GmbH, long-term investors from out of town. The deals mark a shift for Ireland, where private-equity firms, typically interested in flipping properties for quick returns, dominated in the immediate aftermath of the country's financial crisis.

"Long-term capital is replacing the short-term capital," said Andrew Muckian, partner in the real-estate department at law firm William Fry. Not only that, but this level of institutional capital coming from overseas "is new for Ireland," he said.

Starwood Property Trust, the biggest U.S. commercial-mortgage real-estate investment trust, paid about 452 million euros ($510 million) for 12 Dublin office buildings and a multifamily residential property, according to the firm. It was the biggest property deal in Ireland so far this year.

Union Investment, an arm of German lender DZ Bank AG, last month bought two office buildings rented to Facebook Inc. for 230 million euros, the firm said.

Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG, U.K. asset manager Standard Life PLC, U.S. real-estate investor Hines and German real-estate investor Patrizia Immobilien AG also bought offices in Dublin this year, according to Real Capital Analytics data.

Ireland was one of the earliest casualties of the eurozone financial crisis. The Irish government, after nationalizing banks that lent liberally to property developers and home buyers, required an international bailout in 2010 to avoid default.

U.S. private-equity firms swooped in as commercial-property values fell 60% from 2007 to 2011, data from CBRE Group Inc. show.

Prices remain 40% below the peak, but the market is rebounding. Returns on Irish commercial property were up 36% in the first quarter from the year-earlier period, according to MSCI's IPD index, a benchmark for the property sector.

"It's the right time for us to be in Dublin," said Philip La Pierre, head of investment management Europe at Union Investment, which bought 4 and 5 Grand Canal Square from the country's bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency.

"We're very conservative. But the market looks strong, and acquiring an asset with a strong tenant like Facebook was exactly what we were looking for," Mr. La Pierre said.

Dublin hosts the European headquarters for major global tech firms from Google Inc. to Twitter Inc. Still, almost no new offices have been built in the city during the past five years. The resulting lack of space has pushed the vacancy rate for high-quality office space to a mere 1.8% in the first quarter, CBRE data show. Rents for Dublin offices have leapt to about 47 euros a square foot from 27 euros a square foot in 2012.

While there are emergent cranes in the skyline, "it will be some time before new buildings are available for occupation, meaning that prime rents are likely to rise further in the short to medium term," said Marie Hunt, head of research in Ireland at CBRE.

Outside Dublin is a different picture. The capital city accounts for over 80% of both leasing and transaction activity in the country, Ms. Hunt said.

"Ireland definitely has two markets for longer-term capital, Dublin and the regions, and we are not sure yet who will start buying in the regions aside from domestic buyers," said Adam Shah, senior vice president at Starwood Capital Group.

Starwood bought the Dublin portfolio -- its second acquisition in a long-term investment strategy that started with a U.S. shopping-mall portfolio last year -- from U.S. private-equity firm Lone Star Funds.

The U.S.-listed REIT is an affiliate with Starwood Capital Group, which was active buying riskier assets in Ireland after the crisis.

"We were there at the beginning [of the Irish financial crisis] wearing one hat," Mr. Shah said. "Now, since the recovery has progressed, we're there investing longer-term capital."

Institutional investors are in many cases buying from the short-term private-equity groups that bought at the bottom of the market and are now looking for an exit.

Irish pension funds and Ireland's REITs, first launched in 2013, are active players. But some of the international investors are relatively new to Ireland.

In the last boom, "essentially, we bought from and sold to ourselves, which distorted true real-estate values," said Mr. Muckian at William Fry. Investment from overseas "provides a benchmarking of real-estate value here against other real-estate markets."

Heard on the Street
No Willing Bank Risk Away

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The biggest U.S. banks may soon face a test of willpower.

Banks have until July 1 to submit "living wills" to regulators. These describe how they could be resolved in the event of failure. Until last year, investors and the banks weren't very focused on the wills. That changed in August when the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. unexpectedly gave failing grades to 11 of the biggest U.S. banks.

Now, banks are devoting far more attention to the plans. But the Fed and FDIC, too, are facing pressure over perceived inadequacies of bank resolution plans and may apply more stringent scrutiny to them.

A recent International Monetary Fund report criticized the progress, urging U.S. regulators to evaluate plans "against severe contingencies." It warned "data blind spots" meant regulators lack information to assess financial-stability risks. "U.S. regulators are now under even more pressure to prove that they've gotten too-big-to-fail cut down to size," Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics noted.

Last year's rebuke of banks was blunted by two factors: First, it was spread across all the big banks. Second, the Fed didn't join the FDIC in describing the plans as "not credible," which meant the letters didn't officially begin a process that could lead to the forced divestment of assets or operations.

Now, there is a real risk regulators single out individual bank wills as "not credible." FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg warned in a May speech this was possible unless banks make "significant progress."

Given banks have shown an ability to fumble crucial regulatory tests, investors can't assume this is nothing more than another fire drill. Where there is a living will, there is a way -- to land in regulatory hot water.

ICAP Weighs Treasurys-Trading Limits

By Katy Burne

Turbulent government-bond markets are prompting one large brokerage firm to take a cue from the stock-trading world and consider installing circuit breakers.

ICAP PLC is studying the possibility of temporarily halting Treasurys trading following large price moves, according to people familiar with the matter.

Such a program would mark the first use of such safeguards in the $12.5 trillion U.S. Treasury market. Circuit breakers are routinely used to halt trading in stocks when price fluctuations exceed predetermined ranges.

London-based ICAP is raising the idea with some of its customers, one of the people said, and weighing the pros and cons of adopting such controls, which already are commonplace in equity markets in the U.S. and elsewhere. According to Sandler O'Neill + Partners estimates, ICAP's BrokerTec unit handles about 60% of Treasurys trading activity between banks and high-speed trading firms, which account for a large share of overall trading.

Some traders worry that timeout periods in the world's most liquid securities market would reduce investors' access to the perceived safety of Treasurys when other markets are declining, and could raise the possibility of distorted prices in related markets like derivatives that are closely tied to government bonds.

Even so, the development is the latest sign that price gyrations sweeping financial markets are unnerving traders and pushing participants to consider unprecedented steps

Some market participants have discussed the idea of circuit breakers in bonds with officials at the U.S. Treasury Department, a person familiar with the talks said.

"Given the recent extreme swings in bond prices, safeguards to prevent the market going into free fall are worth exploring," said Kevin McPartland, head of market-structure research at Greenwich Associates.

A spokesman for Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., which runs a Treasurys trading platform, declined to comment on any new controls under discussion. A spokesman for Tradeweb Markets LLC, which also has a Treasurys platform, declined to comment.

ICAP's discussions come on the heels of large one-day price swings in Treasurys and German bunds, two of the largest, most liquid markets in the world, over a period of months. The events touched off a debate about whether electronic bond venues need heightened risk controls.

Implemented in the U.S. after the 2010 "flash crash" that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 700 points in a matter of minutes before largely recovering, circuit breakers essentially put trading in a stock on hold if prices move up or down by a preset amount intraday. Exchanges coordinate with one another to issue a marketwide halt in trading.

In December, Chicago futures-exchange operator CME Group Inc. said it would implement circuit breakers for Treasury futures, currency futures and metals futures, expanding existing controls it already had in place for equity and energy futures. Those controls have been put in place.

Such procedures would be vastly more difficult to apply to bonds, observers say. While much of the bond markets are traded electronically today, trading doesn't take place on exchanges and the handful of platforms catering to bonds don't coordinate with each other on how to handle extreme price moves.

"In a world where liquidity can move so quickly from one venue to the next, the absence of an industrywide agreement on when to halt trading poses a risk to the bond market," said Adam Sussman, head of market structure at institutional equities-trading platform Liquidnet.

Traders have attributed the heightened volatility in government bonds in part to structural factors, including the rise of electronic trading and prevalence of high-speed computer algorithms that were long prevalent in the equity, futures and foreign-exchange markets.

The Treasury Market Practices Group, an expert panel convened by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in April wrote that automated trading strategies now account for more than half of Treasury trading on some platforms, and that its increasing adoption would lead to "the risk of sharp, short-term disruptions to the Treasury securities market of the kind experienced in the equities and futures markets."

Others finger a decline in liquidity, or the ease of trading at given prices, as a result of new rules in the wake of the financial crisis targeting bank risk-taking.

In April, Treasurys traded by banks that act as primary dealers of U.S. government securities hit their lowest monthly volume seen since 2009, according to Haver Analytics.

The concerns come as equity and currency markets have experienced exaggerated price swings, raising concerns about the role of electronic trading.

"Pricing may adjust quickly and unexpectedly, even in the absence of significant market events," said authors of a report last month by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of top U.S. regulators created after the financial crisis to oversee the financial system.

On Oct. 15, traders scrambled to react to a stunning rally in Treasurys that sent yields on the 10-year note plummeting to an intraday low of 1.87% within minutes, their biggest one-day decline since 2009.

The episode, in which some dealers turned off their automatic price-quoting systems, prompted scrutiny from the highest levels in Washington and on Wall Street.

New York's Park Avenue is on track to see something it hasn't seen in three decades: a major new office tower.

Developer L&L Holding Co. and its partners on Tuesday secured $556 million from MassMutual Financial Group to fund development of the 897-foot office tower at 425 Park Ave.

Taken with other funding from Japanese investor Tokyu Land Corp., the deal gives the developer the cash it needs to push ahead with the 670,000-square foot-tower in a display of the gradually improving appetite for office construction around the U.S.

"We're fully capitalized and fully mobilized and ready to go," said Robert Lapidus, L&L's president, who has been working on the tower for nearly a decade.

Office development in the U.S. is beginning to pick up steam after years of dragging. With office vacancy rates inching down and interest rates near historic lows, developers and their financiers increasingly are willing to take risks.

In skylines from San Francisco to Chicago to Boston, large office towers are under way. In recent weeks, developers announced they were moving ahead with projects that include Brookfield Property Partners' planned 2 million-square-foot tower in Manhattan and Hudson Pacific Properties Inc.'s planned 323,000-square-foot office building in Hollywood.

Still, office development remains slow by historic standards. Across the U.S., construction-data tracking firm Dodge Data & Analytics estimates developers will start work on 130 million square feet of office space in 2015, up from 107 million square feet in 2014 and 57 million square feet in 2010. Between 1980 and 2010, the country averaged 203 million square feet of annual construction starts.

There are two primary reasons for the slow rebound. Employers have had a restrained appetite for office space even as the economy has improved. Meanwhile, banks have been slow to dive back into the market for construction lending amid tighter regulatory requirements.

"There is still caution being exercised," said Robert Murray, chief economist at Dodge.

For L&L and 425 Park, the road to development was hardly smooth. L&L bought the site in 2006, home to a half-century-old office building with leases that ran through 2015. At the time, the developer's partner was Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., an inopportune pairing that led to a lengthy period of uncertainty after the bank filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008.

But in 2012, L&L began pushing ahead with plans for a new development on the site after the existing leases expired, a rare move on a street that hasn't seen a major new office tower since 499 Park Ave. was built in 1980.

L&L ultimately tapped renowned British architect Norman Foster to design the building at 55th Street. Financing was uncertain, and preleasing was nonexistent, because the building is aimed at smaller tenants who typically don't make real-estate decisions more than a year or two ahead of a lease expiration.

In 2013, a postbankruptcy Lehman sold its majority stake to GreenOak Real Estate, a company led by former Morgan Stanley real-estate executives, while L&L continued to plan. About six months ago, L&L and GreenOak secured Tokyu as an equity partner for an undisclosed investment amount.

Then the developers sought a construction loan, ultimately turning to MassMutual affiliate Cornerstone Real Estate Advisors, which makes investments for the insurer. The firm likes large construction loans such as this one, said Jamie Henderson, Cornerstone's head of alternative investments, because rates are relatively high and the company doesn't typically have to vie with many rivals for the loans.

With the loan in place, interior demolition of the existing -- now vacant -- building has begun, and L&L expects the new tower to be done by 2018.

Mr. Lapidus said he expected the building would lease for an average in excess of $150 a square foot, a level that would put it in the upper echelons of Midtown office towers.

Deal of the Week: Windy City Beckons Technology Firms

The sale last week of a downtown Chicago office building is the latest indication that big investors are betting heavily that the Windy City will become an increasingly important technology hub to rival San Francisco and New York.

One South Wacker, a 40-story glass tower built in 1982, sold last week for $344 million to John Hancock Real Estate, a unit of Manulife Real Estate in Toronto. The price represented a significant gain for the seller, private-equity firm Harbor Group International LLC, which paid $221 million for the building in December 2012.

Even taking into account the $40 million that Harbor Group spent on capital improvements, the deal illustrates how fast values are rising for office properties in Chicago -- which some are dubbing Silicon Prairie.

"Chicago has a lot of attributes that investors are looking for . . . a host of Fortune 500 companies and a 24-7 urban landscape," but with lower costs, said Jed Reagan, a senior research analyst at Green Street Advisors, a real-estate research firm.

He added that Chicago's economic fundamentals aren't as strong as New York or San Francisco, but "vacancies are falling and landlords are able to push rents."

The mayor's office also has been making an effort to attract and retain tech firms and increase the profile of its economy -- trends that have commercial-real-estate buyers more confident in the city's future, he said.

That could explain why prices for office properties in Chicago are currently appreciating faster than other major cities. According to Real Capital Analytics, the average price a square foot for office properties in Chicago rose 73% as of April when compared with 2012, which was a cyclical bottom for the city. During that same period, average prices rose 65% in metro New York, 21% in San Francisco and 37% in Boston.

Still, while Chicago prices are rising fast, they are relatively low when compared with other major cities. Real Capital's data shows that Chicago office properties are fetching about $258 a square foot this year compared with $651 in New York, $421 in San Francisco and $304 in Boston.

It is those differentials, however, that have convinced some investors that Chicago prices still have room to grow.

"We continue to be attracted to the strong economic fundamentals that are emerging in Chicago," said Ted Willcocks, Global Head of Asset Management at Manulife.

John Hancock and Manulife are betting big on their convictions. In 2012, the company paid $102 million for 150 North Michigan Ave. A year later, it paid $214.5 million for 200 South Wacker Drive and this September, it bought 55 West Monroe St. for $244 million.

But the biggest recent transaction in Chicago involved Blackstone Group LP, which in March struck a deal to purchase the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) for $1.3 billion in what would be the highest price ever paid for a U.S. office tower outside of New York.

"Pricing has gotten so aggressive in coastal markets, now demand has started to shift out to markets like Chicago that offer some of those attributes but you can pick up office buildings at a discount," said Green Street's Mr. Reagan.

Harbor Group, the private-equity firm that sold One South Wacker, specializes in buying real-estate assets, repositioning the properties to add value, then exiting within three or five years. In the case of One South Wacker, improvements included installing a new entry atrium winter garden, a brighter lobby with concierge station, a fitness center, creating open space and adding conference facilities.

"Those amenities helped to drive tenant demand," said Harbor Group President T. Richard Litton Jr., noting that the building's occupancy rate rose from 80% at the end of 2012 to the current rate of 86%.

 We continue to be attracted to the strong economic fundamentals that are emerging in Chicago," said Ted Willcocks, Global Head of Asset Management at Manulife, adding that his firm expects more companies to relocate to Chicago in the years ahead.

John Hancock and Manulife are betting big on their convictions. Even before last week's purchase of One South Wacker, John Hancock made several other major Chicago purchases. In 2012, the company paid $102 million for 150 North Michigan Ave., a diamond-shaped building that is a landmark. A year later, it paid $214.5 million for 200 South Wacker Drive and this past September, it acquired 55 West Monroe St. for $244 million.

But the biggest recent transaction in Chicago involved Blackstone Group LP, which in March struck a deal to purchase the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) for $1.3 billion in what would be the highest price ever paid for a U.S. office tower outside of New York. On a per-square-foot basis, its price was about $340, a fraction of what trophy towers fetch in New York.

 Pricing has gotten so aggressive in coastal markets, now demand has started to shift out to markets like Chicago that offer some of those attributes but you can pick up office buildings at a discount," said Green Street's Mr. Reagan.

Harbor Group, the private-equity firm that sold One South Wacker, specializes in buying real-estate assets, repositioning the properties to add value, then exiting within three or five years. In the case of One South Wacker, Harbor Group President T. Richard Litton Jr. said the business plan called for the company to turn the building, which has a large number of law firms and finance companies, into one that would also get the attention of growing technology companies. The improvements included installing a new entry atrium winter garden, a brighter lobby with concierge station, a fitness center, creating open space and adding conference facilities.

 Those amenities helped to drive tenant demand," said Mr. Litton, noting that the building's occupancy rate rose from 80% at the end of 2012 when it purchased the building to the current rate of 86%.

Some of the technology tenants include Rise Interactive, Invenergy LLC, Big Time Software and Owner IQ Inc., according to a Harbor spokesman.  The technology facet is the one of the most interesting aspects of this transaction...and how it translates into value for owners," said Mr. Litton.

Park Avenue Office Towers Mount a Comeback; 425 Park Ave. will be the first major office tower built along the famed New York boulevard since 1980

Mr. Lapidus, who declined to comment on the interest rate being charged, said there were multiple offers for the loan, which proved easier to secure than it would have been earlier in the recovery.

 Three or four years ago, it would have been much more difficult to raise the capital," he said.

With the loan in place, interior demolition of the existing now vacant building has begun, and L&L expects the new tower to be done by 2018. In turn, the company is shifting to a new phase: leasing the building.

Mr. Lapidus said he expected the building would lease for an average in excess of $150 a square foot, a level that would put it in the upper echelons of Midtown office towers.

Good times still rolling in murky depths of subprime car credit

When Santander Consumer USA sold a $1bn pool of subprime car loans this week, it made no pretence that investors would be repaid in full. So confident was "Scusa" that a big chunk of the money would not be coming back that it said it would shield investors in the lowest-rated tranche from the first 19 per cent of losses. That is a lower level of protection than the Spanish bank's US securitisation vehicle provided in its first trip to the lower reaches of subprime car lending in March, when it offered "credit enhancement" of 25 per cent on the worst-ranked bonds.

The development is a sign that things are heating up again in this much-maligned corner of the credit markets. Seven years on from a crisis that was blamed on an explosion in subprime lending, investors remain very keen to back loans to the people who are least capable of handling them.

Definitions vary, but subprime normally means those with scores below 620 on the spectrum run by FICO, the biggest credit-risk scorer, which rates consumers from 300 to 850. "Deep" subprime - which is where Scusa was dabbling - often means scores of 550 and below, implying patchy credit histories and low or irregular incomes.

For investors who are desperate for yield - any yield - getting exposure to this class of consumers is not as easy as it used to be. Buying shares in a bank is not the best way to do it.

Many of the biggest lenders are still paying penalties for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis, and have wound down or sold their subprime businesses. The market for new subprime MBS has still not come back. And bonds that are backed by subprime credit-card balances are growing about as fast as prime.

But in auto, the good times are still rolling. Securitisations of subprime car loans have risen every year since 2009 and topped $21.8bn last year, up from $21.6bn in 2013, according to Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter. Chris Donat, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill in New York, says investor demand this year has been sustained by a combination of high employment and low petrol prices - both strong supports for subprime.

Entrants have flooded the market, and many of them are pushing out loan terms to as long as seven years, from the previous standard of six. To keep up, established lenders are going longer too - even though they know that means the borrower may owe more than the car is worth for much of the life of the loan.

"We are very aware of the downside with longer terms, but we're balancing this against the competitive landscape," said Jeffrey Williams, finance chief at America's Car-Mart, on a quarterly earnings call with analysts last week. The New York-listed company, which runs usedcar dealerships in 10 states in the South and Midwest, is currently stretching subprime loans to an average of 30.2 months, up from 29.7 last quarter, with a consequent increase in the risk of defaults.

Others lament sloppy underwriting standards. "There are people out there . . . who are waiving proof of income, and just doing a few things that we'd never do," sighed Charles Bradley , chief executive at Consumer Portfolio Services, a California-based subprime lender backed by Fortress , the hedge fund, on an analyst call last month. "It certainly gets the dealer's attention when they don't have to worry about whether their customer is making any money."

Where will it end? In the same place it always ends, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics, when lenders extend more credit than people can cope with.

But for now there are few clear signs of strain, such as a big run-up in 30-day delinquencies. And while the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and various state attorneys-general say they are keeping a close eye on potential abuses in the subprime auto sector, none of the big participants in the market has yet been scared into submission.

"In a nine-inning game," says Mr Zandi, "this is maybe three or four".

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Banks desert high street for the digital superhighway

James Pickford explains why the internet, mobile devices and financial services are converging to transform our relationships with our banks and customise our use of money

Picture the scene: you go for a run, armed with a smartphone app that measures how far you go, your speed and the energy you expend. As you push yourself onwards, the app connects with your bank and transfers small amounts of your cash to a higher-yielding account. The harder you run (or the further you walk), the more money you make through your savings.

It sounds outlandish but is already a reality. Russia's Alfa-Bank last year began offering its Activity scheme to customers, linking up with their fitness tracking software on their smart devices and giving a 6 per cent interest rate on the higher-earning account.

This niche innovation illustrates the speed with which the internet, mobile devices and financial services are converging to transform our relationships with our banks . From fitness apps to biometric security, advice-by-video and cheque imaging, digitisation is prompting banks to offer myriad new services at the touch of a button.

Some have the potential to smooth transactions, bringing convenience to our daily lives. Others can connect us with services we never imagined we needed.

But how far do we want financial services groups to intrude into our lives? Will these services open new avenues for fraudsters? And in the race to digital banking, will the Square Mile's incumbents be superseded by the forces of Silicon Valley? FT Money has taken a look at the latest advances in banking technology and asks what these mean for their customers. Plastic and paper Sales of mobile devices have seen phenomenal growth, in 2012 overtaking computers as the core device for people to connect to the internet. Three of four UK adults now use smartphones, according to Enders Analysis, the media research group.

Just a few years ago, no one used their phones for banking services; now they routinely turn to their devices to check balances, pay bills, apply for loans or compare financial products. Last year banking apps were downloaded more than 14.7m times on mobiles and tablets, according to the BBA, which represents banks.

The smartphone is set to make deeper inroads into our finances. One of the mainstays of modern banking is the credit or debit card, which has been flexed by UK consumers since the 1960s. But the days of the traditional card may be numbered: just as a card today can be slotted into, swiped through or held against a terminal to pay for something, so can the same technologyembedded in a smartphone.

Raman Bhatia, head of digital at HSBC UK, says people's familiarity with using mobiles to buy goods and services online is driving banks ever faster towards enabling new transactions on the devices. "The future of money and your phone will coincide," he says. "The mobile wallet will become a reality . . . Experts have been predicting this for ages but it is now happening and the trend will accelerate in the next few years."

Cards, whether of the conventional kind or residing virtually on a phone, are also becoming increasingly customisable, experts say. Stephen Cooper, chief executive of personal banking at Barclays, says it will be possible to limit cards to a specific type of transaction, or even a specific purchase.

Some might be bespoke in other ways: a mother, for instance, might give her teenage son a card that allows him a certain limited spending power but refuses purchases on online gambling or adult websites. It might refuse to allow purchases after a certain hour of the day or, if associated with a phone, would be possible to locate using geolocation technology.

"You can choose how much they can spend and when they spend," Mr Cooper says. "Complete customisation and flexibility is coming."

Banks are rushing to develop these systems for another reason: they hold out the prospect of a new relationship with their customers in which the data they accumulate on spending habits allows banks to offer targeted goods and services.

The power of "big data" to predict intentions and needs is already being exploited by supermarkets and other retailers. Banks, with access to much more comprehensive financial data about an individual, can potentially act as a retail proxy, guiding them towards purchases and helping them finance, insure, maintain and replace them - assuming account holders are happy for them to do so .

Packages of services which are not independently available are the likely first port of call for banks, Mr Cooper says: someone who wants to get themselves set up on the internet, for instance, might be offered a package comprising a computer, internet connection, training and financing. Another might be the logistics associated with a wedding or moving house: after all, your bank already knows which utility companies you use.

Key to the success of a "banker as retailer" strategy will be striking the right balance between offering useful information and deluging people with commercial deals. "Not everyone will want it, but increasingly society is saying, 'Inform me, make it relevant to me. Don't give me a hundred different offers that make no difference to my life'," Mr Cooper says. Branching out Technology is often cast as a dehumanising influence. But when the FT went into City of London branch of Nationwide to sample its remote advisory service for mortgage borrowers, it received a perfectly civilised welcome.

"Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?" asks Paul Marks, in spite of the fact that he is sitting 65 miles away in Northampton and speaking via a high-definition video link. He taps briefly at a keyboard, then moments later, the door opens and a staff member at the Threadneedle Street branch arrives bearing a freshly brewed cuppa.

Nationwide, the second largest mortgage lender in the UK, has 60 remote mortgage advisers stationed in three offices around the UK, but it plans to ramp up the numbers to 400 by September - and eventually provide the option of coverage in all of its 700 UK branches.

"It allows you to provide an adviser in places they wouldn't normally be available," says Chris Rhodes, Nationwide group retail director.

The story of bank branches is one of precipitous decline : the number going into bank branches has dropped by 30 per cent in three years, according to the BBA. More than a quarter of branches have closed in the 20 years since 1992. Some new banks such as Atom or Starling have no branches at all, operating digitally and piggybacking off existing retailers for their physical requirements.

But rather than spelling the demise of the branch, Mr Rhodes argues technology can breathe new life into them, sustaining a range of services in far-flung parts of the network. The benefit for mortgage borrowers across the UK is that they can now arrange a mortgage consultation at their convenience, rather than, as in places such as Kirkwall, capital of the Orkney Islands, waiting two weeks or more for a visit from the consultant.

Like other big providers using video , Nationwide plans to widen its offering to include other aspects of financial planning. But it also sees value in offering specialist services such as dealing with the complex and sensitive emotional issues triggered by bereavement or divorce. "We can train 2,500 people in the branches - but they're never going to be as good as 25 specialists with 100 per cent coverage of the network," Mr Rhodes says.

What is it like to use? There is no discernible time lag in the long-distance conversation and Mr Marks's image is crystal clear on the high-definition screen. Voice quality is less impressive, with some distortion that Nationwide says is the result of poor acoustics in the booths used by its consultants; these are being redesigned.

Mr Marks says the response from customers has been almost entirely positive.

Curiously, Nationwide gets higher satisfaction ratings on its video mortgage service than its in-person equivalent.

This may be partly down to an optical quirk of the system: the adviser makes direct eye contact with participants, even when there's more than one of them.

Mr Marks can therefore appear to be giving his undivided attention to both partners in a couple simultaneously, conferring an inadvertent advantage over a consultant who is physically present in the room and able to address only one person at a time. Big beasts Banks are pressing ahead with digital plans not only to win customers from their immediate rivals but also with an eye to the potential threat from Apple, Google and other tech giants. Silicon Valley's big companies may not be interested in turning themselves into banks - however, they have shown an appetite for absorbing services traditionally provided by high street financiers.

Apple now has over 800m people signed up to its iTunes application - most of which carry credit card details - and last year launched its Apple Pay mobile wallet .

Electronic payment services such as PayPal are, in effect, taking deposits, a core function of a bank.

Google and Amazon, with their vast knowledge of customers' spending habits, are in pole position to create enhanced payment services that bypass banks.

Meanwhile crowdfunders and peer-to-peer lenders have opened up another front against banks in their core lending business.

Consumers are unsentimental about their banks: in a US survey last year by Accenture, 50 per cent of respondents said they would be happy to go with Square, the payments system, if it offered banking services.

Forty-one per cent said the same about PayPal, and 29 per cent about Apple and Google.

With tech companies - and now peer-to-peer insurgents - eating into their business, the banking industry is in a race against time to protect its market share.

How the banks handle the move to digital will be instrumental in determining whether, in the future, they are capable of retaining any claim to be the natural providers of consumer financial services, or whether the crown is taken from them.

This niche innovation illustrates the speed with which the internet, mobile devices and financial services are converging to transform our relationships with our banks. From fitness apps to biometric security, advice-by-video and cheque imaging, digitisation is prompting banks to offer myriad new services at the touch of a button.

Some have the potential to smooth transactions, bringing convenience to our daily lives. Others can connect us with services we never imagined we needed.

But how far do we want financial services groups to intrude into our lives? Will these services open new avenues for fraudsters? And in the race to digital banking, will the Square Mile s incumbents be superseded by the forces of Silicon Valley? FT Money has taken a look at the advances in banking technology and asks what these mean for customers.

Plastic and paper

Sales of mobile devices have seen phenomenal growth, in 2012 overtaking computers as the core device for people to connect to the internet. Three out of four UK adults now use smartphones, according to Enders Analysis, the media research group.

Just a few years ago, no one used their phones for banking services; now they routinely turn to their devices to check balances, pay bills, apply for loans or compare financial products. Last year banking apps were downloaded more than 14.7m times on mobiles and tablets, according to the BBA, which represents banks.

The smartphone is set to make deeper inroads into our finances. One of the mainstays of modern banking is the credit or debit card, which has been flexed by UK consumers since the 1960s. But the days of the traditional card may be numbered: just as a card today can be slotted into, swiped through or held against a terminal to pay for something, so can the same technology embedded in some smartphones.

Raman Bhatia, head of digital at HSBC UK, says people s familiarity with using mobiles to buy goods and services online is driving banks ever faster towards enabling new transactions on the devices.  The future of money and your phone will coincide,  he says.  The mobile wallet will become a reality 	. 	. 	. 	Experts have been predicting this for ages but it is now happening and the trend will accelerate in the next few years. 

Cards, whether of the conventional kind or residing virtually on a phone, are also becoming increasingly customisable, experts say. Steven Cooper, chief executive of personal banking at Barclays, says it will be possible to limit cards to a specific type of transaction, or even a specific purchase.

Some might be bespoke in other ways: a mother, for instance, might give her teenage son a card that allows him a certain limited spending power but refuses purchases on online gambling or adult websites. It might refuse to allow purchases after a certain hour of the day or, if associated with a phone, would be possible to locate using geolocation technology.

 You can choose how much they can spend and when they spend,  Mr Cooper says.  Complete customisation and flexibility is coming. 

Banks are rushing to develop these systems for another reason: they hold out the prospect of a new relationship with their customers in which the data they accumulate on spending habits allows banks to offer targeted goods and services.

The power of  big data  to predict intentions and needs is already being exploited by supermarkets and other retailers. Banks, with access to much more comprehensive financial data about an individual, can potentially act as a retail proxy, guiding them towards purchases and helping them finance, insure, maintain and replace them   assuming account holders are happy for them to do so.

Packages of services which are not independently available are the likely first port of call for banks, Mr Cooper says: someone who wants to get themselves set up on the internet, for instance, might be offered a package comprising a computer, internet connection, training and financing. Another might be the logistics associated with a wedding or moving house: after all, your bank already knows which utility companies you use.

Key to the success of a  banker as retailer  strategy will be striking the right balance between offering useful information and deluging people with commercial deals.  Not everyone will want it, but increasingly society is saying,  Inform me, make it relevant to me. Don t give me a hundred different offers that make no difference to my life ,  Mr Cooper says.

Branching out

Technology is often cast as a dehumanising influence. But when the FT went into the City of London branch of Nationwide to sample its remote advisory service for mortgage borrowers, it received a perfectly civilised welcome.

 Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?  asks Paul Marks, in spite of the fact that he is sitting 65 miles away in Northampton and speaking via a high-definition video link. He taps briefly at a keyboard, then moments later, the door opens and a staff member at the Threadneedle Street branch arrives bearing a freshly brewed cuppa.

Nationwide, the second-largest mortgage lender in the UK, has 60 remote mortgage advisers stationed in three offices around the UK, but it plans to ramp up the numbers to 400 by September   and eventually provide the option of coverage in all of its 700 UK branches.

 It allows you to provide an adviser in places they wouldn t normally be available,  says Chris Rhodes, Nationwide group retail director.

The story of bank branches is one of precipitous decline: the numbers going into bank branches has dropped by 30 per cent in three years, according to the BBA. More than a quarter of branches have closed in the 20 years since 1992. Some new banks such as Atom or Starling have no branches at all, operating digitally and piggybacking off existing retailers for their physical requirements.

But rather than spelling the demise of the branch, Mr Rhodes argues technology can breathe new life into them, sustaining a range of services in far-flung parts of the network. The benefit for mortgage borrowers across the UK is that they can arrange a consultation at their convenience, rather than, as in places such as Oban in Scotland or Kirkwall, capital of the Orkney Islands, waiting two weeks or more for a visit from the consultant.

Like other big providers using video, Nationwide plans to widen its offering to include other aspects of financial planning. But it also sees value in offering specialist services such as dealing with the complex and sensitive emotional issues triggered by bereavement or divorce.  We can train 2,500 people in the branches   but they re never going to be as good as 25 specialists with 100 per cent coverage of the network,  Mr Rhodes says.

What is it like to use? There is no discernible time lag in the long-distance conversation and Mr Marks s image is crystal clear on the high-definition screen. Voice quality is less impressive, with some distortion that Nationwide says is the result of poor acoustics in the booths used by its consultants; these are being redesigned.

Mr Marks says the response from customers has been almost entirely positive. Curiously, Nationwide gets higher satisfaction ratings on its video mortgage service than its in-person equivalent. This may be partly down to an optical quirk of the system: the adviser makes direct eye contact with participants, even when there s more than one of them. Mr Marks can therefore appear to be giving his undivided attention to both partners in a couple simultaneously, conferring an inadvertent advantage over a consultant who is physically present in the room and able to address only one person at a time.

Criminal intentions

Does the embrace of new technology by banks open up more opportunities for fraudsters? In many ways, banks argue, it makes life harder for them.

Developments in biometric security will give banks much greater certainty that the person using an account-connected device is the true owner rather than a thief. Banks are exploring a range of additional safeguards to back up their current procedures around PIN numbers, secret questions and randomly generated codes. Identity recognition through a person s unique  voice print , fingerprint detection or, better still, finger vein patterns are all in use or under development.

Those applying online for an account might be asked to send the bank a time-stamped selfie via a bespoke application, showing they were present as the transaction was requested and documents scanned. Other systems look at customers  physical use of a device   the particular rhythm of their typing, the length and pressure of their  swipe  and their pace and routine of clicking   which experts say exhibit near-unique characteristics when combined.

Cifas, a not-for-profit body for anti-fraud organisations, found that the number of cases where criminals had been able to take over people s accounts had fallen by 38 per cent in 2014   suggesting that banks  efforts to raise new barriers to fraudsters are paying off.

However, in figures released this week, it said cases of fraud where the criminal had concocted a completely spurious identity to access funds rose to over 34,000 in the first three months of 2015, a 27 per cent increase on the same period last year. Some 47 per cent of all fraud is now identity fraud   where criminals either create a fake identity or pose as someone else   and the numbers are increasing.  The internet offers a fantastic opportunity for fraudsters to attempt fraud on an industrial scale,  Cifas said in its 2014 UK fraud report.

John Marsden, fraud expert at credit referencing agency Equifax, says the problem is significantly under-recorded by banks and retailers, which tend to chalk it up erroneously as bad debt rather than fraud.  We ve still not come to grasp the full extent of synthetic fraud,  he says.

The rewards can be lucrative. He cites an Equifax investigation that concluded one individual was responsible for orchestrating 105 separate identities at 25 addresses. Each identity could have yielded as much as 25,000 if the perpetrator maxed out cards and loans.

To generate a fictitious identity, obtaining a real physical address is vital: fraudsters often use blocks of flats where a made-up name on correspondence will go unnoticed among transient residents, and where post can be more easily accessed in a shared hallway.

The perpetrator might use the electoral roll or a faked utility bill to obtain a credit card from a retailer, which typically require lower levels of security when setting up. Buying goods and services in shops and online and using loans from one card to pay off debts on another, they begin to lay down an electronic trail for the fake identity, making their spending and payment habits appear as normal as possible. This is a prerequisite for the ultimate aim of obtaining a current account, since banks typically check applicants by looking at their electronic spending history rather than demanding to see a passport.

Mr Marsden says the typical period from initiation to  bust-out  is 12-18 months, as the criminal cycles cash between accounts to raise their credit limit. It is possible, though, to spot patterns of behaviour   but only if investigators can see what the fake individual is spending and paying across all of their cards and accounts.  When you put the lens across the whole of a credit file you can see it quite clearly,  says Mr Marsden.

Banks and credit agencies are also getting better at spotting when several different account requests are emanating from the same device or computer   a classic red flag for identity fraud.  Controls are becoming more robust,  says Nick Mothershaw, director of fraud and security at credit agency Experian.

Big beasts

Banks are pressing ahead with digital plans not only to win customers from their immediate rivals but also with an eye to the potential threat from Apple, Google and other tech giants. Silicon Valley s big players may not be interested in turning themselves into banks; but they have shown an appetite for absorbing services traditionally provided by high street financiers.

Apple now has over 800m people signed up to its iTunes application   most of which carry credit card details   and last year launched its Apple Pay mobile wallet. Electronic payment services such as PayPal are, in effect, taking deposits, a core function of a bank. Google and Amazon, with their vast knowledge of customers  spending habits, are in pole position to create enhanced payment services that bypass banks. Meanwhile crowdfunders and peer-to-peer lenders have opened up another front against banks in their core lending business.

Consumers are unsentimental about their banks: in a US survey last year by Accenture, 50 per cent of respondents said they would be happy to go with Square, the payments system, if it offered banking services. Forty-one per cent said the same about PayPal, and 29 per cent about Apple and Google.

With tech companies   and now peer-to-peer insurgents   eating into their business, banks are in a race against time to protect their market share.

How they handle the move to digital will be instrumental in determining whether they retain any future claim to be the natural providers of consumer financial services.

A Midday Void in U.S. As Traders Pile In Late

The middle of the day has become awfully quiet on the U.S. stock market, as index funds and computer models push the action toward the end of the trading day.

Across Wall Street, less trading is taking place at 3 p.m. or, in fact, most any time but the opening minutes and the final half hour.

The rising use of index funds, which generally prefer to trade at the close, is contributing to the shift. So are the scores of computer models sniffing out the best times to trade, when they have the greatest chance of matching up without driving the price higher or lower.

With the trend has come concerns about liquidity in the multitrillion-dollar U.S. stock market. As more volume migrates to the end of the session, liquidity -- or the ability to buy or sell stocks easily at a given price -- is harder to come by during midday hours, traders said. That makes trading away from the end of the day more costly, making it harder for traders looking to capitalize on favorable midday stock moves.

The shift also raises the prospect that stocks will be more vulnerable to outsize swings during low-volume trading hours in the middle of the day, an outcome that could expose investors, including retail stock buyers, to losses.

"In the middle of the day . . . you have such a liquidity void," said Joe Spinelli, who heads trading in single stocks for the Americas at Deutsche Bank.

For some widely traded stocks, the cost of trading at different times of day can vary. An investor buying 800,000 shares of General Electric Co. between noon and 12:30 p.m. would face a trading cost of about $46,000, or 0.21% of the recent stock price, according to an analysis by brokerage firm ITG.

Trading the same amount between 3:30 and 4 p.m., by contrast, costs about $20,000, or 0.09% -- less than half as much, due to the increased liquidity at that time of day.

While that fact has affected the way big money managers trade stocks, it has less bearing on retail investors, whose trades are usually too small to result in a noticeable difference in cost throughout the day. Trading costs have declined for retail investors over the years, though some market commentators say mom-and-pop investors are still unfairly disadvantaged in the stock market by the advent of high-speed computerized trading.

More than one in six trades in S&P 500-listed stocks took place between 3:30 and the 4 p.m. closing bell last year, according to an analysis by Ana Avramovic, trading strategist at Credit Suisse. The 17.8% of trades in that period compares with 13% in 2007.

For shares of smaller companies, 19.3% of trades were in the final 30 minutes, up from 14% in 2007. That is important because it can often be difficult for investors to trade smaller-company stocks without pushing the price up or down.

Even the closing minutes of trading have become more crowded. The final five minutes accounted for 6% of all volume last year, rising each year since 2010, according to Trade Informatics, a trading-analytics firm.

During the day, "people are watching the paint dry," said Leonid Hmelnitsky, head of equities trading for Mellon Capital Management, a San Francisco money manager with $404 billion under management. "We've definitely seen the shift."

Market liquidity has come into greater focus in the five years since the May 2010 "flash crash," when the Dow plummeted 700 points over eight minutes before rebounding. Traders and regulators also have raised concerns about liquidity shortfalls in global bond markets.

For now, investors don't see the migration in stock-market volume as portending another crash. Many say they are still able to get their trades done by buying and selling later in the day.

For some traders, it has resulted in once-rare luxuries, like lengthier chats with clients or an afternoon stroll. At around 3 p.m. one Wednesday in March, Justin Wiggs said he did something he rarely used to do during trading hours: He walked down the hall and poured himself a cup of coffee.

Mr. Wiggs, a stock trader at Stifel Financial Corp. in Baltimore, was trying to buy the shares of a small insurance company for a client. But the shares were barely trading.

So he left his desk for a spell, returning to finish the trade just before the closing bell. "The only real liquidity point is at the end of the day," said Mr. Wiggs.

The shift began during the financial crisis, as the near-daily tumult in stocks left traders rushing to finish trades before day's end to avoid getting caught off guard by overnight news, Ms. Avramovic said.

But a growing reliance on computerized trading tools has accelerated the shift. Such tools aim to lower costs and limit the impact money managers have on share prices. These include programs that dribble out trades at intervals, known as "volume weighted average price" algorithms. Their proliferation has led volumes to snowball at times when investors are already active, such as at the close.

"It just kind of feeds on itself," said Joe Rodela, head of U.S. trading at Allianz Global Investors. "Volume attracts volume." Mr. Rodela, who trades on behalf of portfolio managers at the $499 billion investment firm, said a greater share of Allianz's own stock trades over the years take place later in the day. Trading later is cheaper and comes with less volatility, he said.

Another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments, such as index funds. These funds aim to mimic an index, like the S&P 500, by owning the shares that comprise it.

Index funds don't trade as often as active investors, but when they do, it is typically near the market close, traders say. That is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate.

Actively managed funds, in contrast, aim to beat, not match, stock indexes. As a result, these funds don't feel the same pressure to trade late to capture a stock's closing price -- though they might do so for other reasons, such as to lower trading costs.

Over the last five years, investors have plowed $226.6 billion into passively managed stock funds, according to fund researcher Morningstar Inc. Over that period, they have pulled $467.7 billion from actively managed funds.

"The more indexing there is, generally, the more close-trading there will be," said Paul Whitehead, who helps oversee trading for index funds at the $4.8 trillion fund manager BlackRock Inc.

Technology entrepreneurs have always been encouraged to reach for the sky. Now, two new early-stage investment funds are aiming at filling the air with flocks of flying robots, led separately by drone pioneers DJI and Airware.

DJI is teaming up with Accel Partners, the venture capital firm that invested $75m in the Chinese drone maker earlier this month, to launch the SkyFund yesterday. The pair have made an initial commitment of $10m, with individual investments starting at $250,000 for commercial applications and underlying technologies related to unmanned aerial vehicles.

With a valuation exceeding $8bn, Shenzhen-based DJI has become an early leader in the drone market thanks to the popularity of its Phantom range of quadcopters. "It's a way for companies to forge a strong technical and marketing relationship with DJI but the charter of the fund is larger than that. It's really about accelerating this UAV ecosystem," said Sameer Gandhi, the Accel partner who led the DJI investment.

Airware, a California-based drone start-up, announced the Commercial Drone Fund, a rival investment vehicle. It will be aimed at companies of a similar stage of development to SkyFund, investing up to $1m in sensors, software, data analytics, services and industry-specific systems in areas such as mining, construction and infrastructure inspection. Airware, which makes an operating system designed for commercial drones, declined to name the limited partners which are providing the capital or the total funds available in its fund, but said it planned to invest in "dozens" of start-ups in the next two years.

"While the commercial drone industry is evolving rapidly, we still see gaps in the ecosystem," said Jonathan Downey , Airware's chief executive. "The Commercial Drone Fund will identify and boost the rising stars that are advancing important drone-related initiatives."

Its first investments are Paris-based Redbird, which offers data analytics, and Sky-Futures, a London-based company that is developing drones for the oil and gas industry. Vertically focused investment funds are often used to kick-start a nascent industry. Previous examples include venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers' iFund, which launched with $100m in 2008 to spur iPhone app development. In 2013, the firm teamed with fellow venture fund Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of the technology group, to back start-ups experimenting with the Google Glass headset.

Big-data software company Splunk Inc. on Thursday reported another period of strong revenue growth, though higher expenses led to a wider loss for the April quarter.

Shares fell 2.35% to $69.40 in after-hours trading.

For the second time in as many quarters, the company increased its revenue guidance for the year.

Splunk said it had a strong quarter and said its 9,500 customers now include 80 of the Fortune 100.  We welcomed a record number of new customers to Splunk Cloud," the company said.

For the year ending in January, the company now expects revenue of $610 million to $614 million, compared with a previous view of $600 million. In the current quarter, it projects $138 million to $140 million, while analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $136 million.

While Splunk's revenue and customer base have been growing rapidly, the company has yet to post a profit.

Earlier this month, Splunk hired Snehal Antani as chief technology officer. Mr. Antani was previously with GE Capital. He replaced Todd Papaioannou, who left in November.

For the quarter ended April 30, Splunk reported a loss of $71.2 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $50.8 million, or 43 cents a share.

Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, the company reported a loss of one cent a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a loss of three cents a share.

Revenue rose 46% to $125.7 million. The San Francisco company had projected revenue of $116 million to $118 million.

Generali to Make Push For Higher Dividends

Assicurazioni Generali is planning a big commercial push in Europe, Asia and Latin America to improve cash flow in the next four years. Any gains will be returned to the Italian insurer's shareholders through fatter dividends, rather than being spent on acquisitions.

Generali, one of Europe's biggest insurance groups, said it plans to sell more higher-margin products, offer new services and expand its commercial partnerships, while also cutting costs, as part of a new strategic plan.

Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco, who presented the plan to investors in London on Wednesday, said Generali had no plans to make acquisitions in the coming years.

Mr. Greco took the helm of Generali around three years ago after a group of shareholders ousted the previous CEO, frustrated with the insurer's declining stock price and disappointing profitability. Since then, the new CEO has sold noncore businesses and stakes in other companies and refocused Generali on its core insurance activity, with some success. Generali's earnings and capital position have improved, while the stock price has more than doubled.

Generali said on Wednesday that the combination of new measures should generate cumulative net free cash flow of more than 7 billion euros ($7.6 billion) between 2015 and 2018, equivalent to around 1.8 billion euros a year. Last year, the company generated 1.2 billion euros in cash.

"We are opening a new phase of our turnaround plan aimed at taking Generali where it deserves to be," said Mr. Greco.

The new cash will be used to improve cash returns for shareholders. Generali aims to raise the dividend payout to 5 billion euros for the four years of the plan, compared with the 930 million euros, or 0.60 euros a share, it paid out on last year's earnings.

Generali has committed to generating a return on equity of more than 13%.

At the same time, it plans to go on cutting costs, shedding an additional 500 million euros through the plan on top of the 1 billion euros it pledged to cut between 2012 and 2016.

The insurer also wants to improve its technological capability, with 1.25 billion euros earmarked for new technology and data analytics. Generali said it created the new position of chief data officer; the person will oversee the integration of data-led decision-making in the development of business processes and new products.

In terms of commercial strategy, the insurer said it would shift from more traditional guarantee-based products to fee-based ones, such as unit-linked instruments and hybrid products that generate higher margins.

Mr. Greco said that, while not neglecting its corporate business, Generali would focus on expanding its retail operations, which represent around 90% of its business. He also said that Generali aims to build up its presence in Asia and Latin America. He reiterated, though, that the insurer is predominantly European and that he doesn't intend to change that.

Mr. Greco said Generali would continue to strengthening its capital position, measuring it with a ratio calculated with an internal model in line with Solvency 2 parameters decided by international regulators. At the end of 2014, this ratio stood at 186%.

The Property Report
Landlord Turns Developer with $2 Billion New York Office Tower

In the mid-1980s, Canadian developer Olympia & York bought the land above a set of submerged rail tracks on a grungy block on Manhattan's West Side, hoping one day to build a giant office complex on top.

Three decades later, that day has finally come, as successor company Brookfield Property Partners is plowing ahead with a giant $2 billion glass tower.

In addition to fulfilling a long-held company dream -- Brookfield Chief Executive Ric Clark was a junior analyst at Olympia & York who championed the purchase -- the tower shows how the increasingly high prices of existing office towers have caused many landlords to eschew acquisitions and to turn to the higher-risk sport of development.

Existing Manhattan towers "are very expensive," said Dennis Friedrich, CEO of Brookfield's office division. "If you have a pipeline of development and you can develop below where assets are trading, it makes the investment decision easier." In all, the company has eight million square feet of development under way around the globe.

Joining Brookfield in this approach are other publicly traded landlords including Boston Properties, which is selling stakes in Manhattan and Boston towers and plowing the money into developing San Francisco office towers, and Kilroy Realty Corp., the Los Angeles-based office landlord that has been on a development spree on the West Coast.

The calculation is relatively simple for these companies. The annual income from an existing building purchased today in New York would be about 4% to 4.5% of the purchase price -- a meager return for investors in publicly traded companies. By comparison, they foresee new developments bringing 7% or 8% annual returns.

"Logically, we are more actively investing our capital in new developments rather than existing asset acquisitions," Owen Thomas, Boston Properties' CEO, said on an investor call last month.

When the companies don't do this, investors can get antsy.

Such was the case last week when SL Green Realty Corp. announced that it had agreed to buy 11 Madison Ave. in New York, a $2.6 billion deal that analysts project to bring in a 4.6% annual return. Analysts at Green Street Advisors wrote in a report titled "Big NYC Acquisition: Right Place, Wrong Time" that the "merits of the acquisition look questionable given the advanced stage in the cycle."

Of course, the turn to development carries plenty of risk. The office market is highly cyclical, and past downturns have left many developers with empty buildings and no way to pay off their loans.

Brookfield is moving ahead on its tower, called 1 Manhattan West, with just 25% of the roughly two million-square-foot building leased; the company signed a deal with corporate law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP last month for 550,000 square feet. In addition, it faces nearby competition from developer Related Cos., which is moving ahead with two towers set to be completed around the same time.

Mr. Friedrich acknowledged those risks, but said the company is confident given the increasing strength it sees in the leasing market right now and the relatively small amount of new development in Manhattan compared with the overall office stock in the city. The West Side in particular is finally attracting interest of tenants, he said. "Rents are going up," he said.

Brookfield isn't out of the market for acquisitions. It recently took control of Canary Wharf in London, where it had owned a minority stake. But the company found it easier to buy U.S. towers earlier in the cycle. The company agreed to buy a building just to the west of its development site in 2011 after just a few days of negotiations, and it purchased a chunk of the downtown Los Angeles skyline in 2013.

The same is true of many of its publicly traded peers. SL Green was the most active buyer in Manhattan in 2011, while Boston Properties scooped up top-quality buildings such as the John Hancock Tower in Boston.

But prices have soared during the recovery as long-term investors like foreign-wealth funds and pension funds have piled into major cities seeking well-leased commercial properties they view as safe investments.

The average annual yield generated by a building's income -- known in real estate as a capitalization rate -- on downtown U.S. office properties has fallen to 5.5% in April from 7% in mid-2011, according to Real Capital Analytics. Like bonds, yields on buildings fall as prices rise, meaning today's price tags are causing buyers to wince.

"Asset prices are really high," Vornado Realty Trust CEO Steven Roth told investors at a conference earlier this spring. "Acquisitions are getting dicey. . .so, we have been very selective in what we buy."

Chicago Snubs Moody's for Restructuring --- City's decision to choose S&P and other rating- firm rivals followed downgrade to junk status

Moody's Investors Service has missed out on a lucrative assignment for Chicago about a week after the credit-rating firm downgraded the third-largest U.S. city's debt to junk status.

Chicago instead hired rivals Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Fitch Ratings and Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc. to provide grades for a refinancing of $800 million in general-obligation bonds expected to hit the market in coming weeks, according to a sales offering document released Thursday.

The exclusion of Moody's is the latest fallout from a disagreement among large ratings firms about the city's fiscal health and its $20 billion pension hole. Moody's angered Chicago officials on May 12 when it lowered the rating on Chicago's bonds two notches into junk because of a pension deficit that is equivalent to about four years of annual operating budgets. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the Moody's downgrade "irresponsible."

S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc., and Kroll have a more optimistic view of Chicago and rate the city's bonds much more favorably at A-minus -- four notches higher. Fitch, majority owned by Hearst Corp., grades Chicago's bonds one note below S&P.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Emanuel declined comment on why Moody's was left out of the new offering and whether it had anything to do with the downgrade. The Moody's Corp. unit also declined comment.

"Issuers have walked away from one ratings firm or another over the years because of a bad rating," said Mitchell Savader, chief executive of a municipal- debt research firm and a former Moody's senior credit officer. "It can happen."

Mr. Emanuel hasn't minced words on the Moody's downgrade, accusing the firm last week of playing politics with the financial future of the city and questioning why it would lower the city's rating and not the state's, which is struggling with its own pension problems.

Moody's has defended its more aggressive methodology, which changed two years ago when it decided it would no longer rely on the investing return targets submitted by cities and states to calculate pension costs. Its own estimates are more conservative, meaning the city's pension problems look worse.

Still, the mayor likely doesn't face much political downside by taking on Moody's and its downgrade of the city's bonds, according to Dick Simpson, a political-science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a former Chicago alderman.

"Since Moody's already downgraded Chicago to junk-bond status, there's not really much to be lost," said Mr. Simpson. "Moody's doesn't have any votes."

The mayor truly believes Moody's has made a mistake here, said Bill Daley, who served as chief of staff to President Barack Obama like Mr. Emanuel and has deep ties in Chicago with both his father and brother serving as mayors. But the politics also are on the mayor's side, Mr. Daley added, since the rating firms don't have many supporters amid frustration over their opinions leading up to the financial crisis.

"I don't think there are a lot of defenders of the ratings agencies. There is not a big consituency out there," he said.

Moody's has been absent from several recent Chicago debt deals despite its status as a major firm. It wasn't hired for a $300 million issuance in April for the city's board of education plus bond offerings last year of $178.1 million with the Chicago Transit Authority and a group of bonds tied to the Chicago Park District.

"I think you're going to see that more and more," said Howard Cure, director of municipal research at Evercore Wealth Management in New York. '"Ratings shopping' is the word."

Until recently, Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based fiscal watchdog group, said the relationship between the city and the rating firms drew little attention because Chicago had an investment-grade rating and dropping to junk status didn't seem possible. "It was almost inconceivable five years ago that the city of Chicago would drop to less than investment grade," Mr. Msall said.

There are practical reasons why Chicago would want to omit Moody's from certain offerings, industry analysts and bankers said.

First, Moody's generally charges debt issuers more to rate their municipal-bond deals. Chicago has paid Moody's $824,000 since January 2014, versus $605,000 to S&P and $77,000 for Fitch over the same time period, according to the city's vendor, contract and payment information database.

Cities also can look beyond the three major firms because of new rivals that emerged following the 2008 financial crisis and ignore raters that offer lower credit grades. Cities pay higher interest rates for lower-rated debt.

In recent years even lower-rated issuers have tended to sell bonds at historically low rates, said Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics. "So what incentive does any borrower have to use the lower one?" Mr. Fabian said.

COMMENT
Silicon Valley has become a dream factory

Coming to San Francisco for the first time in a few years brings home how much it has been transformed. Whatever you call what is happening - a boom, a bubble or a flood of money into what was known as new technology before the "new" became redundant - has augmented the city's reality.

Once, there was a gaping divide between southern and northern California - between Hollywood and Silicon Valley. To the south was the dream factory of fantasy and imagination; in the north was science, hardware such as the transistor and chino-clad venture capitalists who worked in business parks on Sand Hill Road and lived in sprawling suburbia. San Francisco was a pretty, but unexciting tourist town.

It feels more like Hollywood now, full of people writing scripts and honing pitches. "Brave new world companies create something that was not there before. They do not just save somebody money," a middle-aged man told a young entrepreneur at a nearby table in a diner on Monday morning. The ingnu should portray his venture as more than "faster, better, cheaper".

Later that day one venture capitalist described his own firm's decision to turn down Uber when it was first raising money as "a lamentable failure of imagination". The partners should have realised that the pitch for a smartphone limousine service in San Francisco implied a platform to revolutionise global transport. Instead of thinking of the legal obstacles, they ought to have suspended their disbelief.

The old things are shrunken - the San Francisco Chronicle is thin and full of wire stories - and others are exploding. An entire district has sprung up around China Basin on the edge of the city; Apple, which used to carve its stores into old buildings, has levelled a building by Union Square to build a Foster + Partners retail temple; the city's bars are sleek and vibrant.

Silicon Valley is at one of those historic moments when a set of technologies start to work - and to work together - in unexpected ways. In this case, the interaction of mobile, robotic and artificial intelligence is producing a wave of applications and devices, from voice-activated software to self-driving cars. The machine knows what you want and where you are, and is steadily learning how to serve you.

Andrew McAfee , co-author of The Second Machine Age , describes the experience of being transported in one of Google's self-driving cars as going "from terrifying to thrilling to boring in 15 minutes". The machine not only drives competently but with tedious predictability, always observing the speed limit and slowing at every obstacle, as if constantly trying to pass a driving test.

Behind innovations that have suddenly come to feel routine, such as facial and voice recognition, lie rapid ad-vances in pattern recognition and emerging forms of artificial intelligence. The capacity of computers to sift through databases and comprehend what people are saying, what they mean and what they desire is evolving faster than many researchers had anticipated.

As a result, plenty of investors are eager to throw money at start-ups that look as if they possess a piece of technology and a business idea that will form at least part of the brave new world. The fear of missing out is overwhelming the fear of losing money, as Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital warned recently.

History's famous investment bubbles often formed around such combinations of easy money and fantastical inventions, and some of today's venture capitalists suffered through the dotcom bust of 2000. Prod them about that and the optimists respond that the $48bn invested by US venture capital funds last year is only half the amount sloshing around at the last peak 15 years ago.

This ignores the fact that a lot of the new money is coming not from venture funds but from other investors, including mutual funds such as T Rowe Price and Fidelity. Three-quarters of recent fundraising rounds by "unicorns" - start-ups valued at $1bn or more - were led by "non-traditional" investors, according to a recent study by Fenwick & West, a Silicon Valley law firm.

One is Carl Icahn , the activist investor, who this week put $100m into Lyft, a rival to Uber. Mr Icahn often makes life difficult for his investment targets but is as enamoured as everyone else with his Silicon Valley picks. "We'll be the first to admit that you are more knowledgeable in these areas than we are," he wrote fulsomely to Apple this week.

Wall Street needs Silicon Valley more than the other way round. Large late-stage funding rounds such as Lyft's are allowing unicorns to prance around for longer in private instead of being acquired or seeking initial public offerings. They can get on with their efforts to change the world without the world being able to second guess.

Is it any wonder that a lot of young technology entrepreneurs, and the engineers they employ on high salaries and rich stock packages, feel as good about themselves as film stars? "These guys don't fear the big companies as much as they should. They think they can just sling rocks at them and win," says one venture capitalist.

They are creating a new reality, or at least they appear to be - which is enough to attract money. It will not last for ever, of course. Herds of unicorns may perish, leaving people to wonder why they were so credulous. But Silicon Valley is a fun place to be.

Ratings Rift Rattles Chicago --- Moody's, S&P's differing views on city's debt may portend similar troubles elsewhere

The world's two largest ratings firms are divided in their view of Chicago's fiscal health as the city grapples with a $20 billion pension hole, a potential preview of battles expected to break out around the U.S. as retirement obligations mount.

Moody's Investors Service lowered Chicago's bonds to junk status last week while rival Standard & Poor's Ratings Services settled on an investment-grade A-minus rating , a more optimistic view of the nation's third-largest city. As recently as five years ago, both firms gave Chicago the same grade of double-A-minus.

The highly unusual four-notch ratings gap is the result of a change Moody's made two years ago when it decided it would no longer rely on the investing returns targets submitted by cities and states to calculate pension costs. Its own estimates are more conservative, meaning the city's pension problems look worse.

Chicago represents the most prominent example yet of how diverging views of bulging pension obligations can have huge ramifications for financially strapped cities. The split views are befuddling investors and the bearish grades could lead to higher borrowing costs, difficulties refinancing debt and new doubts about navigating the $3.7 trillion municipal-debt market.

"Moody's precipitous downgrading of Chicago's credit should raise questions about the suitability of using ratings to market bonds to retail investors," according to a report Monday by Concord, Mass.-based research firm Municipal Market Analytics.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the Moody's downgrade "irresponsible," but the firm defended its more aggressive methodology. "Our adjustments are geared toward improving comparability" of liabilities among pensions, Tom Aaron, an assistant vice president at Moody's, said in an interview.

S&P analyst Helen Samuelson, however, said the firm stood by its more optimistic rating. The city still has "options," she said, including increasing taxes to boost revenue.

The changes made by Moody's in 2013 and S&P's tweaks last year have already had a dramatic effect on the direction of municipal-bond ratings. In the first quarter of 2014, S&P said it had upgraded 533 cities and other municipalities due to revised criteria against just 39 downgrades, according to a Janney Capital Markets report published last year. During the same period, Moody's downgrades outnumbered its upgrades.

Other cities with big pension problems, such as Atlanta and Pittsburgh, have yet to show sizable grading disparities, but the frequency of ratings rifts could accelerate in coming years as cities wrestle with how to solve a collective $1.2 trillion pension funding shortfall, said Eric Friedland, head of municipal research at Schroders PLC and a former Fitch Ratings analyst.

Projected pension costs can vary greatly based on what state or local governments select as their return assumptions. Public officials are under pressure to keep those targets high as a way of avoiding higher taxes or benefit reductions as they try to recover from heavy investment losses incurred during the 2008 financial crisis.

State and local pension liabilities ballooned at more than twice the rate of their assets in the aftermath of the crisis, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Public pensions now have about $3.8 trillion in assets versus $5 trillion in liabilities, according to Nasra.

What makes Chicago unique is the magnitude of its retirement shortfall. The city has only half the assets it needs to cover its pension liabilities, or the equivalent of four years of general operating budgets. Mr. Emanuel's cost-cutting pension overhaul looks less likely to win court approval after the Illinois Supreme Court struck down a similar proposed law earlier this month that sought similar benefit cuts.

"As Mayor Emanuel has repeatedly stated, the City of Chicago's financial crisis is real, urgent, and has been decades in the making," said Chicago Deputy Mayor Steve Koch in a statement. "Moody's decision to downgrade the City was driven by the Illinois Supreme Court's reversal of the state pension reform bill and has substantially magnified the City's financial challenges, adding real costs to Chicago's taxpayers. Moody's chose to prejudge both the outcome of the City's pension reform law that solves half of our unfunded pension liabilities before it is heard in court as well as the active police and fire discussions that would help address the other half of our pension issue, putting them out of step with all the other major ratings agencies."

Last week's Moody's downgrade -- the fourth in two years for Chicago -- could trigger around $2 billion in accelerated payments by the city, Moody's said.

The sudden four-notch ratings gap in Chicago caught some market participants by surprise and prompted selling from some retail investors, said Daniel Solender, head of municipal-bond management at Lord Abbett & Co., which manages $17 billion.

Debit-Card Data Theft at ATMs Soars

Criminals are stealing card data from U.S. automated teller machines at the highest rate in two decades, preying on ATMs while merchants crack down on fraud at the checkout counter.

The incidents, in which thieves steal information from debit cards to make counterfeit plastic, are taking place at ATMs that are owned by banks as well as independently owned cash kiosks in shopping centers, convenience stores and restaurants, according to industry executives.

From January to April 9, the number of attacks on debit cards used at ATMs reached the highest level for that period in at least 20 years, according to FICO, a credit-scoring and analytics firm. The company tracks such incidents through its card-monitoring service for financial institutions that represent more than 65% of all U.S. debit cards.

Debit-card compromises at ATMs located on bank property jumped 174% from Jan. 1 to April 9, from a year earlier, while successful attacks at nonbank machines soared by 317%, according to FICO.

The company declined to disclose the total number of such incidents, citing contractual restrictions with its customers.

This comes as banks are racing to issue new credit and debit cards with computer chips that make it more difficult for thieves to create counterfeits. However, most ATMs don't yet accept the new technology, though J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have recently begun to install the more-advanced machines. A Bank of America spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether they have seen an increase in fraud. A J.P. Morgan spokesman said the bank expects attacks on its ATMs to decline this year due to enhanced security.

Merchants are further along in installing equipment to accept the new cards in stores because they will be on the hook to absorb the cost of fraudulent transactions starting in October if they don't have the new equipment in place.

That liability shift won't take place for ATM operators until a year later at the earliest.

The wave of hacking underscores the financial industry's battle to thwart cybercrime and comes as consumers and banks are reeling from several high-profile data breaches at retailers that have exposed millions of credit cards and debit cards to potential fraud.

Many of the ATM incidents involve a long-established technique in which criminals install devices that capture information from the card's magnetic stripe. The method, called skimming, sometimes also involves a tiny camera that records the cardholder entering a personal identification number.

Criminals use the information to manufacture counterfeit debit cards that can be used to withdraw cash at an ATM or make a purchase in a store or online.

JPMorgan's global think-tank uses big data  to read US economy

For decades policy makers and economists have sought data that would allow them to better understand how changes in financial behaviour affect the economy. Now they are getting a boost from a new and unexpected research partner - JPMorgan Chase.

The bank launched a global think-tank this week - the JPMorgan Chase Institute - aiming to combine the power of big-data analytics with information culled from 30m of its own customers to build a more granular snapshot of the US economy.

Mapping financial shifts in real time has long been considered a holy grail for policy makers looking to respond more effectively to the ups and downs of an economic cycle. But the data on which they rely are often extrapolated from recurring public surveys and government records.

What if they had access to the actual daily transactions of tens of millions of Americans?

For its debut report, the institute analysed the income and spending habits of 2.5m account holders over a more than two-year period between 2012 and 2014, to gauge how individuals responded to earnings fluctuations on a weekly and monthly basis in the wake of the financial crisis.

As has been widely feared by economists, the study shows that far too few US households would have enough savings to weather a large unexpected expense - such as a medical bill or a household repair - at the same time as a significant loss of income.

The institute found that while the typical middle-income family would need a "buffer" of about $4,800 to sustain the kind of monthly fluctuations in earnings seen in its account sample, that level of savings is unavailable to all but the highest earners.

In fact, while the median household holds about $3,000 in assets that could be tapped, the lowest-income households would probably have to take on debt or liquidate some of their assets to deal with a significant loss of earnings in the same month as an unexpected expense.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

But perhaps the report's most surprising finding is just how volatile households' income and spending habits are at both ends of the wealth spectrum.

Policy makers have long tried to model how vulnerable low-income families are to financial shocks in trying to develop social programmes that can help prevent households from tipping into a crisis when faced with a single unexpected event or expense.

However, the institute's data show that households in the highest income quintile experience just the same high levels of both income and spending volatility as the lowest-earning households.

For example, individuals at the bottom end of the income spectrum of the sample - those earning less than $35,300 - experienced near double-digit jumps in their monthly income 25 per cent of the time and equally large drops another 25 per cent of the time.

But those month-to-month swings were even wider among top-earning account holders - those with incomes of more than $100,000. Across the sample, individuals in every income quintile experienced significantly more volatility in consumption than in income, with spending and earnings frequently not moving in tandem.

What those data suggest is that while financial shocks may be more disruptive for low-income families, no earnings group is immune to the impact of such fluctuations.

"How exposed are individuals to income and consumption volatility over time? Do earning and spending patterns differ across the income spectrum? How much of a financial buffer do households need to weather their exposure to volatility?" said Diana Farrell, the woman who was brought in to head the institute from Mckinsey's centre for government.

"With this kind of analysis, the institute will be able to answer the questions to help policy makers make more informed decisions."

The institute's use of customer data is unlikely to be free from controversy, given the negativity still surrounding the banking sector and JPMorgan's involvement in an array of scandals that has cost it more than $20bn in fines in recent years.

JPMorgan says strict privacy protocols have been put in place to safeguard its customers' privacy.

For example, before the institute receives any data, all unique identifiable information - including names, account numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers - is removed. Only aggregated data - rather than individual - can be published.

The bank also acknowledges that its data set is skewed away from America's poorest households, many of which remain effectively unbanked. Account holders included in the sample must have $500 in deposits every month and hold a credit card from the bank. The sample is also limited to a geographic footprint of the 23 states where JPMorgan Chase has physical branches.

But it will be a closely watched project, and one that ultimately may be able to provide a more data-rich analysis of economic shifts as they happen.

Massachusetts Mutual Unit Rolls Out Online Life Insurance Approvals; Haven Life s new online program designed to take 20 minutes

A Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. unit said it intends to approve consumers for new term life insurance policies in roughly 20 minutes, the latest entry in an industrywide contest to speed up the application process as a way of boosting sales.

Haven Life, owned by Massachusetts Mutual Life, rolled out a new online program Tuesday that relies on computers to make decisions on policies up to $1 million via an online questionnaire, state motor-vehicle records, prescription-drug histories and other data. The service is immediately available only to customers in Massachusetts, but the company intends to roll it out to other states this year.

The Haven Life unit said it expects its policies to generally be cheaper than those sold by Massachusetts Mutual itself, though the Massachusetts Mutual policies have additional features and aren't directly comparable.

Haven Life's new effort follows other attempts in the life-insurance industry to reduce application times amid declining sales. Buyers of life policies typically have to wait weeks while insurance companies collect medical records from doctors and analyze blood and urine samples.

Industrywide, sales of individual life-insurance policies are down 45% since the mid-1980s, according to industry-funded research firm Limra. The drop off is the result of a number of trends: financially strapped families cutting expenses, more people relying on policies provided by employers and a decline in the number of career life-insurance agents.

Yet insurers have a mixed record when turning to computer software as a way of figuring out risks faster. The largest U.S. life insurer by assets, MetLife Inc., launched an online underwriting service in 2011 with a goal of approving policies of up to $500,000 in roughly six minutes. MetLife shut the program down for revamping in late 2013 largely because it took some people too long to get through the application.

It  was too cumbersome," a spokeswoman said, adding that  some were able to complete the process quickly while others were not." MetLife aims to relaunch the program.

The second-largest U.S. life insurer by assets, Prudential Financial Inc., uses a computer-based underwriting system to approve life-insurance policies of up to $250,000. The company said that system takes roughly 15 minutes.

In general, customers pay extra for the convenience of online underwriting as insurers don't typically offer their best prices online. Most online underwriting programs have also restricted consumers to relatively small policies to mitigate the damage of instances where people slip through with health issues that would have been detected had fluids been sent to a lab.

Haven Life's new online offering asks about cigarette and alcohol use, personal and family medical histories and any medications being taken, among other things, but it doesn't eliminate the need for blood and urine samples altogether. The company requires buyers to complete a medical exam within 90 days, and those results could lead to an increase, or decrease, in price.

The medical exam  is a check for us" on the accuracy of information supplied by applicants, said Haven Life Chief Executive Yaron Ben-Zvi. It is possible an exam will identify reasons to move the price up or down, but  obviously, our goal is to minimize" such changes, he said.

While consumer marketing and other firms are amassing data about Americans' food favorites, magazine subscriptions and exercise routines, among other things, insurance-industry consultants and executives said that life insurers for now don't trust that these sources can reveal as much about a person as old-fashioned blood and urine analysis.

Richard Clarke, an expert in advanced analytics at McKinsey & Co., anticipates that life insurers at some point will use such nontraditional data. The increase in information available about people  is remarkable, and eventually carriers will figure out [how to use it], and if carriers don't figure it out, some new entrant will."

Personal Journal: Divorce and Money: Six Costly Mistakes --- Breaking up often brings financial setbacks for both spouses; Here's how to limit the damage

Divorce can be hazardous to your financial health.

Splitting up is expensive, and your cost of living is likely to go up when it is all over.

Experts say anecdotal evidence suggests an improving economy and long-running bull market in U.S. stocks are making the costs of getting divorced look more manageable to many couples who might have tried to stick it out in leaner years.

"People have a greater sense of freedom. They gain more confidence that they could live an independent life," says John Slowiaczek, vice president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.

Still, you should understand the risks, which can be considerable -- whether you are a stay-at-home parent, the main breadwinner or in a marriage of financial equals. The stakes can be high, particularly for homeowners in some of the nation's hottest housing markets.

"Divorce generally results in a significant financial setback for all those involved," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics in West Chester, Pa., who has researched divorce and other demographic trends.

If you are considering seeking a divorce, plan carefully in advance so that you can make rational decisions at a time when emotions may be running high. Here are six common mistakes to avoid.

Overlooking assets

Many happy couples maintain a division of labor in which one spouse keeps an eye on the finances.

But when the marriage falters, the importance of being able to see the whole picture becomes clear.

It is crucial to know what your family's assets and liabilities are, financial advisers say. Make sure you have access to tax returns, statements from investment and retirement accounts, household bills and any other important records, Mr. Slowiaczek says.

Make sure you also have an inventory of valuable property. You probably know about any shared real estate, but don't overlook collectibles, furniture and the like.

Make sure you obtain a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO, a legal document that spells out how you and your spouse have decided to divide certain retirement assets such as 401(k) accounts, says Page Harty, a financial planner at SignatureFD, a wealth-management firm in Atlanta.

If there are any hard-to-value assets in the family, such as a privately held business, a share of a professional partnership or stock options, you may need the assistance of a valuation expert or a forensic accountant. The help can be costly, but if the assets are valuable enough, it could be money well spent.

If you overlook something valuable, you may end up getting less than your fair share when the time comes to divide the assets. In extreme cases, your spouse may even try to hide from you something that should be considered joint property.

Keep track of shared debts, too. If you and your spouse have joint loans or credit cards, you still are responsible for paying them off when you are single again, says Ben Barzideh, a financial adviser in Crystal Lake, Ill.

"Lenders don't let you off the hook just because your divorce settlement states that your ex-spouse will pay them off," he says. "The best thing to do is pay off all shared debts before the divorce becomes final."

Keeping the house

Fighting for your fair share makes financial sense. Fighting to keep the family home, on the other hand, could cost you money in the long run.

Staying put is tempting, particularly if it seems like the easiest way to make sure that school-age children remain in the same school district. A house also may stir fond memories or symbolize a lifestyle that is difficult to let go.

But a household that took two people to run may be far too expensive for one. Trying to maintain the illusion that nothing has changed can drain your cash flow and eat into your savings, and may end up merely postponing an inevitable move.

The smarter strategy may be to sell the house and split the proceeds in the course of the divorce proceedings, when both parties would be sharing in the risk and cost associated with selling the home, says Matt Mikula, a financial planner in Itasca, Ill.

Mr. Mikula worked with a mother of four who got the family's $1.5 million home as part of a divorce settlement, as well as $500,000 in other assets. The woman wanted to keep the house because she had custody of the couple's four children and didn't want to disrupt their lifestyle.

But taxes, utilities, maintenance and other expenses amounted to about $50,000 a year, and the client had little in the way of other assets or income to cover those costs in the long run, Mr. Mikula says. "She was going to run out of money," he says.

His client ended up selling the house six years after the divorce and received about 20% less than it was valued at around the time of the divorce, he says.

Underestimating expenses

It also is key to get a firm handle on your other expenses, beyond housing.

Take careful note of how much your family spends on food, clothes and other essentials, as well as discretionary purchases that can be cut back in a pinch. Figure out how a divorce may change the cost of health insurance, which can be steep, financial planners say.

Make sure you can cover the postdivorce expenses on your own, without relying on your ex. "Always plan for the 'what ifs.' What if someone loses a job, doesn't pay off debts as promised, disappears off your radar?" says Lili Vasileff, a financial planner in Greenwich, Conn., who works with divorcing clients.

Expect the unexpected. After Shelly Church got divorced, her daughter was invited to play on a volleyball team that traveled extensively. Ms. Church, a financial adviser at Raymond James Financial in Naples, Fla., suddenly needed to come up with about $400 to $500 a month to cover hotel rooms, meals and other expenses.

Ms. Church advises clients to be aggressive when they project their postdivorce cost of living, especially if they have children. Be sure to include the impact of inflation, she says.

One thing is almost certain: "There will be unforeseen expenses," Ms. Church says.

Seeking revenge

The less you spend, the more you keep.

That is the financially savvy principle behind investing in a low-cost mutual fund and waiting for a sale at your favorite store -- and it applies to negotiations with your soon-to-be-ex, as well.

Think carefully before hiring costly experts who advocate aggressive tactics in an effort to boost your share of the settlement -- and try to curb your own impulse to do the same if the aim is to punish the other person. Even if the strategy works, you could merely end up with a larger slice of a smaller pie.

A woman who was married for more than 20 years to a surgeon sought advice from Rose Swanger, a financial planner in Knoxville, Tenn. Her husband had cheated on her and they were getting divorced.

The surgeon earned a seven-figure income, and the woman wanted to get at least $300,000 a year in alimony. But that turned out to be unrealistic because the couple owned two houses that were in affluent neighborhoods and heavily mortgaged, and they were paying private-school tuition for their children, according to Ms. Swanger.

The woman already had gone through two lawyers and run up tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees by the time she consulted Ms. Swanger, and her husband had done the same. As the woman's legal bills grew, her credit score suffered, says Ms. Swanger, who ultimately dropped her as a client.

"I don't blame her for trying to retaliate, but I warned her that a calm divorce is the best divorce," Ms. Swanger says.

Keep in mind that every dollar you or your spouse spends on winning the divorce is a dollar you can't agree to split 50-50. Couples are better off approaching divorce as an opportunity to strike a favorable business deal rather than a chance to settle scores.

Forgetting about taxes

Be careful not to divide assets in a way that looks fair on the surface -- but which sticks one spouse with a larger tax bill.

Before you complete the divorce papers, for example, consider how different accounts might be treated by the tax collector.

Monica Garver, a financial planner in Johnstown, Pa., says she worked on a case where the husband proposed a division of assets that amounted to a nearly even split of their face value. He proposed keeping $2 million that was in an after-tax investment account and giving his wife $2 million that was in tax-deferred retirement accounts.

"Each and every dollar [in the retirement accounts] had to pass through the hands of the taxman before the spouse could put it in her pocket," says Ms. Garver, who pushed to increase her client's share of the couple's assets to compensate.

Similarly, Ms. Garver worked on a case where the husband wanted to give his wife -- Ms. Garver's client -- investments worth $500,000 that had cost $150,000 to purchase and to keep $500,000 in investments that had cost $480,000.

That would have left the wife facing a much bigger tax bill on $350,000 in capital gains, while the husband would have owed taxes on only $20,000 in gains.

Thinking the work is done

Divorcing couples often put so much time and energy into dividing up assets that they believe everything is taken care of when the papers are signed.

But there are other important financial matters that former spouses should attend to on their own.

For example, be sure to update your will, says Ms. Vasileff, the Connecticut financial planner. Many people make the mistake of forgetting to do that, which can put your intended heirs in a difficult situation, she says.

If you have a health-care proxy or a power of attorney that names your former spouse, you may need to update that document as well, Ms. Vasileff says.

Make sure you transfer the titles for any real estate, cars, investment accounts or other assets that were held jointly into your name, says Ms. Harty, of SignatureFD. Change the passwords on your accounts, too, she says.

Don't forget about the future. If a divorce settlement requires your former spouse to purchase a life-insurance policy and name you as the beneficiary, for example, you should make sure that the premiums are being paid and that you remain the beneficiary, Ms. Harty says. One option: Ask for periodic confirmation from the insurance company.

Chinese fund doubles down on copper short; Commodities

One of the Chinese fund s reckoned to be behind a precipitous fall in the price of copper at the start of the year has not followed its peers and closed its bearish bets on the industrial metal.

Chaos Ternary Futures, a unit of Shanghai Chaos, remains the biggest holder of short contracts on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, with 24,679, equivalent to 123,395 tonnes of copper, up from 9,996 at the beginning of the year. Short contracts are bets that the price will fall.

The January sell-off highlighted the power of Chinese funds in global commodities markets. They helped push the metal down to a five and half year low of $5,400 a tonne.

But copper has rebounded strongly. Boosted by a weaker US dollar and supply disruptions at several of the world's biggest copper mines, it has risen 19 per cent since January.

Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange was trading up $43 at $6,424 a tonne.

There has been a burst of short covering by hedge funds, some of which have turned bullish on copper. The reversal has been driven by hopes of fresh stimulus from China.

By the end of last week the speculative net long position in copper on the London Metal Exchange had reached its highest level this year, a strong reversal from January when shorts were at the highest since 1998, according to estimates from Marex Spectron, a broker.

Data from Comex in New York show there are almost three times as many longs as shorts in copper.

"Things have swung against the shorts in a big way . . . It will be interesting to see how aggressive they are prepared to be at these levels," said Vivienne Lloyd, analyst at Macquarie.

The position of Shanghai Chaos, which started going short in November, has more than doubled since January. It is not clear if it has offsetting positions in other markets.

"There aren't many traders who can run a massive short position in the face of [the rising price]," said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex. "Risk-management processes require you to close losing positions, not double them. If the Chinese are in an easing cycle it could be a dangerous game."

Over the weekend China cut interest rates for a third time in six months in a further attempt to shore up its economy. "The stimulus is all very nice but it's not going to make a fundamental difference," said one market participant.

An SUV, a Loan and a Lawsuit --- New York woman went to car dealership and walked out with more than she bargained for

WASHINGTON -- Olga Arroyo said she went to an auto dealership in the Bronx last year planning to cosign a car loan for her 39-year-old son.

But the 56-year-old Manhattan resident, who has good credit but monthly income of only $1,354 in Social Security benefits, said she unwittingly left with a $51,000 car loan in just her own name. How she got the loan, funded through J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s auto-financing arm, is the subject of a lawsuit filed this past week in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit claims the bank and the dealership violated federal consumer-protection statutes and unlawfully deceived her into purchasing a car she didn't want and couldn't afford.

Nick Tayeh, the general manager at City World Ford, said the dealership had done nothing wrong, and that Ms. Arroyo had wanted to purchase the car herself. He said it was a case of buyer's remorse and is willing to help them trade in the vehicle.

Representatives of J.P. Morgan declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.

The lawsuit also alleges the auto lender failed to ensure the borrower was able to repay the loan because of what it described as lax underwriting practices.

U.S. authorities have been scrutinizing underwriting and other practices at auto lenders and dealers, according to company disclosures and statements from U.S. officials.

The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are examining whether disclosures on pools of auto loans sold as securities mirror problems that surfaced in the mortgage market ahead of the financial crisis, with a focus on subprime loans. Many of those financial-crisis cases alleged that mortgage-bond deals didn't disclose the extent to which they were backed by poorly underwritten loans. Some of the largest U.S. banks have paid billions of dollars in penalties to resolve those allegations.

The Justice Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are also investigating allegations of racial discrimination in the interest rates and fees charged on auto loans. Ms. Arroyo's suit doesn't raise a claim of racial bias.

The finance arms of Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and J.P. Morgan have disclosed Justice Department probes related to dealer pricing, with Toyota and Honda divulging related CFPB inquiries.

J.P. Morgan said in February that it is in talks with the Justice Department about "potential statistical disparities" in markups charged to different races and ethnicities by auto dealers who originate loans the bank purchases.

Fueling the concern are rising delinquencies in auto loans. As of the end of March, 8% of subprime auto loans originated in the first quarter of 2014 and 2.6% of all auto loans made in that period were delinquent more than 30 days, according to Moody'sAnalytics. The overall percentage is the highest level of early loan trouble since 2008, when such delinquencies rose above 3%.

Ms. Arroyo, who is considered a creditworthy, or prime, borrower, said she didn't have the income to make the monthly $831.09 payments on the 2015 Ford Explorer and shouldn't have been given the loan. Her son, Edwin Arroyo, has continued to make the payments and use the vehicle, she said.

"I just want my name cleared [off the loan]," Ms. Arroyo said in an interview. Ms. Arroyo said she doesn't recall signing any loan application. Ms. Arroyo said she was asked to sign several other forms, which she said were partially obscured when presented for her signature. Mr. Tayeh denied any wrongdoing on the part of the dealership.

Mr. Arroyo said in an interview he had never before bought a car from a dealership, so he didn't negotiate on the price and didn't think anything was amiss when he was never asked to sign any paperwork.

"I thought it was a lot, but I was so into getting a new car that I didn't think about nothing," he said.

The auto-loan industry has largely relied on stated, rather than verified, incomes when making underwriting decisions for borrowers with good credit, because the loans are relatively small compared with mortgages.

Four lenders declined to fund Ms. Arroyo's loan for the Explorer, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.

Chase Auto Finance Corp. ran the application through automatic software and approved the loan with no manual credit review, according to another document reviewed by the Journal. The application listed Ms. Arroyo's income as $90,000 a year, her occupation as "manager" and her employer name as "retired."

The Arroyos said they didn't provide those answers to the dealer representative.

Mr. Tayeh said the dealership submitted information they were given to Chase Auto.

The $50,989 loan included a $4,000 "service-contract" fee and a sale price of $44,000 before taxes. The lawsuit accuses the dealership of charging $7,000 to $10,000 more for the Explorer than its fair market value. The vehicle retails for about $34,000, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Tayeh said the dealer did nothing wrong.

Ms. Arroyo was charged an interest rate of 5.34%, according to her lawyer at the New Economy Project, an advocacy group in New York that helped Ms. Arroyo file suit.

As the technology world's latest investment boom continues to roar, the valuations are getting higher and the bets bigger - as evidenced by moves this week from SoftBank and Accel Partners that raised the stakes significantly.

Investing in tech start-ups has often been a matter of spreading small bets across a range of promising businesses, but the latest round of eye-catching private fundraising rounds illustrates a shift in approach.

SoftBank, the Japanese telecoms group, this week pumped $100m into Banjo, a US social media analytics venture that had previously raised only $21m, while Silicon Valley venture capital group Accel Partners put $75m down on Chinese drone-maker DJI.

The overall amounts pouring into the start-ups have also been rising dramatically. The biggest investments of the week were the $250m for US online lender Affirm and $500m for human resources tech firm Zenefits - both still only two years old.

The notional valuations of tech start-ups has also continued to explode, with Zenefits now deemed to be worth $4bn and DJI's latest fundraising putting a price tag on the business of $8bn, according to one person familiar with its latest investment.

Evidence has also emerged of downside protection for investors. All the investors in a sample of 37 US tech start-ups with valuations above $1bn were guaranteed some degree of preferential treatment if the businesses were sold at a loss, according to a study this week from US law firm Fenwick & West.

A round up of some of the week's most significant corporate events and news stories.

UBS cheers investors with striking surge in profits

UBS was the toast of last week's banking results, with an 88 per cent rise in first-quarter profits surpassing expectations and sending the Swiss group's shares up as much as 7 per cent on Tuesday, writes Laura Noonan in London.

Earnings at the asset management arm, the darling of the bank after its 2012 strategy review, were up 54 per cent year on year while earnings at the investment bank were up 66 per cent.

The decision by the Swiss National Bank to abandon the Swiss franc's peg with the euro on 15 January helped both divisions, as the resultant volatility drove higher client and trading activity and demand for Swiss franc hedging products.

Analysts also praised UBS's progress on costs, as the share of revenue spent on operating expenses fell to 69.2 per cent in the first three months of 2015 against 81.1 per cent a year earlier.

Sergio Ermotti, chief executive, insisted that the quarter's result should not be multiplied by four to create expectations for the year, because there were some exceptional outside factors, but his remarks did little to quell analysts' enthusiastic reaction to the results.

Credit Suisse upgraded its 2015 earnings per share estimates for UBS by about 10 per cent and its target price to SFr20 from SFr18. Barclays increased its price target to SFr20 from SFr18.95.

UBS's shares hit a high of SFr19.77 last week.

GSK seeks contrarian cure by shedding drugs portfolio

GlaxoSmithKline this week set out a turnround plan that rested upon a contrarian view of the future of the pharmaceuticals industry, writes Andrew Ward in London.

At a time when many drugmakers are feeling bullish about new medicines reaching market, GSK has chosen to reduce its dependence on the high-risk, high-reward world of drug development.

The UK group has beefed up in vaccines and consumer health products, such as toothpaste and cold remedies, after a $20bn asset swap with Novartis in which GSK offloaded a portfolio of cancer drugs to its Swiss rival.

Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive, said this marked a "very fundamental" shift from high-priced drugs for the US and Europe towards higher-volume products to tap rising demand for healthcare in the developing world.

His approach puts GSK apart from drugmakers that have been paying a premium to acquire niche medicines from the biotech sector. Alexion of the US this week bought Synageva, a rival rare disease specialist, for $8.4bn - more than double the market value beforehand. He questioned whether companies would achieve the high prices needed to make such deals pay in an era of fiscal pressure on health systems.

GSK has suffered from falling prices for its best-selling Advair asthma drug in the US, but Sir Andrew forecast a return to growth next year as benefits flow from the Novartis deal and cost cuts.

But any growth will be from a diminished base after further decline this year and analysts at Bernstein said investors had "good reason to remain cautious".

Excess baggage of pension deficit weighs on Lufthansa

Lufthansa's first-quarter earnings report this week shone a glaring spotlight on an unwelcome side-effect of low interest rates: the ballooning cost of financing employee pensions, writes Chris Bryant in Frankfurt.

The German airline group said the deficit in its defined benefit pension scheme had reached  ¬10.2bn on March 31, up 41 per cent since the end of 2014.

The deficit has been rising mainly because of the fall in the discount rate that values Lufthansa's pension liabilities. The rate has fallen - thus lifting the pension liabilities - in part because of the European Central Bank's asset-buying scheme known as quantitative easing.

Lufthansa wants to scrap its defined benefit pension arrangements for employees but has not yet managed to negotiate a new defined contribution scheme with trade unions. Its pilots have gone on strike repeatedly to protect retirement benefits.

Lufthansa is not alone in suffering pension woes. The deficit in Siemens' pension plan rose to  ¬11bn at March 31, from  ¬9.6bn at the end of December, the German engineering conglomerate said this week. At BASF, the chemicals manufacturer, pension provisions more than doubled to  ¬9.6bn in the first quarter compared with a year ago.

The news capped a difficult week for Lufthansa, grappling with the crash of one of its aircraft in the French Alps last month, which killed 150 people. Officials at France's BEA air safety agency said Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz appeared to have rehearsed downing the aircraft on the morning of the tragedy.

Markets
Advisers Using  Active Share  Hear From Critics; Concept first popularized in 2009 to identify active managers who were really  closet indexers 

As a way to evaluate managers and gauge potential fund performance, more financial advisers want to know how much actively managed mutual fund portfolios differ from their benchmarks.

But a debate is intensifying over whether advisers and others in the industry are placing too much faith in the measurement, known as  active share," to gauge if active fund managers are really living up to their name.

With the advisory business growing more competitive, more advisers are using active share as a way to show clients they are adding value when selecting funds, says Tricia Rothschild, head of global adviser solutions at Morningstar Inc ., which offers the measurement in its MorningstarDirect premium research tool.

Some fund companies are embracing the measure to promote their actively managed funds, says Russel Kinnel , director of manager research at Morningstar.

Some fund providers, financial advisers and industry analysts, however, say active share isn't a predictor of fund performance, but is sometimes misused as one. They fear advisers could use it to rule out funds that could be useful in client portfolios or that it could lead them to buy funds that may be too risky.

 It's a useful measure, but people are leaning way too heavily on it," says Mr. Kinnel.

Active share was first popularized in a 2009 paper by Martijn Cremers and Antti Petajisto, then colleagues at the Yale School of Management. The idea, says Mr. Cremers, now a professor of finance at Notre Dame, was to help investors identify active managers who were really  closet indexers," hewing closely to a passive benchmark.

Mr. Cremers and Mr. Petajisto, now a portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc ., computed active share for 2,647 U.S. equity mutual funds from 1980 to 2003. They found that those with the highest active share about 80% and higher outperformed their benchmarks by 1.13% to 1.15% each year after fees and transaction costs.

Those with the lowest active share about 60% and lower generally underperformed their benchmarks by 1.42% to 1.83% a year after expenses.

The measure is a  quick-and-dirty tool" to give an investor a sense of what they're buying. But it must be interpreted cautiously, says Mr. Cremers. Today, a high active share for funds would be about 90% or higher, while a low active share would still be around 60% or less, he says.

David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management , says more financial advisers are asking for active share information on its funds along with other due diligence materials.

However, weighing a fund's active share should only be a part of the process of selecting a manager, he says. A high active share could, for example, even make a fund's performance worse if its manager is a poor stock selector, he says.

But if a manager is a skilled stock picker, a high active share is important, says Mr. Lafferty. It would be a shame to choose a talented manager whose stock selections are so watered down that he can't overcome his fund's fees, he says.

Brian Goodstadt , co-founder of Paragon Capital Management in Denver, says he won't buy a fund that doesn't have a high active share. It's a necessity if you want a fund that can beat the market, he says.

 But just because it has a high active share doesn't mean it will outperform," says Mr. Goodstadt, whose firm manages $700 million. He uses it only as a starting point in evaluating a fund, he says.

He also watches the active share of funds he owns to see if the measure changes. He sold American Funds' The Growth Fund of America several years ago because its active share declined over time.

That's exactly the kind of move that concerns some fund companies.

Mr. Kinnel of Morningstar says active share is a fundamental counterpart to tracking error, which measures the difference between a fund's return and that of its benchmark, but advisers shouldn't look to active share as a way to select funds that will outperform their peers or benchmark.  It's more of a descriptor than a predictor," he says.  There's a lot that active share isn't capturing."

For example, two funds could have the same active share, but one manager may buy and hold investments while the other generates turnover of 200% a year, says Mr. Kinnel, noting that some funds with low active share do overcome their fees to outperform.

Some fund companies with mutual funds that Morningstar says tend to have low active share, such as American Funds and Fidelity Investments , have produced good research to counter the argument that active share can predict performance, says Mr. Kinnel.

Steve Deschenes, senior vice president of American Funds who manages client analytics, says active share doesn't show whether a fund's holdings deviate from those of its benchmark  in a positive direction." American Funds has funds with higher and lower active share that have produced better-than-index results, he says.

American Funds' research shows that a fund's fees and whether the manager himself owns shares in the fund are more important factors to consider when selecting funds, Mr. Deschenes says.

Tim Cohen, chief investment officer at Fidelity Investments , says actively managed funds certainly need to take some active risk to justify their fees. But active share doesn't tell the whole story.

Fidelity studied data on more than 2,000 funds from December 1997 to March 2013 and segmented the data into large- and small-cap subsets. The results called into question the correlation of active share and excess return at least for large-cap portfolios. The study suggested that the apparent correlation between large-cap funds' active share and their outperformance versus their benchmarks may arise mainly from their holdings of small-cap stocks.

Twitter Bolsters Finance Team as CFO Adds Marketing Duties; Finance chief Noto brings in help as he takes on added role of heading marketing department

Twitter Inc.'s financial chief Anthony Noto is bringing in help on the finance side as he takes on the added role of heading the social media service's marketing department.

Twitter has hired five new senior-level finance managers including Todd Morgenfeld from Hewlett-Packard Co. and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Steve McGuinness to streamline the teams reporting to Mr. Noto, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Noto announced the new hires to his team on Tuesday afternoon.

The announcement comes on the same day news leaked that Mr. Noto has brought the marketing team under his jurisdiction from the product department. The unusual move highlights "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/05/twitter-hands-marketing-to-financial-chief-anthony-noto/"within the company "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/05/twitter-hands-marketing-to-financial-chief-anthony-noto".

The changes also come as Twitter's management, led by Chief Executive Dick Costolo, has come under fire from investors "http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-revenue-rises-74-1430250091". Mr. Noto ascribed the first-quarter shortfall to a  demand issue" with its advertising products that resemble tweets and allow users click on them and take an action, such as downloading an app or watching a video. Twitter's stock has fallen 28% to $37.42 since the day before that earnings report.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-names-noto-as-finance-chief-1404221891", mostly in stock compensation, from Twitter, has a strong voice within the company, spearheading partnerships such as "http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-strikes-search-deal-with-google-to-surface-tweets-1423110651" and leading an acquisition attempt of news site Mic News, according to the people familiar with the matter.

The marketing department has drifted within Twitter as the company has struggled to explain the service to the masses even with its mainstream media exposure. In recent months, Twitter has sought a chief marketing officer, a search that continues, according to one of these people. In January, the team was quietly moved from the purview of Twitter's chief communications officer, Gabriel Stricker, to under Twitter's vice president of product Kevin Weil in January.

Now, less than six months later, the marketing team will report up to Mr. Noto.

The Verge earlier reported news of his new marketing role.

Mr. Noto's finance hires a new chief accounting officer, two vice presidents and two directors will be slotted in as a new level of management, taking on some of the teams that had been reporting directly to Mr. Noto. The number of people reporting to Mr. Noto will decline to seven from 11.

Mr. Morgenfeld will join as vice president of finance, leaving Hewlett-Packard where he was senior vice president of treasury, financial analytics and corporate development. He will be taking on a similar role at Twitter where he will be in charge of corporate development, real estate, treasury and infrastructure.

He is a seasoned finance executive with stints at Mr. Noto's former employer, Goldman Sachs, and Silver Lake, where he worked on the private-equity firm's buyout offer for Dell Inc.

Mr. McGuinness, another Goldman alum, joins Twitter as vice president of global and finance operations. Mr. Noto has known Mr. McGuinness since their Goldman days where the latter was a 19-year veteran.

Mr. McGuinness served as co-chief operating officer of Goldman's investment management arm and co-led the bank's special-situations group, which used Goldman's own capital to place bets on credit and distressed investments. He has spent the last three years at Strategic Value Partners LLC, which specializes in distressed-debt investments. At Twitter, McGuinness will be in charge of areas such as payroll, equity, employee support and security.

Two other finance managers, Amy Johnson of Google and Greg Ligotti of Peet's Coffee Tea Inc., will serve as directors on Mr. McGuinness's finance operations team.

Twitter is also getting a new chief accounting officer. Deloitte Touche veteran Robert Kaiden replaces Luca Baratta, who stepped down from that role in March, according to a Twitter security filing.
