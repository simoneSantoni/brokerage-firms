UK COMPANIES
Investors show faith in London tech start-ups; General financial

London-based technology start-ups attracted record levels of venture capital in 2014, with investors ploughing $1.4bn into the city's fledgling companies - double the amount raised last year.

The figures point to growing investor confidence that the UK capital's start-ups can compete on the global stage, despite years in which European tech companies have lagged behind Silicon Valley rivals.

The amount raised in London is more than 20 times what it was just four years ago, and accounted for 65 per cent of the UK total, according to data compiled by research group CB Insights for London & Partners, the promotional arm of the mayor's office.

The past year has seen an increasing number of US investors and overseas corporations set up London bases. Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of the technology group, launched a Europe-focused office based in London, while banking group Santander has set up an investment office in the city.

London's tech scene received a boost when several high-profile exits provided investors with strong returns. These included Google's acquisition of artificial intelligence company DeepMind for 400m and the initial public offering of Just Eat, the online food marketplace, on the London Stock Exchange.

It has also been a strong year for London-based financial technology companies, with money transfer businesses including TransferWise , WorldRemit and Azimo attracting large investments from prominent US venture capitalists.

Nonetheless, the London figures are small compared with other technology clusters. Silicon Valley saw more than $22bn in equity financing in 2014, while New York raised $1.7bn in the third quarter alone, more than London did for the whole of 2014.

"The London numbers are great but we've got a long way to go," said Hussein Kanji, partner at Hoxton Ventures, a London-based venture capital group.

Several non-UK start-ups have joined the " billion dollar club " by raising more than $1bn in investment. Xiaomi, China's top-selling smartphone maker, closed a funding round that values it at $45bn, while ride-hailing app Uber raised $1.2bn which valued the company as worth $40bn this month.

Tech
Maybe There Isn t a Bubble, but There s Plenty of Risk

Investors have been cautious about technology companies since the first tech bubble, when startups with no revenue and sky-high valuations disappeared almost overnight after markets came to their senses. And if we define  bubble  as a stock-market bubble, tech isn t in one.

That doesn t change the fact that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startup-values-reach-the-sky-1419900636?mod=LS1", and they are spending it recklessly, whether on perks for high-value employees or record rents for office space in San Francisco and elsewhere.

 There are pockets of exuberance,  says Scott Kupor, managing partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.  There are definitely some [valuations] that cause you to scratch your head and say  gee, we re not sure how people get to these numbers.  

What s different in 2014 from the bubble that climaxed in 2000 is how money is getting into these companies. Vast pools of capital including institutional investors and sovereign-wealth funds are seeking returns amid near-zero interest rates. They have figured out that one way to get them is by funding companies earlier in their life cycles, before they go public. That s the short explanation for the stratospheric valuations of companies like Uber Technologies, whose nominal worth is $40 billion.

The way the venture-capital game traditionally works is that limited partners with all the money hand it to venture capitalists, who are supposed to have all the expertise.

Now, everyone considers himself an expert in which tech companies deserve money, and how much. Conventional VCs seek giant payoffs when they exit their investments, to offset losses on most of the companies they fund. But today s large institutional investors are happy with returns that beat the broader stock market, says Mr. Kupor. So they are piling on.

As Upfront Ventures VC Mark Suster outlined in a July blog post, hedge funds, mutual funds and even big corporations are making pre-IPO investments in ways that are expanding the available pool of cash and shouldering aside traditional VCs.

Smaller investors also are getting in on the game, through seed-stage investments. That trend will likely accelerate, thanks to the crowdfunding provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act that will soon allow anyone to participate in the earliest rounds of financing.

Many startup founders view this investment as necessary to capture markets before their competitors can, as they race for mindshare and real estate on your smartphone s home screen. But that also means these startups are losing money even if they have significant revenue, because they are using their war chest to buy a share of the market. That s how 2014 isn t so different from 2000.

What s different is pretty much everything else: Nearly all of these companies insist that they could make money if they wanted. The  unit economics  of their business models work out, they tell themselves and their investors, meaning that at least they aren t losing money on every transaction.

But they are losing money on other things, whether it s sales and marketing or capital spending to buy or build assets they can then turn into services, which many are selling on a subscription basis.

 Right now money is certainly chasing growth,  says Brian O Malley, a partner at VC firm Accel.  It s not totally blind growth. They do care about unit math and retention, but growth is certainly the most important factor. 

This is where I grow skeptical. Every hot tech company I can think of, from  sharing economy  giants such as Uber and Airbnb, to enterprise and financial-tech companies like Hortonworks (big data) and Lending Club (peer-to-peer financing) face threats that could cause them to fall short of current valuations. Those threats include regulation and competition, but the biggest one is the same as it ever was: Whether there are enough people and companies out there willing to buy their stuff.

And some of these companies, such as office-leasing startup WeWork, rely on a market that could violently contract in a downturn.

Many of them could make an initial public offering in 2015. Box (enterprise storage), Uber and dozens of others have said they are working on an IPO, or they are rumored to be. There are a record 48 pre-IPO private companies in the U.S. valued at $1 billion or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. A handful will be acquired by public companies riding their own relatively generous valuations, but many will have to go public to pay back early investors.

The bull market is going to turn eventually. Economist Nouriel Roubini, sometimes known as  Dr. Doom,  has pegged the unwinding at sometime in 2016. He told Yahoo Finance that tech and social-media stocks are especially stretched.

On the other side are all the investors betting that tech startups are creating lasting value, and that they can survive any downturn or at least that pre-IPO investors can get out before a slump hits.

It isn t that I don t believe all these earnest promoters of transformational tech companies. I agree with social theorist Jeremy Rifkin, who argues that we are in a  third industrial revolution,  for which these companies are laying the foundation. It s just that I m not sure these pre-IPO investors  short- and medium-term interests are aligned with those of the  dumb money  investors who are supposed to take the companies off their hands.

That s why I d urge caution for anyone looking at these companies, at any stage. It s common these days to talk about whether a startup is in line with its  comparables,  in terms of revenue and spending, but that s a measure unhinged from fundamentals in a market that s overheating. When the correction comes and it will here s what will go first: All the companies whose markets weren t, in retrospect, as big as claimed.

The Property Report
Deal of the Week: It's Hot in Fort Lauderdale

Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a city once popular with spring-break revelers, is in the midst of a comeback. This time it is attracting investors willing to pay hefty sums to acquire or develop commercial real estate or land for new residential development.

The city has long been viewed as a stepsister to its flashier neighbor 30 miles to the south, Miami. But as Miami's construction boom has shifted into overdrive, investment dollars are spilling over into nearby cities, including Fort Lauderdale.

Last week, a joint venture of Stiles Corp. and Prudential Real Estate Investors paid $108 million to acquire New River Center, a 20-story office tower in downtown Fort Lauderdale, from Invesco Ltd.

For Stiles, a real-estate developer and manager in Fort Lauderdale, the transaction reunites the company with a property it originally developed in 1990 with Tribune Co., which bought out Stiles's stake in the property in 1991. Tribune sold the building to Invesco for $42.6 million in 1997.

"New River Center was an underperforming asset in a core location that we could never reproduce for the purchase price," said Doug Eagon, Stiles's president. "We feel that with our expertise and local market knowledge, we can improve the occupancy and the building's income stream, and that will result in an increase in value." New River Center is 86% leased, according to Stiles.

The sale was the latest in a string of trophy office properties that have changed hands since March, making 2014 the best year for commercial real-estate sales in downtown Fort Lauderdale since 2007. In the first three quarters of this year, office-property deals totaled $302.9 million, compared with $299.6 million for all of 2007, according to CBRE Research and Real Capital Analytics.

Other property types are also hot. Demand for retail space is outpacing available inventory, luxury condominiums are popping up and multiple hotels have been sold or renovated. The city's airport and port are being upgraded, and a new rail line is coming.

Why all the attention to Fort Lauderdale? Real-estate brokers argue that the city has strong economic fundamentals, including robust job growth and an influx of new residents. The unemployment rate in Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, was 4.8% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared with the national rate of 5.8%. Moreover, investors are seeking alternatives to high prices in primary real-estate markets such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco and, now, Miami.

"A lot of attention has been paid to what's going on in Miami," said Ken Krasnow, South Florida managing director for brokerage CBRE Group Inc. "But Fort Lauderdale is going though a tremendous renaissance."

CBRE said that since 2011, 27 tenants occupying 446,000 square feet of space have relocated to downtown Fort Lauderdale from the suburbs. That has helped reduce the vacancy rate in the city from 21.7% in the third quarter of 2012 to 13.2% in the same period of 2014. The average asking rent also climbed, to $20.05 a square foot from $19.89 in the same period of 2013.

Office investors are attracted to existing properties in downtown due in part to the limited availability of buildable land. "There is a fairly constrained supply and barriers to entry," said Mr. Eagon. "We are not a market where you're going to see several office buildings going up at once."

At the same time, demand for development opportunities is pitting residential and commercial investors against each other. "Right now, residential can pay more and, as a result, they ultimately are the driver," said Harry Newstreet, director of the Broward office of consultant Integra Realty Resources.

In October, Related Group announced plans to build Auberge Beach Residences and Spa, a 171-unit beachfront condominium complex. "We believe that condominiums in Broward County are undervalued in price when compared to Miami-Dade [County]," said Matthew J. Allen, Related's chief operating officer. "The average price per square foot on Miami Beach is over $2,000 compared to Fort Lauderdale, which is around $850, thus making Fort Lauderdale truly an incredible value to buyers."

Investment in hotels and restaurants is booming as well. Fort Lauderdale hit a record 14 million annual visitors in 2014, according to the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau. Eight hotel properties opened this year and another six are under construction in Broward County, according to Nicki Grossman, the bureau's president and chief executive officer.

Fort Lauderdale "may not get the same level of attention as Miami," said Mr. Krasnow, "but the fundamentals and long-term demographics are equally as strong."

Starwood s Sternlicht Returns to Hotel Operations; Starwood Capital Has Become One of the Largest Property Investors

On a rainy December afternoon, real-estate investor Barry Sternlicht was in his element, surveying the gilded interiors of his soon-to-open Baccarat hotel in Manhattan while telling staff what they did wrong.

Mr. Sternlicht pointed to glass crystal embedded in a lobby wall that didn t work as planned, and wondered aloud about the blonde floor color in the ornate cocktail lounge. As he passed through the luxury hotel s restaurant, he frowned at a stucco wall flecked with crushed-glass near the entrance.

 This has to read red,  he said firmly.  It can t read orange. 

Mr. Sternlicht, chief executive of private-equity firm Starwood Capital Group and the former CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., rarely keeps opinions to himself. But nowadays the stakes are particularly high.

Not only does the Baccarat venture mark Mr. Sternlicht s return to the operations side of the hotel business after nearly a decade in private equity, but he is also on the cusp of making history. Starwood is in advanced discussions to sell the 114-room property for more than $200 million, or about $2 million a room, according to people familiar with the negotiations. On a per-room basis, that would match the 2012 sale of New York s Plaza Hotel as the richest ever in the U.S., according to data provider STR Analytics.

Mr. Sternlicht declined to comment on sale discussions.

Starwood will continue to buy hotels for its private-equity funds, and look to sell them after a few years to return money to investors. When the firm sells the Baccarat hotel, it will keep the brand and maintain the management contracts.

The deal would cap a record year for valuations on U.S. hotel acquisitions.

Hotels sold for an average of $240,000 a room this year, a record and up 26% from 2013, STR Analytics said. The increased has been driven by heightened demand for high-end properties from foreign and institutional buyers. Total sales in 2014 were about $20 billion, down from the peak of $30.5 billion in 2006, on fewer deals.

With about $37 billion in assets under management, Starwood Capital has become one of the world s largest property investors. The annual net return for Starwood Capital funds since inception in 1991 is about 25%, according to a person briefed on the performance.

Mr. Sternlicht, 54 years old, started out buying office buildings and shopping malls two decades ago. He later expanded into lodging ownership and operations and carved out a reputation for innovations such as the W Hotel, the first boutique chain, and the Heavenly bed by Westin, which turned plush mattresses into a marketing tool.

Mr. Sternlicht left Starwood Hotels in 2005 to focus on property investing and after disagreements with management. Since then, he said, he has missed managing the operations side of the business. His noncompete agreement with Starwood Hotels expired when he left the board in 2005.

 I wanted to start a hotel company from scratch,  he says.

His peers are watching his latest moves closely.

 When Barry left Starwood, he had to start all over again, and not a lot of people can rebound after something like that,  says hotelier Ian Schrager, who is widely credited with creating the boutique hotel model.  I m curious to see what he s going to do. 

But the business has changed greatly during Mr. Sternlicht s time away. Every major hotel company now has a lifestyle brand, which are design-focused and appeal to a more-discerning clientele. The high-end market is more competitive than ever. Luxury-hotel operators such as Four Seasons Hotels Inc. are expanding aggressively, and well-funded players from overseas, such as China s Dalian Wanda Group Co., are coming to the U.S.

 You ve got to be different,  Mr. Sternlicht says.  The guest has to look at a room and know it s your brand right away. 

Mr. Sternlicht officially re-enters the fray in February with the opening of the Baccarat in midtown Manhattan, the first of three hotels for this brand, with debuts planned in Rabat, Morocco, later next year and in Dubai in 2018.

The New York property, across the street from the Museum of Modern Art in midtown, has 17 glass chandeliers and 15,000 pieces of crystal stemware from France s Baccarat factory, which Starwood Capital acquired as part of a 2005 purchase of Baccarat SA. Rooms will run from $900 to $1,000 a night. The presidential suite will go for $18,000 a night.

Meanwhile, Mr. Sternlicht is trying to create a new genre with 1 Hotel, expected to open its first properties in Manhattan and Miami during the first quarter. It is a lifestyle brand seeking to appeal to the environmentally conscious guest, where all the wood has been recycled and plants adorn the walls in place of art.

Both Baccarat and 1 Hotel are being run by Starwood Capital s new SH Group hotel-management company.

Mr. Sternlicht got his real estate start in the 1980s in Chicago before establishing Starwood Capital, which is now in Greenwich, Conn. The investment firm took advantage of the slow recovery in the hospitality sector from the early 1990s recession, buying hotels and hotel operators at reduced prices. It acquired Westin Resorts & Hotels Worldwide for $780 million, and then paid $10.2 billion for ITT Corp., which owned the Sheraton chain and the St. Regis hotel in New York.

He created his first brand with W Hotels in 1998. It was widely considered the first effort to bring scale to the boutique concept.

 That really gave credibility to the lifestyle space, which it didn t have before,  says Mr. Schrager.  Everyone had been skeptical. They thought it was just a niche for people who wear black and live in SoHo. 

After some restless nights at hotels, Mr. Sternlicht decided to upgrade the beds at Starwood properties. The Heavenly Bed line at the Westin, with its custom pillow-top mattress, became so popular that Nordstrom stores began carrying it.

While his exacting attention to detail causes some employees to groan, he has no plans to change.

 I got criticized for it,  he says.  But it turned out to be a strength of Starwood Hotels.

F-Squared Admits Wrongdoing in Pact

F-Squared Investments Inc., which builds investment portfolios out of exchange-traded funds, admitted it misled clients about its track record and agreed to pay $35 million in a settlement with regulators.

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed separate civil charges against former Chief Executive Howard Present, accusing him of making false and misleading statements to investors. Mr. Present stepped down as head of the firm last month.

Mr. Present's lawyers said in a statement they intend to show in court that he did nothing wrong and the SEC's allegations "are misdirected and meritless."

"There is no allegation in the SEC's complaint that investors lost money. There is no allegation questioning the company's investment performance over the past six years," the lawyers said. "Instead, the complaint focuses on the firm's marketing and advertising relating to performance data for 2001 through September 2008."

The settlement follows a more than yearlong investigation by the SEC into how F-Squared presented its performance to clients.

In reaching the deal, F-Squared admitted that it used hypothetical data to overstate the track record of its flagship index for seven years through 2008, including market-beating returns during the financial crisis. F-Squared also admitted that the formula used to create the hypothetical data inflated results by about 350%.

"We are pleased to put this matter behind us so that we can focus on our clients and continue to invest to ensure that our compliance, research, analytics and operational teams are best-in-class," said F-Squared Chief Executive Laura Dagan in a statement Monday. Ms. Dagan succeeded Mr. Present last month.

The settlement comes at a time when SEC Chairman Mary Jo White has made a priority of requiring admissions of wrongdoing to settle SEC allegations. There have been 15 such pacts, including the F-Squared admission, according to the SEC.

F-Squared is the biggest company among a group of money managers that build portfolios out of exchange-traded funds, overseeing $25 billion in such assets at the end of September, according to data reported to research firm Morningstar Inc. ETFs are mutual funds whose shares trade on an exchange and usually are designed to track an index or benchmark.

In the wake of the financial crisis, investors have poured money into these ETF portfolios, especially those that make frequent shifts in and out of ETFs with the aim of timing the market. Assets in these ETF portfolios totaled $96 billion at the end of the third quarter, up from $14 billion five years ago, according to Morningstar.

From the creation of AlphaSector in 2008, the firm's flagship ETF portfolio, Mr. Present misled potential clients, the SEC alleges. F-Squared advertised that the strategy behind AlphaSector had been in use since 2001, even though Mr. Present knew the algorithm wasn't completed until 2008, the SEC said.

According to the SEC complaint, an F-Squared analyst working with Mr. Present used the algorithm, which was built by a 20-year-old college intern at the wealth-advisory firm, along with Mr. Present's portfolio construction rules to calculate the hypothetical performance of a model portfolio going back nearly eight years.

Mr. Present referenced this hypothetical performance in a presentation sent to potential clients in August 2008, but at that time he said in an email that the "product has been run on a live basis since 12/2000 and currently have over $90M managed against a version of it," according to the SEC. Throughout the late summer of 2008, Mr. Present went back and forth with the intern and an analyst to change the algorithm and compile track records for the model portfolio, the SEC said.

When F-Squared issued a statement announcing AlphaSector's launch on Sept. 18, 2008, it claimed AlphaSector had been the basis for real investments on behalf of real clients since 2001, according to the SEC.

This type of misleading language remained on some of F-Squared's promotional materials and in presentations to potential clients for years, repeated even when Mr. Present knew they were falsehoods or was reckless in not knowing, the SEC alleges.

In September 2009, Mr. Present emailed a fund company with sample answers to questions the company's sales agents may be asked by potential clients, the SEC said. One such question specifically addressed whether AlphaSector's track record was hypothetical or real. Mr. Present wrote that the results were real and "not backtested in any manner," according to the SEC

Since AlphaSector's launch, F-Squared has become popular among investors, and F-Squared's strategies underpin a handful of popular mutual funds sold by Virtus Investment Partners Inc. A spokesman for Virtus didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.

Since news broke of the SEC's probe, some brokerages have distanced themselves from F-Squared and Virtus.

Private group to help exchequer chase 20bn debts

Ministers have struck a deal with a private US-owned company in an attempt to collect more than 20bn in debt owed to the exchequer for unpaid taxes and student loans as well as overpaid benefits and grants.

The government is creating a joint venture with TDX Group, a leading "recovery management" company whose parent company, Equifax, is based in the US. TDX will have a 75 per cent stake in the new entity, Integrated Debt Services Limited, with the government holding the remainder.

The new company will receive a proportion of any unpaid debts collected beyond the figure secured in 2013-14. The Cabinet Office would not reveal the percentage to be paid, citing commercial confidentiality.

The move to establish the joint venture is the latest sign of how a smaller and leaner Whitehall is adopting different ways of working in the hunt for big efficiency savings. In the Autumn Statement last month, George Osborne, the chancellor, set a target of an additional 10bn in economies to be achieved by 2017-18.

Initial clients will include HM Revenue & Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Student Loans Company. The aim is to widen it by bringing in other areas of the public sector, including local government.

The backdrop to the initiative is the government's less-than-sparkling record in collecting what is owed to it from many sources. These include unpaid fees, taxes, fines and loans, overpaid benefits or grants, and unrecovered costs from court cases.

Earlier this year the Commons public accounts committee criticised the government's failure to establish a "cross-government approach" to managing debt and securing more money for the exchequer, despite the direct impact it had on government borrowing.

This inaction had led to large volumes of old debts building up in departments that were unlikely to be collected, it said. The Cabinet Office said that working with TDX would allow the government "to access best-value private sector knowledge and expertise" on how to collect it. The other clients already signed up to the new venture are the Home Office, the Legal Aid Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.

TDX Group, a supplier of debt collection systems based in Nottingham, was founded in 2004 by Mark Onyett, a former executive of credit card issuer Capital One. The group helps large businesses, including some of Britain's biggest banks, manage their debt collection. It was bought by US-based Equifax, a credit referencing agency, at the start of this year in a 200m deal.

Mark Sanders, managing director of TDX Group, said it used data and analytics to understand what individuals in debt were able to pay. It then applied "the most appropriate and effective strategies using the best suppliers from the private sector".

TDX's software analyses customer data to categorise loans in order to identify the most suitable company to collect them at the best price. Its Plato platform, for example, provides businesses with an outsourcing arrangement that takes over the management of their debt portfolios, giving tranches to a range of collection agencies.

The business has grown substantially over the past decade, along with the expansion of consumer credit. TDX is estimated to have handled up to 50 per cent of total debt sales in the UK at one point, although that has dropped significantly over the past few years.

A recent report found that TDX might have inflated debt sale prices while lowering barriers to entry, allowing smaller companies to buy segments of loan portfolios.

The Schroder UK Opportunities fund has shrunk by almost two-thirds in six months as investors fled the product after the departure of prominent manager Julie Dean. The fund, which contained 2.5bn of assets six months ago, has now dipped to 871m, according to figures from FE Analytics.

Ms Dean left Schroders in September, less than a year after she joined as part of the company's takeover of Cazenove. She plans to launch a fund at Sanditon Asset Management - a new boutique firm run by former Cazenove colleagues - next year.

The fund's rapid shrinkage is a mark of investors' faith in Ms Dean, but also reflects underperformance prior to her departure. Judith Evans

Hampton Creek raises $90m from big-name investors in Silicon Valley; Food producers; US start-up

Hampton Creek, the food technology company that wants to replace eggs and other ingredients with plant-based products, has raised $90m of funding from big-name investors in Silicon Valley and Asia.

Josh Tetrick , founder of the three-year-old start-up, would not comment on the latest valuation but deals at a similar funding level have given Silicon Valley start-ups a price tag of more than $1bn.

The round was led by Horizons Ventures, Li Ka-shing's investment fund, and Khosla Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, both of which are already investors in the company.

New backers include Marc Benioff , chief executive of cloud-computing company Salesforce.com, and Eduardo Saverin , co-founder of Facebook. Uni-President and Far East Organisation, two Asian food groups, are also joining as strategic investors. Previous backers include Peter Thiel 's Founders Fund and Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder.

Mr Tetrick said that about half of the new funds would go towards working capital, and about half into research and development. After expanding distribution into 15,000 outlets in the US and Asia in less than a year, the money would also help extend its reach to more retailers globally, including Tesco, the UK's biggest retailer, early next year.

"We have no ambition to be a substitute for a certain section of the population. We want to be for the mainstream," Mr Tetrick told the Financial Times.

Hampton Creek is one of several well-funded Silicon Valley companies trying to change how food is produced , including Impossible Foods, developing meat-free burgers and dairy-free cheese.

San Francisco-based Hampton Creek identifies ingredients that can be used as a substitute for eggs and proteins, to create products such as its Just Mayo spread and a cookie-dough mix. It uses "big data" technology to scan plant varieties' properties and select ones to use as alternatives without affecting the cost or taste of the final product.

Mr Tetrick said that the results are healthier and better for the environment, for example by replacing eggs from battery chickens. He said that investors see the company as a technology venture, rather than a food producer such as Kraft or General Mills - which puts it under pressure to grow very quickly.

"They're not interested in a food company, they are interested in a technology platform that wants to make food better," he said. "They see much larger opportunities."

Hampton Creek's biggest risks, he said, are that it is pigeonholed as a niche producer for vegans, and that it scares off potential buyers who are put off by a fear of "Frankenfoods".

"We are not doing synthetic engineering. We are not manipulating genes," Mr Tetrick said. "We are screening through plants in a way that is novel and using them to make food better."

Bryan Meehan , chairman of San Francisco coffee company Blue Bottle and a new investor in Hampton Creek, said that he was "relieved" to see innovation in food that was not reliant on genetically modified ingredients. "The opportunities across the scale are as big as what Monsanto were proposing their [GM] technology could do," he said.

Web lender OnDeck jumps 40% on debut; General financial

OnDeck has become the latest online alternative lender to make a splashy debut in public markets after shares of the company jumped almost 40 per cent on their first day of trading.

OnDeck's initial public offering comes less than a week after Lending Club, the world's biggest peer-to-peer or marketplace lender, raised $1bn in its own IPO . That deal gave Lending Club a valuation of almost $9bn after its shares "popped" nearly 60 per cent on their first day of trading.

Shares of OnDeck, which uses computer analytics and an online platform to make small businesses loans, were up 39.9 per cent at $27.98 by the close of trade in New York yesterday after being priced at $20 the night before.

The price range for the share sale, which will raise at least $200m for the New York company, had already been increased from an expected $16 to $18 range following strong demand from investors.

A new crop of alternative lenders are seeking to use technology and online platforms to make loans faster and more efficiently than traditional banks and credit card companies. OnDeck differs from some marketplace lenders in that only 10 per cent of its loans are directly funded by investors - the majority are funded by the company's own debt facilities or through so-called securitisations of the loans.

When asked what drew stock investors to the IPO, Noah Breslow , OnDeck's chief executive, said: "When we started the company we had to convince people that small businesses were underserved by banks. Now that's completely, understood. Then there's the technology disruption where I think public investors have had limited ways to play that."

Other market participants have criticised the lofty valuations being placed on alternative lending platforms, many of which have yet to be tested by a full economic cycle or produce reliable profits. At $27.98 a share, OnDeck is valued at roughly $2bn.

In a previous regulatory filing, the company revealed that it had posted annual losses of $16.8m and $24.4m in 2012 and 2013, and losses of $14.4m in the first half of 2014. OnDeck, which is eight years old, has also been criticised for its use of independent loan brokers to bring borrowers on to its platform.

Mr Breslow responded to the criticism by saying the company is seeking to create a "blue-chip" lending channel for small businesses. He said OnDeck aimed to use the proceeds from the IPO to expand its direct marketing - including limiting the usage of independent loan brokers - and roll out products.

A quirk of modern finance is that information for cooking up new products may well come from a machine that looks and feels as if it has been teleported from the 1980s. The Bloomberg terminal is used for finding and parsing financial data, and is ubiquitous in offices in the City, Wall Street and beyond.

Kerim Derhalli, a former head of equities at Deutsche Bank who has also worked at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, aims to challenge the Bloomberg terminal with Invstr , an app that offers financial news, research, market data and messaging. Gone are Bloomberg's $20,000 annual subscriptions: instead, users swipe and tap to make micro-payments to follow particular instruments on particular days, rent an analytics calculator or buy an individual research note.

Citizen stockpickers can be rated according to their performance in a built-in market prediction game, and users can chat with each other in virtual clubrooms.

Like fellow London start-up DueDil , Mr Derhalli sees value in being able to visualise corporate information intuitively.

If his user base grows big enough, he thinks the data on the platform could be used as a sentiment indicator by investors.

Comprehensiveness, not just quality, is an important element of information services. Building Invstr's armoury of sources to compete with Bloomberg will be a challenge, as will the economics of taking tiny sums to cover the distribution of pricey research. Mr Derhalli expects the average user to spend under $50 a year.

His aim is "democratising access to information by putting it in the hands of the ordinary consumer"; another challenge will be to make the service accessible for the casual punter but still packed with features for the serious professional.

Corporate News: Venture Firm IVP Backs Woven Digital

Institutional Venture Partners has a long record of investing in news and entertainment providers, especially those that disrupt the normal patterns of distribution and consumption.

While the firm has backed fairly straightforward media companies such as Business Insider, IVP has also made bets on brand-new models like those launched by Twitter Inc., Snapchat Inc., SoundCloud Inc. and Wikia Inc.

Now the firm is backing Woven Digital Inc., a startup that mashes up pop culture with news and gears it toward males 18 to 35 who read and watch video from mobile devices, said Somesh Dash, an IVP principal who takes a board seat at the Los Angeles-based company in the round.

The $18 million Series A round was led by IVP, joined by Advancit Capital, the San Francisco 49ers, United Talent Agency, partners from entertainment law-firm Ziffren Brittenham LLP, former National Basketball Association players Baron Davis and Jermaine O'Neal and other individual investors, Woven Digital said in a statement.

The company owns and operates three digital-media sites and sells advertising inventory for other digital-media sites, Mr. Dash said.

Woven owns and operates BroBible, which distributes viral videos and other content aimed at college-age men. The site has also become a major advertising venue. The company also operates Uproxx, a pop-culture news site that also specializes in video, and ANIMAL, another entertainment site.

The company's combined properties get five million visitors a day, company materials said, with some 90 million visitors every month. Sixty percent of the sites' viewership is via mobile devices.

"These days, you don't wait for people to tune in. You go where the audience is," Mr. Dash said.

"The common thread [with these three properties] is that they take content, run it through analytics and social media, and make it consumable for a very broad audience. They make it viral."

Woven Digital is in a crowded field populated with powerful companies like BuzzFeed, Vox Media and Vice Media.

The company is aiming to move further into the area of content creation, and will soon hire more staff to help with various aspects of creating original video segments, he said.

Moody s Corp. said Wednesday that it has boosted its quarterly dividend by 21% and authorized a new $1 billion stock-buyback program, as the company continues to benefit from strong demand for its credit ratings and market analytics.

Moody s has posted strong results in recent quarters, driven by gains in its debt-rating and analytics businesses, which help financial institutions manage their risk and sell additional research from its ratings analysts. Shares have climbed nearly 18% this year.

Moody s said it will now pay out a dividend of 34 cents a share, up from 28 cents a share on March 10. The increase will cost the company an extra $13 million a quarter and brings its dividend yield to 1.5%.

The company plans to start on its new buyback program after finishing out its existing program, which had $1 billion in repurchase authority left as of Sept. 30.

Banks Are Getting Riskier

By Alan Zibel and Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON -- A federal regulator said increased risk is creeping back into the financial system, warning in a report that U.S. banks are relaxing loan-underwriting standards in a manner similar to the years preceding the 2008 financial crisis.

The largest U.S. lenders have loosened requirements for corporate loans and consumer borrowing such as credit cards and auto loans for three years in a row, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in an annual report. The easing comes as banks search for higher-return investments amid low interest rates and competition from nonbank lenders.

Officials at the OCC, which regulates national banks, warned a similar trend of gradual easing in lending standards took place in the early 2000s. The regulator noted similarities between the 2014 survey, which measured underwriting standards through June 30, and one issued in 2006.

OCC officials said they didn't believe current lending standards are too loose. Instead, they said they wanted to highlight specific areas of lending where they believe banks could be on a path toward taking too much risk, which they worried could lead to losses.

The survey "showed a continued easing in underwriting standards, with trends very similar to those seen from 2004 through 2006," said Jennifer Kelly, senior deputy comptroller for bank-supervision policy and chief national bank examiner, in a statement.

There were some notable differences between today and early 2000, including mortgage lending, where the OCC didn't identify loosening standards. Some small-business loan terms also were tighter than their median over the past decade, according to the report.

Still, the report comes amid growing concern banks are reverting to some of the easy-money practices that got them -- and the economy -- into trouble.

The OCC's examination of 91 large banks with $4.9 trillion in loans found the greatest relaxation among leveraged loans -- or loans to companies that already have large amounts of debt -- as well as auto loans, credit cards, large corporate loans and international loans.

Among regulators' concerns are what they view as risky auto-lending practices, including an increasing number of loans to borrowers with poor credit, and long loan terms of as many as seven years.

Washington also has raised concerns about leveraged loans that back corporate buyout deals, flagging lax reviews of potential borrowers and poor risk management. Loans to commercial and real-estate projects are being closely watched, "given significant concentrations in this product relative to capital levels noted at some banks," the report said.

"The banks are being overly aggressive in certain pockets . . . both in terms of price and in terms of structure [of loans]," said Charles Peabody, a partner at Portales Partners, a New York research firm. Mr. Peabody said he is concerned by banks' auto financing activities as well as leveraged loans and loans to the commercial-real-estate sector.

Both large and regional banks, he said, are taking on more risks. "You don't want to see loosening standards as the probability of a recession rises," he said.

Regulators have been admonishing banks for more than a year to tighten terms on leveraged loans, but Tuesday's report said 48% of the banks surveyed eased standards in the sector, while 12% of them tightened those standards. The report also said more banks were entering the market. In the past, the OCC has said telecommunications, health care, manufacturing, finance and utilities are among the largest industries tapping leveraged loans

"As banks continue to reach for volume and yield to improve margins and compete for limited loan demand, supervisors will focus on banks' efforts to maintain prudent underwriting standards, monitor portfolio credit risk, and reduce exceptions to policy," Ms. Kelly said.

Keith Leggett, senior economist at the American Bankers Association, said banks' standards remain stricter than in the mid-2000s. "Even with the easing that has taken place, we are still tighter than we were in the 2005-to-2006 era," he said.

Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc. in Washington, said regulators' concerns may raise more hurdles for banks seeking profits in a relatively tough conditions.

The report appears to be "designed to scare the devil out of anyone who reads it," Ms. Petrou said. "I am really not sure what else the banks could be doing right now . . . to make money."

Verisk Analytics  Ends Effort To Acquire EagleView Technology Corp. FTC Alleges Verisk Acquisition of EagleView Would Violate Antitrust Law

WASHINGTON Verisk Analytics Inc. said Tuesday it was abandoning a proposed $650 million deal to acquire EagleView Technology Corp. in the face of an antitrust challenge by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

The FTC announced Tuesday it would seek to block the transaction, alleging it could lead to higher prices for insurance carriers and consumers.

The FTC said the deal was problematic because it would combine the only two notable competitors that offer aerial measurement products used by the insurance industry to calculate the dimensions of building rooftops.

Insurance companies use the aerial technology to help determine the costs of repairing or replacing rooftops because it is safer and more accurate than sending insurance adjusters out to measure damaged rooftops manually, the FTC said.

 Verisk worked hard to come to a mutually agreeable solution with the FTC, but no agreement could be reached that was in the best interests of our shareholders,  the company s president, Scott Stephenson, said in a written statement.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Alliance Trust remains a 'jam tomorrow story'; FUND FOCUS; Analysts say little has been done to brighten record of 'indifferent delivery'

The 126-year old Alliance Trust has received fresh criticism from analysts, who claim recent efforts to reinvigorate its performance are not working.

The analysts, from Winterflood Securities, said the trust remains a "jam tomorrow story" of undelivered promises as little has been done to brighten the trust's record of "indifferent delivery".

The appointment of Simon Clements as head of the trust's equity portfolio and a shift towards a "sustainable investing" approach have "changed relatively little", Winterflood said.

"Although it was clear the portfolio was not about to be run on a purely [sustainable, responsible investing] basis, we were expecting more changes," the analysts said in a highly critical research note.

Winterflood added that the spectre of further shareholder activism continues to be a problem, with New York-based hedge fund Elliott Associates now owning 12 per cent of the trust's share capital. In 2010, activist investor Laxey Partners launched a failed bid to oust Katherine Garrett-Cox, the trust's investment head, as well as the rest of the internal investment team.

In July 2012 the trust announced a restructuring plan that combined four distinct regional equity portfolios under the control of the then new hire Ilario di Bon, with a number of staff exiting the management team. But its long-term returns have remained lacklustre and the trust has underperformed its AIC Global sector average by 16 percentage points in the past 10 years, registering below average performance in six of the past 10 calendar years, according to FE Analytics.

Mr di Bon left as head of equities in September and Simon Clements now runs the division, cutting its number of holdings from 84 to 74.

Mr Clements said further changes to the portfolio would be "part of normal portfolio turnover, which we like to keep to a minimum" - a strategy fund managers employ to keep down internal trading costs.

Mr Clements has increased the trust's exposure to healthcare , IT and financials, and has decreased exposure to consumer staples, consumer discretionary and energy stocks.

Among the stocks jettisoned were SeaDrill, a Norwegian oil services company, German car manufacturer Volkswagen and Glencore, the mining company.

New additions include CSL, an Australian biotechnology company and Nasdaq, the US stock exchange operator.

Mr Clements said the adjustments represented a tilting of the portfolio further towards a "growth'" style of investing.

SurveyMonkey Valued at $2 Billion as Some Investors Sell Shares; Online Questionnaire Service Looks to New Round of Funding to Expand Corporate Software

A group of large money-management firms are valuing SurveyMonkey at close to $2 billion in a new round of funding that will help fuel the online questionnaire service s expansion into corporate software, said a person familiar with the matter.

The Palo Alto, Calif., startup raised $250 million from new investors including T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Fidelity Investments and Baillie Gifford, the person said. A portion of the funds will be used to buy back stock from employees and previous investors, including Bain Capital Ventures, Spectrum Equity and TPG Growth.

SurveyMonkey, founded in 1999, enables customers from schools and community groups to large corporations such as Kraft Foods and Yamaha  to create polls to gather feedback from customers and employees.

The basic survey tools are free, but the company offers premium packages for as much as $780 a year that include upgrades such as unlimited responses, customer support and customized branding. Most of SurveyMonkey s 20 million-plus users don t pay for these services, so the company this year has pushed to offer more specialized business tools for a fee.

SurveyMonkey could use the new funding to expand its tools for corporate customers. First offered a year ago, SurveyMonkey s enterprise product gives businesses more analytics around survey results, lets them allocate billing to departments and works with other software like Salesforce.com Inc.

The company could also use its cash to ramp up mergers. SurveyMonkey made its first acquisition in more than two years in August, when it bought smaller Canadian rival Fluidware for more than $20 million.

Dave Goldberg, SurveyMonkey s chief executive, has said the company generated revenue of $113 million for 2012, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization a measure of profit of $62 million that year. The company has not disclosed more recent financial results.

Mr. Goldberg, a former Yahoo Inc. executive, joined SurveyMonkey in 2009 when a group of investors were buying the company from its founders. The CEO has grown the company from just 12 employees to more than 450.

Previous investors, including Google Capital, Iconiq Capital, Tiger Global Management and The Social+Capital Partnership, all participated in the new round of funding, according to the person with knowledge of the deal.

SurveyMonkey was last valued at about $1.3 billion in a round of funding in January. The startup has raised more than $1.2 billion in debt and equity as it puts off an initial public offering.

Ford Motor Co. is making a bigger deal of big data by appointing a global chief data and analytics officer who is tasked with pulling together the disparate efforts around the company to gather and use the enormous amount of digital information flowing in the company.

Paul Ballew, who ran consulting firm Dun and Bradstreet s global data and analytics and previously held the same position at Nationwide Insurance Co., returns to Detroit for the position. He left General Motors Co., where he was the chief sales analyst, for Nationwide in October 2007.

The auto industry has been trying to find ways to use the huge amount of data flowing into individual companies to better forecast consumer behavior and make smarter business decisions. But until recently the successes have been scattered.

As "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-launches-new-version-of-in-car-multimedia-system-1418315656", and even the machines building cars go online, the amount of information a company can glean is set to explode.

 There will be a large wave of even more data coming into the company,  said Mark Fields, the Chief Executive Officer, said in an interview Monday.  It s really important to have a centralized person bringing that together. 

Ford already has had some success in using the data it has gathered. Ford created a new system for ordering vehicles for its dealers that analyzes sales and inventory data in a given region of the country and then tells the dealer what kinds of cars, and even what options on those cars, the dealer should order. This replaced informed guesses by dealership managers. The result is that cars have been sold much faster because the cars that the data predicted will be the hottest sellers are ready to go on the lot and consumers don t have to wait for an order or potentially take their business elsewhere.

Across town, General Motors Co. has been forging ahead with a massive effort to construct its own data empire. It has built two data warehouse centers and hired 8,000 information technology workers in the past two years. Its efforts are handled by GM s chief information officer.

At Ford, Mr. Ballew has his own division to create and will report directly to Bob Shanks, the chief financial officer, who also is in charge of corporate strategy.

Mr. Fields said the data also have helped Ford determine the exact level at which it must limit sales to corporate fleet customers, such as rental car companies, in order to maintain strong residual values. Sales to corporate fleets can undermine used-car values if a flood of late-model used vehicles come on the market at the same time to compete with vehicles that consumers bought at dealers.

The use of so-called Big Data has been criticized at times as more flash than substance as some companies find it tantalizing in its potential, but are unable to use it in a practical way. However, the tools to analyze and bring together the data has improved and more companies are bringing in people such as Mr. Ballew to organize disparate efforts around a corporation.

 Today our analytics give us insight, instead of hindsight and where we want to head is foresight,  Mr. Fields said.

Bigger Is Better for Retaining Junior Analysts, Report Says

Big Wall Street firms have suffered through their fair share of headaches recently, from outsize regulatory penalties to upstart boutiques that are taking more market share.

But this month, they got a bit of good news with a new study that shows they retain more of their junior analysts than boutique investment banks.

The study, by Vettery, a data-driven recruiting firm, also sheds new light on the well-worn path that ambitious young Wall Streeters often make to investment firms also known as the  buy-side. 

The study found that one-third of investment-banking analysts who started working at the biggest U.S. banks in 2012 remained with the same firm this year. At smaller boutique banks, only about half that percentage 17% stayed on after two years.

Many top boutiques have a disproportionate presence in mergers and acquisitions, promising analysts more exposure to deal making. That often appeals to the buy-side firms. After two years, 63% of bankers who worked in the M&A group, at both big and small banks, left to join buy-side firms, predominantly private equity and hedge funds.

 The deal-making skill set is highly valued by buy-side recruiters,  said Alex Orn, director of analytics at Vettery.

Banks have also made efforts in recent years to foster a more worker-friendly office environment. Several have cut the number of hours entry-level bankers are expected to work and raised salaries for junior employees.

 The banks wouldn t be doing this if they didn t have a good reason,  said Brian Bissonette, a former investment banker at Bank of America. He said efforts to improve conditions for junior employees in recent years include a push to  strip away the more tedious stuff,  ensuring that junior-level employees are allocating their time more productively.

Mr. Bissonette, a 12-year veteran of the bank, left in 2011 to start WorkingGroupLink, a cloud-sharing startup.

Citigroup, which had 49 junior staffers stay on out of an analyst class of 122, according to the Vettery study, had the highest retention rate among the big U.S. banks in the survey, at 40%. At the other end of the spectrum, the report found that 13 out of 14 analysts at Greenhill & Co., a boutique investment bank, joined the buy-side, a retention rate of 7%.

 You have to craft your recruiting for the different markets,  said Greenhill Chief Executive Scott Bok.

Mr. Bok said the Vettery numbers reflect the disposition of young recruits today, who are looking for at least two different work experiences before applying for their M.B.A.s.

 Our track record of analysts going into elite buy-side firms is the single biggest recruiting tool that we have,  Mr. Bok said.

 We are proud that many of our talented banking analysts have made the decision to begin and develop their careers at Citi,  said a spokesman for Citigroup. He added that the report shows Citigroup s commitment to  attracting, developing and retaining top talent.

Tesco funds cling to hope that every little helps; INVESTING

Opinion is divided on whether there will be more bad news

Funds run by Schroders, Axa and St James's Place are among those to have taken a hit from the latest decline in Tesco's share price after Britain's biggest retailer issued its fourth profit warning in six months.

The 1.5bn Schroder Income and 1.2bn Schroder Income Maximiser funds are among those listing Tesco in their top 10 holdings, along with the 184m High Octane portfolio from wealth manager St James's Place.

Two ethical funds - L&G Ethical, a 250m enhanced index fund, and Axa's 100m Ethical Distribution - also have Tesco as a top 10 holding, along with Kennox Asset Management's 322m Strategic Value product, according to data from FE Analytics and Morningstar.

"What we've seen this week is pretty disappointing," said Richard Marwood, manager of the Axa Ethical Distribution fund. "I'm not absolutely convinced yet that they are doing the right things to achieve a turnround. It could get worse."

The managers of the St James's Place and Kennox funds declined to comment on the outlook for Tesco, or on whether they had been selling the troubled supermarket chain over the past week. Holdings data mainly dates from the end of November.

"In a well-diversified fund it is not the end of the world - for example, Schroder Income Maximiser has a 3 per cent holding, but it is only one of 50 stocks held by the fund," said Sam Lees, head of research at Fund Expert.

The managers of the Schroder Recovery fund, another holder of Tesco, "see headwinds but believe the business model is not fundamentally broken," said Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services.

Kevin Murphy, fund manager of UK equities at Schroders, said: "Tesco has significant scale benefits over its competitors, which mean that it is likely to be profitable even at levels where its competitors are making cash losses, and its balance sheet remains robust. Its current valuation implies the present tough environment will last forever, that most supermarkets will make no money and Tesco will never grow its revenues again. To us, this seems unlikely. Uncertainty and panic can create exceptional opportunities for long-term value investors like us."

Tom Jemmett, analyst at the wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said the Schroders, Kennox and St James's Place funds "all adopt a value or deep value approach, so they clearly feel there is value in Tesco".

Opinions divide on whether there may be more bad news.

Tesco shares dropped 17 per cent on Tuesday on the latest profit warning, reaching their lowest point in about 14 years as the supermarket chain said trading profits for the year ending February 2015 would not exceed 1.4bn. They later recovered some ground but remain 40 per cent down on their price six months ago.

Tesco has had a dire year, announcing in September that it had overstated profits by at least 250m. Tesco's chairman resigned in October over the accounting problem, now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.

This has played out against a backdrop of declining sales and profits for the chain, under pressure from discounters and online retailers. Once a staple of income funds, Tesco in August slashed its second-half dividend by 75 per cent.

Top Tesco shareholders including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Franklin Resources, Artisan Partners, Aberdeen Asset Management and Harris Associates have sold some of their shares in the retailer in recent months.

Dave Lewis, chief executive, has said he will use a January trading update to spell out more detail on his plans to strengthen the balance sheet and improve Tesco's offering for customers.

Mr Marwood said Tesco should sell some of its peripheral businesses before looking to a rights issue to raise cash.

He added: "I'm wary of any strategy that involves going toe to toe on price with the discounters. That's a dangerous route to go down - essentially trying to get a bigger slice of a smaller cake."

Nicla di Palma, retail analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: "I don't think we are at a level where all the bad news is in the price at Tesco. I am concerned about Tesco's cash flow and how they will finance what I consider necessary investments in stores and products."

Direct-to-consumer platforms Barclays Stockbrokers and Interactive Investor said they had seen high levels of trading in Tesco on the day of the latest profit warning, with most investors opting to buy.

Mr McDermott said the "sobering reality" served this year was likely to prompt Tesco to be more careful in allocating capital.

Shares in Hortonworks Inc. s initial public offering priced at $16 each on Thursday, putting the a data-crunching software company on track to raise $115 million.

The price was above the company s previous range of $12 to $14 a share and suggests an initial market value of about $662 million. In March, "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/03/25/hortonworks-raises-100m-at-1-billion-plus-valuation-for-big-data-and-hadoop/".

Shares are expected to start trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on Friday under the ticker symbol  HDP. 

The Silicon Valley company is one of several aiming to commercialize on big data software Hadoop, an open source project developed at Yahoo Inc. Hortonworks was founded in 2011 by a group of engineers from the original Yahoo Haddop team and backed by investors Benchmark, Index Ventures, Teradata Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Yahoo is the largest shareholder with a 19.6% stake, according to a regulatory filing.

Hortonworks and its chief competitors, Cloudera Inc. and MapR Technologies Inc., charge for subscriptions and professional services that they provide on top of Hadoop.

As of Sept. 30, the company reported $33.4 million in revenue and $53.2 million in gross billings, more than double the year earlier, while net losses reached $86.7 million, up 80% from the year earlier, according to its amended filing.

Korea's 'Amazon' Gains Backing From BlackRock

SEOUL -- BlackRock Inc. is adding its name to a roster of high-profile investors betting on Asia's fast-growing technology startups by leading a $300 million financing round for Coupang that will value the South Korean online retailer at more than $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Coupang has already attracted investments from Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, which led a $100 million funding round in April, and hedge-fund investor William Ackman.

The latest deal paves the way for a possible U.S. listing for Coupang and is a vote of confidence for one of the hottest companies in South Korea's burgeoning startup scene. The latest round of financing also underscores U.S. investors' rising interest in tapping Asia's increasingly prosperous consumers.

Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a round of investment in Seoul-based Woowa Brothers Corp., operator of a popular South Korean food-delivery mobile service.

Coupang, which describes itself as the Amazon.com of South Korea, draws more than 70% of its revenue from smartphone users domestically.

The new investment will give South Korea's largest online retailer, formally known by its corporate name Forward Ventures Co., a war chest of about half a billion dollars, which it will plow into research and development to improve its mobile service and logistics network.

Unlike Amazon.com, Coupang controls the entire retail process, from stocking products in warehouses to operating distribution centers to hiring a fleet of delivery men, who can deliver most items within a few hours.

Coupang was founded by Bom Kim, who dropped out of Harvard Business School in June 2010 to start the company.

Initially, Coupang operated as a daily-deals service, akin to Groupon Inc., before moving into selling physical merchandise from third-party vendors.

Beginning in 2012, Coupang transitioned to a model that hews closer to that of Amazon.com by selling merchandise directly to consumers. It retained the daily-deals business and the third-party marketplace as a small portion of sales.

The company also moved into the delivery business earlier this year, replacing third-party couriers with salaried truck drivers.

Coupang is growing quickly. Though the privately held company doesn't reveal sales and profits figures, it says it is on pace to average $2.2 billion in annual gross sales. The company said its app has been downloaded by a third of the South Korean population.

All of its sales currently come from within South Korea. The company doesn't ship overseas and due to domestic regulations, it can't store users' credit-card information. That means that, unlike on Amazon.com, Coupang customers have to enter their payment details each time they make a purchase.

Mr. Kim has said that the company was seeking a Nasdaq listing. He declined in an interview this week to elaborate on any listing plans, but confirmed that the company is considering a U.S. listing.

For BlackRock, the investment in Coupang comes after leading stake investments in other pre-IPO companies, including New Relic Inc., an app-analytics firm, and Hortonworks Inc., a data-crunching software company. Earlier this month, the two companies proposed to seek IPOs.

In addition to BlackRock, Boston-based Wellington Management Company LLP is also investing in Coupang.

The previous round in April, which valued the company at more than $1 billion, was led by Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Sequoia Heritage.

Coupang's other investors include Harvard Business School investment guru Clayton Christensen, as well as hedge fund Maverick Capital Ltd., which is planning to launch its first venture-capital fund next month.

Comment: The benchmark of success

There is a lot of interest in benchmarks these days, as exemplified by the London Stock Exchange Group recent purchase of 1.6bn Russell Investments, which contains a significant US-based index business in the Russell 2000.

The Barclays index and analytics business is also up for sale, with valuation estimates exceeding $500m. In the primary market Dealogic, a provider of benchmarks such as league tables and bookbuilding software, has been bought by private equity firm Carlyle for $700m, and Ipreo, a competitor, has been bought by Blackstone and Goldman Sachs' investment arm for $975m.

What explains the high demand and valuations for these data assets from non-bank players? In the case of index businesses, the easy answer is the untapped revenue and profit streams that independent index providers are able to generate through explicit fees, such as data subscriptions, fees based on assets under managementor product licensing fees.

These revenue streams may be a multiple of the income explicitly captured by banks, which have traditionally viewed benchmarks as a low-cost or "giveaway" service through which to either develop products or to attract trading flows, primarily in the fixed income, currency and commodity (FICC) market.

In the case of providers such as FTSE (a subsidiary of the LSE since 2012), S&P Dow Jones (a joint venture in which CME Group has a stake) or the independent MSCI, explicit fees can be meaningful, exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars.

Even so, they pale in comparison to the indirect fees generated from trading products linked to the benchmarks. Such revenue streams can run into the billions. And herein lies the real reason for the high valuations these properties are attracting: the acquirers are hoping that the benchmarks will give them an opportunity to participate in trading profits.

The connection between benchmarks and trading is one that banks have long understood. We might summarise it as follows: he who controls the benchmark, and the intellectual property that goes into it, holds a key to the liquidity of the market.

To take things one step further, we are able to observe how products based in one way or another on the major indices such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), futures or volatility contracts, now account for an ever larger share of equity market volumes.

Notwithstanding philosophical debates about active versus passive management techniques, managers always need to measure their performance. Individuals and professionals alike benefit from liquid vehicles in the cash or derivatives markets to express their views, bullish or bearish.

This means that the index business is likely to grow in the future, as will the products and the overall trading activity linked to the indices. In particular, we would expect products such as fixed income ETFs, which have grown at 20 per cent compound annual growth over the past five years, to develop further.

Buy-side firms hold $22tn in fixed income assets under management, versus $24tn in equities, according to our analysis of publicly available data from institutions such as BlackRock, ICI and the OECD.

Yet ETFs linked to fixed income total a paltry $350bn compared with nearly $2tn in equities, according to BlackRock.

There is much room for growth. In December mutual life insurance company New York Life Insurance announced that it plans to acquire ETF index provider IndexIQ. We would also expect more exchange-traded futures and options equivalents in credit in the future. 

Ultimately, we believe that these recent index transactions are a key performance indicator for the migration of over-the-counter products, such as derivatives and corporate bonds, on to exchange.

As the intellectual property central to so much trading activity migrates away from banks to other intermediaries, we are seeing value shift into a series of new areas.

We expect a world where banks compete with alternative providers who can use their control of data and analytics to change market shares and market structure.

Indirect, non-transparent charging models will give way to new revenue streams and expand the capital markets ecosystem to include new types of players and services, as well as winners and losers among the incumbents.

BBVA has bought a Spanish "big data" start-up in the latest sign that large banks are increasingly eager to integrate new technologies into their business models.

Madiva Soluciones, founded in 2008, processes "unstructured data" for its clients, which include banks, insurance companies and property companies. The value of the deal was not disclosed.

Technology acquisitions have become a central part of BBVA's strategy. Last February, it bought Simple, a rapidly growing US digital bank that allows customers to conduct transactions through an app. In October, the bank announced a partnership with Iowa-based Dwolla, a company that allows users to process payments more quickly than through traditional wire transfers.

BBVA's deal with Madiva underscores the way in which banks are beginning to utilise reserves of data to speed up time-consuming tasks, such as valuing portfolios of assets. The acquisition of Madiva, which will stay an independent company, also has implications for the way in which BBVA interacts with customers, according to Mark Jamison, head of global customer experience.

"The typical process for a mortgage can involve a bunch of paperwork which can take days or weeks," he said. "Madiva has taken publicly available data sources and created algorithms which decrease the processing time. Within a couple of minutes, they can very accurately tell you how much you can or should borrow against the house."

Lending Club IPO rides wave of easy money; General financial: P2P

Enthusiasm for high-tech lending is tempered by fears of a subprime-style disaster

After months of expectation, the investor roadshow for Lending Club's initial public offering began on the first day of December. Five hours later it was a roaring success.

Seeking to raise at least $650m, the world's biggest peer-to-peer lender received pledges for the full amount in less time than it takes t o fly from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.

Like many of its San Francisco brethren, Lending Club has ridden a wave of easy money and enthusiasm about the disruptive power of new technology to achieve extraordinary growth. The company attracted Wall Street names including Lawrence Summers, former US Treasury secretary, and John Mack, former Morgan Stanley chief, as directors and investors.

This week that enthusiasm is set to reach a pitch as the company lists on the New York Stock Exchange in a move expected to give it a valuation well in excess of $4bn. But that extra money is coming at a time when some of the biggest P2P investors are expressing growing concern about the future trajectory of marketplace lending.

While investors are keen to capitalise on the prospect of technology being used to lend more efficiently, some of the sector's more established participants are asking whether an industry facing such intense pressure to grow could wind up with a disaster similar to the subprime lending boom.

"We've seen this movie before," said Etienne Boillot, an investor in P2P loans with Shepherd Capital, at an industry conference at Nasdaq last month. "It's a little bit dangerous, and as capital providers we have to be very careful."

Lending Club was co-founded in 2006 by its chief executive, Renaud Laplanche , a sailing champion-turned-lawyer-turned entrepreneur. It began with a simple premise: use cutting-edge technology to create an online platform that connects borrowers with lenders. The company can bypass banks and extend loans at a lower rate for borrowers, and generate higher returns for lenders and investors.

It was good timing. The financial crisis of 2008 triggered a wave of outrage at big banks, encouraging borrowers to seek alternatives. Ultra-low interest rates encouraged professional investors to buy the higher-yielding loans originated through the new platform.

To grade its borrowers Lending Club uses traditional credit scores and a proprietary system that incorporates online data points. Loans to borrowers it deems safest give a return of 7.6 per cent, compared with the 0.65 per cent on offer from two-year US Treasuries.

Many in the industry consider the IPO a legitimising moment for the entire P2P sector. "Everybody who's doing alternative lending really sees this as like a coming-out party for the industry," said Aaron Vermut , CEO of Prosper, Lending Club's closest rival. "We have all worked very hard to make the platforms and there's a lot of money coming in."

However, some people have questioned the innovation behind Lending Club's business - in particular whether it diverges appreciably from the "originate to distribute" model of securitised lending that caused chaos in the run-up to the crisis. Many of the company's efficiencies are achieved simply by virtue of not being a bank, and it does not retain any credit risk in the loans it originates.

"They're not true peer-to-peer," said Max Gasner, CEO of One Financial, a retail finance start-up. "They use their freedom as a non-bank to generate high-yield stuff for institutional players."

In a note last week Barclays banking analysts said: "A borrower who is deemed higher risk by his or her own bank may be able to find a more attractive rate from another lender. But as the recent credit crisis has demonstrated, there are individual and broader costs of inappropriately extended credit."

Many investors praise the transparency of the Lending Club model, saying it differs markedly from the origination practices that led to subprime home loans with little documentation being bundled into bonds by banks.

Investors can sift through reams of publicly available information on borrowers, though much of it is selfreported and not verified by Lending Club. "If a platform offers 200 loans, you can analyse them and select only five. Technology and big data enable that," said Joshua Rand of Petra Partners.

Having spent the years after the crisis scooping up distressed property loans from banks, Mr Rand said P2P loans were different. "You're not simply being spoon-fed these loans."

Lending Club's IPO has garnered significant interest. By day two of the roadshow the issue was three times subscribed, people familiar with the matter said, enabling it to increase the price of the planned IPO from a range of $10-$12 per share to $12-$14. Lending Club declined to comment ahead of the IPO.

Matt Burton, founder of Orchard, a secondary trading market for P2P loans, said "the biggest question mark" was whether Lending Club would meet Wall Street's expectations on a "quarter-by-quarter basis". Some P2P investors worry that the temptation will be to cut corners in underwriting or extend credit to lower-quality borrowers to meet expectations. The average credit scores of borrowers on Lending Club's and Prosper's platforms is now about 700 - firmly in "prime" territory.

One top P2P investor said: "We have a few years to go [before there are problems]. I don't see anything today that makes me nervous. But we don't own equity in Lending Club, and we will flip the switch as soon as we see problems."

The biggest danger to Lending Club's future may be its rapid success. Dozens of imitators are jumping in. Mr Boillot admonished the "self congratulatory mode" of those at the Nasdaq conference, and warned of further challenges as money poured in. "We're going to have an accident."

Canadian Property Investors Tap London

LONDON Real-estate investors from the Middle East and Asia have been snapping up trophy assets in London s commercial-property market. But there is another group on the prowl: Canadians.

On Monday, Canadian firm Ivanho Cambridge bought Stonecutter Court, a central London office building, for 112 million from Hines Global REIT.  We definitely want to be more present in London,  said Meka Brunel, executive vice president at Ivanho Cambridge, which has been active in London for 20 years and owns just over 500 million of assets there.  We have the right deals in mind. 

Meanwhile, Brookfield Property Partners LP, another Canadian property company, is bidding with state investment fund Qatar Investment Authority for Songbird Estates PLC, owner of London s Canary Wharf business district. Brookfield manages $95 billion in real-estate assets and bought a central London office block, Moorgate Exchange, for 211 million ($330.3 million) last week.

 We ve been very focused on London,  said Brookfield Chief Executive Ric Clark, noting the firm has been building up its team in London over the past two years.  There are a few very special cities in the world. London is high on the list. 

Brookfield has been a shareholder in Songbird for more than a decade. The deal for Canary Wharf could move forward before year-end, although some people close to the talks said details were more likely to be finalized early next year.

One reason money from Asia or the Middle East often grabs the attention is because of the trophy assets that are bought.

Indeed, on Tuesday, investment firm Abu Dhabi Financial Group purchased New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of London s police force, for 370 million. The 600,000-square-foot site is to be redeveloped into luxury homes, a restaurant and health facilities by 2017.

Last month, a Brazilian firm bought the Gherkin, one of the most recognizable office towers in London s skyline. Chinese investors scooped up eight London properties for a combined $4 billion this year. The Qatar Investment Authority bought four buildings for a total of $1.5 billion, data from research firm Real Capital Analytics show. The Qatar investment fund is also lined up to close on HSBC Holdings PLC s global headquarters in Canary Wharf for more than 1.1 billion, in what would be the biggest real-estate deal in U.K. history.

Despite the attention focused on new buyers from the Middle East and Asia, North Americans, who have been present in the market for far longer, continue to dominate cross-border investments in London and around the world. Investors from North America pumped $39 billion into U.K. real estate in the past 24 months, according to Real Capital Analytics. London is the top destination, capturing $17.3 billion.

Investors from the Middle East bought $10.8 billion in the same period, with London getting $9.4 billion of that.

World-wide, U.S. and Canadian investors were first and second, respectively, in buying the most real estate abroad through the third quarter, real-estate broker JLL data show. Germany was third, followed by France and China.

During the first three quarters this year,  U.S. investors have spent double the amount of Chinese investors, and capital from Canada has surpassed $11 billion, twice as much when compared to the first three months of 2013,  the JLL said.

For property investors, regardless of where they are from, London ticks many of the right boxes: laws that side with property owners, an expanding economy, and a market where it is easier to trade in expensive assets than almost anywhere else in the world.

In the deal for New Scotland Yard, the purchase was 120 million above the projected price. The sale was part of a drive by London officials to reduce costs.

Prime Minister David Cameron s coalition government has cut spending on police by about 12% since it came to power in 2010, as part of sweeping cuts intended to reduce the U.K. budget deficit, Home Office figures show.

The commissioner of London s Metropolitan Police Service, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said funding was under extreme pressure. He said the service has to make cuts equivalent to a third of its original budget,  so this money is absolutely vital to us. 

The sale of New Scotland Yard is part of an overhaul of London s police real-estate holdings that will see a total of about 200 buildings sold by 2017. The mayor s office hopes the sales will cut annual costs by about 60 million, enough to fund 1,000 officers. Fifty-two of those sites have been sold and 55 leases terminated since 2013, raising 215 million.

The proceeds are mainly due to go toward funding the new, smaller headquarters for Scotland Yard and equipping police with the latest mobile technology and software, according to London Mayor Boris Johnson. A small portion of the proceeds will also be used to relocate Metropolitan Police artifacts and memorabilia to a dedicated museum, the mayor s office said.

LONDON -- Real-estate investors from the Middle East and Asia have been snapping up trophy assets in London's commercial-property market. But there is another group on the prowl: Canadians.

On Monday, Canadian firm Ivanhoe Cambridge bought Stonecutter Court, a central London office building, for GBP 112 million ($175.3 million) from Hines Global REIT. "We definitely want to be more present in London," said Meka Brunel, executive vice president at Ivanhoe Cambridge, which has been active in London for 20 years and owns just over GBP 500 million of assets there. "We have the right deals in mind."

Meanwhile, Brookfield Property Partners LP, another Canadian property company, is bidding with state investment fund Qatar Investment Authority for Songbird Estates PLC, owner of London's Canary Wharf business district. Brookfield manages US$95 billion in real-estate assets and bought a central London office block, Moorgate Exchange, for GBP 211 million ($330.3 million) last week.

"We've been very focused on London," said Brookfield Chief Executive Ric Clark, noting the firm has been building up its team in London over the past two years. "There are a few very special cities in the world. London is high on the list."

Brookfield has been a shareholder in Songbird for more than a decade. The deal for Canary Wharf could move forward before year-end, although some people close to the talks said details were more likely to be finalized early next year.

One reason money from Asia or the Middle East often grabs the attention is because of the trophy assets that are bought.

Indeed, on Tuesday, investment firm Abu Dhabi Financial Group purchased New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of London's police force, for GBP 370 million. The 600,000-square-foot site is to be redeveloped into luxury homes, a restaurant and health facilities by 2017.

Last month, a Brazilian firm bought the Gherkin, one of the most recognizable office towers in London's skyline. Chinese investors scooped up eight London properties for a combined $4 billion this year. The Qatar Investment Authority bought four buildings for a total of $1.5 billion, data from research firm Real Capital Analytics show. The Qatar investment fund also is lined up to close on HSBC Holdings PLC's global headquarters in Canary Wharf for more than GBP 1.1 billion, in what would be the biggest real-estate deal in U.K. history.

Despite the attention focused on new buyers from the Middle East and Asia, North Americans, who have been present in the market for far longer, continue to dominate cross-border investments in London and around the world. Investors from North America pumped $39 billion into U.K. real estate in the past 24 months, according to Real Capital Analytics. London is the top destination, capturing $17.3 billion. Investors from the Middle East bought $10.8 billion in the same period, with London getting $9.4 billion of that.

World-wide, U.S. and Canadian investors were first and second, respectively, in buying the most real estate abroad through the third quarter, real-estate broker JLL data show. Germany was third, followed by France and China.

During the first three quarters this year, "U.S. investors have spent double the amount of Chinese investors, and capital from Canada has surpassed $11 billion, twice as much when compared to the first three months of 2013," the JLL said.

For property investors, regardless of where they are from, London ticks many of the right boxes: laws that side with property owners, an expanding economy, and a market where it is easier to trade in expensive assets than almost anywhere else in the world.

In the deal for New Scotland Yard, the purchase was GBP 120 million above the projected price. The sale was part of a drive by London officials to reduce costs.

Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government has cut spending on police by about 12% since it came to power in 2010, as part of sweeping cuts intended to reduce the U.K. budget deficit, Home Office figures show.

The commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said funding was under extreme pressure. He said the service has to make cuts equivalent to a third of its original budget, "so this money is absolutely vital to us."

The sale of New Scotland Yard is part of an overhaul of London's police real-estate holdings that will see a total of about 200 buildings sold by 2017. The mayor's office hopes the sales will cut annual costs by about GBP 60 million, enough to fund 1,000 officers. Fifty-two of those sites have been sold and 55 leases terminated since 2013, raising GBP 215 million.

The proceeds are mainly due to go toward funding the new, smaller headquarters for Scotland Yard and equipping police with the latest mobile technology and software, according to London Mayor Boris Johnson. A small portion of the proceeds will also be used to relocate Metropolitan Police artifacts and memorabilia to a dedicated museum, the mayor's office said.

Skyscraper Is Latest Deal For Chinese

In the past two years, Chinese investors have bought stakes in New York's most valuable office tower, one of its largest development projects and the country's most expensive hotel ever sold.

Next on the list: Manhattan's newest skyscraper.

Bank of China Ltd. has agreed to pay nearly $600 million for 7 Bryant Park, a 28-story building being constructed on Sixth Avenue and 40th Street, according to people familiar with the matter.

The 470,000-square-foot tower, being built by a venture led by Hines, a Houston developer, and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s asset-management arm, is slated for completion next year, when Bank of China would complete the transaction.

The deal comes as foreign investors have been pouring into top-quality New York properties, in part out of the belief that the city is a safe long-term bet, and that higher-end buildings will see values grow faster than less-flashy buildings.

Chinese investors sat on the sidelines for years, eyeing deals but rarely pulling the trigger. Recently, though, they have become more aggressive, as the government has encouraged its companies to spread money around the globe and the real-estate market in China has shown signs of weakening.

In all, Chinese investors have spent more than $5 billion on New York City properties since early 2013, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics, up from less than $300 million in 2012.

Chinese buyers also stand out because of the high-profile nature of their acquisitions. Among the recent purchases are the General Motors building, the country's most valuable individual tower, in which Beijing-based developer Zhang Xin and her family bought a 20% stake last year.

Other investments include Greenland Holdings Group's purchase of a 70% stake a 6,000-unit apartment development in Brooklyn by Barclays Center and Anbang Insurance Group's $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria, by far the most ever paid for a hotel.

"Chinese investors appear to have a major preference for . . . more stable markets like New York," real-estate services firm CBRE Group Inc. wrote in a report this fall. The New York region accounted for 78% of Chinese investments in U.S. commercial property between 2007 and 2013, CBRE found.

Now Bank of China is joining the ranks with 7 Bryant, which the developers initially had hoped would lease to top-quality corporations willing to pay some of the city's highest rents.

But earlier this year, the bank approached the Hines team and began a lengthy negotiation to buy the property outright.

The purchase comes as the bank is growing quickly in the U.S., and it would mark a major upgrade from its current New York headquarters, a small, low-slung brick building at 410 Madison Ave.

The bank has adopted a more aggressive overseas strategy since its new chief, Tian Guoli, took over in early 2013, pushing for larger shares in foreign markets for lending and foreign-exchange trading.

For instance, the bank last year provided $4 billion to help finance Chinese firm Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.'s buyout of U.S. pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc.

It has also pushed ahead with a competitive commercial-property lending arm, and its U.S. branch reported holding $5.4 billion in commercial property debt at the end of September. That is more than double the $2.5 billion it reported two years earlier, according to Trepp LLC.

For the developers, the sale marks the culmination of a risky bet on the Manhattan market, as they broke ground in early 2013 hoping to find tenants as they built the tower.

Instead of leasing the building, the developers were attracted to the Bank of China's offering price.

While the nearly $1,300 a square foot being paid is shy of the more than $1,700 a square foot fetched by a handful of Midtown towers recently, that doesn't include the cost of building out the office space for tenants, which could add $150 to $200 a square foot, people familiar with the deal said.

In addition, the deal, which is technically a long-term leasehold, doesn't include the land under the tower. The land is owned by Pacolet Milliken Enterprises Inc., a limited partner in the tower.

Red Flags Emerge in Technology Valuations

These days in Silicon Valley, venture capitalists appear to be valuing companies in only one direction: up. Two companies may soon break that pattern when they go public, a warning sign for investors in sizzling startups.

App-analytics firm New Relic Inc. and data-crunching software company Hortonworks Inc. last weekproposed to sell shares to the public at a 25% to 50% discount to the roughly $1 billion valuations that some venture-capital firms and big mutual funds paid earlier this year.

Bankers for Hortonworks and New Relic could be proposing conservative initial public prices to entice investors. The target prices for IPO shares often are revised higher as bankers get a better sense of demand.

Still, if the IPOs do value New Relic and Hortonworks well below their private-market valuations, it could fan worries that such valuations have gotten out of whack with public markets.

Beyond Uber Technologies Inc. and its near-record $41 billion valuation, other tech startups such as software provider Dropbox Inc. and data-mining startup Palantir Inc. have also attracted multibillion price tags in a relatively short period. Venture-capital firms, hedge funds and mutual funds have plowed billions of dollars into those companies on the expectations they will continue to soar in value.

There are now at least 48 private U.S. companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture-capital firms, versus 27 at the start of the year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. That is a record number -- during the height of the dot-com boom in 2000, there were 10 such companies.

Until last week, both New Relic and Hortonworks were on that list. But now those companies and their bankers need to reflect lower public-market valuations in their shares.

So far in 2014, at least 30 companies have gone public in the U.S. with lower prices than they were worth in private stock sales or option grants in the prior 90 days, according to Valuation Advisors LLC, which conducts valuations for private companies. That compares with 10 such companies last year.

"When it comes to riskier assets, as the economy improves, [investors are] willing to take on more risks," said Valuation Advisors President Brian Pearson. "To the extent people view tech companies as higher risk, higher reward-type companies, that's what's driving private valuations."

Some investors and bankers say valuations of tech startups continued inflating this spring even as the stock prices of some fast-growing and richly valued public tech companies took a dive.

The market correction battered valuations for public companies in similar sectors as Hortonworks and New Relic, which means the IPO prices are now being set in line with those lower valuations, according to people familiar with the matter

"Any disconnect between private and public market valuations is ephemeral, and corrects very quickly," said David Weild, chairman and CEO of investment bank IssuWorks Inc. and a former vice chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The potentially depressed valuations for Hortonworks and New Relic could be specific to their financial makeup.

Both companies employ large sales forces that have contributed to swelling losses, while their annual revenue is under the $100 million threshold that bankers have typically set as IPO-ready.

Hortonworks had just $33.4 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30. That doubled last year's mark but wasn't enough to outweigh expenses, which led to a nearly doubling of its loss to $86.7 million.

The company announced in March that it had raised $100 million at a valuation over $1 billion, just one day after another business software company with a high-cost business model, Box Inc., publicly filed for its IPO. The company decided to delay its IPO as market conditions deteriorated.

An index of public cloud-computing stocks -- which includes companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. and Workday Inc. and is tracked by Bessemer Venture Partners -- fell more than 5% from a peak in February to mid-November.

The median enterprise value of the 38 companies in this index fell to 4.9 times next year's expected revenue from 6.4 times over that time period, according to Bessemer.

Hortonworks' funding round in March and July valued the shares at $12.19 each, putting the company's valuation above $1 billion.

Hortonworks recently conducted a 1-for-2 reverse stock split that effectively raised the share price to $24.37. Bankers then set the proposed IPO price range at $12 to $14 a share, which cut its valuation nearly in half to about $540 million, excluding stock grants.

New Relic said investors bought company stock in an April private investment round at about $27.97 a share, or a valuation of more than $1.1 billion. Currently the company proposes to sell its IPO shares at $18 to $20 each, valuing the company at as high as $740 million excluding stock awards.

New Relic and Hortonworks had two of the same lead investors in their most recent private investment rounds: funds managed by BlackRock and Passport Capital. Mutual fund giants T. Rowe Price and Wellington Management also invested in New Relic's private stock sale announced in April.

Representatives for Passport Capital, T. Rowe Price and Wellington declined to comment. BlackRock didn't respond to requests for comment.

San Francisco based Passport has some protection from any gap between Hortonworks' IPO shares price and what the firm paid for Hortonworks stock earlier this year.

ECB Signals New Action, But Not Yet

FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank opened the door to a dramatic escalation in its campaign to stimulate the eurozone's stagnant economy early next year, signaling a new chapter in the bank's fight against excessively weak inflation in the heart of Europe.

ECB President Mario Draghi said after the bank's monthly meeting on Thursday that officials discussed purchases of government bonds -- known as quantitative easing, or QE -- but that they needed more time to gauge the effects of policies that they had already implemented while assessing how falling oil prices might affect the bank's consumer-price outlook.

"We discussed the possibility of doing QE" with buying government bonds "as one option," Mr. Draghi said after the ECB left its key interest rates unchanged at record lows. The ECB will reassess its policies early next year and decide whether it needs to do more, Mr. Draghi said, raising expectations that the ECB could act as soon as its next policy meeting on Jan. 22, although he didn't commit to a time frame.

"Early means early. It doesn't mean at the next meeting," Mr. Draghi said.

Financial markets reacted negatively despite Mr. Draghi's comments, as investors had hoped for a more ironclad commitment to begin large-scale bond purchases, a policy that has been used extensively by central banks in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. European stocks fell Thursday and the euro rose on Mr. Draghi's comments.

"They're almost there but not quite over the line," said Ken Wattret, economist at BNP Paribas. "The pieces of the jigsaw are falling into place," he said.

The ECB opted against immediate action despite an annual inflation rate of 0.3% in the eurozone in November, far below the central bank's target of just under 2%. Some analysts say inflation could fall to zero this month given the slide in oil prices. The ECB lowered its 2015 forecast for consumer-price growth to 0.7% from 1.1% and in 2016 from 1.4% to 1.3%.

The inflation forecasts didn't fully incorporate the most recent drop in oil prices, which could push inflation even lower.

Despite the negative reaction in financial markets, which may have grown overly optimistic about imminent ECB moves, the prospects of large-scale government bond purchases increasingly appear to be a question of when rather than if.

When interest rates are near zero, as is the case with the ECB and other large central banks, the main lever to stimulate the economy is through purchases of assets with newly created money that increase the size of a central bank's balance sheet and reduce borrowing costs for governments and the private sector.

Quantitative easing also typically weakens the exchange rate, boosting exports and inflation. Mr. Draghi said the policy was shown to be effective in the U.S. and U.K.

His comments underscore the divergent paths of major central banks as their economies recover at different speeds. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are expected to start raising interest rates next year as their economies see faster, jobs-rich recoveries than in the eurozone. In contrast, Japan and the ECB are ramping up their stimulus drives.

Mr. Draghi's remarks contained a number of hints that more central-bank stimulus may be coming to Europe soon. He said the ECB would be "particularly vigilant" about the effect the sharp reduction in oil prices could have on consumer prices and expectations for future inflation, using a phrase that his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, often deployed to signal imminent ECB action.

Mr. Draghi said the bank intended to raise the size of its balance sheet to early 2012 levels, implying a rise of around 1 trillion euros ($1.24 trillion). That was a firmer objective than in November, when the bank said it expected its current policies -- which include cheap, four-year loans to banks and purchases of covered bank bonds and asset-backed securities -- to achieve this rise.

But the small shift in language was met with resistance within the ECB's 24-member governing council. Mr. Draghi said a vast majority approved the change to the balance-sheet language, signaling some opposition.

Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany's central bank, was among the dissenters, a person familiar with the matter said, because he didn't want the ECB to commit prematurely to full-blown quantitative easing. The other German member, executive board member Sabine Lautenschlager, has signaled resistance to buying government bonds. Quantitative easing is deeply unpopular in Germany, Europe's largest economy, where the policy fuels deep-rooted fears of inflation.

Mr. Draghi suggested that the ECB would move even in the face of German opposition if the ECB's inflation target was at risk. "We don't need unanimity" to launch quantitative easing, he said, adding that he was confident a program could be designed to achieve a consensus within the ECB, if needed. The ECB could also purchase other private-sector assets, he said, saying officials have discussed all types of assets except gold.

Still, doubts persist as to whether even more aggressive stimulus measures from the ECB will restore economic vitality to the eurozone, whose $13.2 trillion economy is the world's second largest after the U.S. Yields on European government and corporate bonds are already very low, suggesting further declines will have little traction on the economy unless they are matched by fiscal stimulus and reform measures to raise the growth potential of struggling European economies.

Quantitative easing "is necessary to keep the economy out of recession and avoid another round of financial turmoil," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics. "But I don't think it is sufficient" without economic reforms in France and Italy."

Web-based lender OnDeck Capital boosted the amount it intends to raise in its initial public offering to $207 million as it set the deal s estimated terms.

The fast-growing, but unprofitable, company said it expects to offer 10 million shares at $16 to $18 a share and will give underwriters the right to purchase up to an additional 1.5 million shares.

The small-business lender filed for an IPO last month, amid strong investor interest in nonbank lending companies. The company had "http://online.wsj.com/articles/nonbank-lender-ondeck-capital-files-for-ipo-1415655224?KEYWORDS=ondeck".

OnDeck uses proprietary software and  big data  to evaluate credit risk, while it collects from borrowers with electronic-payment technology. Backers include Google Ventures and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.

OnDeck has been growing quickly, but is still losing money. For the six months ended June 30, OnDeck Capital s revenue rose $20 million to $64.5 million, but its loss widened to $14.4 million from $13.7 million.

The Wall Street Journal reported in August that OnDeck s planned IPO "http://online.wsj.com/articles/small-business-lender-ondeck-prepares-to-file-for-ipo-1408040903". Underwriters for OnDeck s planned IPO include Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch.

The company plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ONDK.

State of UK economy returns to spotlight; ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

In a busy week highlights include the Autumn Statement by the UK finance minister on Wednesday as well as rate announcements by the Bank of England and European Central Bank on Thursday.

But release of manufacturing purchasing managers' indices for the eurozone, UK and China and the ISM manufacturing survey for the US are today.

Chinese and eurozone PMIs are both final estimates. The flash estimate of the HSBC China PMI came in at 50, where anything above 50 indicates growth, and the eurozone survey registered 50.4. The expectation is that the final estimate will confirm both.

The UK manufacturing PMI is expected to fall slightly from 53.2 in November to 53 in October. The ISM survey for the US is likely to show a similar pattern, dropping from 59 last month to 57.8 this month. Manufacturing is expected to expand in both countries but at a slightly lower pace.

The Autumn Statement will be the next big economic event of the week. George Osborne, the chancellor, has little good news to deliver - income tax revenues have been weak thanks to anaemic wage growth and so reductions in the deficit have been disappointing.

Mr Osborne is likely to announce upward revisions to borrowing and gilt issuance although there may be some pre-election spending announcements or tax cuts.

The other major release is the second estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product for the eurozone. The breakdown of GDP into its components is likely to reveal that consumer spending was the main driver of better than expected growth. Services PMIs for the UK and eurozone will also be out the same day.

The market's attention will turn to central banks on Thursday. The ECB is likely to be the more interesting with speculation about the possibility of the bank undertaking quantitative easing to stymie the possibility of deflation.

New ECB forecasts, whose release will accompany the meeting, are expected to show a lower one for inflation in 2014 and downward revisions to both growth and inflation for 2015.

The last big data release of the week will be US non-farm payrolls . The series has been increasing at a steady rate during the past few months, averaging 229,000.

Banks step up staff monitoring in hunt for rogue traders; Dealing scandals: Software

Bankers beware - big data are watching you. Trading scandals have spurred big banks to turn to new technology and data sources as they attempt to crackdown on possible illegal behaviour by their staff.

Financial institutions are increasingly moving beyond employing traditional compliance systems, which have focused on monitoring electronic communications and transaction prices, and using state of the art surveillance software as they seek to stay one step ahead of wily bankers and traders.

The drive to incorporate behavioural science and new data sources comes after analysis of electronic messages has helped regulators ensnare bankers accused of rigging interbank lending rates and foreign exchange rates . That behaviour has led to multibillion-dollar fines and settlements.

The worry for banks is that employees will go underground to engage in illicit behaviour, prompting an internal race as compliance officers seek to root out malfeasance by "front office" staff.

"The days of traders saying something really dumb, which then gets picked up by a filter are largely gone," says Michael O'Brien, global head of Smarts Broker, the Nasdaq's market surveillance business.

Banks have long feared that staff might turn to personal cell phones or social media platforms such as Snapchat or Facebook, to avoid having their work communications monitored by compliance systems.

To combat that risk, some compliance departments are benchmarking staff's performance against average use of internal communications - trying to detect discrepancies between their profitability and the number of messages sent to clients.

Varun Mehta, vice-president of legal and compliance solutions at Clutch Group, says: "If an average trader's been hitting the same benchmark or better than peers on their desk but the volume of messages they're sending on internal messages is significantly less, that's a red flag. Are they using a burner phone or something else?"

To combat the use of personal phones, banks are restricting mobile phone usage on trading floors to certain frequencies that can be monitored. Key card data and human resources information may be examined to ensure bankers and traders are not taking too many "smoke breaks", says Brandon Daniels, president of Clutch.

The increasingly high-tech surveillance of bankers and traders has raised legal issues with financial institutions, particularly in Europe where banks may struggle to reconcile heavy compliance requirements with local privacy laws.

"This is the zeitgeist," says Mr Daniels. "Everyone will be monitored."

Communications analysis - alongside transaction analysis, still the predominant form of compliance monitoring - is becoming more sophisticated too, with algorithms and artificial intelligence being used to identify patterns of speech and networks of contacts as opposed to merely catching keywords.

Bill Nosal, head of product development at Smarts, says traders were unlikely to use obvious statements such as "it's 'time to set up our insider trading ring or manipulate a market.' That's why it's sometimes better to do the linkages of communications and tie them to abnormal trading."

The key, according to analysts, is to bring senior traders or former bankers into the compliance function to help identify strategies or unusual patterns that can be worked into the system.

One lawyer at a large US bank, says: "A lot of times what someone says doesn't mean anything. It won't mean anything unless you look at trading.

"The holy grail is marrying up the communication surveillance with trading surveillance. If someone is really determined to do something illegal it makes it that much more difficult to detect."

Fonetic, a Spanish software company that analyses audio and written communications, launched in the US this year. Its software - utilised by BBVA and Santander - uses real-time phrase recognition technology, as opposed to analysing transcripts, and is capable of flagging related words and phrases to broaden its search capabilities.

For instance, if a bank is trying to identify traders talking about bananas, it could use the software to search not only "banana" but also "yellow," "long", "fruit," and "monkey".

The message to fraudulent traders is clear; banks are shining an increasingly bright spotlight on their business.

World News: Signals of a Slump Weigh on Economies --- In Europe, Rising Unemployment, Concern About Deflation; Spending Is Muted in U.S. as India's Growth Falters

Economic prospects are flagging across Europe, Japan and big emerging markets such as India, a turn that presents fresh challenges to the relatively robust U.S. economy just as the world needs a dependable growth engine.

Multiple strands in recent days pointed to slackening economic vitality across the globe.

In Europe, consumer prices rose in November at their slowest annual pace in five years, deepening fears the continent may be tipping toward deflation. In Japan, the core consumer-price index in October rose at its slowest pace this year.

In both places the fall in energy prices has clouded a concerted push by central banks to boost the inflation rate and stoke consumer and business confidence.

The picture in emerging markets isn't much brighter.

Economic growth in India decelerated in the third quarter, according to government data released Friday. Figures in Brazil showed Latin America's biggest economy had edged out of recession in the third quarter, helped by government spending. But economists warned of potentially prolonged stagnation.

The low-growth outlook is raising questions over whether weak demand could wash onto U.S. shores in the coming months, even as American businesses and consumers benefit from falling gasoline prices heading into the holiday shopping season. America's economy has grown steadily this year after a first-quarter contraction, and employers have added more than 200,000 jobs a month for nine straight months through October.

But consumer spending and business investment in the U.S. was muted in October, suggesting the U.S. might provide insufficient demand to help buoy other economies.

Cheaper energy stands to boost both the U.S. economy and those of other oil importers, including China, by offering what amounts to a tax cut to businesses and consumers.

But in Europe, "problems go well beyond oil," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, an economic forecasting firm in Holland, Pa. "But the better off the U.S. is, the better off Europe is going to be. So would we rather see oil at $70 a barrel instead of $100? The answer is absolutely yes, and so would Europe."

Economists at Oxford Economics estimated in a report Friday that oil prices at around $60 a barrel over the next two years would offer "a significant strengthening" of economic growth "for most of the major advanced and emerging economies."

Growth could rise by 0.4 percentage point in China and the U.S. above current expectations, they said. Lower energy costs could also raise growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point in Europe and Japan.

At the same time, falling inflation expectations were likely to strengthen the existing bias by central banks to ease money supplies, said economists at Barclays, providing added fuel to economies alongside lower energy prices.

The U.S. economy is better insulated from a downturn in global growth because, among the world's major economies, it is less reliant on overseas export demand. Exports account for only about 14% of U.S. gross domestic product, the lowest for any developed nation-and well below the 51% for Germany or 26% for China, according to the World Bank.

Other reports Friday confirmed a grim outlook for much of the eurozone's $13.2 trillion economy, the world's second largest after the U.S.

Unemployment across the region rose by 60,000 in October, keeping the unemployment rate at 11.5%, according to the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat. Consumer spending fell in France and Spain. Retail sales also fell in Italy, where the jobless rate stood at 13.2%, the highest since 1977.

The benefits for Europe's economy of cheaper oil are also diluted by the euro's recent weakness against the dollar, which means Europeans have to pay a little more for dollar-denominated energy imports. The falling oil price this year has partly been a reflection of the fact that demand for energy in Europe, -one of the world's biggest energy consumers, -has been weak, along with overall economic demand in Europe.

The eurozone "needs every bit of help it can get," said Howard Archer, chief European economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight in London. "But it will need a lot more than an oil-price fall to help economic activity pick up in the eurozone," he said.

Most analysts expect ultralow inflation to prompt the European Central Bank to purchase large amounts of government bonds in early 2015 to raise the money supply and further depress borrowing costs -- a route taken by central banks in the U.S., U.K. and Japan. Commerzbank economists said Friday they expect eurozone inflation to hit zero by January.

"We will do what we must to raise inflation and inflation expectations as fast as possible," ECB President Mario Draghi said in November.

Inflation in Japan is also moving further away from the Bank of Japan's 2% target, a vital element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to defeat deflation, which is raising some economists' expectations that the central bank will again expand its monetary easing program.

Cheaper energy prices usually offer relief for an economy-such as Japan's-that has slipped into recession and is struggling with weak consumer spending. But Japan's central bank is focused on stoking inflation, and changing the public's "deflationary mind-set."

The Japanese economy showed signs of life in October, after contracting during the previous two quarters, a common definition of recession. Industrial output improved modestly, surprising economists by rising 0.2% in October from a month earlier, adjusted for seasonal variations, according to data released Friday.

The labor market also offered some good news for Mr. Abe, who called a general election scheduled for Dec. 14. The unemployment rate in October fell to 3.5%, down from 3.6% in September.

In India, gross domestic product grew 5.3% from a year earlier during the three months ended September, a retreat from the 5.7% annual growth posted in the prior quarter and a departure from its recent past of headier growth.

Starting in 2003, India's economy grew 8% a year on average for nearly a decade, lifting millions out of poverty and creating a generation of young people with middle-class aspirations. The abrupt end of those halcyon years stirred voters' perceptions that India's previous government was inept and corrupt, helping to vault Prime Minister Narendra Modi into office this spring.

Half a year later, hopes for a turnaround in Asia's third-largest economy are running high. But a series of largely incremental steps by Mr. Modi has yet to cause the Indian economy to get humming again.

The second quarter's jump was an aberration, said Glenn Levine, senior economist at Moody'sAnalytics. Exports and fixed investment, both growing from a low base a year earlier, had propelled an earlier uptick. "Neither of those looks sustainable," Mr. Levine said.

Brazilian economy, meanwhile, expanded 0.1% in the third quarter, according to official figures released Friday. That ended the technical recession that Brazil suffered in the first half of the year. But the figure fell short of the 0.25% median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Compared with the third quarter of 2013, when the economy shrank by 0.2%.

"The economy at least escaped the recession, but the stagnation is very deep," said Newton Rosa, chief economist at Sao Paulo-based asset management firm SulAmerica Investimentos. "We are in a low-growth trap."

Brazil's economy was hampered in the third quarter by consumer spending, which declined 0.3% from the previous three months. That was the biggest drop since late 2008, when Brazil was suffering the effects of the global financial crisis.

Unlike 2008, though, economists say the problems facing Brazilian consumers now are mostly homegrown. Families that borrowed to help finance a recent consumption boom are now struggling to pay down their debt in an environment of high rates of inflation and interest rates.

Santander, Telefnica and MasterCard to become major shareholders

Monitise has struck deals that will see Santander, Telefnica and MasterCard become major shareholders in the British mobile money group, just weeks after long-time backer Visa revealed plans to sell its stake in the company.

Yesterday, the banking, telecoms and credit card groups said they would invest 49.2m in Monitise between them, representing 8.2 per cent of the company's existing share capital.

Santander will buy shares worth 5.5 per cent of the existing share capital, Telefnica 2.2 per cent and MasterCard 0.5 per cent. The investment amounts to buying 161m new shares at Wednesday's closing price of 30.5p per share. This group of "strategic partners" has also joined discussions to "expand its commercial relationships" with Monitise.

The agreements will provide a welcome respite for the British technology start-up, which has seen its share price lose more than half of its value since January. In this time, it has been hit by two profit warnings , global nervousness over tech stocks and problems over a shift in business model. Last month, Visa, it's fourth-largest shareholder and long-time investor, said it had hired JPMorgan to advise on the potential sale of its 5.5 per cent stake in the company.

Alastair Lukies , Monitise's founder and co-chief executive and a former rugby star, said his strategy was to switch focus from a large number of small deals to pursuing bigger alliances to build a global platform. "This shows that we're here to stay," he said. "If you look at some of the commentary and shorting arguments, people have suggested we're a busted flush . . . [but following the latest deals] there can be no question that we need to raise more capital. We're debt free and have plenty of cash. 2015 should be, from a share price perspective, a really positive year as we continue to execute."

Peter Roe, research director at TechMarketView, the analyst group, cautioned the company must continue to seek more deals to maintain its goal to be profitable by 2016. "We want to see that Monitise is building momentum, with a drumbeat of good announcements and a building of confidence that shows the company is building scale and really seizing the opportunity," he said.

In August, Monitise announced a deal with IBM that opens access to Big Blue's corporate client base. That agreement also included the transfer of about 200 workers to the US tech conglomerate. Yesterday, IBM also agreed to expand this relationship by using its artificial intelligence engine Watson to support Monitise's mobile money technology.

Monitise, which listed on London's Alternative Investment Market in 2007, has 30m registered users, via customers such as HSBC and RBS. It builds banking and payment apps, as well as software that lets financial institutions talk to one another to facilitate mobile transactions. It likens itself to a next-generation Link, the organisation that co-ordinates ATMs in the UK.

The company has undergone a transformation in recent months. It has taken steps to shift from a licence business model, which required its customers to pay a large upfront fee, to a subscription-based model.

Monitise has also made changes to its board, as well as recruiting two Visa executives: Elizabeth Buse , who joined as co-chief executive in June, and Mike Dreyer , Visa's global head of technology, who was appointed president for the Americas this month.

 Big data  deal pushes WANdisco shares up by 13%

Shares in WANdisco, the UK-based cloud computing company, were trading up more than 13 per cent on Wednesday after securing a contract to provide "big data" services to one of the top 10 US banks.

Capital One is going to be rolling out WANdisco's technology in order to analyse transaction trends in real time, according to people close to the deal.

The contract win comes less than two months after WANdisco said pre-tax losses more than doubled in the first half of the year after struggling to sell its big data technology to risk-averse corporate clients.

Shares in the Sheffield-based provider are down more than 70 per cent from their highs at the start of the year. They were trading up 13.17 per cent at 371.75p in early afternoon trading in London.

WANdisco's technology makes it possible to ask complex queries of this data and get answers very quickly, rather than doing more traditional, slower analysts. It has invested heavily in technology that harnesses the power of multiple computers in the cloud to let data to be stored and updated almost instantly from many locations, as well as crunched with clever algorithms.

The deal with Capital One marks the company's first foray into the financial services sector. It said the deal will bring in $250,000 a year, covering 30m bank customers and billions of transactions across credit cards, ATMs and mobile phones.

However, the company still makes most of its money from storage and collaboration services, but has struggled to sell its more exciting analytics product to clients, despite conducting pilot trials with customers including British Gas and University of California Irvine.

David Richards, chief executive, said the Capital One contract represented a new phase of moving from trials to full-blown implementations, adding the coming months were likely to bring in several more.

The market for "big data" and analytics was worth about $14.4bn in 2013, according to research group Gartner and is expected to grow as companies try to get a competitive edge by using digital technology to better understand their customers, businesses and markets.

Hortonworks, a major supplier of the open-source database technology known as "Hadoop", recently filed for an initial public offering at an expected valuation of more than $1bn. It has a partnership with WANdisco that lets the UK company cross-sell products.

More than three quarters of chief information officers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa said they were shifting their focus to predictive analytics and actively experimenting with their own data, according to a recent survey by research group Gartner.

Aside from the risk aversion of industries such as financial services, one of the problems is that executives are unsure what to do with the masses of information they are collecting, analysts say. Companies such as Fusionex, another Aim-quoted stock, are looking to address this issue by creating intuitive products for visualising data.

Going Private Is Paying Off for Dell

By Michael Dell 
860 words
25 November 2014

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

My partners at Silver Lake Management and I successfully took Dell private a year ago in the largest corporate privatization in history. I'd say we got it right. Privatization has unleashed the passion of our team members who have the freedom to focus first on innovating for customers in a way that was not always possible when striving to meet the quarterly demands of Wall Street.

To be clear, public markets can and do play an integral role. In Dell's formative years, public markets provided capital enabling us to grow and thrive, as is the case for many companies. The problem is when customer and shareholder interests diverge. At Dell, we faced a confluence of factors in making the decision to end a 25-year run as a publicly traded company. These factors included the big opportunities ahead, the required pace of innovation and investment, and an affliction of short-term thinking that drove a wedge between our customer and investor priorities.

I have had the privilege of a front-row seat during an extraordinary era of technological advances. It is no coincidence that from 1985 to 2005, while the personal computer and industry-standard server proliferated as the universal model for accessible computing power, world poverty was cut in half. When I look at innovation today, I know we have barely scratched the surface of that potential. The forces of cloud computing, big data and mobility are transforming millions of lives and businesses world-wide.

The technology revolution is gradually reinventing economies and society itself. To keep innovation coming, though, requires companies take big risks. It also requires vision and commitment. The single most important thing a company can do is invest and innovate to help customers succeed. Theoretically, this should also be good for shareholders. You do what's best for customers, you grow and generate returns, and a stable base of long-term shareholders benefits from success.

Apparently, I'm not alone in this view. In a recently reported survey of more than 1,000 board members by McKinsey & Co. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, 86% declared that using a longer time horizon to make business decisions would positively affect corporate performance in a number of ways, including strengthening financial returns and increasing innovation.

Yet we find ourselves in a world increasingly afflicted with myopia -- governments that can't see beyond the next election, an education system that can't see beyond the next round of standardized tests, and public financial markets that can't see beyond the next trade. This was what Dell faced as a public company. Shareholders increasingly demanded short-term results to drive returns; innovation and investment too often suffered as a result. Shareholder and customer interests decoupled.

Perhaps nowhere is this divergence more obvious than in the case of certain activist investors. What they look for is arbitrage -- a way to wring out shareholder value in the near term. They take a sizable position, demand influence on the board and agitate for a set of actions. To quote Bill George and Jay W. Lorsch from a recent article in the Harvard Business Review, "Because the activists usually cash out their holdings shortly after their demands are accepted or rejected," the "risk is significant that their initiatives can weaken a company's competitive position."

Look at what is happening in technology. Major players like IBM and Hewlett-Packard are selling off and splitting up -- huge disruption at a time when long-term innovation and customer focus have never been more critical. Such moves may boost share values in the short term, but too often at the expense of real innovation.

As a private company, Dell now has the freedom to take a long-term view. No more pulling R&D and growth investments to make in-quarter numbers. No more having a small group of vocal investors hijack the public perception of our strategy while we're fully focused on building for the future. No more trade-offs between what's best for a short-term return and what's best for the long-term success of our customers. For example, in the past year we have made investments of several hundred million dollars in areas with significant time horizons, such as cloud and analytics, that might not have been feasible in today's environment for public companies.

Every company in every industry is facing the same pressures and opportunities to compete in the digital age and the data economy. We need to find ways to get out of the destructive cycle of nearsighted decision-making and focus on a future that is far beyond the next quarter or fiscal year or election. In this fast-paced, uncertain time, one thing is certain: If we aren't the ones inventing the future, someone else will be.

Credit-Scoring Companies Take Aim at Malaysia

By Kathy Chu

U.S. companies are racing to bring credit-scoring models to Malaysia in a move that could widen access to credit at a time when heavy borrowing has made the country one of Asia's most indebted.

Tuesday, San Jose, Calif.-based Fair Isaac Corp., known as FICO, plans to announce that it is partnering with Malaysian credit-reporting agency CTOS Data Systems to roll out a FICO credit score to financial institutions in early 2015.

Credit-reporting companies TransUnion and Experian are also partnering with Malaysian firms to develop credit scores they hope will become a standard to gauge risk in the industry, the companies said.

The development is potentially significant for Malaysia's economy. If it enables lenders to more accurately assess the risk of borrowers paying their bills, it could make them more comfortable about extending credit in the country of 30 million people.

In Malaysia, "many of the lenders themselves are concentrating on prime customers, but with this score, we are able to allow more granularity of risk so borrowers below that may get access to credit," said Dan McConaghy, a managing director in Asia for FICO.

The introduction of the credit score comes at a time when high debt loads have led Malaysia's central bank to take measures such as raising the minimum annual income required to qualify for a credit card. Malaysian households are among the most highly leveraged in Asia, according to Fitch Ratings. Figures from Malaysia's central bank show that household debt reached 86.8% of gross domestic product at the end of 2013, up from 80.5% a year earlier.

Some observers question whether more credit is needed in Malaysia.

"People don't really complain that banks are shutting their doors to potential borrowers," said Eric Koh, a senior lecturer in the University of Malaya's faculty of business and accountancy. "The sense I get is that the people who really need credit and who are in decent shape seem to get what they want."

In the World Bank's June 2014 rankings, Malaysia ranked 23 in ease of getting credit, on par with Hong Kong, based on the legal rights available to borrowers and lenders, as well as the depth of credit information in the country. This compares with a ranking of 2 for the U.S. and of 71 for China. New Zealand ranked first in ease of getting credit.

Still, borrowing is less common in Malaysia than in the industrialized world. Only 11% of people over the age of 15 in Malaysia received a financial loan during a 12-month period, and 12% held a credit card, according to World Bank data from 2011. In the U.S., the figures were 20% and 62%, respectively.

Jeff Price, a managing director in the Asia-Pacific region for Experian, which plans to launch a credit score in Malaysia in the first quarter of 2015, said that if lenders have access to more tools that allow them to "comfortably and reliably grant credit" in Malaysia, they will do so.

Borrowing rates tend to be relatively uniform in Malaysia. That differentiates the market from the U.S., where lenders say that credit scores and sophisticated risk models have allowed them to extend credit to those with spotty payment histories, albeit at higher interest rates. Such offerings have been controversial, however, and critics blame them for contributing to the financial meltdown of 2008.

"Whether you pay your bills on time or not, the interest rate is pretty much the same," said Dawn Lai, general manager for Ram Credit Information, a credit-reporting agency in Malaysia that is partnering with Experian.

Some Malaysian banks already use credit scores they have developed internally to gauge the riskiness of borrowers. But a more uniform industry score could provide a more accurate gauge of risk, allowing financially responsible borrowers to get lower rates on loans, said Ms. Lai. Higher-risk borrowers may be able to access loans, but with lower limits or higher interest rates.

Brahmal Vasudevan, chief executive of Creador, a private-equity firm that has a controlling stake in CTOS Data Systems, said it is already seeing interest from banksabout using the FICO score.

Referring to concern about high debt loads in Malaysia, Mr. Vasudevan said that "our intention is not to create products that will stimulate the market. What we're bringing to the market is more sophisticated tools for scoring and analytics that will allow banks to better manage their risk."

Consumer advocates say a credit score can be a good thing if it gives borrowers more information about their credit risk.

Still, "No matter what, this credit score has to be regulated," said Paul Selva Raj, the chief executive officer of the Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations. "If it's too easy to get credit, people can go bankrupt."

Goldman Sachs leads $15m financing of Siri-style data service for investors

Goldman Sachs has emerged as the largest investor in a financial analytics start-up that enables institutions to mine a wealth of big data, underscoring Wall Street's drive to tap technology.

Goldman led a $15m round of financing in Kensho, an analytics platform that can instantly answer millions of complex financial questions by automating previously human-intensive research. The bank will roll out the platform across its business as well as to some of its big c lients.

Kensho, which has been likened to a Siri-style service for investors, analysts and traders, enables them to ask questions such as, "what happens to US homebuilder stocks if a category three hurricane makes landfall?"

Data scientists estimate that 80 per cent of all data come in unstructured form; being able to quickly analyse this wealth of information is the holy grail for banks seeking to use big data to augment their business.

"Wall Street historically was constrained to playing in the 20 per cent of data that move markets," said Daniel Nadler, Kensho chief executive. "Every Wall Street bank could only look at - with any real speed or automation - financial statistics: P/E ratios, and book value and market cap and similar things."

He said not being able quickly to analyse hard-to-structure events - central bank announcements, geopolitical events, weather phenomena, technology product releases - was "trying to see the world with not only one eye covered, but one eye covered and the other eye half-closed."

Initially called "Warren" in a nod to both the billionaire octogenarian investor Warren Buffett and the IBM supercomputer known as "Watson", the platform has been rebranded to match the company's name, Kensho, partly on Goldman's advice.

While the exact size of Goldman's investment is unknown, it is big enough to make the bank the single largest strategic investor in Kensho, which has previously secured money from Google Ventures, Accel Partners and CNBC.

Increasing online competition in the banking sector is shaking up traditionally staid business models around the world. But for Chinese banks - already struggling to adapt to liberalisation - this shift is turning out to be seismic, as the country's institutions face a wave of competition from internet finance companies that is changing the industry landscape.

Where existing banks have legacy systems and processes, companies emerging from the technology side have the advantages of agility and deep technical talent. Now they are quickly building the financial capabilities to compete head-to-head with traditional financial institutions.

The Chinese government has announced a pilot programme of banks owned entirely by private companies such as Alibaba and Tencent, as it steps up liberalisation of its financial sector. Tencent is one of the participants in Webank, which will focus on lending to small firms and consumers. The official entry into the banking sector of online groups further blurs the boundary between internet companies and financial institutions.

With competition heating up, banks are under greater pressure than ever to increase their online offerings. Chinese consumers hold roughly 60 per cent of their personal financial assets in bank deposits (far above the 12 per cent held by US consumers). But as the internet lowers the minimum threshold for investing while improving financial literacy and convenience, customers are diversifying their portfolios.

In June 2013, Alipay launched Yu'ebao; just a year later, its assets under management had swelled to about Rmb570bn, making it the largest money market fund in China and the fourth-largest in the world. Yu'ebao's success has spurred competitors such as Baidu and Tencent to follow suit with similar offerings.

As consumers move away from bank deposits toward other asset management products, however, they are largely doing so via websites such as Yu'ebao or online discount brokerages that produce lower margins.

Chinese banks, securities firms, and insurance companies have already built online channels for distribution, marketing, and transactions - and Chinese consumers have been quick to shift with them. According to iResearch, almost 80 per cent of banking transactions in China took place online in 2013.

The Securities Association of China found that 98 per cent of customers at securities firms have registered for online accounts. Meanwhile, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China estimates an online transaction is typically one-seventh the cost of a transaction at a branch counter.

But while the move to online channels lowers transaction costs, it requires investment and erodes margins by empowering consumers to compare products, fees and interest rates. China's banks and financial firms will have to counter this effect by using their online channels to become more efficient in sales and marketing and to reach previously unreachable customers.

Beyond the customer-facing side, it is critical also to update back-office and logistics functions to streamline and cut costs. Big data analytics could provide an answer to one of the biggest problems looming over China's banking sector: a rising tide of non-performing loans.

Ecommerce platforms typically own a huge amount of information on both small merchants and consumers, including payment histories, point-of-sale data, stock levels, and social network activity. With the right capabilities, banks can analyse this information to reduce risk and increase lending to the underserved small businesses and retail segments.

In addition to providing banks with credit information, some ecommerce companies - including Alibaba, JD, and Baidu - have established their own micro-lending arms.

China's banks and financial firms will face increasing talent shortages, particularly for highly specialised roles in big data analytics, and some may opt to increase their skills pool through acquisitions or partnerships.

What is clear is that institutions willing to embrace these changes and stay at the forefront of innovation have the potential to capture enormous value.

Research from the McKinsey Global Institute projects that by 2025 Chinese banks could save some Rmb800bn each year by using big data analytics to reduce non-performing loans and another Rmb230bn by moving more of their operations online.

But the potential ripple effects beyond the banking sector are even larger. Better allocation of capital to small and medium-sized enterprises could add 1 to 2 percentage points to China's overall GDP growth from now until 2025, creating up to 11m jobs.

Jonathan Woetzel is a director of the McKinsey Global Institute based in Shanghai, where Jeongmin Seong is a senior fellow.

KPMG laps up McLaren's F1-style analytics ; Support services

McLaren Group is to apply the same predictive analytics and technology for its Formula One team to KPMG's audit and consulting clients.

The motorsport group has signed a 10-year deal with the Big Four professional services company, which is the second-largest auditor to FTSE 100 companies including SABMiller, Diageo and Standard Chartered.

Through the alliance, KPMG will be able to introduce an audit model that is forward looking and predictive, based on multiple sets of data.

It will move away from the current auditing model, which has drawn criticism for being largely retrospective and subjective.

KPMG will also sponsor McLaren's F1 team as part of the deal.

Simon Collins , UK chairman and senior partner at KPMG, said: "The ability to have multi-dimensional changes in predictive modelling is extraordinary. It will eliminate a huge amount of the noise that makes judgment for auditors so difficult around areas such as going concern and goodwill."

At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this weekend, McLaren will generate giga-bits of data from its cars, which are sent back to a control room in Woking, in Surrey, where the data are analysed and used to direct the drivers.

Just as McLaren's F1 data analytics runs scenarios around weather, pit stops and tyre changes, in applying the technology to KPMG's clients it will be able to run scenarios around how changes in a company's cash flow, interest rates or marketing spend will affect its revenue.

Specific scenarios might include how China's crackdown on corporate entertaining and gift-giving is likely to hit the sales of luxury companies, or how sunny weather could affect a beer producer. This information could then feed through to a company's supply chain.

The idea is to make the audit predictive rather than reactive, so that companies can anticipate issues before they become an impairment.

For McLaren, KPMG will bring scale and distribution for its technology and access to its clients. The alliance is the latest step for McLaren in seeking to position itself as a technology company with an F1 team, rather than an F1 team that develops technology.

Ron Dennis , chairman and chief executive of McLaren Group, said: "I want McLaren to be perceived as a tech brand that has a tech demonstrator called a Grand Prix team."

U.S. News: After Bailout, FHA Posts Sluggish Return to Black

By Joe Light

The Federal Housing Administration is projected to be in the black for the first time since 2011. But the FHA's independent annual audit also found the pace of recovery remains slow, potentially complicating the agency's efforts to help strengthen the housing recovery.

The audit, released Monday, found that the FHA's insurance fund had an economic value of $4.8 billion at the end of September, up from negative $1.1 billion last fiscal year. Its capital reserve ratio, which the FHA is supposed to keep above 2%, grew to 0.41%. While an improvement, it was still short of last year's projection.

More important, the report estimated that the FHA won't return to the congressionally mandated 2% threshold until 2016, a year later than last year's estimate. The FHA doesn't issue mortgages but insures lenders against losses. Borrowers can pay for insurance on mortgages with down payments of as little as 3.5%.

Officials with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the FHA, emphasized that the fundamentals of the FHA's portfolio were sound and that the fund was on an upward trajectory. They attributed a large part of the unexpectedly slow growth to the FHA's reverse-mortgage program, whose economic value dropped sharply.

"The improvement in the fund is very welcome," said HUD Secretary Julian Castro. "We're confident that the fundamentals of the fund are strong."

But the weaker-than-expected financial results could make it more difficult for FHA officials to lower insurance premiums, which many groups have argued are too high and are hampering the housing recovery. Lower premiums would reduce the cost of buying a home and widen the number of people who could afford to become homeowners.

The FHA is "clearly on a pathway of growth. The question is that, with the trajectory of growth rates, are they excessively charging their borrowers?" said David Stevens, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association and former head of the FHA.

Current Acting FHA Commissioner Biniam Gebre said he thought that the independent report showed clear improvement in the fund but wouldn't say whether it made it more or less likely for the agency to change premiums.

The FHA last year saw lower serious delinquency rates, contributing to its improving health.

Since July 2008, the upfront cost for a borrower to receive a typical FHA loan has risen 0.25 percentage point to 1.75%, while the required annual premium has been raised five times to 1.35%, according to Moody'sAnalytics.

The higher costs have helped to shore up the FHA's finances, but they've also driven many of the most-credit-worthy borrowers to private lenders, where they can often still make low down payments and pay less for private mortgage insurance. That has given the FHA a smaller book of business than expected.

"The FHA doesn't operate in a vacuum and it's a competitive world out there," said Brian Chappelle, a partner at consulting firm Potomac Partners who used to work at the FHA. In the year ended September, the FHA insured $134 billion in new loans, not including reverse mortgages, far less than the $191 billion that the FHA projected in the last audit.

That problem could get exacerbated next year, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac roll out new programs to allow the companies to guarantee mortgages with down payments of as little as 3%, rather than the current 5% limit for most mortgages. Executives at those companies have already said that they expect those mortgages to carry lower costs than FHA-backed loans for many borrowers.

"If the FHA keeps premiums at these levels, they could be adversely selected. The problem could be quite serious," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics, whose economic projections are used in the actuarial report.

The agency took little part in the housing boom, as lenders were willing to make loans with much easier terms. Lenders tightened their standards beginning in 2007, sending much more of business to the agency, and the FHA has shouldered large losses to mortgages made between then and 2009, when it tightened its own standards and oversight. In part because of those losses, the FHA required a $1.7 billion infusion from the U.S. Treasury in 2013, which was its first bailout in 79 years.

Although Monday's report indicated that the FHA won't need another boost, it also showed that its coffers are further from health than hoped, which will provide support to those who think premiums should stay high.

"If they want to maintain risk levels where they are and protect the taxpayers, then they need to keep their premiums where they are," said Edward Pinto, co-director of the International Center on Housing Risk at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.

Law mandates that the FHA keep reserves of at least 2% of the loans it guarantees, a test that the FHA hasn't passed since 2009. Last year, the agency projected that the ratio would reach 1.2% by this year and more than the required 2% by 2015. Instead, the report showed that it reached 0.41%.

The report should give the agency enough confidence to continue in their attempts to ease mortgage access, said Jim Parrott, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and former housing policy adviser in the Obama White House.

For the past several years, some lenders have eschewed lending to riskier borrowers, even if they could be backed by the FHA, for fear that they later be penalized for making mistakes on loans.

For the past several months, the FHA has been clarifying its guidelines and punishments in an attempt to allay those fears.

Profits prove elusive at Rocket's dozen 'winners'; Ecommerce: Start-ups

The investor prefers to stress favourable figures on margins and merchandise volumes

Rocket Internet, the German ecommerce investor, has released earnings for its 12 most established companies which show that none have made an operating profit in the first six months of the year.

In its first earnings since its initial public offering last month, Rocket, a holding company for a range of ecommerce, online marketplace and financial services start-ups, only provided detailed information for a group of companies it describes as "proven winners".

It said core earnings margins for the 12 companies had improved on average by 12 percentage points, though the comparison was between the first half of 2014 and the full year 2013.

Rocket said gross merchandise volume for the companies had increased on average by 104 per cent from the first half of last year to the first half of 2014.

In a conference call with journalists, Oliver Samwer , co-founder and chief executive, said Rocket was taking a long view of profitability. "We will always favour long-term market leadership over short-term profitability," he said.

Rocket says its approach gives investors a sense of the company's value and potential by disclosing detailed information only on the most established companies in which it holds stakes.

But this also makes comparisons difficult. Results for individual companies are given in a range of currencies including Brazilian reals, Russian roubles and Indian rupees.

The financial data also do not always provide comparisons with the same time period in a previous year. For example, foodpanda, a food delivery company based in Malaysia, compares net revenues for the first half of 2014 with the whole of 2013.

The figures showed widely contrasting performance between companies in Rocket's stable.

At Lazada, a Malaysian online retailer, gross merchandise volume grew by more than 200 per cent from  24.2m in the first six months of 2013 to  73m in the first half of this year. The number of active customers - who had made at least one transaction in the previous 12 months - grew by more than 250 per cent from 400,000 to 1.41m in the same period. The company went from an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation loss of  50.7m in the whole of 2013 to an ebitda loss of  40m in the first half.

But the performance of Home24, an online home furnishings retailer, was more modest. Gross merchandise volume grew by about 43 per cent from  48.5m in the first half of 2013 to  69.1m in the first half of this year, while the number of active customers grew by 38 per cent from 370,000 to 510,000.

Rocket said online travel booking will be an area of focus for the company in future, as its seeks to tap into the growing middle class in emerging markets. The Berlin-based group also said it had signed an agreement with Facebook to adopt the social network's advertising features across its companies. The US group will provide guidance on advertising strategy and train Rocket staff. It will also give access to beta versions of its new advertising features. Rocket declined to disclose how much it spent to sign the agreement.

Foodpanda unveiled a series of acquisition deals with Delivery Hero, a rival Berlin-based food delivery portal, to strengthen the companies' market positions in different countries.

Rocket, founded by brothers Marc, Oliver and Alexander Samwer, raised  1.4bn in proceeds from its listing in Frankfurt in October, less than the  1.6bn it had initially targeted.

The money was intended to fuel expansion, through the launch of new ventures, as well as increasing Rocket's stakes in existing companies.

Shares were priced at  42.50 but dropped 12.9 per cent to  37 at the start of trading, the second-worst start to trading for any IPO raising more than $500m in Europe or the US for five years, according to Dealogic.

Underwriting banks intervened to prop up the share price by reducing the number of shares available for an overallotment option.

Rocket takes an industrialised approach to building start-ups, adopting business models that other companies have pioneered and creating replicas of these businesses in emerging markets. The group has launched seven companies this year and expects to start three more before the end of the year.

"Rocket's value lies not just in launching new businesses in new geographies, [but] in our opinion significant potential for future value creation via other as yet unexplored or identified routes, such as big data, aggregated payment services, or advertising," wrote analysts at Citi in a note.

Rocket shares were 0.6 per cent down at  47.53 in late afternoon trading.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Schroders makes large number of small bets; FUND FOCUS; UK Alpha Plus fund will have an "income tilt", says manager Philip Matthews

The future of one of Schroders' flagship funds will rely on a larger number of smaller active bets, says Philip Matthews, the man now in charge of the Schroder UK Alpha Plus fund.

Mr Matthews joined the group in November last year to take on the fund left behind by Richard Buxton . Mr Buxton had departed earlier in 2013 to join rival Old Mutual Global Investors.

Mr Matthews said that while he was taking more active bets, the size of those bets were smaller than was usually the case before his arrival. He has turned over roughly 60 per cent of the portfolio since he joined.

Mr Buxton often said the Schroder UK Alpha Plus fund was either first or fourth quartile because of his large active bets that paid off handsomely if correct, but damaged returns if wrong.

"The active weight within the portfolio has come down to levels I feel much more comfortable with," said Mr Matthews.

"Historically my portfolios were more diversified and less volatile, which ended up producing very strong total returns."

During his tenure at the Jupiter Growth & Income fund from June 2001 to April last year, Mr Matthews produced a top-quartile return of 105.7 per cent compared with the average return of 69.9 per cent from the IMA UK All Companies sector, according to data from FE Analytics.

He said he is using the same valuation-led approach he employed at Jupiter but that the stocks he was buying now were different because "markets have moved on".

He has also introduced tobacco stocks, and the sector now makes up 6.5 per cent of the portfolio.

"This is a call on the relative defensiveness and relative valuation compared with what is happening elsewhere in the market," Mr Matthews said.

The manager has also taken some exposure away from the "very high weighting" to financial stocks, with life insurance companies "definitely coming down".

"I have been making significant changes, primarily by taking out the domestic cyclicals, such as those in travel and leisure, and domestic banks," he said.

He added: "At the margin I have been putting a bit more into [companies that have] reliable earning streams, such as BT [the UK telecoms group] and AstraZeneca [the pharmaceuticals group]."

Asked if the fund was now focusing on income, Mr Matthews said the fund did not have an explicit target but would have an "income tilt", as this area was where he would be "most likely to find value".

Asia
Evernote Chief Sees Change as Challenge; Maker of Note-Taking App Looks to Adapt Its Product to New Platform

Evernote Corp. Chief Executive Phil Libin is focused on making people more productive during a time of rapid technological change.

His company s note-taking app, used by more than 100 million people globally, allows users to store and sync text and other material across computers and their various gadgets, such as smartphones, tablets and wearable devices.

The Redwood City, Calif.-based company, which launched in 2008 and has about 400 employees, has received several rounds of funding totaling more than $300 million from the likes of venture-capital firms Sequoia Capital and Morgenthaler Ventures.

Some 70% of Evernote s revenue comes from customers who upgrade from its free to its premium service, which costs $45 a year. The company also makes money from an enterprise service, along with physical products like styluses and laptop sleeves. Evernote isn t profitable now, but it aims to be in a few years, according to Mr. Libin.

In an interview during a recent trip to Singapore, the 42-year-old Russian-born, Bronx-raised Mr. Libin discussed the changing digital landscape, innovation in Asia, and his love for foods he once disliked, such as durian and sea cucumber.

Edited excerpts:

WSJ: Where are most of Evernote s users located?

Mr. Libin: Only 25% are in the U.S. and Canada, and more than 30% are here in Asia. China is our biggest market outside the U.S. Asia and South America are seeing growth driven by similar reasons: fast population and economic growth combined with very dense urban environments.

WSJ: Are you bullish on innovation coming from sources outside Silicon Valley?

Mr. Libin: I think it s very unlikely the next multibillion-dollar ideas are going to come out of a place like Palo Alto, which is basically pastoral. Even San Francisco is sort of pastoral compared to Singapore or So Paulo or Jakarta or Seoul or Tokyo. The next giant ideas are going to come from highly dense urban environments and they re going to solve problems that people who live in those environments have.

WSJ: How do you entice people to pay for Evernote?

Mr. Libin: We have a free version which is meant to be really great and full-featured, and the more people use it, the more they fall in love and want to pay for a professional version. We have a direct-only business model. We just make money when people pay us for our product. We don t do anything clever to make money. We don t show ads, we re not a big data company.

WSJ: What kind of challenges do wearable devices, like Apple s planned smartwatch, present for Evernote?

Mr. Libin: This will probably be our fourth watch version of Evernote, but it s the first one where we re making it for hundreds of millions of people. Evernote is a service that you will use in your car, on your refrigerator, on your watch, on your smart glasses, on your phone and on your TV, kind of all at once. That s a really different way of designing things that no one really knows how to do yet. We don t really know how to do it yet but we re trying to figure it out pretty quickly.

WSJ: Does today s pace of technological change make you nervous?

Mr. Libin: It s kind of amazing to be in this industry right now. We re on the verge of cataclysmic change, and it s kind of awesome. Products are going to be pretty different five years from now than they are now. Very few companies survive that kind of major shift. We are hoping to be in the forefront. If we re going to keep our current position in the next generation of products, we really need to work hard at it right now.

WSJ: Any plans for a public offering?

Mr. Libin: I would like to be a public company. We re not ready yet. We don t deserve to be a great public company yet. But I think we will in maybe a couple years, and then we ll take that process.

WSJ: What about an acquisition of Evernote?

Mr. Libin: Acquisition is never the goal. I would not want to sell the company as a way to get money, as a way to get out. But if it was the right fit, we would consider it.

WSJ: What s your management style?

Mr. Libin: My job is to basically get the best people I can to work with us and then as much as possible get out of their way and make sure they have enough coffee. It doesn t feel like I m on top of this pyramid.

WSJ: So you re a pretty laissez-faire manager?

Mr. Libin: About 10 years ago, I realized for the first time in my life: I m kind of fat. My mental image of myself had always been a skinny, lanky kid with an Afro, because that s what I was like when I was growing up. Then I finally confronted the reality that I need to adjust my self-image. In a similar way I have a self-image now as a really easygoing manager. But more and more I ve been seeing the evidence that actually maybe I m more demanding and not quite as accessible as I think I am. and people are more nervous around me than I think they should be. I feel like I m going through a transitional period as a manager.

WSJ: What do you do to relax?

Mr. Libin: I don t have work-life balance. It s fully integrated. This is my life s work, it s pretty much all I do. Sometimes I cook, I play videogames, I read, I watch a little TV. But these are all things that happen when I m not on. There s nothing that I m pursuing passionately that isn t work.

WSJ: What do you like to cook?

Mr. Libin: I m best at different kinds of soups. Making a soup is similar to running a company. It s the exact opposite of baking, where you measure everything and put it together and you leave it alone. Making a soup, you re tasting the entire time. You just keep making a thousand little adjustments until it tastes great, and then you re done. It s kind of the same running a startup.

WSJ: What are some of your favorite foods?

Mr. Libin: A few years ago I wanted to understand where my brain got off thinking it didn t like something. So I made a list of every single thing I don t like. There s nothing on that list anymore. I ve crossed everything off. One of the most recent things is durian. I love durian now. The odor now is like the same reaction as a really stinky French cheese. Now I start salivating. I didn t like sea cucumber but now it s great. Whenever I go to China I try to get as much as possible.

Rsum

Career: A computer programmer since the age of 15, Mr. Libin founded and ran two companies: identity management firm CoreStreet and software development company Engine 5, both of which were later acquired.

Education: Dropped out of Boston University one class short of earning a degree in computer science.

Outside interests: Reading, playing videogames, cooking.

'Death bond' investors face heavy losses; INVESTING

Warning over poorly performing Centurion funds

UK investors in three so-called "death bond" funds have been told they may lose up to 70 per cent of their original investment and cannot access their money for at least three years.

The three funds run by Cayman Islands-based Centurion Fund Managers have restric-ted withdrawals since 2011.

A letter to investors warns the funds have an effective net asset value (NAV) of zero. The likely outcome, the letter says, is that "investors may receive between 30 to 100 per cent of NAV" when funds are wound down in three to five years.

The vehicles hold traded life policy investments, also called life settlements or "death bonds". Life settlements are the life insurance policies of US pensioners, which can be bought from the pensioners for a lump sum, then traded on a secondary market. The new owners of the policies pay the premiums, but take the payout when the policyholder dies.

The funds were marketed in the aftermath of the financial crisis as a safe income investment whose returns were uncorrelated with those of other asset classes.

But many funds failed to achieve the ambitious returns they aimed for because they underestimated the life expec-tancies of people whose policies they bought. The Financial Services Authority descri-bed the products as "toxic" in 2011 and its successor regulator banned their promotion to retail investors in 2013.

Centurion's Defined Return fund targeted a return of 5 to 9 per cent a year. When redemptions were suspended, Centurion's Argent fund had at least $135.4m of assets under management, while the Life Settlements fund had at least $142.9m, according to partial figures from FE Analytics.

Both of these and the Defined Return vehicle, for which no data are available, are being wound down. The funds have taken out loans to pay the premiums until the policies mature.

At least 116 UK investors hold Centurion funds through self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) using Standard Life's platform technology.

The funds have never been offered to Standard Life's advised platform customers and were available only through special "off-platform" arrangements with advisers, Standard Life said.

The insurer wrote to investors in August, passing on information from Centurion that the funds were to be wound down. Centurion maintained the funds' troubles were caused by the life settlements market seizing up rather than problems with investment strategies, citing the UK regulator's comments as a turning point.

The company blamed third-party distributors marketing the funds in Europe for sales to unsuitable investors.

The funds have never been offered to Standard Life s advised platform customers and were available only through special  off-platform  arrangements with advisers, Standard Life said.

Centurion maintained that the funds  troubles had been caused by the life settlements market seizing up rather than problems with their investment strategies, citing the UK regulator s comments as a turning point.

 It wasn t a problem with the strategy, it was a massive dip in the market for life settlements,  Centurion said.

The company blamed third-party distributors marketing the funds in Europe for any sales to unsuitable investors, and said that these distributors would have been responsible for any commissions paid to financial advisers in the UK.

The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, said that anyone who believed they had been mis-sold life settlements should contact the company that sold them the product, then proceed to the Financial Ombudsman Service, an independent complaints body.

The FOS said:  The good news is that we can look at complaints about [these funds]   so far, however, there have only been a very small number of queries.

 If anyone has a problem we would encourage them to get in touch with us and we ll do what we can to help. 

The Financial Services Compensation Scheme can consider awarding compensation in cases involving unregulated funds, but only if they were sold through a regulated advisory firm that has since gone out of business.

The Centurion funds are among a series of products that have lost UK individuals all or part of their investments. In September the FCA urged investors in the EEA Life Settlements fund, in which redemptions have also been suspended, to consider making a mis-selling complaint to the firm that sold them the product.

Some 180 investors in that fund have formed a campaign group to lobby for better management of the fund and for investors to get as much as possible of their money back.

And the investment firm Keydata   which had sold life settlements products as low-risk   collapsed in 2009 as auditors found that 103m invested by Keydata clients in bonds issued by a Luxembourg company had been  misappropriated . Some 30,000 investors lost money.

The market for life settlements has revived in the past year, but is now focused on highly institutional, often US-based investors such as life insurers, who have the capability to carry out their own assessments of how much these assets are worth.

 Death bond  investors face heavy losses

UK investors in three so-called  death bond  funds have been told they may lose up to 70 per cent of their original investment and cannot access their money for at least three years.

The three funds run by Cayman Islands-based Centurion Fund Managers have all restricted withdrawals since 2011.

A letter to investors warns that the funds have an effective net asset value (NAV) of zero. The most likely outcome, the letter says, is that  investors may receive between 30 to 100 per cent of NAV  when the funds are wound down in three to five years.

The vehicles hold traded life policy investments, also called life settlements or  death bonds .

Life settlements are the life insurance policies of US pensioners, which can be bought from the pensioners for a lump sum, then traded on a secondary market. The new owners of the policies pay the premiums, but take the payout when the policyholder dies.

The funds were marketed in the aftermath of the financial crisis as a safe income investment whose returns were uncorrelated with those of other asset classes.

But many funds failed to generate the ambitious returns they had aimed for because they underestimated the life expectancies of people whose policies they bought. The Financial Services Authority described the products as  toxic  in 2011 and its successor regulator banned their promotion to retail investors in 2013.

Centurion s Defined Return fund targeted a return of 5 to 9 per cent a year. When redemptions were suspended, Centurion s Argent fund had at least $135.4m of assets under management, while the Life Settlements fund had at least $142.9m, according to partial figures from FE Analytics.

Both of these and the Defined Return vehicle, for which no data are available, are now being wound down. The funds have taken out loans to pay the premiums until the policies mature.

At least 116 UK investors hold Centurion funds, which also include other  alternative  investments, via self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) using Standard Life s platform technology.

Nigeria battles against currency speculators; Oil price fall

Nigeria is fighting to avoid a currency crisis as lower oil prices prompt investors to bet that Africa's largest economy could soon be forced to devalue the naira.

The currency plunged yesterday to an all-time low of 173.95 naira against the US dollar, down nearly 9 per cent since January. The Nigerian central bank has been intervening to support the naira for days, but the $1bn it has spent in the past two weeks failed to halt the slide.

"We believe that the risk of currency devaluation has increased significantly in recent days," Ridle Markus, an analyst at Barclays in Johannesburg, said in a note.

Emad Mostaque, at emerging markets consultants Ecstrat, added that Nigeria could face a "speculative attack on the currency in the next few months similar to that Turkey experienced earlier this year and Russia has just experienced now".

The naira could turn into a political headache for Goodluck Jonathan , the Nigerian president who is seeking a second term in elections next year.

Central bank officials have insisted Nigeria is in control of the currency drop and say that current gross foreign reserves, equal to more than seven months of imports, are high enough to manage the exchange rate. Godwin Emefiele, who is fighting his first crisis since taking over from Lamido Sanusi as the central bank's governor earlier this year, said there was no need for panic. "The central bank has always intervened . . . We believe we're very safe," he told Bloomberg News.

But Nigeria, the largest oil producer in Africa, is particularly exposed to falling hydrocarbon prices . The government, which typically depends on oil and natural gas exports for about 80 per cent of its revenues, is assuming an oil price for its 2015 budget of $78 a barrel, close to current prices of $80.

During the oil price crash of 2008-09, when Brent crude dropped from $150 to $50 in a matter of months, Nigeria de facto devalued its currency. The naira lost 25 per cent of its value from December 2008 to January 2009 before the government fixed the exchange rate at 145.5 and imposed a tight trading band.

Since then, the central bank has allowed the currency to slowly depreciate against the dollar, but the crawl has turned into a flight for safety in recent days. Gareth Brickman, an analyst at Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics, said the central bank's focus on interventions, rather than raising interest rates or an outright devaluation, was "imprudent". Other analysts largely agree. Nigeria is sitting on $37.8bn in foreign reserves, compared with $53bn when the oil price plummeted in 2008.

The currency depreciation has been exacerbated by foreign investors liquidating their positions in the Lagos stock market, which since January has lost 18.4 per cent and it is now the worst-performing market in Africa, coming below Zimbabwe. With oil prices at a four-year low and foreign investors selling both Nigerian equities and bonds, the pressure on the naira could increase again.

Peter Thiel: We Don t Live in a  Technological Age  (Full Video); It s a Financial Age, the Founders Fund Partner Said at the WSJD Live Conference, but Start-Ups Can Make a Difference

Technology may be everywhere, but we re not living in a scientific or technological age, Founders Fund partner Peter Thiel said.

Mr. Thiel was on stage recently at the "http://www.wsj.com/wsjdlive" to talk about venture capital and society s attitude toward technology.

He said Progress that s progress with a capital P is at the core of any scientific or technological vision for the world. But that talk is counter-cultural right now, and so  in many ways we re not actually living in a scientific or technological age. 

 We live in a financial and capitalist age,  Mr. Thiel said.  Most people don t like science, they don t like technology. You can see it in the movies that Hollywood makes. Tech kills people, it s dysfunctional, it s dystopian. 

Not that the PayPal co-founder claims to know how to change society. That used to be government s role the atom bomb was built in three and a half years, and Apollo got someone on the moon--but not so much anymore. Today,  a letter from Einstein would get lost in the White House mailroom,  he said.

Big companies can t do it well either--they are too driven by internal processes. That s why he focuses on startups, where people can be convinced to work on something new and different.  Startups and new-company formation is so important to the technology story in our time,  he said.

The interview also covered Thiel s advice to a CEO on fending off an activist investor, why you should think  fraud  when you hear Big Data or Cloud Computing, and that time he debated Eric Schmidt about whether Google had run out of ideas.

Heard on the Street
Casting Off With OnDeck

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

OnDeck Capital, a nonbank small-business lender that filed for an initial public offering Tuesday, has the markings of a tech-startup darling.

It is growing explosively. It uses proprietary software and "big data" to evaluate credit risk, while it collects from borrowers with electronic-payment technology. Its backers include Google Ventures and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. It promises to "transform" small-business lending.

And it loses money. Fortunately, the latter point is less and less true. In 2013, OnDeck originated $458.9 million of loans and lost $24.3 million on revenue of $65.2 million. In the first nine months of this year, the company made $788.3 million of loans, producing a loss of $14.4 million on revenue of $107.5 million.

And while the growth of lending and revenue has come with higher costs, that fact masks improving operating leverage. Sales and marketing costs in the first nine months of 2014, for example, were up 61.5% from the prior-year period. But revenue grew by 155.5%. So the per-loaned-dollar cost of marketing actually declined.

OnDeck's own borrowing costs are hefty at 6.6% in the first nine months of 2014. Still, that is down significantly from 11.6% in the period a year prior. This is thanks in part to its bundling small-business loans into a securitization vehicle it sold to investors. Moving further toward that funding model could help the company hold borrowing costs down even in a rising-rate environment. And since OnDeck's loans are themselves short term, liquidity risk shouldn't prove significant.

Until the offering prices, investors won't know whether it is worth getting on board with OnDeck. But at least the ship is looking more seaworthy.

China Courts Foreign Investors --- Beijing Approves Stock-Trading Link With Hong Kong in Bid to Bolster Market

By Gregor Stuart Hunter

China will give investors much greater access to its stock market, a big step in Beijing's efforts to lure foreign capital and part of attempts to overhaul its economy.

The program allows global investors to invest in a wide range of companies that had been largely cut off from international money, and many of which are expected to benefit from the shift of China's economy from manufacturing toward consumer spending.

For China, the hope is that foreign investors will bring some order to what is an unruly market, driven by fast-trading small investors, that until this year was one of the world's worst performers.

The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program will allow all investors to buy shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, while also permitting wealthy investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. The move allows investors access to companies with an overall market value of roughly $2 trillion.

"We think it is very significant. We plan to participate," said Gary Greenberg, head of emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management in London, which managed $46.9 billion in assets as of June 30. Stocks that trade in Shanghai are known as A shares, and they have only been accessible to foreigners through a quota system.

China has slowly been liberalizing its capital markets to foreign investors. It has allowed its currency, the yuan, to be traded outside of the country and has pushed for it to be used for trade. Beijing has also allowed Chinese companies to borrow overseas and more easily move cash in and out of the country. In a speech Sunday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country would further open its capital markets as part of its broad overhaul plans.

Investors are generally excited about the new market, but investing in Chinese stocks has been difficult. The market is still 50% below its 2008 peak, and allegations of accounting scandals continue to plague Chinese companies.

Illustrating investors' sensitivity to the issue, a September report by Anonymous Analytics, a so-called hacktivist group, alleging fraud at Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd. led to a monthlong suspension of its shares. Tianhe denies the allegations. Its shares have fallen 36% since trading resumed.

Institutional investors are concerned with a lack of clarity in areas like capital-gains taxes and some controls placed on trading.

Stocks jumped Monday after the program's approval. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose as much as 2.4%, before closing 0.8% higher, while the Shanghai Composite Index rallied 2.3%. Since the program was announced in April, the Hang Seng Index has gained 3.9%.

The Shanghai Composite Index has surged 17.5% in that time, as investors anticipated a flood of cash flowing in, making it one of the world's top-performing major benchmarks this year.

The program has a daily limit of $2.1 billion for investment into Shanghai-listed shares, with an overall cap of $49 billion. The overall amount mainland Chinese investors can invest in Hong Kong stocks is $40.8 billion, capped at $1.7 billion a day. China typically moves slowly on overhauls like these, and investors hope the cap is loosened over time.

The quotas are designed to prevent large capital inflows or outflows, but brokers warn they could create difficulties for large investors seeking to place orders during the initial days of trading.

Investors will find other limitations, too. Buyers or sellers of Chinese stocks will have to place orders before the trading day starts to meet the requirements of Shanghai's exchange, limiting the ability of investors to react quickly to market-moving events like corporate earnings.

Before the new program, handpicked fund managers had been able to invest in Chinese markets through a quota system capped at a total of $105 billion. This quota system will remain.

Many banks expect the program will be soon expanded to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which combined with Shanghai and Hong Kong would form the biggest stock market in the world outside of the U.S.

Currently, the Hong Kong stock market is dominated by shares of mainland companies, but many of those are debt-laden, state-owned enterprises in areas that have been targeted for overhaul as the Chinese government tries to promote growth driven by consumers.

With the trading link, investors will be able to buy shares in a further 568 Chinese companies in sectors like health care, industrial materials and consumer staples. These include auto maker SAIC Motor Corp.; China International Travel Service Corp., which runs the only nationwide duty-free operator; and Kweichow Moutai Co., a state-run company that is the biggest producer of baijiu liquor.

As global leaders descended on Beijing on Monday, the Chinese government confirmed the launch of the plan. Trading is set to begin Nov. 17, allowing global investors to buy shares in Shanghai through brokers in Hong Kong via the city's stock exchange.

Mr. Xi told Hong Kong's leader on Sunday that the link, which had been delayed, would come soon.

Final approval was given by Chinese regulators early Monday, hours before President Barack Obama landed in Beijing for a gathering of Pacific Rim leaders.

Stocks tied to China's economic rebalancing, such as consumer goods, were in limited supply on Hong Kong's market, said Adrian Mowat, chief emerging-market and Asian equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The opening will allow investors to shift to more attractive sectors and away from those that the Chinese government is playing down, he said.

"There are certain sectors which, as an investor, you want to de-emphasize, such as heavy industry," said Mr. Mowat.

The Shanghai Composite has climbed 17% this year, and some investors expect further gains. Shares there have tended to have lower valuations than in Hong Kong, in part because the market has fallen out of favor with investors, many of whom suffered big losses in recent years. Many Chinese have switched to investing in real estate and products offered in the shadow-banking system instead.

From the perspective of mainland investors looking to invest in the Hong Kong market, sectors such as telecommunications -- not listed on the Shanghai market -- were a big draw, Mr. Mowat said.

That has made telecom stocks listed in Hong Kong among the best performers this year, up 29% since Stock Connect was announced.

WSJ.D Technology: A Tech IPO Shows the Future of Databases

If Big Data becomes mainstream for business any time soon, it may be due in part to free software with an unusual name.

The software known as Hadoop took a step toward that future Monday with a filing for an initial public offering by Hortonworks Inc., a company valued at $1.8 billion and founded a little more than three years ago by Yahoo Inc. engineers and backed investors Benchmark, Index Ventures, Teradata Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.

Yahoo is the top outside investor, holding 19.6% of company shares, and it is also a significant customer, according to the filing. Hortonworks' filing laid out its goal to transform the way companies store and process data, a market expected to be worth $32 billion dollars in three years, according to IDC.

Hortonworks declined to comment on its IPO.

Both Hortonworks and its better capitalized, venture-backed rival, Cloudera, are riding the exponentially growing wave of data. Both companies have staked their business on Hadoop, an especially efficient open-source approach to storing and searching through large amounts of information.

Hadoop isn't an acronym, but the name of a toy elephant of the child of the Yahoo engineer who founded Cloudera.

Hortonworks' business model is more dependent than others' on open-source software -- meaning the software itself is free, but the company charges for regular updates and other services. Rival companies maintain some open-source software but sell proprietary add-ons as well as services.

Today, many large U.S. enterprises are producing more data than they can manage and keeping more than they used to discard. Thanks to a large marketing push by Hortonworks and its rivals, Hadoop is catching on as a relatively inexpensive way to house the information for future uses. The technology ultimately could be used for large-scale data mining.

However, many companies lured by that promise have found the technology difficult to use. David Gleason, an executive of Bank of New York Mellon who has tested Hadoop, said in a recent interview the technology wasn't "ready for prime-time."

Hortonworks and Cloudera are trying to overcome that challenge by integrating Hadoop with more familiar technologies, including those from Microsoft Corp. and Teradata, a traditional data warehouse.

The biggest challenge to Hortonworks may be Cloudera's partnership with Intel Corp. In May, Intel invested $740 million in Cloudera, which has raised more than $1 billion at a valuation of about $4.1 billion. Intel is integrating Hadoop into its chip sets. Similar to Intel's previous investments in open-source software vendors VMware Inc. and Red Hat Inc., the bet is that in a few years, this will be a commonplace technology.

Hortonworks' IPO filing shows both the opportunity and the challenges. The company's revenue has more than doubled in the past year, while operating expenses and losses also have roughly doubled.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, revenue was nearly $33.4 million, compared with nearly $16 million for that same period in 2013. But losses were also substantial and growing -- $86.7 million in the first nine months compared with $48.4 million in 2013.

Eric Baldeschwieler, a Hortonworks co-founder who was the company's CTO until he departed last year, acknowledged it was still early days. However, signs in the market were positive, he said. "We've seen companies move from pedestrian use cases at small scale to exciting use cases at a large scale," he said.

Cloudera CEO Tom Reilly said in an interview that his company wasn't yet ready for an IPO, although its revenues and customer numbers were double those of Hortonworks, which said it had just under 300 customers, including partners. Cloudera was also losing money, but at a lower rate, he said.

Global Finance -- MoneyBeat / Market insight from WSJ.com: Brazilian Billionaire Goes From Bananas to Gherkin

The Brazilian billionaire who co-owns iconic banana firm Chiquita Brands International Inc. has acquired the Gherkin, one of the most recognizable office towers in London's skyline.

The Safra Group, controlled by Joseph Safra, Monday announced the purchase of the tower, more formally known as 30 St. Mary Axe. The price wasn't disclosed, but people familiar with the transaction said it went for over GBP 720 million ($1.1 billion).

At that price, the building is likely returning a yield just over 4%, making it a difficult purchase for institutional investors to make work, said Simon Barrowcliff, head of international capital markets for central London at broker CBRE. "But for people who are putting money away for future generations, [that return] makes more sense."

The bidding process was driven by wealthy individuals, rather than the financial institutions that typically feature prominently in London's commercial-property market.

The building -- called the Gherkin for its pickle-like shape -- went for substantially more than the GBP 650 million asking price, showing just how much international demand there is for London real estate. Overseas investors dominated the group of over 300 investors who originally registered interest in buying the Gherkin.

Government funds from Singapore, Kuwait, Norway, Abu Dhabi and China have invested more than a billion pounds each in London property in the past decade, according to numbers from Real Capital Analytics and Property Data. Last month, Norway's state fund spent GBP 582.5 million on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Financial Centre -- a 585,000-square-foot office building in the main financial district -- from Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, which bought it in 2007 for GBP 480 million.

Mr. Safra sits atop a family-run banking empire with diverse assets. Last month Safra, alongside a Brazilian orange-juice maker, bought Chiquita Brands. Safra has long acquired commercial property in the U.S., but this is the group's first deal in London.

In a statement, Safra Group said, "The acquisition of 30 St. Mary Axe is consistent with our real estate strategy of investing in properties that are truly special -- at the best locations within great cities."

China Approves Stock-Trade Link

China will give foreign investors much greater access to stocks next week in one of the biggest liberalizations of its capital markets. The move allows investors entree to companies with an overall market value of roughly $2 trillion, some of them poised to benefit from Beijing's overhauls.

As global leaders descended on Beijing, the Chinese government confirmed the launch of a plan, unveiled seven months ago, to connect Hong Kong's open stock market with Shanghai's largely closed one. Trading is set to begin Nov. 17, allowing global investors to buy shares in Shanghai through brokers in Hong Kong via the city's stock exchange.

"Hong Kong stands at the forefront of the largest capital account opening of a country since WWII," said the U.S.-based broker Jefferies in a note to clients. "The market should take the news positively given some of the recent political issues and fears that the program had stalled."

The program opens up a number of stocks to foreign investment for the first time, many of which are expected to benefit from the rebalancing of China's economy from manufacturing toward consumer spending. These include auto maker SAIC Motor Corp.; China International Travel Service Corp., which runs the only nationwide duty-free operator; and Kweichow Moutai Co., a state-run company that is the biggest producer of baijiu liquor.

Stocks jumped Monday in response to the news. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose as much as 2.4%, before closing 0.8% higher, while the Shanghai Composite Index rallied 2.3%. Since the program was announced in April, the Hang Seng Index has gained 3.9%. The Shanghai Composite Index has surged 17.5% in that time, as investors anticipated a flood of cash flowing in, making it one of the world's top-performing major benchmarks this year.

Underscoring the political importance of the trading link, it has attracted attention at the highest levels of government. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Hong Kong's leader on Sunday that the link, which had been delayed, would come soon. Final approval was given by Chinese regulators early Monday, hours before President Barack Obama landed in Beijing for a gathering of Pacific Rim leaders.

The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program will allow all investors to buy shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, while also permitting wealthy investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong.

To be sure, accounting scandals continue to plague Chinese companies. Illustrating investors' sensitivity to the issue, a September report by Anonymous Analytics, a hacktivist group, alleging fraud at Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd. led to a monthlong suspension of its shares. Tianhe denies the allegations. Its shares have fallen 36% since trading resumed.

The program restricts investment into Shanghai to a daily $2.1 billion limit, with an overall cap of $49 billion, as well as curbing the amount that can flow into Hong Kong The quotas are designed to prevent destabilization of China's capital account, but brokers warn they could create difficulties for large investors seeking to place orders during the initial days of trading.

Investors will find other limitations, too. Buyers or sellers of Chinese stocks will have to place orders before the trading day starts to meet the requirements of Shanghai's exchange, limiting the ability of investors to react quickly to market-moving events like corporate earnings.

Still, institutional investors have been awaiting the launch of the program, though they are concerned with a lack of clarity in areas like capital-gains taxes and some controls placed on trading.

For China, the hope is that foreign investors will bring some order to what is an unruly market, driven by fast-trading small investors, that until this year was one of the world's worst performers.

"We consider the scheme part of the liberalization of China equity market to foreign investors and it's likely to see potential rerating of some undervalued quality big-cap names," said Lilian Leung, fund manager of the JPMorgan China A-Share Opportunities Fund.

For global investors, the plan lets them invest in a wide range of companies that had been largely cut off from international capital. Currently, the Hong Kong stock market is dominated by shares of mainland companies, but many of those are debt-laden, state-owned enterprises in areas that have been targeted for overhaul as the Chinese government tries to promote growth driven by consumers.

With the trading link, they will be able to buy shares in a further 568 Chinese companies in sectors like health care, industrial materials and consumer staples. UBS AG said investors may find "scarcity value" in a number of Chinese shares that aren't dual-listed in Hong Kong or elsewhere and that typically couple high returns on equity with low debt loads.

Stocks tied to China's economic rebalancing, such as consumer goods, were in limited supply on Hong Kong's market, said Adrian Mowat, chief emerging-market and Asian equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The opening would allow investors to shift to more attractive sectors and away from those that the Chinese government is playing down.

"There are certain sectors which, as an investor, you want to de-emphasize, such as heavy industry," he said.

The Shanghai Composite has climbed 17% this year, and some investors expect further gains. Shares there have tended to have lower valuations than in Hong Kong, in part because the market has fallen out of favor with investors, many of whom suffered big losses in recent years. Many Chinese have switched to investing in real estate and products offered in the shadow-banking system instead.

From the perspective of mainland investors looking to invest in the Hong Kong market, sectors such as telecommunications -- not listed on the Shanghai market -- were a big draw, Mr. Mowat said.

That has made telecom stocks listed in Hong Kong among the best performers this year, up 29% since Stock Connect was announced. China Mobile Ltd., the world's biggest mobile operator by subscribers, has soared 31%, while China Telecom Corp. has leapt 38% in that time.

One widely used strategy is betting that gaps between the prices of stocks dual-listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai will narrow as international prices become more closely linked to their mainland equivalents. On Monday, several such discounts for individual stocks vanished as shares in Shanghai gained.

The average spread between Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed stocks has narrowed seven percentage points since the program was announced. Underperformance by Hong Kong stocks following the start of widespread street protests in the city in late September helped Shanghai shares to narrow the gap throughout October.

Many banks expect the program will be soon expanded to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which combined with Shanghai and Hong Kong would form the biggest stock market in the world outside of the U.S.

Charles Li, the chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., said he was confident the link was going to work. "There may be glitches along the way," he said. "When they do arise, we'll fix them."

Bank of New York Mellon has created a technology lab in the heart of Silicon Valley as it seeks to tap into new digital offerings, underscoring the threat the financial services industry is feeling from West Coast technology groups.

Banks have operated innovation centres in the region for years but BNYMellon's move comes as a host of start-ups and groups including Apple are using technology and data to offer services once dominated by financial institutions.

Suresh Kumar , BNYMellon's chief investment officer, said: "We're looking at the disruptions that are taking place in other industries - publishing, transportation, hospitality - and now you see a lot of disruption in the payment space and finance. We can't wait for someone to disrupt us and then react. We need to be in offensive mode here."

Michael Gardner , head of the centre, said the bank wants to tap into the "collaborative" culture that permeates the technology scene. It will hire 20 people by the end of the year and ramp up recruitment in 2015. Employees will be working on technology projects including Digital Pulse, BNYMellon's effort to harness the big data that flow through it.

The innovation centre is in Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto, right in front of the local offices of Tesla Motors, the electric car pioneer led by Elon Musk.

BNYMellon joins other banks including Capital One and Wells Fargo, which have been running their own West Coast labs to either develop their own technology or cultivate investments in tech start-ups. JPMorgan Chase created an incubator during the late 1990s internet boom, but "Lab Morgan" had a mixed record. Cygnifi, an online derivatives service provider, filed for bankruptcy shortly after being spun out of the bank but other early investments, including the trading platform MarketAxess and PayPal, the payment processing company, made significant profits.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Inflation hedge 'problem children' hobble Investec; FUND FOCUS

Alastair Mundy , Investec's contrarian investor, has pledged to retain his positions hedging against inflation despite those bets proving a significant drag on performance.

Mr Mundy's flagship 2.5bn Investec Cautious Managed fund had the worst performance record in the IMA Mixed Investment 20-60% Shares sector over the past year, according to data from FE Analytics.

The recent negative performance also hurt the fund's long-term record, with the fund slipping into the bottom quartile over three and five years. It has, however, beaten its peer group over the past 10 years, according to the data provider.

Long-serving manager Mr Mundy said the fund had underperformed due to positions in four trades, or what he called "problem children", of which three are hedges against rising inflation.

The fund has 6.9 per cent invested in gold , 2.8 per cent in gold-mining shares and 7.9 per cent in Norwegian government bonds. Both gold and the Norwegian currency, the krone, are seen as havens in the event of inflation.

The consensus from economists is that deflation is far more of a threat than inflation in the near future, and the rate of inflation has been declining in the US, UK and Europe.

Falling inflation expectations are likely to have been one of the contributing factors behind the precipitous fall in the price of gold in recent years and a drop in the price of oil has hurt the krone.

The price of gold has fallen by 37 per cent since its peak in September 2011. Gold-mining stocks have had a tough time over the same period, with the FTSE Gold Mines index falling 72.8 per cent.

Mr Mundy said that, apart from banking stocks during the financial crisis, he had not "seen anything as out of favour as gold-mining shares". The manager admitted he had "lost a significant amount of money in gold-mining shares" but said he was holding on to his position in case of inflation.

Mr Mundy had "no idea" when, or from where, an inflation shock would come but said it was prudent to be cautious, given the suddenness and unpredictability of past shocks.

He suggested a rise in interest rates in the UK could have a big impact, because "8 per cent of people in the UK cannot pay their mortgage" even at current levels, so a rise in rates could "bankrupt most of the population".

He also pointed to possible political causes of inflation, suggesting that if Prime Minister David Cameron tried to restrict immigration to appease voters then "very quickly you would run out of labour and get wage inflation".

Gold plunge spells more misery

Gold investors are searching for glimmers of hope after the metal sank to its lowest price in four years, and compounded a year of steep declines for gold equity funds.

Gold dropped to $1,131.85 an ounce on Friday, its lowest finish since April 2010.

A strengthening dollar has done little to help UK-based investors in gold-related equity funds, who have faced losses of between 21 and 37 per cent over the past year. The FTSE Gold Mines index is down 21.2 per cent.

Webb Capital's Smaller Companies Gold fund has been the most dismal performer, shedding 37 per cent over the year to November 6, according to figures from FE Analytics.

BlackRock's 1bn Gold and General fund, a popular vehicle managed by Evy Hambro which buys gold mining, precious metal and commodity-related shares, shed 22 per cent during the 12 months.

The least bad performer was Smith & Williamson's Global Gold and Resources, which fell 21 per cent. But its performance has been worse than that of the gold price, which is down 11.8 per cent over the past year as the Federal Reserve gradually ended its asset purchase programme.

There was fresh hope for gold in worse than expected US payroll figures on Friday, which sent some investors back to so-called "haven" assets, but analysts at Goldman Sachs said the gold price is likely to fall further to $1,050 by the end of 2014. However, BlackRock's analysts said gold may regain ground over the next three years.

"The significant structural change in the industry that is taking place is encouraging," they said, adding that miners have brought in new management teams and improved efficiency, while focusing more on returns for shareholders.

Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics, said he expects the gold price to rally to $1,300 next year, then $1,400 in 2016.

"An extended period of low or negative inflation in the eurozone threatens to restart the financial crisis in the region and hence revive safe-haven demand for gold," said Mr Jessop.

Rise in consumer confidence helps to buoy Experian; General financial

Data provider benefits from greater awareness of need for cyber security

Increasing consumer confidence coupled with the fear of online fraud helped drive up profits at Experian, the FTSE 100 data provider best known for its credit checking and fraud prevention software.

Half-year results yesterday revealed a boost to profits, cash flow and its interim dividend as consumers and companies around the world took out more loans and finance agreements, triggering the need for more credit checks.

This resulted in 22 per cent revenue growth for Experian's US credit services division - its largest business segment - and a 6.5 per cent boost to its shares.

Experian holds credit files on 800m consumers worldwide, but its future growth prospects rest on exploiting this data in new ways - whether through anti-fraud applications to pick up bogus transactions, or using algorithms to predict when consumers are likely to switch credit card providers.

"There are certain types of consumer behaviour that you can derive trends from in the data, and hypothesise upon," said Experian's newly installed chief executive Brian Cassin . Predicting when customers might be thinking of switching a credit card balance is one new service its decision analytics division has been offering to large financial institutions.

"The first time they know about it is when a customer leaves, but we can analyse our data and other data sources to predict when a switch may be made," he said, recognising that this has "wide potential applications" in other areas in future, such as mobile phone contracts.

In the age of cyber crime, Experian's biggest growth opportunity is anti-fraud products both for institutions and consumers.

Its $324m acquisition in this area, fraud prevention service 41st Parameter , has been rolled out globally from the US in the past 12 months, operating in the UK, Brazil and Australia. The software identifies "dirty devices" stopping fraudsters from using stolen login details when accessing multiple bank accounts from the same tablet, computer or smartphone.

Experian's consumer services division - which was the weak spot of its US business as it undergoes a rebranding - provides online tools for consumers to manage their credit score and repair the damage from ID theft.

It has rebranded its US consumer website as Experian.com and struck a partnership with FICO, a popular US credit scorer, to distribute its data through Experian's website in an effort to turn this round.

With cyber fraud estimated to cost US businesses $108bn a year, Mr Cassin said Experian was also benefiting from advising retailers in the aftermath of data breaches where customer data has been compromised - a key growth market with the rise of ecommerce.

Another growth area is healthcare data. Passport, the US healthcare business which is used by hospitals to manage complex healthcare provider payments, saw a 20 per cent revenue boost on a pro forma basis. Experian acquired the business for $850m year ago.

Total revenue growth was up 5 per cent to $2.4bn on a constant currency basis in the six months to September 30, and pre-tax profits rose 11.5 per cent to $534m. Operating cash flow growth in the first half was an impressive 17 per cent, meaning Experian has been able to deleverage more quickly than expected with net debt now reduced to $3.7bn. It declared an interim dividend of 12.25 cents per ordinary share, up 7 per cent on the year before.

Robin Speakman, analyst at Shore Capital, estimated this could be as much as $800m. "Experian's financial efficiency metrics suggest significant surplus capital emerging in the next financial year to March 2016," he said. "We expect this capital to be used potentially in a limited number of new organic investment projects, potentially in some bolt-on acquisition activity, but more materially to restart a share buyback programme, thus potentially boosting future EPS levels."

Experian shares closed 6.3 per cent higher at 999.5p.

Songbird Rejects Qatari Approach for Canary Wharf; Suitors Are Likely to Make Another Offer After $3.45 Billion Bid Was Refused

LONDON Songbird Estates PLC, owner of London business district Canary Wharf, rejected a 2.18 billion ($3.45 billion) joint bid from Qatar s state investment fund, but the move is unlikely to stop the suitors or stem the flow of money from state-backed funds into London real estate.

The advance, rebuffed on Friday, is expected to be a step in a process that could see the Qatari fund scoop up another giant slice of London.The bidders  familiarity with Canary Wharf, and their confidence in its potential, mean  we think it s quite likely that there will be another offer,  said James Carswell, a real-estate analyst at Peel Hunt.

Songbird, which owns 69% of the Canary Wharf estate, rejected the joint offer from Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield Property Partners L.P. At 295 pence a share, the bid  significantly undervalues  the company, said David Pritchard, independent chairman at Songbird, in a statement.

Qatar s fund has bought nearly 4 billion of London property in the last 10 years, the most out of all state-backed investors in the city, according to data from Real Capital Analytics and Property Data. QIA owns the Shard, the U.K. s tallest building; the former Olympic Village site in Stratford, East London; and a former army barracks in Chelsea.

Government funds from Singapore, Kuwait, Norway, Abu Dhabi and China have all invested more than a billion pounds each in London property during the past decade, the RCA/PD data show. In the past three years, the pace of deals has picked-up dramatically. In each of the last four quarters alone, state-backed funds on average bought 1.7 billion of London real estate, the data show. Last month, Norway s state fund spent 582.5 million on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Financial Centre a 585,000-square-foot office building in the main financial district from Singapore s sovereign wealth fund, which bought it in 2007 for 480 million.

London is often the first destination for funds with global ambitions, particularly those from the Middle East and Asia looking to diversify beyond their local markets. London is attractive for a litany of reasons. The economy is growing. The currency is stable. The legal system tends to side with property owners. The market is transparent and liquid.  It s a market overseas investors feel comfortable with,  said Rob Hayes, co-head of central London investment at Colliers International.

This attraction only increases  if you re holding a lot of cash,  Mr. Hayes said. 

Persistently low interest rates in the years since the financial crisis have forced cash-rich global investors to branch out. Real estate has been one of the benefactors. And when looking abroad,  London is very much at the top of the list,  Mr. Hayes said.

Canary Wharf, an area outside the city s traditional financial district, has grown since 1990 from derelict docks into a vast estate of modern office buildings. Citigroup, Barclays and HSBC which occupy three of the most recognizable buildings in the district are advising QIA and Brookfield on the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Qatar Investment Authority already owns a 28.6% stake in Songbird, while Brookfield holds about a 22% stake in Canary Wharf Group, which owns the Canary Wharf development in London.

Takeover rumors, often involving the Qataris in recent years, have swirled around Canary Wharf since the bidding war that gave the company its dual corporate structure. Songbird, originally set up as a buyout vehicle, gained control of Canary Wharf in 2004 after seeing off rival bidder Brascan, a Canadian investor that later became Brookfield Asset Management Inc. Brookfield retained the stake it had built in Canary Wharf Group.

QIA and Brookfield are likely to return with a higher bid, said Hemant Kotak, senior analyst at Green Street Advisors. Green Street estimates Songbird has a net-asset value of 305 pence a share. Analysts have said a bid of 350 pence or more could be required.

Endowments for Area Colleges Surge on Investment Gains

By Mike Vilensky

Tri-state area universities have some good news to trumpet this month: They are rich.

Five years after university endowments plummeted along with the rest of the global economy, many schools in the New York area are sitting on large piles of cash and investments.

At the top of the list is Yale University, which reported an endowment of $23.9 billion in the fiscal year ended June 2014, a bump of about $3.1 billion over the previous year.

The New Haven, Conn., Ivy League school stands among the wealthiest schools in the nation.

Princeton University reported a $21 billion endowment for fiscal 2014, adding about $2.8 billion in the past year.

And New York University, the sprawling Manhattan campus serving some 50,000 students, saw its endowment increase to $3.1 billion from $2.6 billion.

Schools both public and private got an endowment boost this year from robust equity markets, said David Lindberg, managing director of global investment-services firm Wilshire Associates.

Yale's 14.9% increase in the size of its endowment was helped by a 20.2% return on its investments. The investment gain, analysts said, reinforces the benefits of alternative investments such as private equity, real estate, hedge funds and natural resources. The school said it intends to allocate more than 50% of its portfolio to those areas in the coming fiscal year.

Some schools trumpeted the health of their endowments in news releases.

"Columbia's solid financial position has been due to the remarkably consistent success of our endowment investment managers year after year," said Columbia president Lee Bollinger in a statement.

Princeton Provost David Lee wrote: "The strong performance . . . is crucial to our ability to sustain the excellence of our teaching and research mission and to continue providing generous financial aid that makes Princeton's education affordable."

That is a far cry from 2009 when, in the wake of the financial crisis, Columbia's endowment dropped by 21%, Princeton's by 23% and Yale's by 30%. That year, data-analytics firm Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service reported a median return drop of 18% for big endowments across the country.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, Wilshire TUCS reported a median return of 16.7% for the same group.

To be sure, a fat endowment fund doesn't necessarily guarantee that an institution is on sound financial footing, since the degree to which endowment income is reinvested into the nest egg or tapped for operating needs or special projects varies by school.

Many draw on endowment earnings to underwrite capital projects, academic programs, student scholarships and more.

And investment returns don't account for all the endowment gains, since gifts from alumni and others also help boost funds. In September of last year Yale announced that an alumnus donated $250 million to the school.

NYU raised $604 million through fundraising in the most recent fiscal year, a school spokesman said.

Several public-school endowments in the region remained billions of dollars smaller than their private-school peers, even though many public schools serve larger numbers of students. Still, area public universities also reported gains.

Rutgers University, New Jersey's flagship public university, reported an $822.9 million endowment, a gain of $39.9 million over last year, the school said.

And Binghamton University, an upstate campus in the State University of New York network serving about 16,000 students, saw its endowment grow to $103.7 million from $87.2 million through June 2014.

"We're excited about the level of growth," said Larry Morgenthal, Binghamton's investment-committee chairman. But, he said, "The endowment is small at this point relative to the spending needs of the university."

Mr. Morgenthal said endowment funds will be directed toward "a tremendous amount of research," among other initiatives.

As is often the case in academia, many schools are competitive when it comes to endowment strategies, concerned that their peers might try to replicate their success, analysts said.

David Swensen, the chief investment officer at Yale, declined to be interviewed, but Roger Ibbotson, a professor at the Yale School of Management, credited Mr. Swensen with what he called "the Yale model."

Mr. Ibbotson said many schools have emulated the approach, which he described as "basically investing heavily in alternatives, not investing heavily in public markets, and having the skills to select which pools you get into."

Princeton declined to make an administrator available to speak about the school's endowment strategy.

"We do not discuss the specifics of our endowment portfolio," said Michael Caddell, a school spokesman, "in order to maintain a competitive edge in the financial markets."

Wilshire Associate's Mr. Lindberg said school presidents may be feeling flush, but they shouldn't count their chickens yet.

"Performance endowments can be volatile," Mr. Lindberg said. "This one year's great, but that's one year."

INSIGHT
Why innovation really should matter to policy makers - and investors

Innovation has been accelerating since the invention of the steam engine, and the pace is increasing. Consider the telephone. It took 56 years for Alexander Graham Bell's invention to reach half of US households; smartphones took seven years to hit the same adoption rate. Innovation could be defined as the application of invention (think about the 12-year gap between the accidental discovery of penicillin and the first patient treatment with it). Today's low-growth, disinflationary period mirrors the great deflation of 1873-96, a period where innovation was high as entrepreneurs sought to lower costs and widen markets.

Why should investors care about innovation? Technological change is at the intersection of employment, nominal economic growth and inflation risk - the focus areas of global policy makers. Innovation is disinflationary (suppressing wages and prices), but can hurt employment (producing more with fewer people). This helps explain why central banks are prepared to risk falling behind the curve - because they see little inflation risk and focus on increasing employment.

Tech optimists say we are on the cusp of a productivity renaissance. Pessimists counter that the productivity boon from the internet is waning. We are optimists. The next leg of innovation has far to go. Exponential increases in computer power, machine learning and the ability to analyse vast reservoirs of data back this view. Many companies, industries and investors have yet to tap these data riches.

The rapid diffusion of technologies is one reason it is harder for companies to maintain competitive advantages. Just 63 per cent of groups that were in the S&P 500 a decade ago are still in the index today, according to Thomson Reuters. It becomes more important to invest in companies that can weather the disruptive effects of innovation and harvest its benefits. Predicting whether a company will be around in a decade is going to become tougher.

On a macro level, innovation can erode an important competitive advantage of emerging markets: cheap labour. Businesses that are faced with rising wages can automate or move to cheaper locations. Even developed economies can benefit. Some US companies are "reshoring" aspects of their production, lured by cheap energy and proximity to end markets. At the same time, Chinese factory wages have risen fourfold since 2002 and are forecast to continue on that trajectory. Yet the substitute for Chinese labour today is not just workers in Vietnam or Bangladesh; it is robots. China is the second-largest importer of robots and will shortly take pole position.

In a nutshell, if you lose your labour cost advantage, you had better come up with something else. Quality of education will probably be an important determinant of success here. Asian economies such as China and South Korea are well ahead of other emerging regions in this respect - particularly in the important areas such as maths and science. Developed economies in North America and Europe still score well on this metric, but are losing ground.

Innovation is a driver of productivity, which determines sustainable long-term growth. But productivity growth has slowed in the US, China and most of Europe, as ageing populations have reduced the number of hours worked. Rising debt-to-GDP ratios in developed economies are another potential drag on growth, as is any increase in income inequality. Inflation remains a tug of war between two opposing forces: deflation in stuff you want (gadgets); inflation in everything you need (food and housing). The net impact is lower inflation than in recent decades.

Low nominal growth and bond yields mean financing will stay cheap for companies, which is good news for equity holders. B ond markets are in effect subsidising equities by allowing companies to cut debt service costs and extend maturities. At the same time innovation is lowering the capital expenditure needs of companies, enabling them to do more with less. In turn companies have less need to borrow and issue bonds than in the past, and this lower supply, combined with an appetite for income from yield-hungry investors, means the hunt for yield is unlikely to get any easier. In turn this leads to new frontiers for income-seeking investors.

Dealogic has become the latest financial information group to fall into private equity hands, after Carlyle led a $700m acquisition of the US-based researcher.

The buyout house, which will fund the purchase price with $335m of debt, will own more than 50 per cent of the shares in the company, according to statements released yesterday.

As part of the deal, Euromoney Institutional Investor, the London-listed publisher and event organiser, will also acquire a 15.5 per cent stake for $59.2m. Capital IQ co-founder Randal Winn , and Dealogic's management and other founders, will also invest in the deal.

"Dealogic is a globally recognised and trusted brand and its software and data platform is the de facto standard for the investment banking industry," said Cam Dyer , managing director at Carlyle.

Private equity groups have been attracted to financial research companies by their subscription models, which generate the steady income needed to service debt. The larger information providers have also become consolidators in a relatively fragmented market.

Carlyle's acquisition follows the 382m leveraged buyout last year of Dealogic's rival Mergermarket by London-based private equity group BC Partners, after a competitive auction that attracted a bid from Warburg Pincus.

Four years ago, General Atlantic, another New York-based private equity group, paid $250m for a 7.5 per cent stake in Markit, the $4.3bn financial data provider that listed on Nasdaq in June .

Dealogic, headquartered in New York and London, sells data, analytics, market intelligence and capital markets services used by investment bankers around the world. It reported adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation of $66.7m and revenues of $152.3m last year.

The acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2014. Barclays Capital and JPMorgan are advising Carlyle, while Investec is advising Dealogic.

Carlyle Group LP agreed to buy financial data provider Dealogic Ltd. in a transaction valued at roughly $700 million.

The Washington, D.C., firm said Randall Winn, the former chief executive of Capital IQ, and Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, a business and financial magazine publisher, are joining Carlyle on the deal as co-investors. Euromoney said in a separate release it is acquiring 15.5% of Dealogic for $59 million.

Carlyle said the equity for the transaction, expected to be completed by the end of the year, will come from Carlyle Partners VI LP, a $13 billion U.S. buyout fund closed last year.

Dealogic provides analytics, market intelligence and capital markets software to more than 500 clients world-wide. The company has offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, Budapest, Tokyo, Mumbai, Sydney, Beijing and So Paulo.

Carlyle Managing Director Cam Dyer said Carlyle was attracted to Dealogic s software and data platform  that is the de facto industry standard for investment banks and is highly integrated into their mission-critical workflows. 

He added Dealogic has expanded its product offerings over the past several years, including substantial investment in software as a service product.

 These facts, coupled with Dealogic s high recurring revenue base and multiple opportunities for growth via acquisitions, make it a compelling investment opportunity for us,  Mr. Dyer said.

Mr. Dyer said Carlyle and the co-investors backed Dealogic to help the company strengthen its software and data platform.

 Dealogic s platform helps banks address competitive industry pressures by providing market intelligence and workflow solutions, allowing them to run their business in a highly strategic way,  Mr. Dyer said.  And since competitive pressures are increasing, this can drive growth in Dealogic s products. 

Private-equity firms have taken a liking toward financial technology firms lately. Vista Equity Partners in September announced it would take private Tibco Software Inc., a data management and analytics-software maker, for about $4.3 billion.

Blackstone Group LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. s merchant banking division this year acquired a majority stake in Ipreo Holdings LLC, which provides market intelligence, data and technology to participants in global capital markets. The investors bought the stake from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which retained a minority stake in the company.

Dealogic said there were $29.03 billion of technology deals that private-equity firms have sealed so far this year, making technology the most active sector, exceeding the $19.83 billion of deals in real estate and the $18.05 billion in professional services transactions.

Carlyle has invested in the financial-technology sector in the past. It sold in September 2013 the remaining stake in financial software provider SS&C Technologies, a company it invested in 2005. Carlyle previously held Open Link Financial Inc., a software provider for participants in the global commodity, energy, agribusiness, commercial, industrial, and financial markets. It sold the business to private-equity peer Hellman and Friedman in 2011.

For the Dealogic transaction, investment banks Barclays PLC and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and law firm Latham & Watkins (London) LLP are advising Carlyle, which secured debt financing from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank NA, Barclays Capital Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

Investec Ltd. and law firm Linklaters LLP are Dealogic s advisers. Gleacher Shacklock and Herbert Smith Freehills LLP are advising Euromoney.

FT REPORT - EXCHANGES, TRADING & CLEARING
Making waves in Chicago; Start-ups

Last month, the world's largest futures exchange played host to a meeting of tech workers, venture investors and traders. CME Group had not formally organised the event, but it had provided the venue and Rumi Morales, representing the CME's new venture capital fund, was moving about the crowd, writes Neil Munshi .

CME's involvement demonstrates its appreciation of the important role that start-ups are likely to play in the future of the derivatives industry - and the city.

Derivatives trading is going through an important transition, as electronic trading cements its hold on the industry.

Broader technological trends are bringing down the cost of entry for financial technology companies, cloud- and web-based computing are making retail participation easier and new regulations are challenging the advantages of established incumbents.

Among the newcomers are AlgoFast, which aims to take complex algorithmic trading to the masses, and Social Market Analytics, which trawls Twitter for data sophisticated enough to be used by traders.

Then there is TopstepTrader, which allows retail traders to simulate futures trading with the aim of being invited to trade with the company's money.

The city's leading exchanges, CME and CBOE, both acknowledge that innovation may now come more from the start-up world and have started venture capital initiatives.

Mark Fields, managing director of CME's strategic investment group, launched the company's venture fund this year. It plans investments of between $500,000 and $5m to develop a pipeline of companies.

The fund's mandate is global and it has so far made investments in four companies: Wickr, a communications and cyber security firm; 1QBit, a software company; Powerlytics, a data analytics provider; and payments start-up Dwolla. None is Chicago-based, but Mr Shields says CME is looking in its home town. "We regard it as an extension of the 160 years of innovation and leadership in the financial industry that CME has had," he says.

"We [saw] a gap and recognised that technology was changing fast. We continue to innovate, but we wanted to look out three to five years in the future and the place you do that is in the venture community."

John Deters, chief strategy officer at CBOE, says his company's initiative - which invests from early-stage to full maturity - operates according to a similar philosophy.

"No longer are big ideas more likely to come from centralised, process-oriented R&D structures. It's equally if not more likely that big ideas are going to be sourced from a broadly distributed network of creative individuals who are applying their talents to solving a problem," he says. "We are concretely trying to make sure we're part of the conversation."

In March, CBOE invested in New York-based Tradelegs, an analytics platform like many new fintech firms, following an earlier investment in the Chicago-based Intellectual Property Exchange International.

Mr Deters notes that over the past decade, the decline of floor trading sent many people off to launch businesses, and has given Chicago's trading community "an appreciation of individual creativity and what people can do when they're out there with an idea".

Justin Bouchard, who founded AlgoFast in 2011, says the industry is "ripe for disruption". But he says start-ups face big challenges, including high market data prices, legal and compliance issues, and the generally secretive nature of the industry, which runs counter to the open-source ethos of start-up culture.

Joe Gits, founder of Social Market Analytics, says that the barriers can be high, but "the technology to get started isn't nearly as challenging as it was in 1997", when Mr Gits founded Quantitative Analytics, a data software company he later sold to Thomson.

Rick Lane, chief executive of Trading Technologies, agrees. "Building tools for the professional trading community over the web isn't something that has been done a lot to date," he says.

"Cloud technology enables start-ups to compete, where a couple of years ago they might not have been able to because of the costs."

That ability to compete may also give Chicago a chance to retain some of the derivatives industry dominance that it has lost, as trading has migrated to the computer screen, says Mark Longo, a former trader, who left the floor in 2007 to start Options Insider, which provides news and analysis on the industry.

"This has been the mecca for derivatives since they were invented, and now that's going away," he says.

"You can't just walk off the street and start a derivatives-oriented start-up. You really need that deep knowledge . . . No where else is there a community like this, and if you want to keep it, you need to foster it."

U.S. Bonds Pull Back on Data, Elections; Jobs Report, Midterm Results Encourage Investors to Buy Riskier Assets

Treasury bonds pulled back Wednesday as an upbeat U.S. employment report and the outcome of U.S. midterm elections encouraged investors to buy riskier assets.

The selling in bonds was cushioned by a separate release showing activities in the service industry pulled back last month.

In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year note was 2/32 lower, yielding 2.350%. Yields rise as prices fall. The yield was 3% at the start of the year.

European and U.S. stock markets strengthened after Republicans took control of Congress. Some analysts said the party is perceived as pro-business, even though the impact from the elections could be temporary.

 Having a more united Congress with the opposing party in the White House gives less of a chance of any big changes in policy that could potentially rock the boat to the recovery,  said Anthony Cronin, a Treasury bond trader at Societe Generale SA.

Wednesday s employment survey, compiled by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody sAnalytics, showed the U.S. private sector added 230,000 jobs last month, more than the 220,000 forecast by economists. The jobs growth in September was revised higher to 225,000 from the 213,000 previously reported.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management s reading on the U.S. service sector slowed to 57.1 from 58.6 in September, missing forecasts for a reading of 58.0. But the employment component increased.

The more important nonfarm jobs report which includes both employment in the public and private sectors is slated for release Friday. The health of the labor market is one of the key factors influencing the Federal Reserve s interest-rate policy outlook.

The Fed announced an end its monthly bond buying last week and signaled that the timing for the first interest-rate increase depends on how the economy performs. Higher interest rates make newly issued bonds more attractive to buy, thus shrinking the value of existing bonds.

Economists expect the payrolls report to show 233,000 jobs were added last month following a 248,000 increase in September, with the jobless rate holding steady at 5.9%. Economists expect the average hourly wages, a main gauge of wage inflation, to increase by a mild 0.2% last month following no increase in September.

Many investors expect the Fed won t start raising rates until the second half of 2015. But the timing could be brought forward to the first half of next year if the U.S. economy picks up speed or inflation gains momentum. Analysts said this case would drive bond prices lower.

Investors have been grappling with an uneven pace of global growth this year, which has sent the 10-year Treasury yield sharply lower from 3% at the start of January even as the U.S. economy has gained traction.

On Tuesday, Treasury bond prices rose after the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, reduced its growth forecasts for the eurozone in 2014 and 2015.

The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have stepped up money printing this year, aiming to bolster anemic economic growth, even as the Fed wound down its stimulus. Ultra-loose monetary policy in the eurozone and Japan has sent government bond yields in Japan and Germany to near zero, making U.S. bond yields more attractive for foreign investors. A rising dollar this year has further boosted the allure of U.S. financial assets to foreign buyers.

Some traders expect these factors to keep a lid on bond yields.

Election 2014: GOP Senate Takeover Puts Fed on Hot Seat

By Victoria McGrane

Republicans' takeover of the U.S. Senate promises increased political turbulence for the Federal Reserve, which has already been under pressure from a GOP-controlled House.

Financial executives say a GOP-led Senate would ratchet up congressional scrutiny of the central bank's interest-rate policies, as well as its regulatory duties as overseer of the nation's largest financial firms. Republicans haven't controlled the Senate since before the 2008 financial crisis and recession, which put a spotlight on the Fed and its powers.

"If the Republicans take control of the Senate and thus have control of both the House and the Senate -- two words for the Federal Reserve: Watch out," Camden Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, said before the Election Day results were final. His group represents the community-banking industry.

Leading the GOP wish list in dealing with the Fed would be legislation to open the central bank to more scrutiny of its interest-rate decisions, using congressional audits of monetary-policy matters that Fed officials strongly oppose. Many Republican lawmakers also want to require the Fed to use a mathematical rule to guide interest-rate decisions or shift its focus more directly to inflation rather than inflation together with unemployment. All of that would come on top of heightened bipartisan scrutiny of the Fed's regulatory moves.

Many Republicans oppose the unconventional efforts the central bank has taken to bolster the U.S. economy over the past several years. The Fed last week announced the end of its long-running bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing. But that won't quell GOP criticism, since many Republicans want Fed officials to move quickly now to raise interest rates from near zero and shrink the central bank's balance sheet, which has climbed to near $4.5 trillion.

Under the Republican-led Senate, Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby would likely become the next chairman of the Banking Committee, which oversees the Fed.

Mr. Shelby is no fan of the Fed. He has been sharply critical of its regulatory performance in the run-up to the crisis. As the top Republican on the banking panel after the crisis, he supported stripping the central bank of its bank-supervision authority when Congress was writing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul law. He voted against Janet Yellen to be Fed chief, citing her support for the Fed's bond-buying programs and his concerns that they could spark runaway inflation and other economic problems.

A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.

To be sure, analysts say President Barack Obama would veto anything Fed officials worry would hinder their abilities. But a slate of hostile congressional hearings questioning the Fed's every move, as well as new legislation, would nonetheless force the Fed to play more defense.

"It still alters the dynamic in some very important ways. . .and frightening ways from the Fed's perspective," said Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics, which advises banks on policy matters.

In a recent client note, Ms. Petrou warned that a Republican takeover in the Senate could intensify congressional pushback against the Fed's use of a new tool, known as overnight reverse repurchase agreements, to raise short-term interest rates when the time comes to tighten policy.

A desire to curb the power of the Fed is one of the few topics on which Mr. Shelby sees eye to eye with Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, say industry lobbyists and analysts. That means the two might be able to find common ground on legislation.

Mr. Hensarling's committee, which has jurisdiction over the Fed in the House, held 11 hearings in the past year examining various aspects of the Fed's authority. The effort culminated in legislation proposing a multifaceted overhaul of the Fed that would, among other things, require the Fed to adopt a formal mathematical rule to guide its interest-rate decisions. Ms. Yellen opposes such a move.

While Democrats oppose meddling with the Fed's monetary-policy powers, efforts to probe the Fed's substantial regulatory powers might find more sympathy on the left. Democrats and Republicans alike regularly question whether the Fed has done enough to rein in the nation's largest financial firms since the 2008 crisis.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) recently said the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection will hold a hearing to investigate allegations that Fed supervisors are too cozy with the banks they oversee, following a report by nonprofit news organization ProPublica and the public-radio program "This American Life."

Another measure that could get more traction with Republicans in charge is Sen. Rand Paul's "Audit the Fed" legislation. The bill by the Kentucky Republican would open up the Fed's core monetary-policy deliberations to congressional scrutiny.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a potential GOP presidential contender in 2016, recently identified passing Mr. Paul's bill as one of 10 top priorities should his party take control of both chambers. Six out of 10 Republican members of the Senate Banking committee are among the bill's 31 co-sponsors as is Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is set to become majority leader with Republicans in the Senate majority.

Mr. Paul's legislation would direct the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, to conduct a "full audit" of the Fed's activities, including its deliberations on interest-rate policy, and report back to Congress.

Currently, the GAO reviews the central bank's financial operations, but not its policy decisions or agreements with foreign governments and central banks. An outside firm audits the Fed's financial operations and its findings are published in the central bank's annual report.

A companion measure passed the House in September, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) has kept it off the Senate floor. That could now change with Republicans in charge.

Fed officials oppose Mr. Paul's bill because they believe it could compromise the central bank's political independence.

Deal of the Week: D.C. Prices Go Their Own Way: Up

By most standards, the office market in Washington has lagged behind when compared with those in other major cities. Federal-government budget cuts and corporate contractions have meant rising office vacancies and stalling rents, for instance.

But those factors haven't kept the prices paid for office buildings from climbing.

Last week's deal involving PNC Place, a 12-story office building, is a case in point.

The property sold for $392 million, or $1,075 a square foot. That was the highest price ever paid, on a square-foot basis, for an office building in Washington, according to commercial-real-estate brokers.

Prices throughout the region have been rising fast. In the first half of this year, buyers of office buildings paid an average of $367.91 a square foot, up 29% over the same period last year, according to real-estate data firm CoStar Group.

The buyers of PNC Place, giant retirement-plan provider TIAA-CREF and Norges Bank Investment Management, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, declined requests for an interview to discuss the transaction.

In a statement, Suzan Amato, head of strategic joint ventures for TIAA-CREF, said, "This unique property is exceptionally located and provides long-term income from established tenants."

The building, enclosed almost entirely in glass, is two blocks from the White House and 84% leased. Pittsburgh-based banking concern PNC Financial Services Group, which sold the building, says it plans to lease it as its regional headquarters. Completed in 2010 by Vornado Charles Smith, the Washington area division of Vornado Realty Trust, and designed by architecture firm Gensler, PNC Place fills a gap in a local market that has long been dominated by older, more traditional and drab office buildings.

In contrast, PNC Place is a modern, energy-efficient building with popular features such as a fitness center, atrium, a ground-level bakery and an expansive rooftop deck -- amenities businesses are increasingly finding useful to lure and retain top talent.

"What's trading right now are these fully leased trophy buildings that these long-term investors can come in and make a long-term bet" on, said Sean Cahill, president of the D.C. Building Industry Association and a vice president at Property Group Partners.

In April, Property Group sold a modern, energy-efficient office building on 17th Street -- across the street from PNC Place -- for $948 a square foot, the highest price paid until PNC Place, according to commercial broker JLL.

On average, Class A buildings -- showcase properties with the most amenities -- in D.C.'s central business district sell for $611 a square foot, still lower than the same types of buildings in core parts of downtown Boston, San Francisco and Manhattan, where average prices range from $642 to $701 a square foot.

Commercial-real-estate brokers say rising property values in Washington -- along with a handful of other large American coastal cities that include New York, San Francisco and Boston -- also reflect aggressive bidding by large institutional domestic and foreign investors for a small number of trophy properties.

"Super-high-quality opportunities are still in short supply compared to this very substantial amount of equity capital looking for opportunities," said Al Pontius, who oversees national office and industrial properties for commercial brokerage Marcus & Millichap.

Ben Thypin, director of market analysis at real-estate data firm Real Capital Analytics, says foreign buyers have been especially aggressive. "If you're a large fund, you can't make small deals," Mr. Thypin said. "You need to place a lot of capital in big chunks. These Class A office buildings are large."

Trains Are a Pain for U.S. Grain

ONIDA, S.D. -- The worst rail delays in the U.S. in more than a decade are impeding crop shipments in the Midwest, causing grain-storage facilities to fill up and sending prices for corn, soybean and soybean meal up sharply.

Congestion on railroad networks, now threatening to extend into a second year in the U.S. Farm Belt, is forcing some buyers to purchase additional soybean meal, used mainly in animal feed, to ensure a steady supply, analysts said.

That helped push futures prices up 11% in the past week. And soybeans and corn both jumped by around 7% as livestock and poultry operations in the eastern U.S. rushed to avoid feed shortages and speculators bid up the price of the commodities related to soy meal, analysts said.

"It's panic buying," says Charlie Sernatinger, global head of grain futures at brokerage ED&F Man Capital Markets in Chicago. "You have to feed these animals."

The delays -- the worst for the agriculture industry since 2002, according to Agriculture Department officials -- have slowed business for grain companies in the upper Midwest that ship crops to customers who process them into feed and other products or export them overseas.

Analysts are concerned that unless railroad congestion abates, soybean-meal futures prices could march higher in the weeks ahead, potentially lifting some consumer prices for meat and other animal products.

For farmers who are able to ship their crops, last week's commodity-price run-up offered a chance to sell at higher prices after an extended period of decline.

Abundant summer rain this year nurtured what is projected to be the biggest U.S. corn and soybean crops in history. That has hammered prices: Even after last week's surge, corn futures are down 11% since the start of the year at the Chicago Board of Trade, the main global marketplace for agricultural commodity futures. Soybean futures are down 20%.

But for other growers, the recent price gains may not help if they can't get their product to market. At Oahe Grain Corp., a grain elevator in this central South Dakota town, business has nearly halted at what is normally its busiest time of year because railcars needed to pick up crops have been running about six weeks behind schedule.

The company's 110-foot silver towers, with several holding hundreds of thousands of bushels of wheat, have been full for most of the past month, said Tim Luken, general manager for Oahe, which markets grain, sunflower seeds and other crops. Last week, Oahe ran out of space in its corn bins, too.

While Oahe waits for railcars to arrive, it can't buy any more grain because there is no place to put it, Mr. Luken said. "Farmers call me every day. . .I'm telling people not to bring anything in."

The rail snarls will cut grain-trading volumes to 8 million to 10 million bushels at Oahe this year, from 12 million to 15 million in a typical year, Mr. Luken said.

The transport problems are caused by several factors: Rail companies are experiencing an overall rise in demand to move goods including consumer goods, crude oil from the shale fields of the upper Midwest, and increased grain from two years of bumper crops.

Last year, an unusually harsh winter compounded problems by forcing shippers to run shorter, slower trains.

That overflowing demand has lifted profits for railroad companies such as BNSF Railway, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., the two primary railroads serving the upper Midwest. Canadian Pacific shares have soared 37% this year, while rival railroads CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have climbed 24% and 19%, respectively.

Rail companies have claimed progress in easing bottlenecks. BNSF earmarked $1 billion for expanded capacity along its northern U.S. tracks this year.

"We're delivering consistently better performance than we did last year," said John Miller, BNSF's vice president of agricultural products, who said the biggest factor influencing grain shipment speeds this fall is the scale of the crop to be moved, rather than rail congestion.

Canadian Pacific is investing $500 million to help boost capacity and upgrade tracks in its U.S. network, Chief Executive Hunter Harrison told U.S. railroad regulators in a September letter. A spokeswoman said its fleet should be able to handle this year's harvest, but "the entire grain supply chain must function efficiently in order for CP to continue our recent strong performance."

A spokeswoman for CSX, which operates railroads across the East Coast, said the company is "putting all possible resources toward efficient grain service."

A spokesman for Norfolk Southern, another major railroad operator in the eastern U.S., said "all traffic is being impacted by unexpected increased volume."

Track congestion threatens profits for big agricultural traders and processors such as Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Cargill Inc. Logistics problems contributed to profit declines for the companies earlier this year, and Bunge Ltd. cited higher U.S. transport costs among its headwinds after its third-quarter results missed expectations last week.

Analysts expect railroad capacity issues to remain a challenge this winter, with J.P. Morgan Chase warning recently that higher freight costs and congestion will weigh on farmers' crop prices and agricultural-processing profits.

The logjams have led grain companies to rely more on river barges to move goods, while others are looking at using trucks as a more expensive, but possibly more reliable, option.

U.S. barge freight rates in the week ended Oct. 28 ran 60% higher than the past three years' average, according to a USDA report.

Because grain processors and exporters face higher shipping costs for the crops they buy, grain elevators -- the middlemen which gather crops from farmers for transport -- are offering some growers in the upper Midwest sharply lower prices.

In South Dakota, some grain elevators are offering to buy corn for 70 to 80 cents below the December futures price, about double the normal discount of about 35 cents, according to Bob Metz, a farmer who grows corn and soybeans near Peever, S.D.

"It's a huge hit to my balance sheet," Mr. Metz said.

Futures markets reflect expectations for further snags. Contracts for the price of corn delivered next spring have climbed higher than December contracts. Traders say the move shows that commercial grain buyers are providing a financial incentive for farmers to store crops away for the winter rather than sell them immediately after harvest, partly due to anticipated shipping backlogs.

Corn for December delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade, the front-month contract, rose 0.7% on Friday to $3.7675 a bushel. That compares with higher prices for contracts for March ($3.8925) and May ($3.98).

The price difference "has a lot to do not just with the size of the crop, but the fear it's not going to get loaded," says Mike Zuzolo, president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting LLC.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Neptune reaps the reward of solid foundations; FUND FOCUS; Large bet on housebuilders helped manager to rise up the performance rankings

Top-performing fund manager Mark Martin has closed out his large bet on housebuilders , helping him to rise up the performance rankings.

Mr Martin, who runs Neptune's 268m UK Mid Cap fund that invests in medium-sized companies, was an early adopter of positions in housebuilders, first investing in the sector in 2009.

Data from FE Analytics shows his fund is now ranked in the top decile of its sector in terms of performance over the past one, three and five years.

But now the manager has sold out of the sector entirely in the belief that it has become expensive.

"Everyone knows the housebuilder story now," he said. "It is not new and their valuations are beginning to reflect that other people have spotted it."

Housebuilders' price-to-book ratios have surged, the manager said, adding that the ratios were moving towards the peak reached in 2007 before the housing market crash.

The composition of debt in the UK also makes Mr Martin nervous. Seventy per cent of outstanding mortgage loans are variable rate and so are more interest-rate sensitive. Only 14 per cent of mortgages are interest-rate sensitive in the US.

With rates in the UK at record lows and the only likely direction of travel upwards, Mr Martin is worried how UK residents will cope.

However, the manager is still eager to take advantage of recent increased activity in the housing sector. He has been buying housebuilder suppliers, such as Marshalls, which manufactures natural stone and concrete hard-landscaping products.

Away from housing, Mr Martin is also keeping a close on eye on the pick-up in merger and acquisition activity among UK companies.

Typically, M&A increases as markets increase, but in recent months markets have improved and merger deals have lagged behind. According to Mr Martin, however, deal volumes are starting to pick up.

On October 27, Salamander Energy, a British-based oil and gas business, was approached by two companies. Mr Martin sold out of the stock as he thought there was relatively little chance of a bidding war and expected to find better opportunities elsewhere.

Some of the money that was previously invested in Salamander Energy is likely to find its way into the healthcare sector - especially mid and small-caps, which, the manager said, are being overlooked.

Mr Martin has been a strong advocate of the healthcare sector, which has been the largest overweight and biggest sector within the fund for more than a year. It makes up 22.9 per cent of Mr Martin's portfolio.

Why Big Companies Don t Think Like Startups; Venture Capitalist Peter Thiel Says Internal Politics Gets in the Way

When it comes to startup financing, it s not the  90s anymore.

Young companies have a range of new options for landing capital, and many choose to go public much later in their life cycle.

To make sense of this new landscape, The Wall Street Journal s Dennis K. Berman spoke with Peter Thiel, a partner at Founders Fund and co-founder of Mithril Capital Management. Here are edited excerpts of their discussion.

Changing the World

MR. BERMAN: The term you use in your book is that a startup is an excuse to change the world. How do people inside big companies take that idea and make something of it?

MR. THIEL: There are a number of larger companies that are still innovating fairly aggressively. I m very biased, as an investor, to be pro-companies that are still led by the founders. The founders are often able to make more choices and take more risk and have more inspiration than more politically minded CEOs. The old founders don t always live forever, that s true. You need a figure that s as close to a founder as possible.

In theory, large companies could do far more than small companies. They have more capital. They have longer time horizons. They can take more risks. I tend to think it s always that the internal politics somehow get in the way.

MR. BERMAN: It seems, though, at least now, the market favors dividend-returning, stock-buying technocrats. And they really don t have much patience for a charismatic leader, even if it s not the founder.

MR. THIEL: The antitechnology bias in our culture is also manifested in the investor class on Wall Street, which prefers companies to issue dividends, to buy back their shares and is always very disturbed if you are, instead, investing a lot of it in various opportunities.

MR. BERMAN: So what would be your advice to a CEO who s in the cross hairs of an activist?

MR. THIEL: When you go public, start with a statement like Facebook made, where the company will be managed for the long run. It won t be managed on a quarter-to-quarter cycle. You don t give much guidance on a quarterly basis, all these things where people have positioned themselves to be vulnerable to activist demands.

The Decline of  Sociopaths 

MR. BERMAN: Let s move to Silicon Valley. A lot of venture capitalists out there. They have a lot of money. Marc Andreessen said he thought valuations were warm. Give us the Thiel temperature measurement. Warm, hot, cold, what is it?

MR. THIEL: They re probably warm. I don t think it s a bubble, like in the late  90s. These bubbles were psychosocial phenomena. There s no bubble, because the public is not involved. The companies are generally not going public.

MR. BERMAN: If you were to analyze the psychosocial realm of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, Sand Hill Road in particular, what would be your analysis?

MR. THIEL: There probably has been some shift in the center of gravity from Sand Hill Road to the entrepreneurs. In the  80s or  90s, the most important relationships one had as a venture capitalist were with other venture capitalists. At this point, the most important relationships are with the entrepreneurs. This is very different from the sociopathic investor class that often dominates not just venture capital but many other areas of finance.

MR. BERMAN: Can you tell me more about that?

MR. THIEL: A sociopath is someone who optimizes at every single moment and does not think about longer-term repercussions. We re living in a more transparent world. Sociopathic behavior will work much less well.

MR. BERMAN: What percentage of venture capitalists are sociopaths, would you estimate?

MR. THIEL: There were a lot more sociopaths in the  80s and  90s than there are today. It no longer works in a way in which it worked in the past.

MR. BERMAN: Do we need venture capitalists in the way we did before? We have a range of crowdfunding platforms. Financing is coming in from all corners of the world. Big companies want to get into the venture game. Maybe we just don t need as many venture capitalists.

MR. THIEL: The demand for capital is much bigger than it was in the  90s, because the IPOs are happening much later. The capacity to invest is much greater. There certainly are somewhat more pools of funding. You have more angel investors and crowdfunding at the seed stage. You have private equity, mutual fund, crossover investors at the very, very late stage. But I think the first part, I would say is just there s far more capacity.

AIG Posts Higher Profit; Insurance Company Boosted by Life-Insurance Operations

By Leslie Scism

American International Group Inc. posted slightly higher third-quarter net income, with a jump in profits in its life-insurance business and a more modest gain in its core property-casualty unit.

The New York insurance conglomerate reported $2.19 billion in net income, up 1% from $2.17 billion in the year-earlier quarter. The results reflected the last two months of management of the company by former Chief Executive Robert Benmosche and the first month by his successor, Peter Hancock.

Mr. Benmosche retired Sept. 1 after five years at the helm, during which the company repaid one of the biggest bailout packages of the financial crisis. Under Mr. Benmosche, the once-sprawling financial-services conglomerate sold many of its units including its aircraft-leasing business and two international life-insurance businesses to narrow its operations primarily to a global property-casualty insurance business and a U.S. life-insurance and retirement-services unit.

Mr. Hancock, who previously ran the property-casualty insurance unit, called the quarterly results solid and cited  consistent performance across our businesses. 

Separately, AIG took another step to put the financial crisis behind it. It said in a regulatory filing that it had reached an agreement in July to resolve consolidated class-action securities litigation in federal court in New York related to its subprime-mortgage-bond exposure, for a cash payment by AIG of $960 million. AIG said the court has scheduled a final settlement-approval hearing for March 20, 2015. AIG said the amount had been previously accounted for in its financial statements.

AIG s operating earnings, which exclude realized capital gains and losses from its investment portfolio and other items considered nonrecurring on a quarterly basis, easily topped analyst expectations, as they gained 23% year-over-year, to $1.75 billion.

On a per-share basis, operating income was $1.21, compared with the $1.09 consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. In the year-earlier quarter, AIG reported operating income of $1.42 billion, or 96 cents a share.

Overall, net income amounted to $1.52 a share, up from $1.46. The company said it had bought back approximately $1.5 billion of shares during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $3.4 billion. AIG also announced that its board authorized additional share repurchases of $1.5 billion.

The life-insurance unit s pretax operating income jumped 18% to $1.35 billion. It was aided by a 15% increase in premiums and deposits, higher fee income from growth in assets under management and higher net investment income, primarily due to strong returns on alternative investments, such as private equity.

The property-casualty unit s pretax operating income edged up 2% to $1.1 billion. The unit saw a 3% gain in net premiums written, which is a measure of insurance sold in the quarter and is watched by analysts as a gauge of future earnings.

But the unit s combined ratio edged up slightly to 102, meaning AIG spent $1.02 on claims and expenses for every dollar it collected in premiums, compared with 101.6 in the year-earlier period.

The company said the property-casualty unit had higher net investment income among other positive developments, but that catastrophe losses and additions to loss reserves for older policies ran higher than in the year-earlier quarter.

The higher year-over-year catastrophe costs reflect AIG s world-wide presence, as many U.S.-focused rivals have reported improved results from an unusually calm U.S. hurricane season. AIG s catastrophe losses were $284 million in the most-recent quarter, compared with $222 million in the prior-year period.

Mr. Hancock, who joined AIG in 2010 as a risk-management expert, has stressed higher pricing and an exit from some unprofitable lines of business, while also modernizing the company s computer infrastructure to make better use of data analytics.

How E-Commerce Companies Are Changing; Maelle Gavet and Sebastian Siemiatkowski Say It s All About Customer Engagement

The Wall Street Journal Online

Maelle Gavet has been the chief executive of Russian e-commerce group Ozon Holdings since 2011. Widely referred to as the Amazon.com of Russia, Ozon became the top e-commerce company in a country dominated by cash by developing a system of couriers who accept payment upon delivery.

Sebastian Siemiatkowski is the CEO of Klarna, a Swedish online payments processor that uses a risk algorithm to reduce the amount of information required from buyers during checkout. The company plans to enter the U.S. market next year, where it will go up against behemoths like PayPal Inc.

The two sat down with Wall Street Journal technology columnist Christopher Mims to discuss where e-commerce is headed. Here are edited excerpts.

Customer Engagement

MR. MIMS: So e-commerce is more than 20 years old and yet it represents only 6% of retail in the U.S. And in most markets it s a fraction of that. Clearly we ve got a long way to go. What is the new frontier in e-commerce?

MR. SIEMIATKOWSKI: The initial e-commerce companies like Amazon are really infrastructure companies. They had to solve all the logistical problems, the product-search problems, the e-commerce platform problems, everything they needed to be able to sell stock online.

The new e-commerce companies we see today are totally different. They re much more about product, brand, discovery.

The new frontier is really how do I engage with customers in different new ways, whether it s through social media or whether it s through these cool new things where you can take pictures and see how you re going to look in these clothes. All these things we think are going to bring it from 5% to 15% and 20%.

MS. GAVET:: I completely agree. We ve been operating in Russia for 16 years and clearly the first problem we had to solve was an infrastructure problem. How do we deliver? How do we take calls? How do we handle the payments?

This is changing now. It used to be a huge competitive advantage. It is becoming less and less because there are alternatives. And so now we re refocusing a lot of our energy and people and resources to precisely what you described, which is marketing how to interact with customers.

MR. MIMS: Given that so much attention is now being directed through Facebook and other social media, when is that going to become a channel for purchasing?

MS. GAVET: Before Amazon and Facebook, we launched an e-commerce solution in Russian with a social network called VKontakte. It was a big, big failure. Nobody wanted it. The customers weren t ready to actually buy online.

### picture data found, picture dimensions are 154 by 480, depth 1
pict087.jpg

And what we learned from that is that they love social networks to interact with us, to ask us questions, to complain, to send us funny pictures of their cat in the Ozon box, all these kinds of interaction.

So for us, social network is a [customer relationship management] tool much more than a sales tool.

MR. SIEMIATKOWSKI: It s definitely going to happen sooner or later.

If you look at Pinterest, you have things you ve collected from different places. To add a buy button that allows you to instantly buy what s on that list without going to every separate merchant it just makes a lot of sense.

But there are technical challenges. There is also somewhat of a power struggle between the merchants who then feel that they might lose and become nothing other than infrastructure, where they just ship the goods and they don t have the interaction with the customer any more because the sales happen on other platforms. But over time, this has to happen.

Delivery by Drones

MR. MIMS: Is there a danger that e-commerce infrastructure will become commoditized? That like the telecommunications carriers that provide dumb pipes for bits, large e-commerce companies will provide dumb pipes for atoms? Is this going to happen to Amazon?

MR. SIEMIATKOWSKI: I wouldn t be surprised if 10 years from now they don t sell products themselves anymore, they just ship other people s products. So I definitely think that they re on that path.

I think the challenge these companies have is that basically they re becoming a conglomerate of many subsets of things, and they need to stay competitive in every subset. That is really, really hard.

And that s when over time, you will have the Carl Icahns of the world come in and say,  Hey, you should split this, you should spin off.  Just take eBay and PayPal. That s the first example we re seeing of that starting to happen.

MR. MIMS: Maelle, as somebody who has handled logistics in one of the most difficult environments possible, what do you think about delivery by drones?

MS. GAVET: I think drones are a very good technology when it comes to delivery, but this isn t about having a drone going to the warehouse all the way to your house.

Think about New York. I don t even understand where drones [would land]. Where it becomes really interesting is when you have many warehouses and you can t possibly keep your stock level where it should be to ensure same-day or even next-day delivery in all these warehouses.

Here drones comes in very handy because they become like roads. You just send drones back and forth between the warehouses to optimize your stock level.

That, I very much believe is likely to happen. Whether a drone is going to land in my garden in Moscow soon, no, I don t think so.

The Temperature in Silicon Valley; Venture Capitalist Marc Andreessen Sees Valuations Getting a Bit  Warm 

Marc Andreessen, the Web pioneer who co-founded Netscape Communications more than two decades ago, has become one of the most prominent investors in Silicon Valley.

His venture-capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, was among the early investors in Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc., bet on Skype ahead of its acquisition by Microsoft Corp. and more recently has become a leading evangelist for bitcoin, investing in the digital-currency arena and tweeting and blogging about its potential.

Mr. Andreessen sat down with Wall Street Journal technology editor Jonathan Krim to discuss where the tech industry is headed. Here are edited excerpts.

Bitcoin s Promise

MR. KRIM: You ve been incredibly bullish on bitcoin, and it has kind of dropped off the radar in the past few months. Do you still see it as a transformational technology?

MR. ANDREESSEN: This is a really, really big deal. We re completely convinced that bitcoin is to money what TCP/IP was to data. But it doesn t just happen overnight. It takes time.

Bitcoin is a tremendous breakthrough in computer science. If there were Nobel Prizes for computer science, this was one that would definitely win. It s a way to establish trust on an untrusted network like the Internet that we never had.

MR. KRIM: Is there some problem that you think is a barrier to this transformation happening at this point? Or is it just a matter of time?

MR. ANDREESSEN: There were tons and tons of problems, just like there were tons and tons of problems with the Internet. If we were sitting here 20 years ago having this conversation, we would say,  Oh, my God, look at all the problems on the Internet. It s really slow. It s hard to get on. Consumers don t understand it. E-commerce doesn t work yet. 

It turns out when you have a really fundamental transformational technical breakthrough, all of the problems basically become gigantic opportunities. What actually ends up happening is they become companies, and then they ultimately become industries.

MR. KRIM: Are you concerned about valuations in the Valley right now?

MR. ANDREESSEN: Well, they re running a little warm. So, the big thing we talk about a lot is discipline. You want to go after the opportunities, but you want to do it in a disciplined way.

You want to have a reasonable approach to valuation. You want to have a reasonable approach to cash burn. You want to have a reasonable approach to the total amount of venture capital. It s a tension. People get depressed. People get excited. It goes back and forth. And it comes out somewhere in the middle.

Finding Unicorns

MR. KRIM: Between your portfolio companies and the research that you do, you will see the trends coming before almost anyone else. Let s say you start to see things getting overheated. Will you tell us early?

### picture data found, picture dimensions are 375 by 480, depth 1
pict089.jpg

MR. ANDREESSEN: Well, in fact, I did. I got a fair amount of flak when I said about a month ago that the cash burn is getting out of hand.

Here s the real question of valuation. The way that valuations and tech business and venture capital works is that basically all of venture capital is an exercise to get to the 15 companies a year that are the unicorns. They are the ones that will get to $100 million in revenue, go public and get to billion-dollar valuations. These companies generate more than 90% of all venture-capital returns.

Today, $20 billion to $30 billion a year is going into 4,000 new tech startups in the U.S., translating into 15 home runs companies like Google and Amazon and Apple.

The question would be, is that 15 number about to go up? The argument for it to go up is that technology is permeating more industries in a way that it hasn t before. Airbnb is a unicorn in the real-estate industry. Uber and Lyft are unicorns in transportation. There are technology-driven unicorns in health care, financial services, government in a whole series of industries.

So you can make an argument that says instead of 15 a year, there will be 20 or 30 or 50, in which case there should be a significant ramp in venture capital and we should stay aggressive. You could also say, there they go again, hubris.

MR. KRIM: Pivot time. I want to talk about the issue of the treatment of women in tech. In the NFL, the owners have pretty much gotten together and decided there s a zero-tolerance policy now. Misbehavior involving even words is being dealt with immediately. Is there a model there for tech?

MR. ANDREESSEN: The high-quality companies tend to be pretty good on this. And within our portfolio, we re quite tough on this.

Could firms do more? I think they probably could. The other side of it is inclusion. We just simply need to get more women into this industry.

MR. KRIM: But if they re treated badly and made to feel like they re sort of pariahs and separate, how do you?

MR. ANDREESSEN: I think that may be overblowing it a little bit. There are maybe a few companies that have serious cultural issues, but none that I work with. The companies I work with very much want to have a larger percentage of women in the company, and they are doing a lot of work on that.

Thanks to the success of his Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Jack Ma is the richest person in China, which makes him a big power in the business world, and a political force whom China s leaders must reckon with.

Mr. Ma s e-commerce giant has revolutionized retailing in China, branched out into financial services, and is now trying to expand into mobile technology, entertainment and sports. The Wall Street Journal s Dennis K. Berman talked with Mr. Ma about his company, the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, and the possibility of an electronic-payments alliance between Alibaba s Alipay and Apple Inc. s Apple Pay. Edited excerpts of the conversation follow.

Reversing the Tide

MR. BERMAN: What is 11Main.com? What does it mean for Alibaba?

MR. MA: I got my inspirations from Silicon Valley, 15 years ago, on my trip to the U.S. I saw Silicon Valley, the lights everywhere, on Sunday, and people working hard. So I go back to China and build up Alibaba. Today, it s our time to come here, invest in Silicon Valley, helping entrepreneurs. So we invested in 11Main.

MR. BERMAN: A website to shop in America via Alibaba.

MR. MA: Yeah.

MR. BERMAN: You re bringing this to places like Brazil and Russia, the notion of bringing commerce directly from China to consumers in other countries basically cutting Wal-Mart out of the process of getting cheaper Chinese goods to other nations.

MR. MA: I m more interested in bringing America to China, Brazil to China, Russia to China, because selling Chinese products around the world that s the past 10, 15 years.

What I want to do is, how can we sell more American small-business products to China? More European products to China? This is the unique value that we have. Because when you have such a huge demand of good products from outside, the next 10 years, I believe, China should import.

MR. BERMAN: What U.S. small business products would make sense in the Chinese market?

MR. MA: Last year we helped Washington state. We sold 150 tons of cherries. We sell Alaska seafood. We sold 80 tons of nuts to China.

There are so many farm products here that can be sold to China; because of the pollution, people cannot have good quality products.

We start with agricultural products. People here probably don t realize that in China, when you have 110, 120 million people shopping on your site every day, you can almost sell everything.

Challenging the Banks

MR. BERMAN: The most radical thing you ve done in China is your money-market mutual fund. For decades, the people have been subsidizing the state banks of China and the state-owned enterprises of China. When you brought them better-yielding money-market accounts, you were changing the whole financial-services game in the country, and that is radical.

MR. MA: Yeah, that s radical. That s dangerous.

MR. BERMAN: Why dangerous?

MR. MA: You have taken money from those people who take it for granted. I heard so many banks talking about supporting small guys. But none of them really put efforts into that. I said five years ago,  If banks do not change, let s change the banks. 

We have more than 300 million active users for Alipay. We are probably the third-largest payment system in the world, after Visa and MasterCard. We are not trying to build a financial system. We want to build the credit system for each individual and small business. We can fundamentally change the China financial system.

That s why last year, I had a tough year. Within six months we gathered more than $100 billion. That make the government worry. All the banks hated us. I ve never seen the top five biggest banks in China unite together, want to kill us.

I talked to all the chairmen of the big bank. One of the guys said,  Jack, in 10 years, we will have a fantastic memorial for you. Thank Alibaba and Jack Ma for doing these great things. But now we have to kill you. 

Hong Kong Protests

MR. BERMAN: What happens when you see the umbrellas open up in Hong Kong?

MR. MA: The Hong Kong problem is not about China and the Hong Kong relationship. It s about young people, they don t have hope. All the big guys take &the good things. And the young people feel hopeless. But [the protests] should not push that much.

When I was young, I was upset by IBM, Microsoft. They took all the great opportunity from me. And I think, how can I be my IBM? How can I do things like Cisco? Later I say,  Forget about that.  I started to work. I started to focus on myself, my job, and a great life.

MR. BERMAN: Is it only a matter of time till the umbrellas open up in greater China?

MR. MA: Both sides should listen. And both sides should step down. This thing cannot last, it should not last long.

MR. BERMAN: Would it make sense for Alipay and Apple Pay to come together?

MR. MA: I m very interested in that. But a good marriage needs both sides hard working. And I respect Apple. I respect him [Tim Cook] very, very much from my heart. I think he s doing a fantastic job. And I hope we can do something together.

What Technology Can Do for Health; Sue Desmond-Hellmann and Sam Altman on Tackling the Big Problems

Sue Desmond-Hellmann runs the $40 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is probably best known for investing in the development of drugs and vaccines to fight widespread diseases such as AIDS and malaria. Sam Altman is the president of Y Combinator, one of the best-known technology incubators in Silicon Valley.

Together, they sat down with Dennis Berman, The Wall Street Journal s business editor, to discuss how technology is being used to solve the world s problems. Here are edited excerpts.

World s Biggest Thermos

MR. BERMAN: I think you guys represent, in some ways, distinct ways of solving problems around the world.

Sue , you might say that you can combine a lot of what Sam has to offer into big organizations. But can big bureaucracies, big organizations do the work needed to respond to something like Ebola?

MS. DESMOND-HELLMANN: What we have in common is we re both problem solvers and investors. And one of the great things about the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is we can, in a very precise way, sometimes with a small group of people, invest in solving problems.

But inevitably we need to work with governments or what you re calling bureaucracies. When you re working on the world s biggest problems, when you re working in sub-Saharan Africa at scale, you ve got to go to the local ministry of health. You ve got to understand that NGOs and governments and universities are part of that. And so it won t scale if we won t interact with bureaucracies. So we do.

MR. BERMAN: Give us one or two things that get you most excited, whether it be companies or initiatives happening at the Gates Foundation.

MS. DESMOND-HELLMANN: One of the things that I saw when I was out in Ethiopia over the summer is called the P6, the world s biggest thermos. A front-line health worker in Ethiopia can put vaccines that need to be stored cold in it, and it allows her to get those vaccines to the villages where the children are, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives.

So sometimes, the big gee-whiz high-tech things allow us to do things to get safe and effective vaccines to save kids  lives. And that kind of technology allows us to markedly reduce under-5 mortality.

MR. BERMAN: Sam, do we overfetishize startups and what they can do for the world?

MR. ALTMAN: One of the top problems with how venture capital works right now is that the time period over which people are expecting results is incredibly short. And so a lot of these things, you do have to be incredibly patient. It isn t as fast as writing software and having a viral consumer product. I do think there is a big lack of patience among much of the investing community in startups, though it s beginning to change.

MR. BERMAN: We ve seen, over the last 20 years, most venture capital in biotech has had a pretty crummy return. The patience isn t there.

MR. ALTMAN: None of these ideas are bad ideas. They were just too early. The things startups need to win are a very low initial cost and a very quick cycle time. And historically that hasn t really been the case in areas like energy or biotech. But I think things have happened in the last five years that have really changed that.

MR. BERMAN: So a company that you have like uBiome. Just walk us through what that is and how technology is making those characteristics possible.

MR. ALTMAN: So uBiome is a company that sequences the bacteria in your gut, your microbiome, and then can tell you a lot of things about that. And they mail you a kit, and you send them back a sample.

MR. BERMAN: A sample of what?

MR. ALTMAN: Poop, I think is the word they choose to use for it.

For this to work, the cost of sequencing needs to come down a huge amount, and that has been falling on this incredible curve. I think Illumina says they can do a full sequence for $1,000 with their newest machines. But also, we needed a software suite to actually analyze this genome and say,  Given this raw data, here s what this means. 

That software wasn t widely accessible until very recently. Now, you can do this thing you could never do before, because the cost and the speed and the availability of tools have just come down so much.

The Doctor s Role

MR. BERMAN: It seems that we are rolling out these incredible, beautiful, mechanical, software-driven creations. And they re doing a lot of good. Will the individual doctor just become a concierge to the machine over time?

MS. DESMOND-HELLMANN: There are certain parts of that interaction between a patient and a physician that are extra special asking the right question, laying on hands, caring, understanding what s going on in a way that Watson still can t do.

So I think of all of the technology as tools and tactics to improve outcomes in health. But the human part of what a physician does becomes more important over time.

MR. BERMAN: But over time, might that role disappear? You would say there s something special about the way humans drive cars. But there s nothing special about it. We don t drive them very well .

C omputers would probably be better at driving cars. They re going to be better at diagnosing disease.

MR. ALTMAN: Certainly the fear with AI or machine intelligence in general is that it replaces drivers or doctors or whatever. But the optimistic view on this, and certainly what backs up what we re seeing, is that computers and humans are very good at very different things.

So a computer doctor will do a better job than a human on looking at a massive amount of data and saying this. But on cases that require judgment or creativity or empathy, we are nowhere near any computer system that is any good at this.

Win Some, Lose Some; Rupert Murdoch and Carlos Slim on mostly winners

Rupert Murdoch and Carlos Slim know a thing or two about success. Each has built a multibillion-dollar empire using bold strokes and an ability to identify companies, markets and ideas with potential. Mr. Slim owns large stakes of businesses in telecommunications, banking and other industries. Mr. Murdoch is chief executive of 21st Century Fox Inc. and executive chairman of News Corp, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker spoke to them about successful bets, some less successful ones, and what lies ahead.

MR. BAKER: Carlos, were there one or two bets that looked incredibly risky at the time that actually set you on the path to where you are now?

MR. SLIM: It s difficult to just say one thing. You begin to build many things, and they get integrated. Circumstances are important. At 25, I made many companies. I was thinking more like a businessman or entrepreneur than a CEO. I created many companies, small companies, medium companies. I tried to be involved in many kinds of activities, in finance, in real estate, in mining.

The most important moment, if you are talking about two or three years, was the big crisis of external debt world-wide in  82. In our country [Mexico], after having so much oil, we used the money of the oil, and we increased our external debt. In  82,  83,  84, prices [for companies] were crazy. It was like the 1930s in the U.S.

MR. BAKER: Rupert, is there one that stands out for you?

MR. MURDOCH: We bought The Sun newspaper, which was bankrupt, for nearly nothing, changed it into a tabloid. I found a brilliant editor, and it just took off.

I started Sky, which everyone thought was crazy. We failed to get the license. It was almost a pirate station. Today, it s a very undervalued $25 billion company. We own 40% of it.

Later, here, I guess the best deal I did was Twentieth Century Fox. I said, if we re in television, content is king, we ve really got to be able to be where it s made, not have to overpay for it. Today, Fox is worth $75 billion. Shareholders are happy.

Then we started thinking, Fox News. People thought we were just crazy. I was the only one who wanted to do it in the company or outside. And of course, all the analysts, who know everything, said I was mad. And today, it has a bigger audience than all the other news networks together and makes way over $1 billion a year.

MR. BAKER: Let s talk about bets that maybe didn t work out so well. Carlos, would you say you ve had a few along the way?

MR. SLIM:CompUSA was a bad decision. We stayed too much with CompUSA, and we stayed too short with Apple.

MR. BAKER: Rupert, I assume everybody here s going to agree that Dow Jones was a great bet, a great success.

MR. MURDOCH: When we bought Dow Jones, we paid a high price. But we really wanted it. And now I think it s absolutely the cornerstone of everything we re going to do. It s a terrific platform. Circulation is holding up well or going up, as is the London Times, the only paper in London to do it.

Do you want to talk about failures?

MR. BAKER: Yes, Myspace.

MR. MURDOCH: Well, we just messed it up. The buck stops with me. But we didn t know. It was growing like crazy, and the chief executive of Fox and myself said,  Well, we don t know enough. We ve got to get advice. 

We took bad advice and put in a layer of bureaucracy from our own company that didn t know any more than we did to study it. And it was completely the wrong way.

We either should ve had faith in that management, and let it run, or changed it and found someone. But we learned from it. You ve got to learn from these experiences.

MR. BAKER: You tried to make another very large bet this summer with the bid for Time Warner.

MR. MURDOCH: It was their loss.

MR. BAKER: You pulled back.

MR. MURDOCH: I ll tell you, quite seriously, we all talked about it. It wasn t particularly my idea. We all thought, this is just a great fit. You had things like Time Warner Cable and Comcast coming together. We felt we needed more critical mass in content.

We d even talked to them about it. They said they weren t ready for it. So anyway, we made a good bid. And then it was quite clear that we d have to put the price up another $10 or $12. And we would have been very financeable. But the fact is, we would have had over $90 billion debt in the combined company.

There will be other times. There will be other opportunities.

MR. BAKER: Rupert, News Corp has just made its biggest investment so far, in Move, which includes the Realtor.com digital real-estate listings site.

MR. MURDOCH: That area, Realtor, is a huge opportunity. It s a very fragmented market. No one dominates it. And we have this great platform to link with it, in the Journal. There s a lot of work to do. You can do a much, much better job in selling houses, or enabling people to sell houses, with a website than you can with a small ad or even a large ad in a newspaper.

NATIONAL NEWS
Salaries for big data  jobs soar as demand for specialist skills grows; Technology

Rising demand for big data expertise in retail, banking and finance has created a severe skills shortage that is allowing tech professionals to command more than double the average national wage for their services, research has found.

Britain is expected to create an average of 56,000 big data jobs a year until 2020, according to a report by the Tech Partnership employers' network and SAS, a business analytics company.

The demand for big data professionals has already pushed their average salary to 55,000 - 31 per cent higher than the average IT position. More than three-quarters of posts are currently considered "fairly" or "very" difficult to fill. The big data industry has thrived as sectors as diverse as weather forecasting and fraud investigation have realised the business benefits of using consumer data to predict future trends.

Financial services was the most commonly cited employer in big data advertisements, accounting for about 20 per cent of all positions in 2013. Uses of data analytics include counteracting fraud, price modelling and risk management. Banking was mentioned in 5 per cent of adverts, and the gaming and retail sectors in 4 per cent.

Mark Wilkinson, managing director at SAS UK & Ireland, described big data as the "new oil" that will power the future information economy, and suggested skilled analysts would act as refiners by extracting the valuable insights. He added the need for expertise will increase as the "internet of things" - connecting vehicles, household appliances or clothing to the web - takes off.

However, Niel McLean, director of education at the Tech Partnership, said it was still difficult to persuade the new generation of young tech employees to acquire the skills necessary to become big data experts. "There's plenty of restaurant critics who couldn't cook a meal, and it's a similar situation with new technology users," he said.

"You can be a highly effective consumer [of technology] without having the skills to be a producer."

This summer, coding was introduced into the national curriculum in an effort to encourage more creativity in computing studies. Tech experts had been campaigning for several years for a more up-to-date approach to IT teaching, which would help foster more entrepreneurial attitudes.

But Peter Glover, a senior researcher at the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, said big data jobs were hard to fill because the knowledge and combination of expertise required went far further than standard coding.

"Software programming is quite popular as a future career choice [among young people] but when you get down to data analytics it's much harder," Mr Glover said. "You're looking for someone who can combine a range of competencies from data science, coding, adeptness at maths and problem solving, even to get to the first level."

The research showed a wide regional variation in demand for big data jobs. Between 2012 and 2013, 96 per cent of all advertised big data positions were in England. Of these, 63 per cent were based in London, followed by 12 per cent in the southeast, 5 per cent in the northwest, and 4 per cent in both Yorkshire and the southwest. Scotland's demand was even lower at 3 per cent, while Wales and Ireland together accounted for 1 per cent.

Recruitment

Three-quarters of positions difficult to fill

Of an estimated 2,200 big data posts advertised by respondents to the SAS/Tech partnership report's recruitment survey, more than three-quarters were said to have been difficult to fill. During 2013, employers found this type of recruitment harder than for any other group of management or professional staff. Even with new training schemes designed to create address skills shortages, demand for big data expertise rose by 42 per cent between 2012 and 2013. The need for IT staff declined by 9 per cent over the same period.

The Property Report
Property Investors Cool to Once-Hot Corner --- Nontraded REITs Are Struggling to Sell Their Holdings at a Profit, Which Is Hurting Share Sales; 'It's Been Very Dramatic'

By Robbie Whelan

Investors are backing away from a corner of the property market that had been a money magnet.

Nontraded real-estate investment trusts pulled in $12.3 billion through September, down 18% from the same period a year earlier, according to investment bank Robert A. Stanger & Co. Their annual haul from investors had more than tripled from 2009 to a record $20 billion last year.

Like conventional real-estate investment trusts, nontraded REITs raise money to buy commercial properties such as warehouses and office buildings. Unlike conventional REITs, they aren't traded on public stock exchanges. Instead, their shares are sold directly to small investors via networks of financial advisers and broker-dealers.

After the financial crisis, nontraded REITs appealed to investors because of their hefty dividends, typically 6% or greater annually. The trusts usually seek to return their cash to investors within three to five years by selling their portfolios or listing on a stock exchange, giving holders a chance to unload their shares.

But after helping drive up commercial-property prices by channeling money into the market, the trusts are having difficulty selling their holdings at a profit, analysts and market watchers said. That is hurting share sales.

Jeff Sica, chief investment officer of Circle Squared Alternative Investments, a company that helps wealth managers find real-estate and other alternative assets for their clients, said he has heard from hundreds of financial advisers who are no longer recommending nontraded REITs.

"It's been very dramatic," he said. "The advisers are getting nervous because people know that there's not that much real estate left to buy with all the money flowing into nontraded REITs."

The slowdown raises questions about the outlook for commercial-property deal making. Nontraded REITs have been a vital element of the market, both by channeling billions of dollars from ordinary investors into the sector and because they offer themselves up as acquisition targets for public real-estate firms looking to expand.

Brokers often pitch nontraded REITs as alternatives to bonds and other fixed-income investments. A handful of nontraded REITs in 2012 and 2013 produced returns that were 10 to 30 percentage points greater than the average performance of publicly listed REITs, according to Green Street Advisors, a real-estate research firm.

By this time last year, nontraded REITs had doled out $13.1 billion to investors through asset sales or by going public, according to Stanger & Co. So far this year, by contrast, investors have seen only $10.2 billion.

Part of the problem is that nontraded REITs must see big rises in value or in operating income in order to compensate for up-front fees charged by brokers, which are often as high as 15%. If property prices don't rise enough, the trusts can't return money to shareholders.

After heady gains following the financial crisis, increases in property prices have slowed. According to Green Street, prices for all commercial-property types climbed 8.4% in the year ended in September, much slower than the 14.7% jump between September 2010 and September 2011 and the 25.5% gain in the year before that.

"The last two years have been truly astonishing," in terms of the flow of funds into nontraded REITs, said Sheridan Schechner, a real-estate banker with Barclays PLC who has advised on nontraded REITs. Replicating the returns of recent years "is harder now."

Nontraded REITs have suffered other problems. Besides their high fees, the trusts have been criticized for aggressive sales tactics, for concentrating too much of retail buyers' assets into a small number of investments, and for paying distributions to shareholders out of capital raised from other people putting money into the funds.

One deal in the pipeline shows how difficult it is getting for nontraded REITs to return money to investors.

In September, Select Income REIT, a traditional REIT, agreed to buy Cole Corporate Income Trust Inc., a nontraded REIT, in a $3 billion cash-and-stock deal that includes the assumption of debt. Cole, which began raising money from investors at $10 a share in 2010, owns a portfolio of 64 office and industrial properties and 23 health-care-related properties.

Initially, Cole's shareholders stood to collect slightly more than the $10 they put into the trust, plus the annual 6.5% dividends they have received since buying shares. Under the terms of the transaction, Cole shareholders would receive either $10.50 in cash, or 0.36 of a share of Select in exchange for each share of Cole they own. Neither the cash nor the stock component can exceed 60% of the total.

But Select Income's share price has fallen 14% since the deal was announced, from $27.90 to $23.86 as of the close of trading on Tuesday. If the cash component was fully used, on average, Cole shareholders would now only get back around $9.70 a share.

Cole shareholders are expected to vote on the transaction in December, but the deal now looks much less attractive, making rejection more likely, analysts said. They said one reason for the decline in Select Income's stock is that by one measure often used in real estate, Cole appeared expensive.

The deal, as initially proposed, implied a capitalization rate -- a metric that compares the annual yield on property to its cost -- of 5.8% for Cole, much lower than the average of 6.9% on single-tenant office and industrial properties like the ones Cole owns, according to Real Capital Analytics. As prices rise, cap rates fall.

"It just doesn't seem like a good deal" for either side, said Daniel Donlan, an analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann. "Investors may be less inclined to reinvest their proceeds because of this."

Michael Weil, chief executive officer of RCS Capital Corp., a company that has agreed to buy Cole's so-called external adviser, said it was too early to tell how successful the company's deal with Select will be, but that "the idea behind the nontraded industry is to create a profitable exit."

External advisers provide management services to some REITs.

Select Income is one of four REITs that are externally managed by Reit Management & Research, a Boston firm run by father-and-son team Barry and Adam Portnoy. The Portnoys declined to comment.

"We continue to be very bullish on the combination," said Select Income's president, David Blackman, during an earnings call with analysts on Monday. "We think it makes a lot of sense for both companies and are continuing to move forward."

Insurers take the strain of longer and healthier lives; Life assurance

No industry has borne the brunt of the world's rapidly ageing population like life insurance.

As well as selling protection to family members against the premature death of a wage earner, these companies have built a healthy business insuring human lifespan.

Insurers take the savings of workers, promising to deliver a retirement income that can last for life. Yet with people living longer than ever before, it is more important than ever for them to get the longevity assessments right.

"It's probably only the big pharmaceutical companies who rival our interest in understanding longevity," says Kerrigan Procter , who runs the retirement business of Legal & General.

On the one hand rising longevity is good news for insurers; they can sell protection against premature death much more cheaply than they once did. However, as pensioners live longer, the costs of promises made in earlier years threaten to eat into their profits.

"Pensioners used to live for just a few years after 65. If it could be 20 or 30 years, the potential for getting it wrong is much greater," says Paul Clark, insurance partner at Boston Consulting Group. Worse, the industry complains actuaries have underestimated longevity improvements. "The past is not necessarily a good indicator about what will happen in the future," adds Mr Clark.

Nor is the present particularly favourable. Low interest rates mean insurers struggle to fulfil promises profitably.

"If you're in the business of providing long guarantees to customers, and people are living longer, it's very difficult to do that with low yields," says Paul Fulcher , managing director of asset liability structuring at Nomura.

Insurers are responding to the challenges in several ways. For example, they are asking more detailed questions about lifestyle, such as patterns of exercise and alcohol consumption. They are using sophisticated "big data" techniques to assess life expectancy and being more granular in assessing the risk of each annuity holder. This is then reflected in the price.

The industry is also passing on risks to third parties. They have found financial institutions and investors willing to take the other side of their gamble through products such as longevity swaps.

Regulation is also forcing insurance companies to rethink their business models. Tougher capital requirements are making it more expensive than ever for insurers to take the longevity risk.

Over the past decade they have moved from bearing such risks on behalf of policyholders to managing investment assets. For instance, though still formally designated an insurer, Standard Life is set next year to generate only about 10 per cent of its revenues from products that involve it taking risks on its own balance sheet.

The trend is expected to accelerate, particularly in the UK, after regulatory changes which will give savers more flexibility in using pension savings.

Although the challenges are formidable, an ageing population creates opportunities as well: the ratio of workers to pensioners is forecast to more than halve over the next 35 years - from four to one to less than two to one, says L&G.

With fewer workers available to fund state and private pension schemes for people who have already retired, those still in work will need to save more to ensure they have income when they retire. Insurers are counting on a surge of savings to fuel their growing investment management businesses.

Insurance executives also predict that governments will look to the industry as they struggle to pay the rising bill for care, health and other services for the elderly, as well as pensions.

"If things are bad now, what's it going to be like in several years' time?" asks Ned Cazalet, the financial services consultant. "Consumers should be nervous."

Companies too are anxious. Having promised generous retirement benefits, many companies are looking for products to manage the risk of longevity.

These are potentially lucrative opportunities for the insurance industry.

"I don't look at longevity risks as a big problem for providers - though they've got to get their sums right," says Mr Cazalet. "There is a huge client need - people are going to live a long time and they're going to need to get their money to work."

Bank regulators often speak a language all their own, replete with a host of acronyms amd jargon describing the nuances of different capital buffers. Even bank stress tests, a seemingly simple term, get dressed up as CCAR, or comprehensive capital analysis and review.

And regulators feel free to inject new phrases at will. So it was when the Federal Reserve last week proposed new rules governing assets a bank must keep on hand that it can readily convert into cash should it face a run. These are more stringent than international ones proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

But the Fed didn t want to say it was being tougher or breaking from the international regulatory pack. Instead, it said its proposed rules were  super-equivalent  to others. Marveling at  the wonders of regulatory prose,  Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics wrote in a note late last week:  I m pretty sure that this means that, if a person is 200 pounds, he is  super-equivalent  to someone weighing in at 150.

Deutsche Bank Hires Former Goldman Sachs Partner Sam Wisnia; Banker Gets Key Post in Fixed-Income Trading Division

Deutsche Bank AG is adding former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Sam Wisnia to a key post within its fixed-income trading division.

Mr. Wisnia was co-head of Global Strats and structuring at Goldman before leaving in 2012 to help start DMC Partners, a London private-equity firm that aimed to invest in emerging markets. He will start at Deutsche Bank next month and serve as the head of its fixed-income and currencies structuring group that develops complex trading strategies for clients.

He will also serve a head of strategic analytics, Deutsche Bank said Tuesday in a statement. In that newly created role, Mr. Wisnia will help build out the German lender s analytics platform.

Deutsche Bank has vowed to remain a big player in debt and currencies trading at a time when many Wall Street firms, from UBS AG to Morgan Stanley, have pulled back.

New rules on capital and risk-taking have crimped banks  ability to profit from the fixed-income markets as they did in the years leading up to the financial crisis. But some firms, including Deutsche and Mr. Wisnia s former employer, Goldman, have pledged to hold out for a pickup in trading activity, arguing that they will benefit from their rivals  withdrawals.

DMC, which was also co-founded by fellow Goldman alums Edward Eisler and Chris Barter in 2012, scuttled plans earlier this year to raise a $2 billion fund amid turmoil in Russia and the Middle East.

Mr. Wisnia will report to Ram Nayak, head of structuring, and remain in London.

 Sam s expertise and his deep understanding of the analytics that drive strategy will be of immense value,  Colin Fan, Deutsche Bank s head of markets, said in a statement.

On the one hand rising longevity is good news for insurers; they can sell protection against premature death much more cheaply than they once did. However, as pensioners live longer, the costs of promises made in earlier years threaten to eat into their profits.

 If you ve only got a few years to cover there s only so much you can be wrong,  says Paul Clark, insurance partner at the Boston Consulting Group.

 Pensioners used to live for just a few years after 65. If it could be 20 or 30 years, the potential for getting it wrong is much greater. 

Worse, insurance executives complain that actuaries have tended to underestimate longevity improvements.  Data about the past is not necessarily a good indicator about what will happen in the future,  adds Mr Clark.

Nor is the present particularly favourable. With interest rates near record lows, insurers are struggling to make good on payout promises and still turn a profit.

 If you re in the business of providing long guarantees to customers, and people are living longer, it s very difficult to do that with low yields,  says Paul Fulcher, managing director of asset liability structuring at Nomura.

Insurers are responding to the challenges in several ways. They have historically gathered relatively limited information about policyholders such as their age and gender. Now they are asking far more detailed questions.

They are looking at a greater range of lifestyle factors, such as patterns of exercise and alcohol consumption. They are employing increasingly sophisticated  big data  techniques to assess life expectancy and being far more granular in assessing the risk of each annuity holder. This is then reflected in the price.

The industry is also passing on risks to third parties. They have found other financial institutions and capital markets investors willing to take the other side of their gamble through products such as longevity swaps. If people live longer than expected, payments go from the investor to the insurer. But if the annuity holder dies sooner than forecast, they go the other way.

Regulation is also forcing insurance companies to rethink their business models. Tougher capital requirements are making it more expensive than ever for insurers to go on taking the longevity risk.

Over the past decade they have transformed their business models from bearing such risks on behalf of policyholders to managing assets on investments consumers make.

For instance, although still formally designated an insurer, Standard Life is set next year to generate only about 10 per cent of its revenues from products that involve it taking risks on its own balance sheet.

The trend is expected to accelerate, particularly in the UK, after regulatory changes that will give savers more flexibility in how they access their pension savings.

Although the challenges are formidable, there is a silver lining. The ageing population creates opportunities, not just risks: the ratio of workers to pensioners is forecast to more than halve over the next 35 years   from four to one to less than two to one, says L&G.

Banks join wave of investors in cyber security; Financials among backers hoping to reap rewards of battle against hackers

Banks are among a new wave of companies including technology and industrial conglomerates taking stakes in cyber security start-ups in the hope that they could play a key role in the fight against hackers.

Corporate venture arms have more than doubled their investment in cyber security in the past two years, according to data from CB Insights, with technology companies such as Google, Intel and Cisco leading the way.

But financial services companies, which are being targeted by cyber criminals as can be seen from the recent JPMorgan Chase attack , have also been eager to invest in security start-ups .

Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director at Allegis Capital, which counts 40 corporations as investors in its fund, said cyber security was a "little unusual" because companies normally invest in start-ups to gain a competitive advantage.

"With very few exceptions, there is not going to be an opportunity for a corporation to derive a competitive advantage from a cyber security company," he said.

"What I think it is a reflection of is a growing realisation up to and including the board level of the importance of cyber security to the health and wellbeing of their business."

Citibank's venture capital arm invested in vArmour, a cloud security company , Pindrop security, a fraud prevention company, and Click Security, a security analytics company. Wells Fargo-backed Norwest Venture Partners has taken stakes in Shape Security, which creates shape-shifting code designed to defeat "botnets" that can take over people's computers, and the now-public FireEye, which specialises in combating threats from nation states.

In industrials, General Electric made it into the top five most-active investors, ranked by the number of funding rounds in which it had participated, compiled by PrivCo, the private company research firm. Among others, GE Ventures has invested in Mocana, which secures the so-called "industrial internet".

Toby Lewis, from Global Corporate Venturing, said corporate venture capital in general has more than doubled in the past five years, as companies look to the start-up world to keep track of innovation, rather than investing quite as much in research and development themselves.

Cyber security is "a very hot area" that affects a wide range of industries, he said. "Cyber is a massive threat to the banking industry, and Silicon Valley start-ups and start-ups from elsewhere have some of the key technologies. Industrial companies need certain technologies to protect their machines and they are looking to bolster them perhaps with start-ups who can provide the solution." By taking funding from a large corporate, a start-up can learn how potential customers might use their product and so determine how it should be developed and pitched. Larger companies, especially in financial services, tend to be the primary buyers of advanced protections against cyber criminals.

Vanessa Colella, who leads Citi Ventures' investing team, said the bank uses its VC arm firm to look for and understand innovations it could adopt.

"For Citi, it gives us brilliant access to changes and innovations, and for the entrepreneurs, it gives them a way to figure out how to navigate these large companies. It builds the muscle needed for them to then go on to work with lots of other large enterprises," she said.

Citi Ventures invests in cyber security and enterprise IT as one of four key areas, which also includes with the others financial technology, data and analytics and commerce and payments. "We really try to think about what are the biggest challenges and opportunities that Citi faces and where is the innovation happening in smaller companies externally - and we draw a Venn diagram," she said.

But Citi does not see investing in security start-ups as a way to gain an advantage over its rivals. "Security is such an important area across financial services and the broader ecosystem these days that we are very happy to identify, find and invest in early-stage companies that improve the overall safety and soundness of all other financial institutions," she added.

DEUTSCHE BANK

Reserves for Litigation

In Quarter Top $1 Billion

Deutsche Bank AG said Friday it would book 894 million euros ($1.13 billion) in litigation reserves in the third quarter.

The early disclosure of the litigation reserves came as the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority was preparing to publish the results of an industry health check for the banking sector Sunday.

The charge is at the high end of expectations. Analysts from Credit Suisse, Independent Research and Equinet expected the bank's litigation costs to be between 400 million euros and 866 million euros.

Among other probes, the German bank is under investigation for its alleged role in the manipulation of a central interest benchmark rate, Libor, and the alleged rigging of currency fixings. Deutsche Bank has said a number of individuals have engaged in improper communications and that it is cooperating with authorities.

Moody's Executive Says

Corporate Debt Is Back

A top Moody's Corp. executive said the market for highly rated corporate debt has bounced back after a slowdown earlier this month amid wild downturns in the stock market.

Speaking on Moody's earnings call Friday, Chief Financial Officer Linda Huber said investment-grade bond issuance had "stabilized and looks quite strong." Highly rated corporate borrowers sold about $6 billion in bonds this past week, with several days of no issuance.

The coming week will feature about $20 billion in transactions, with a similar outlook for the following week. "What we're seeing is that the pipelines are robust," Ms. Huber said.

Earlier in the day, Moody's, the big credit rater, posted stronger-than-expected profits, fueled by a 16% rise in revenue driven by strong gains in its debt-rating and analytics businesses.

Overall, Moody's reported earnings of $215.2 million, or $1 a share, compared with $183.9 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings rose to 97 cents a share from 83 cents a share. Revenue rose to $816.1 million from $705.5 million a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had estimated earnings of 90 cents a share and revenue of $787 million.

Investors Clear Bailout

Of Shanghai Chaori Solar

An insolvent solar energy firm that suffered China's first domestic bond default approved a controversial debt restructuring plan that includes a state-backed, surprisingly generous settlement package for investors -- but leaves many of its biggest debtors with hefty losses.

Investors holding 69.89% of Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co.'s debt approved the proposal at a meeting Thursday at a district court on the southern outskirts of Shanghai, debtors attending the meeting told The Wall Street Journal.

The unusually generous solution to Chaori's bond default and the state's conspicuous presence in the process suggest Beijing is prioritizing economic and social stability over much-needed but painful financial overhaul.

SWISS BANKING

Lender's Offices Raided

In German Tax Probe

Swiss authorities raided the offices of Bank J. Safra Sarasin AG in connection with a German tax probe, an official from the Zurich Public Prosecutor's Office said.

Investigators searched the bank's office in Zurich and its head office in Basel on Thursday in consultation with German authorities who are investigating so-called "cum/ex dividend deals," according to Marcel Strassburger, a deputy director at the prosecutor's office. Authorities also searched 20 private offices and homes in a number of Swiss cities in relation to the probe, Mr. Strassburger said.

In a statement released Friday, Bank J. Safra Sarasin said the searches were connected to probes of funds containing "cum/ex" transactions that are being conducted by prosecutors' offices in Cologne and Frankfurt.

The bank said it "was and is not involved in the set up or the processing of such cum/ex transactions, as the funds under investigation were established and operated by a third party."

"Cum/ex" dividend transactions can enable investors to claim excessive tax credits, based on the timing of when dividends associated with shares have been received.

Weak exports weigh on S Korea GDP

South Korea's economy grew at an annual pace of 3.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year, the central bank said on Friday, with weak exports to China offset by rising private consumption.

April's Sewol ferry disaster had been widely blamed for slowing the domestic economy, with consumer spending falling as the country grieved for the 304 dead - but private spending bounced back in the third quarter, growing 1.1 per cent from the previous three months, after growth of 0.5 per cent for the second quarter.

This "low base effect" from private consumption was the driver for an improved quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.9 per cent, said Ronald Man, an economist at HSBC. But it would be "difficult for the strong upward momentum in private consumption to be sustained", he added, noting a recent decline in consumer confidence survey data.

Annual growth in the second quarter was 3.5 per cent.

South Korea's domestic economy is benefiting from expansionary fiscal policy, two recent interest rate cuts and a boost to the property market from regulatory easing. But the country remains heavily reliant on exports, which account for more than half of gross domestic product, and which have been on an unsteady course in recent months.

Exports were 2.6 per cent down from the previous quarter and showed a year-on-year rise of 2.1 per cent - the slowest pace since early 2009. The low figures were largely due to a slowdown in China, by far South Korea's biggest export market, Bank of Korea director-general Jung Yung-taek told journalists. Exports of display panels and chemical products have been particularly weak, according to the BoK.

The struggling exports to China contrast with stronger shipments elsewhere, notably the strengthening US market. In the year to September 20, South Korean exports to the US and EU grew by 9.7 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, while sales to China fell by 0.3 per cent.

Sluggish exports, coupled with foreign selling of South Korean equities, have eroded recent strength in the South Korean won. The currency strengthened against the US dollar by 11 per cent in the year to July 1 but has since retreated by nearly 5 per cent.

"The weakening Korean won will improve the price competitiveness of underperforming exporters, while global demand should strengthen [next year] on the back of faster US growth and a recovery in China," said Matthew Circosta, an analyst at Moody'sAnalytics.

Mr Circosta added that the improving domestic performance "raises questions" about whether recent monetary and fiscal stimulus measures were necessary.

This month the BoK cut the benchmark interest rate for the second time in three months, after the finance minister called for "harmony" between monetary and fiscal policy, which has been increasingly focused on boosting growth.

In July the government revealed a stimulus package with a headline figure of $40bn, and two months later said that government spending would increase in 2015 by 5.7 per cent.

The bank said it  was and is not involved in the set up or the processing of such cum/ex transactions, as the funds under investigation were established and operated by a third party. 

 Cum/ex  dividend transactions can enable investors to claim excessive tax credits, based on the timing of when dividends associated with shares have been received.

Moody s Financial Chief Says Highly Rated Corporate Debt Has Bounced Back; Executive at Credit-Rater Says Investment-Grade Bond Issuance Had Stabilized and Looks Strong

A top Moody s Corp. executive said the market for highly-rated corporate debt has bounced back after a slowdown last week amid wild downturns in the stock market.

Speaking on Moody s earnings call on Friday, Chief Financial Officer Linda Huber said investment-grade bond issuance had  stabilized and looks quite strong.  Highly-rated corporate borrowers sold about $6 billion in bonds last week, with several days of no issuance.

But this week will feature about $20 billion in transactions, with a similar outlook for next week.

 What we re seeing is that the pipelines are robust,  said Ms. Huber, who expects investment-grade debt to remain strong through the end of the year.

Earlier in the day, Moody s, the world s No. 2 credit rater, had posted stronger-than-expected profits, fueled by a 16% rise in revenue driven by strong gains in its debt-rating and analytics businesses.

Bond issuance had declined in certain key segments during the third quarter, causing some analysts to wonder if that would hinder the performance of Moody s ratings unit. Moody s and other ratings firms are paid to issuer credit ratings on bond deals.

While dollar volume was down sharply in investment-grade corporate debt, Moody s saw revenue from its ratings of companies grow 12% to $260.7 million. The reasons: it rated more deals, though they were smaller in size, and the firm saw growth in its monitoring fees.

Last year s third quarter corporate bond sales were heavily boosted by Verizon Communications Inc. s $49 billion offering. Without the Verizon deal, Ms. Huber said U.S. investment-grade issuance would have grown 17% year over year.

Overall, Moody s reported earnings of $215.2 million, or $1 a share, compared with $183.9 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings rose to 97 cents a share from 83 cents a share. Revenue rose to $816.1 million from $705.5 million a year earlier.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had estimated earnings of 90 cents a share and revenue of $787 million.

The firm s analytics division, a provider of market analytics, posted record revenue growth. Moody s Analytics now represents about 30% of the firm s overall revenues, helping the firm withstand quieter times in the capital markets.

The analytics business  revenue climbed 20% to $273 million during the quarter.

The company s ratings unit its biggest revenue contributor posted a 14% increase in revenue to $543.1 million.

 Strength was seen across all segments,  said Douglas Arthur, an Evercore analyst.

Moody s stock is up 21% in 2014 versus a 6.7% rise at rival McGraw Hill Financial Inc., S&P s parent company.

Moody s has targeted overseas expansion for growth. In June, Moody s said it had secured a majority equity ownership stake in ICRA Ltd., a leading India-based credit-rating firm. Last month, Moody s acquired full ownership of Copal Amba, a research serviced used by financial institutions with large offices in India and Costa Rica.

Moody s maintained its annual earnings target of $3.95 to $4.05 per share. Moody s had raised its target last month at its investor day, forecasting strength with U.S. ratings revenue and continued growth with analytics.

Insurance analytics  - the missing link

Analytics and big data are the flavour of the season and every educational institution worth its name has introduced courses around them. Magazines, books, articles are flooded with information on the use of analytics and the harnessing of big data.

Analytics is the process of gathering together huge chunks of data and then drawing business insight using various models and tools. Analytics helps companies and businesses to make better informed decisions and there is a huge demand for data analyst/scientists in today's world.

Reading the recent books on big data and going through the syllabi of analytics courses offered by various business schools across the globe, the use of big data in marketing and sales, banking and engineering is evident. Customer analytics, social media analytics and many other forms of analytics such as cloud analytics, web analytics, channel analytics and content analytics, also find their way into the course contents.

However, the missing link is insurance analytics. Insurance is one of the most data intensive industries. Historically actuaries and underwriters have always dealt with large data sets and have used these to make decisions. But in spite of this, insurance analytics rarely features on the business school curriculum. Financial analytics courses tend to be focused on the stock and bond markets and while there are elements of fraud analytics and visualisation in a number of courses, none of them teach these techniques with application to the insurance industry. Even insurance specific courses in business schools lack focus on analytics.

It is time that business schools recognise that there needs to be specialised courses on insurance analytics. In fact schools should go further and each line of business in insurance should be a module in itself for the purpose of analytics. For example, motor insurance, its issues and the kind of analytics it warrants is very different from life insurance. Similarly, health insurance has its own issues which are very different from fire or marine insurance.

According to a report by PwC on 'Top Insurance Industry Issues 2014' one of the most significant issues faced by the insurance companies is data analytics. The insurance sector lacks data scientists, even though it has access to pools of data, it is unable to turn that data into advantage.

A lack of skilled analysts in this sector is preventing the insurance industry from advancing. This is especially true in emerging countries where insurance penetration is low and the use of analytics is far more important, both as a means of capturing and creating markets as well as a tool to help underwriters who are having to make decisions with limited information about risks.

Business schools need to recognise the potential of this untapped market and contribute to the development of this sector by offering courses on insurance analytics. Not only would the insurance sector benefit, but this would also be good economics for business schools. Currently there is a huge demand for insurance analytics, but as yet only a handful of suppliers.

Failure to act will mean that business school students who enter the insurance sector will be ill-equipped to deal with insurance in the 21st century.Nupur Pavan Bang is head-analytics at the Insurance Information Bureau of India and Saumya Rastogi is senior analyst with ADP India Pvt.

Keywords: World's Last Great Hope: Venture Capital

One of the things you hear a lot when you talk to entrepreneurs and venture capitalists is that they want to change the world. Some of them even mean it. One of those people is Bryan Johnson, who has committed $100 million -- a substantial portion of his personal fortune -- to a new venture-capital fund aimed at what Mr. Johnson himself calls "crazy" projects.

The goals of the startups Mr. Johnson is backing are varied. They include an effort to capture an asteroid and mine it, a company that wants to meaningfully increase both the length and quality of human life, and a firm that wants to blacken the skies of our cities with swarms of self-flying autonomous drones.

"I may lose all this money, but the goal is to try and build a better world," says Mr. Johnson, who made his money founding and then selling Braintree, an online payment provider. He could also multiply his fortune by a substantial amount -- especially in this or some future climate of excitable CEOs ponying up whatever it takes for desirable acquisitions.

Since Mr. Johnson is playing exclusively with his own money, some might say what he is doing isn't even venture capital -- that tried and true system for securitizing investments in risky startups so that investors with only the usual tolerance for failure can invest in them.

But we are at a pivotal time in humanity's brief tenure on Earth, argues Mr. Johnson and the loose fraternity of wealthy tech billionaires with whom he sometimes co-invests, including Richard Branson, Peter Thiel, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Larry Page. Pick a reason: A population of seven billion people rising to 11 billion by 2050, the unlocking of our genetic code, new and frightening pandemics, artificial intelligence, and more.

We're also at a pivotal time in the history of our willingness to fund the risky genesis of the next big thing. Compared with almost any point in the past century, the U.S. is only tepidly committed to creating truly disruptive innovations -- a phenomenon Mr. Thiel has summed up as, "We expected jetpacks, but we got 140 characters."

The numbers are plain to see: While research and development is critical to creating new technologies, total spending on R&D as a percentage of U.S. GDP has been stagnant since the 1960s, according to the National Science Foundation's biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report. By itself that might not be a problem; the real issue is that the proportion of R&D spending going to basic research has declined precipitously.

The U.S. government, which is overwhelmingly responsible for the sort of basic research that has given us things like the Internet, is currently funding only about a third of R&D in the U.S., while the rest is paid for by the private sector. In the 1960s, that proportion was reversed, notes economist Timothy Taylor, editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.

The problem this presents for disruptive innovation is that businesses typically emphasize development, as opposed to research, which means commercializing existing technologies. Apple gets to count as R&D the time it spends enhancing mobile gaming on your iPhone, while the NIH is left trying to come up with a vaccine for Ebola.

This isn't an argument about the role of government in innovation -- to the contrary, we should all be grateful that businesses are now funding the bulk of R&D in the U.S., and that some of them are even funding basic research, like Google's efforts to extend human lifespan. But as government has pulled back from spending on basic R&D, in general so too has big business. Long gone are the days when large corporate research campuses like Bell Labs came up with fundamental breakthroughs like the transistor.

This is where venture capitalists could step up -- if they choose to fund the right startups.

Much of the basic research that used to be conducted within companies is now resident in startups, which technology companies gobble up at every opportunity. Acquisitions are the new R&D, and "acqui-hires" are the new staff development. Successful venture capitalism is about managing risk, so partners at most VC firms invest in businesses they think will become viable, or at least worthy of an acquisition, in the shortest time possible.

That doesn't leave much appetite among VCs for startups working on ambitious, long-shot projects, the sort that require basic research, and that's a shame. Mr. Johnson told me that there isn't much competition to fund the companies he is investing in, and that his goal is to take them from "crazy to viable," usually via small bets of a few million apiece. By "viable," of course, he means interesting to more risk-averse backers.

One of the firms he is funding, Human Longevity, certainly qualifies as crazy ambitious. Led by genetic sequencing pioneer

Craig Venter, the company told me it now has the largest genetic sequencing facility in the world. Mr. Venter's goal is to sequence 100,000 full human genomes a year. Compare that to the first full human genome sequence, released in 2003, which took a decade and $3 billion.

Human Longevity's bets are multiple, but boil down to a wager that throwing enough data at the problem will untangle the question of whether our individual genomes hold the key to medical treatments customized, by computers rather than doctors, for every one of us.

"A lot of these solutions have been left unfunded by the traditional investors," says Rob Day, a partner at Black Coral capital, which specializes in early-stage investments in cleantech and renewable energy. "We need somebody who is going to fund the commercialization of these deeper innovations, and there's nobody funding that gap," he adds.

There was a time in the 1960s when federal R&D spending was at its peak and children were raised to believe that travel to space would soon be routine. The federal government was never intended to sustain that level of R&D spending indefinitely, and the responsibility to advance the capacities of human civilization was passed to private enterprise. Now that startups are the engines of innovation, the high-risk ventures funded by individuals so wealthy they can afford to lose hundreds of millions on companies they find personally compelling are arguably the primary way that humanity goes about developing fundamentally new technologies. In this regard, we should all hope that Johnson's OS Fund is just the beginning.

Careers
Bosses Seek  Critical Thinking,  but What Is That?; An Important Skill for Young Workers Has a Variety of Definitions

Critical thinking is a critical skill for young workers these days.

What that means, though and how to measure it is less clear. Employers complain that colleges are not producing graduates who can solve problems and connect the dots on complex issues, but bosses stumble when pressed to describe exactly what skills make critical thinkers. That leaves job seekers wondering what employers really want and, once on the job, unsure of whether they re supposed to follow the rules or break them.

Mentions of critical thinking in job postings have doubled since 2009, according to an analysis by career-search site Indeed.com. The site, which combs job ads from several sources, found last week that more than 21,000 health-care and 6,700 management postings contained some reference to the skill.

 It s one of those words like diversity was, like big data is where everyone talks about it but there are 50 different ways to define it,  says Dan Black, Americas director of recruiting at the accounting firm and consultancy EY.

Brittany Holloway, a music-business major who graduated last spring from New York University, says critical thinking appeared in so many postings during her job search that it, along with traits like  detail-oriented  and  organized,  was nearly meaningless. Only in interviews could she tell what a company meant when it sought those traits.

Ms. Holloway, who now works as a content-review and fraud specialist at Brooklyn-based digital-music distributor TuneCore, defines the skill as  forming your own opinion from a variety of different sources. 

Ms. Holloway, 21 years old, says her current job requires her to think critically when screening music releases before they re sent to digital stores like Apple Inc. s iTunes.

Behavioral interview prompts, such as  Talk about how you handled working with a difficult person,  help EY bosses assess critical-thinking skills, says Mr. Black. (His definition:  The ability to work with data, to accumulate it, analyze it [and] synthesize it, in order to make balanced assessments and smart decisions. )

In late-round interviews, candidates must show how they would tackle business problems, such as whether it makes more sense for a company to make or buy a product, and why.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asks investment-banking and sales-and-trading candidates to assess company valuations and stock pitches and then to explain how they arrived at their conclusions.

By the end of one of those exercises,  the candidates should have displayed whether they possess critical thinking,  says Michael Desmarais, global head of recruiting for the bank.

Critical thinking may be similar to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart s famous threshold for obscenity: You know it when you see it, says Jerry Houser, associate dean and director of career services at Willamette University in Salem, Ore.

When recruiters tell Mr. Houser they want students with problem-solving skills,  that usually has something to do with critical thinking,  he says. His office encourages students to prepare stories to illustrate their critical-thinking prowess, detailing, for example, the steps a club president took to improve attendance at weekly meetings.

Colleges  capacity to mold thinkers has been a topic of heated debate. Richard Arum, co-author of  Academically Adrift  and  Aspiring Adults Adrift  as well as an NYU sociology professor, is a prominent critic of how schools are faring on that front.

 Schools have institutionally supported and encouraged [a] retreat from academic standards and rigor,  he says, adding that he thinks colleges have allowed students to focus on their social lives at the expense of academic pursuits.

According to research detailed in those books, students rarely study on their own for more than an hour a day, and most don t write in-depth papers that require sustained analysis.

For their part, students seem to think they are ready for the office. But their future bosses tend to disagree. A Harris Interactive survey of 2,001 U.S. college students and 1,000 hiring managers last fall found that 69% of students felt they were  very or completely prepared  for problem-solving tasks in the workplace, while fewer than half of the employers agreed.

Judy Nagengast, CEO of Continental Inc., an Anderson, Ind., staffing firm, says she has come across young graduates who  can memorize and they can regurgitate  but who struggle to turn book learning into problem solving at work.

Ms. Nagengast says she grew frustrated with young accountants who didn t understand the importance of accuracy on tax forms and filed  B-minus financial statements.  She wants and needs to recruit young workers, though, and she is testing the waters with a fresh graduate who s handling the firm s compliance with the Affordable Care Act.

Linda Elder, an educational psychologist and the president of the Foundation for Critical Thinking, which promotes educational reform, says employers really want well-trained problem solvers and not critical thinkers, especially in the lower ranks. Critical thinkers, she says, tend to challenge the status quo, which isn t always what a boss is after.

At Goldman,  we don t expect new hires to propose changes to our chairman or board on a firm-wide strategy level on Day One,  says Mr. Desmarais. But the bank s entry-level hires are expected to do more than just fulfill orders, he adds.  We do encourage our junior people to recommend changes.

C-Suite (A Special Report) --- Tons of Data -- Now To Put It to Use: Chief Data Officer Wes Hunt of Nationwide Mutual Insurance says the biggest problem is finding talent

The world creates 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data daily, a mind-boggling number that's expected to double every two years until 2020, according to International Business Machines Corp.

The explosion of data has given rise to a relatively new entrant to the C-suite: the chief data officer. With corporations awash in data, the CDO is the leader who keeps track of it, vouches for it, and ultimately is responsible for figuring out how to turn it into profit.

Last year, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. promoted marketing executive Wes Hunt to be the company's first CDO. In the marketing department, Mr. Hunt brought in new analytic techniques. For example, his team built software models that used data from consumers' digital trails to predict life transitions -- moments in which a consumer might be interested in a new type of insurance. Now he's tasked with applying that data-driven approach to business challenges on a broader scale. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Hunt discussed what it takes to fulfill that mandate. Here are edited excerpts.

WSJ: What is the best way for companies to translate insights they get from data into action?

MR. HUNT: I view this role as a driver of decision making. But you want to be able to describe what you do in a language your grandma would understand. To take action on insights, it requires that leader to be able to describe why that information should be trusted and is relevant to the problem you are solving.

WSJ: Why are companies adding chief data officers to the C-suite?

MR. HUNT: There is a belief that having strong data and analytics capabilities can lead to competitive differentiation. To do that, there is a need for a leader who is accountable for the data. Many people do data analytics. So the role isn't designed to be the sole place where data is executed. The CDO is the ombudsman for the data.

WSJ: With all these new data sources, how do you discern the signal from the noise?

MR. HUNT: Finding talent is my largest challenge. Someone who understands our business, who has quantitative skills, who has the technical skills to create the models, and who is able to persuade others that the insights they've come up with are ones you can trust and take action on. The hardest part is persuasion. You get the quantitative skills, but there's a struggle in that ability to communicate effectively. We'll often pair people together, but we'd really like to grow the talent.

WSJ: Is there a profile that fits particularly well?

MR. HUNT: When I was in marketing, we put a focus on liberal-arts-educated individuals, because abstract thinking where there are ambiguous data sets is an area where they are comfortable. Ph.D.s in psychology were a great recruiting pool. A psych Ph.D. has a fair amount of statistical training. We created a program to recruit Ph.D.s.

WSJ: Why not data scientists?

MR. HUNT: There's not yet an educational discipline and curriculum that produces data scientists at the scale that would clear the market. So the way we've focused on it is to find people with innate curiosity and critical thinking. You can teach the other skills. On my team, I have a pathologist, a bioengineering student who trained in doing heart research, an M.B.A., and someone who is trained in traditional data architecture. I also have a landscape construction engineer and a psychology Ph.D.

WSJ: Can you give an example of how you are using data mining?

MR. HUNT: We have a customer advocacy group, the ombudsman for the customer. They're looking at calling patterns. If you analyze the call-center notes -- we mine keywords to examine the emotional tone of an individual and the frequency of how often they tend to call us. Looking at that low-grade, unstructured data, we can predict when customers are going to call -- and we can get to them before they lodge a complaint.

WSJ: Your background is in marketing. Are the techniques of Web marketing, such as analyzing clicks and other minute data points, migrating into other areas of the business?

MR. HUNT: The traditional place that business analytics has taken place is in the finance office. And the business techniques that originated in finance migrated into marketing. The marketing team showed you could use nonfinancial data to assess performance. Those techniques can be applied to an even broader set of data than traditional marketing departments focus on. This latest generation is applying the techniques in ways we could never imagine. That's where the competitive advantage will come from.

WSJ: How much has all this data-mining actually grown your bottom line?

MR. HUNT: In the last six years, as we've become more data driven, we've been able to increase the time members have been active customers by 15%. It's part of a bigger strategy, enabled by analytics, to deliver services at points where customers choose.

WSJ: Is there too much hype around big data?

MR. HUNT: If you're trying to find the silver bullet that is going to raise revenues by 50%, that's going to be hard to find. If you're focused on building a model and continuously improving the operation, you can derive value.

WSJ: Has there been resistance to a data-driven approach within Nationwide?

MR. HUNT: We've seen buy-in challenges. All companies have that. We've found it comes in two forms. One is blind trust, i.e., "It looks complicated so it must be right," versus, "It looks complicated so it can't be right." You want understanding to be intuitive and for there to be trust between the person [developing the data] and the one who is making the decisions.

WSJ: How do you overcome resistance?

MR. HUNT: For those who want to understand the details, we will provide them. We'll focus on educating them, not only on the data sources, but on the dedicated techniques, the assumptions and analyses. When you share information, it allows for greater collaboration.

WSJ: What kind of mistakes do companies make?

MR. HUNT: It takes a team that can learn how to use these new technologies. It takes an organization time to be willing to trust the information that comes out of it. That learning curve is often minimized and overlooked.

The world creates 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data daily, a mind-boggling number that s expected to double every two years until 2020, according to International Business Machines Corp.

The explosion of data has given rise to a relatively new entrant to the C-suite: the chief data officer. With corporations awash in data, the CDO is the leader who keeps track of it, vouches for it, and ultimately is responsible for figuring out how to turn it into profit.

Last year, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. promoted marketing executive Wes Hunt to be the company s first CDO. In the marketing department, Mr. Hunt brought in new analytic techniques. For example, his team built software models that used data from consumers  digital trails to predict life transitions moments in which a consumer might be interested in a new type of insurance. Now he s tasked with applying that data-driven approach to business challenges on a broader scale. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Hunt discussed what it takes to fulfill that mandate. Here are edited excerpts.

Making the Case

WSJ: What is the best way for companies to translate insights they get from data into action?

MR. HUNT: I view this role as a driver of decision making. But you want to be able to describe what you do in a language your grandma would understand. To take action on insights, it requires that leader to be able to describe why that information should be trusted and is relevant to the problem you are solving.

WSJ: Why are companies adding chief data officers to the C-suite?

MR. HUNT: There is a belief that having strong data and analytics capabilities can lead to competitive differentiation. To do that, there is a need for a leader who is accountable for the data. Many people do data analytics. So the role isn t designed to be the sole place where data is executed. The CDO is the ombudsman for the data.

The Right People

WSJ: With all these new data sources, how do you discern the signal from the noise?

MR. HUNT: Finding talent is my largest challenge. Someone who understands our business, who has quantitative skills, who has the technical skills to create the models, and who is able to persuade others that the insights they ve come up with are ones you can trust and take action on. The hardest part is persuasion. You get the quantitative skills, but there s a struggle in that ability to communicate effectively. We ll often pair people together, but we d really like to grow the talent.

WSJ: Is there a profile that fits particularly well?

MR. HUNT: When I was in marketing, we put a focus on liberal-arts-educated individuals, because abstract thinking where there are ambiguous data sets is an area where they are comfortable. Ph.D.s in psychology were a great recruiting pool. A psych Ph.D. has a fair amount of statistical training. We created a program to recruit Ph.D.s.

WSJ: Why not data scientists?

MR. HUNT: There s not yet an educational discipline and curriculum that produces data scientists at the scale that would clear the market. So the way we ve focused on it is to find people with innate curiosity and critical thinking. You can teach the other skills. On my team, I have a pathologist, a bioengineering student who trained in doing heart research, an M.B.A., and someone who is trained in traditional data architecture. I also have a landscape construction engineer and a psychology Ph.D.

Putting Data to Work

WSJ: Can you give an example of how you are using data mining?

MR. HUNT: We have a customer advocacy group, the ombudsman for the customer. They re looking at calling patterns. If you analyze the call-center notes we mine keywords to examine the emotional tone of an individual and the frequency of how often they tend to call us. Looking at that low-grade, unstructured data, we can predict when customers are going to call and we can get to them before they lodge a complaint.

WSJ: Your background is in marketing. Are the techniques of Web marketing, such as analyzing clicks and other minute data points, migrating into other areas of the business?

MR. HUNT: The traditional place that business analytics has taken place is in the finance office. And the business techniques that originated in finance migrated into marketing. The marketing team showed you could use nonfinancial data to assess performance.

Those techniques can be applied to an even broader set of data than traditional marketing departments focus on. This latest generation is applying the techniques in ways we could never imagine. That s where the competitive advantage will come from.

WSJ: How much has all this data-mining actually grown your bottom line?

MR. HUNT: In the last six years, as we ve become more data driven, we ve been able to increase the time members have been active customers by 15%. It s part of a bigger strategy, enabled by analytics, to deliver services at points where customers choose.

All Aboard

WSJ: Is there too much hype around big data?

MR. HUNT: If you re trying to find the silver bullet that is going to raise revenues by 50%, that s going to be hard to find. If you re focused on building a model and continuously improving the operation, you can derive value.

WSJ: Has there been resistance to a data-driven approach within Nationwide?

MR. HUNT: We ve seen buy-in challenges. All companies have that.

We ve found it comes in two forms. One is blind trust, i.e.,  It looks complicated so it must be right,  versus,  It looks complicated so it can t be right.  You want understanding to be intuitive and for there to be trust between the person [developing the data] and the one who is making the decisions.

WSJ: How do you overcome resistance?

MR. HUNT: For those who want to understand the details, we will provide them. We ll focus on educating them, not only on the data sources, but on the dedicated techniques, the assumptions and analyses. When you share information, it allows for greater collaboration.

Mortgage Giants Set To Loosen Lending --- Fannie, Freddie Near Deal to Lift Limits; Concerns Persist

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and mortgage lenders are nearing an agreement that could lower barriers and restrictions on borrowers with weak credit, a move that would expand access to home loans amid the sluggish housing recovery.

The move by the mortgage-finance giants and their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, would help lenders protect themselves from claims of making bad loans, according to people familiar with the matter.

Fannie and Freddie are also considering programs that would make it easier for lenders to offer mortgages with down payments of as little as 3% for some borrowers, the people said. That would be a reversal for the loan giants. The moves could be announced this coming week.

Regulators and White House officials have struggled to expand access to mortgages, which have been hard for some borrowers to get since the financial crisis despite a sharp rise in home prices. But the likely moves by Fannie and Freddie could provide kindling for critics who worry about repeating some of the mistakes that led to the housing boom and bust.

The agreements wouldn't end the debate over the future of Fannie and Freddie, which were taken over by the government near the height of the crisis in 2008. Earlier this year, a bipartisan Senate plan to replace Fannie and Freddie as part of a broader housing-finance overhaul stalled.

The latest moves underscore just how much the government is relying on Fannie and Freddie to help increase the supply of credit. Steps to reduce down-payment standards would further signal a turn away from previous efforts to shrink the influence of the two mortgage giants.

"Three percent [down payments] can disappear and become zero real quick," said Mark Calabria, director of financial-regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "This is the sort of thing that gets people underwater."

Still, the potential agreement "would allow credit to flow more freely to lower- and middle-income households," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics. "That's vital to getting the housing recovery moving forward."

While Fannie and Freddie don't make loans, they buy them from lenders, package the loans into securities and then give guarantees to make investors whole if borrowers don't repay.

Fannie and Freddie have recouped tens of billions of dollars in penalties from lenders in recent years over claims that the lenders made underwriting mistakes on loans they sold to the mortgage giants during the run-up to the housing crash. Lenders have blamed those penalties, in which lenders were required to buy back mortgages, for prompting lenders to make loans only to borrowers with near-pristine credit.

In previous years, Fannie's and Freddie's regulator had tried to shrink their outsize role in the mortgage market. However, under new director Mel Watt, who took office in January, the FHFA has turned to expanding mortgage access, partly to ensure that tight credit doesn't stifle the housing recovery.

The FHFA has made several previous attempts to ease lenders' concerns. Beginning in 2013, the agency said lenders wouldn't have to buy back most loans where the borrower didn't miss any payments for three years. In May, the FHFA said borrowers could miss two nonconsecutive payments within three years.

In both cases, the FHFA exempted some mistakes such as fraud. But without clear definitions of what mistakes met that threshold, lenders said they remained wary of expanding mortgage access.

The new agreement would clarify which mistakes should constitute fraud, giving greater confidence to lenders that they won't be penalized many years after a loan is made. Still, lenders and regulators must reach an accord on what to do if they disagree on some problems, which could involve using a third-party arbiter to resolve disputes.

Mr. Watt is scheduled to speak at a Mortgage Bankers Association conference on Monday.

"Assuming Director Watt announces some new framework to give better clarity for lenders to extend credit to more qualified families, this will be a good step forward for the housing market," David Stevens, the trade group's president, said in a statement.

Analysts at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC said an agreement would reinforce "our belief that policy makers are willing to embrace initiatives aimed at increasing the flow of mortgage credit."

Separately, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHFA are considering new programs that would allow the companies to guarantee some mortgages with down payments of as little as 3%. The program might be limited to certain kinds of loans, such as mortgages to first-time home buyers.

Fannie Mae stopped accepting loans with 3% down payments last year, except in certain circumstances, while Freddie stopped guaranteeing such mortgages years ago.

The companies already guarantee loans with down payments of as little as 5%, though loans with down payments of less than 20% typically require mortgage insurance.

Regulators and lenders have tried to walk a fine line between expanding mortgage access and moving too far toward the loose credit that led to the crisis.

In May, Mr. Watt said Fannie and Freddie should focus on making credit more available, rather than pull back from the mortgage market.

The potential impact of looser lending standards and low down-payment programs on the availability of mortgages isn't clear. One question: Will an agreement be enough to get lenders to boost their lending to lower-quality borrowers?

Meanwhile, the U.S. government and shareholders of Fannie and Freddie are continuing to fight in the courts over how to handle the companies' profits.

When the two companies were taken over in 2008 and put into a so-called conservatorship, the government didn't wipe out shareholders. Instead, it received warrants to buy as much as 80% of the common stock in Fannie and Freddie -- and a new class of preferred shares that initially paid a 10% dividend.

In August 2012, the government did away with the fixed dividend but required Fannie and Freddie to steer almost all of their profits to the U.S. Treasury.

Investors sued the government over the change in terms. A judge recently dismissed one of the most prominent cases, but others haven't been decided yet.
