Tidjane Thiam , Credit Suisse's relatively new chief executive, was really annoyed on Wednesday. Just five months after outlining a strategic plan to set the bank on a new course, he was having to try again - this time with deeper job cuts and bigger losses than previously expected.

Staff in the bank's markets division, he said, had hidden giant risky bets from senior management and the cost of unwinding those positions was a large part of the problem.

This behaviour was "unacceptable", Mr Thiam said. "There have been consequences. I don't want to name names, but there have been changes," he explained. "There is a new way to manage the bank, which we've been very explicit on."

Good on Mr Thiam for identifying culprits and trying to change the culture. But it is shocking that this kind of thing can still happen in 2016.

Poor tracking of banks' trading positions was a big part of the problem before the financial crisis - and fear of unknown exposures was a key reason the markets ground to a halt after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

Ever since, bankers and regulators have sought to ensure every lender has up-to-date information about its holdings, particularly in its trading book. Analytics firms run around selling high-tech "dashboards" that are supposed to provide real-time monitoring of banks' various exposures.

So how could senior managers at Credit Suisse be unaware of its outsized, risky and hard to sell positions? Some of them dated back several years.

In fact, all sorts of unexpectedly bad things still lurk inside the world's big banks. JPMorgan Chase's $6.2bn London Whale trading loss in 2012 is one particularly famous example. But mistakes happen all the time. As many banks cut staff and try to rationalise computer systems, it is not unheard of for entire securities portfolios to fall through the cracks and be forgotten for many months.

Critics argue that slips such as these are evidence the banks are still too big to manage properly and should be broken up . In Israel, Moshe Kahlon, the finance minister, is championing a plan to force banks to sell off their credit card divisions.

Bank chiefs have hit back, arguing that some activities, particularly those that cross international borders, can be better handled by large institutions. They also complain of unrealistic expectations. "Can I know what every one of 257,000 people is doing? Clearly, I can't," Stuart Gulliver , the HSBC chief, told a UK parliamentary committee last year. He suggested he was being held to higher standards than the military or the church.

Misbehaviour happens everywhere, but in a well-run institution, managers spot problems early. Then measures are taken to limit the damage and make amends. Culture is key, but so are resources. After the Whale, JPMorgan spent an extra $1bn on controls.

In that context, Credit Suisse's other big announcement this week makes perfect sense. It has joined forces with Palantir, a CIA-backed artificial intelligence firm, to use data-driven behavioural analysis to root out rogue traders and insider dealing.

Mr Thiam says he wants to change Credit Suisse's culture. But if his employees don't feel comfortable admitting to problems, at least his bank will soon be a lot better at catching them.

'Quantitative' financiers are sceptical that new technologies will help in battle for returns

Isaac Newton may have been one of the finest minds of all time, but he turned out to be a miserable investor. "I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people," he lamented after losing a fortune in the South Sea bubble .

Increasingly, however, technology-savvy investors think they can harness mathematics and computer science to predict financial markets. Some of the most advanced asset managers are turning to artificial intelligence , with investment algorithms that can autonomously learn, adapt and scour vast data sets for tradable patterns.

But some "quantitative" financiers, or quants , are sceptical that these tools are any more than a somewhat better mousetrap, and argue that areas such as "machine learning" are overhyped and AI used as a marketing gimmick.

"Everyone wants the Holy Grail, something they can invest in and it will make 1 per cent a month forever," says Ewan Kirk, head of Cantab Capital, a quantitative hedge fund. "I don't want to be cynical, but I am sceptical."

David Harding, head of Winton Capital, one of the biggest quantitative hedge funds in the world, is also doubtful that AI represents a quantum leap for the investment industry. "I'm not a Luddite, we're always interested in new ways to make money. But I have to be very sceptical because I constantly have world-class people showing me miracle cures that don't actually work," he says.

Improvements in computing power have revolutionised the investment world, with algorithmic traders and investors increasingly influential across markets. Money is pouring into computer-driven hedge funds that have consistently managed to parse signals amid market noise. As a result money managers are scrambling to hire computer scientists, often pitting them in direct competition for talent with Silicon Valley's tech giants and hot start-ups.

AI is at the forefront of this. The field has taken several leaps forward in recent years. Most notably, Google's DeepMind AI arm has created a programme that recently thrashed a legendary player of Go, an ancient Chinese game so complex that most experts had reckoned it would take at least a decade before a computer could beat a human champion .

The potentially wider applications of techniques used by the likes of DeepMind's AlphaGo algorithm have fuelled optimism that investment management could be on the cusp of another technological revolution, possibly similar in scale to the electronification of markets in the 1970s and 1980s.

"Machine learning and artificial intelligence is going to play a very large role in quant managers, but also with traditional asset managers that are aggressively expanding in this space," says Osman Ali, a fund manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

Popular AI approaches such as machine learning can be used by computers to develop autonomously. For example, a machine learning algorithm can master a computer game such as Super Mario independently, at first playing the arcade classic randomly but quickly figuring out how the controls work.

There is therefore widespread enthusiasm for the potential of machine learning algos to find fleeting but profitable patterns in the vast sea of data.

"I think of algos as little children that can scale tremendously," says Brad Betts of BlackRock's Scientific Active Equity arm. "And you can teach them to read millions of books at the same time."

Yet scepticism, even among quants, is pervasive. They see areas such as machine learning and deep learning - the latter underpinned DeepMind's Go exploits - merely as extensions of techniques that have long been in use.

"Lots of people [have been using] techniques that could be called machine learning for decades," argues Robert Hillman, head of Neuron Capital. "There's a huge difference between image recognition and using AI in markets. Will this be a paradigm change for investing? I don't think so . . . It's not a fundamental change, it's an efficiency improvement."

Mr Kirk says that most common AI approaches are focused on pattern recognition, such as telling the difference between a cat and a dog in an image. But markets are dominated by noise and chaos; the patterns are harder to find.

"As a geek I'm super-excited about AlphaGo, but it's a big leap from beating a game with clearly defined rules and objectives [to] investing," he says.

Even quants that are cautiously optimistic on the future of AI in investing warn of pitfalls. Algorithms that may look ingenious and backrest superbly against historical data have a habit of unravelling when confronted with unforgivingly fickle financial markets.

"Playing Super Mario might not necessarily work for markets. If you hit the button you always know what will happen, but you don't in markets," says another quant at a large hedge fund. "It can take time for it to find the good trades and to optimise them. It can go through a lot of bad trades."

Proposal Aims to Curb Bank Risk Models; Basel Committee proposes limits on discretion institutions have to measure how much risk they can take

Global regulators moved to further tighten the reins on banks, proposing limits on the discretion institutions have to measure how much risk they can take.

The compromise plan reached Thursday by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision wouldn't allow banks to calculate their own credit risk from exposure to other banks, large corporations and stocks. The committee is counting on the nonbinding proposal to lessen potential risks to financial stability tied to the connections among global banks.

Financial institutions in Japan, Switzerland, Singapore and Scandinavia potentially have the most to lose from limits on using their own models to measure risk. The proposed rules aren't expected to have a big impact on the four largest U.S. financial institutions J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., Bank of America Corp . and Citigroup Inc . U.S. regulators have already imposed tough new borrowing limits, and the Federal Reserve has implemented rigorous annual stress tests.

 The U.S. is in a better position to make this adjustment with these rules than the European and U.K. banks," said Mayra Rodriguez Valladares, managing principal at consulting firm MRV Associates LLC. But U.S. banks could face high hurdles if U.S. regulators stop them from using their own risk models altogether and instead use a common standard, a policy change Fed governor Daniel Tarullo has sought.

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/basel-committee-to-stop-banks-gaming-risk-models-1446472711" (Nov. 2, 2015)

The Switzerland-based global rule-setting body stopped short of barring banks from using their own modeling. Under the proposal, banks would still be allowed to calculate capital held against corporate, mortgage, credit-card and retail exposures, a typically significant portion of a bank's assets.

The committee is separately considering imposing additional constraints by placing a cap in the range of 60% to 90% on all four asset classes to limit the benefit of banks being able to use their own models to weigh risk. A significantly higher floor could have a material impact on all banks.

The proposal kicks off a three-month comment period before any policy changes are finalized. After that, each country must begin their own process of applying the rules to their respective banks.

The move marks the latest big piece of work by the Basel Committee on regulatory changes that address problems exposed by the financial crisis. Further work by the 29-member body that sets standards for banks globally includes changes to operational and credit risk along with a leverage ratio that would require banks to fund all assets with a minimum amount of money.

Regulators, especially those in the U.S., consider it problematic to allow banks to measure their own credit risk and determine how much capital they need to guard against a possible default by a counterparty and the individual firm's exposure if there is a loss.

 Addressing the issue of excessive variability in risk-weighted assets is fundamental to restoring market confidence in risk-based capital ratios," said Stefan Ingves, chairman of the committee and governor of Sweden's central bank .

Policy makers argue that individual assessments often deliver varied results among institutions because the models are different. By applying a standardized approach, regulators will have the ability to set a stricter framework based on their own expectations of default and calculations of potential losses.

 It is a clear indication that Basel has renounced models other than for favored asset classes, like mortgages, where they want to give banks leeway to support social and economic policy goals," said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing director of advisory firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

Brad Carr, deputy director for regulatory affairs at the industry group Institute of International Finance , said the issue needs close examination.

 For instance, there are corporates with strong balance sheets, for which there might be a better way to converge and improve modeling treatments than using a blunt standardized approach," Mr. Carr said.

The Basel Committee said the treatment of sovereign exposures, another hotly debated issue at the committee, would be handled under a separate review.

Norwest Venture Partners Invests in Medgate; Norwest Venture Partners has made a  large strategic investment  in Medgate Inc., a software-as-a-service provider of environmental, health, safety and risk management services.

Norwest Venture Partners has made a  large strategic investment" in Medgate Inc., a software-as-a-service provider of environmental, health, safety and risk management services.

Canadian growth-equity firm Georgian Partners and BMO Financial Group joined Norwest as co-investors in Medgate, according to a news release.

Toronto-based Medgate provides EHS software to companies in areas such as occupational health, safety, industrial hygiene, environmental management and ergonomics. Its clients include National Aeronautics and Space Administration, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Deere & Co. and Suncor Energy Inc.

Robert Arditi, a Norwest partner, said the firm has been interested in the compliance industry, specifically in risk management.

 It's nicely profitable and growing at a healthy pace," said Mr. Arditi.  They didn't need to do a transaction--they chose to work with us because they saw the value we could bring."

Medgate provides software that aims to make workplaces healthier--including products that strive to reduce employee injuries and prevent deaths. Mr. Arditi said the product intends to increase productivity by fostering a healthier and safer employee base.

In terms of growth, Mr. Arditi said Norwest views Medgate as a consolidator in the fragmented EHS space. The company is expected to opportunistically consider acquisitions in the risk management space.

 What we see from speaking to customers is they are clamoring for ways to improve their internal productivity, prevent injuries and deaths," Mr. Arditi said.  We would look at any solutions that could help them do that."

Medgate said it will use the new capital to spur product expansion, further enhance its analytics capacity and to fund acquisitions to accelerate growth.

Previous to Norwest's investment, Medgate acquired U.K.-based Tempus Software Ltd.'s Cohort Occupation Health software business in 2012, according to a news release issued at the time.

Norwest makes both venture and growth equity investments in companies across the technology, consumer, health-care and services sectors, among others. The firm currently manages $6 billion in capital and has funded more than 575 companies since its inception, according to its website.

Earlier this year, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm raised Norwest Venture Partners XIII, a $1.2 billion fund. A news release by the firm at the time said the capital would be used to support its growing network of portfolio companies.

Goldman Executive Put on Leave

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. put its head of U.S. inflation trading on leave as it reviews the way certain trades were booked, according to people familiar with the matter.

Josh Schiffrin, who was named a partner in 2012, still is employed at the firm, the people said. He was placed on leave in January, some of the people said.

Mr. Schiffrin didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.

Goldman's compliance executives are seeking to determine whether Mr. Schiffrin's desk may have violated the firm's policies in booking certain inflation trades, in which government bonds and their derivatives are used as hedges, the people said.

The review is in motion, and it is unclear what the firm's conclusions will be, the people said. Mr. Schiffrin hasn't been seen on the trading floor in a few weeks, some of the people said.

A person familiar with the matter said the review is expected to conclude shortly and that Mr. Schiffrin will return to work.

Meanwhile, a trader who worked under Mr. Schiffrin, Igor Cashyn, has resigned, people familiar with the matter said. He declined to comment.

The incident comes as Goldman and other firms have faced a deep debt-trading slump, reflecting factors including a longer-than-expected period of low interest rates and broad volatility tied to concerns about the health of the global economy.

"It's been a very difficult environment" in bond trading, said Brian Kleinhanzl, an equity-research analyst covering banks at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a unit of Stifel Financial Corp.

Fixed-income, currency and commodities revenue fell 9% in 2015 across the top 12 global investment banks including Goldman, according to analytics firm Coalition. The number of traders, salespeople and certain researchers on desks catering to those classes of trading -- known in Wall Street circles by their acronym FICC -- fell 4% last year.

Traders have fared no better in early 2016. The five biggest Wall Street banks, including Goldman, are expected to show a 16% decline in total first-quarter trading revenue, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts have said.

Even Goldman, whose commitment to debt trading hasn't wavered since the financial crisis, has been cutting jobs from its FICC department, paying smaller bonuses to those who remain and shrinking the balance sheet tied to its trading activities.

Earlier this year, the firm moved to trim as much as 10% of its fixed-income staff, a steeper cut than Goldman normally makes during annual cost-cutting.

Meanwhile, inflation-related market measures have come under scrutiny from traders and policy makers.

One widely watched measure, the five-year, five-year forward inflation expectation rate, fell last month to its lowest level since the financial crisis in the middle of the market panic over U.S. recession risk and banks' exposure to negative interest rates overseas.

In that episode, inflation expectations by some measures fell alongside U.S. stocks, oil prices and Treasury yields before swiftly recovering when the panic ended.

Minutes from recent Federal Reserve policy meetings spotlight central bankers' concerns about certain inflation measures remaining under their 2% longer-term objective. Inflation has been stuck below that goal for more than three years.

Big banks have beefed up their compliance departments in recent years in response to a flurry of new regulations on capital and risk-taking.

Goldman's total workforce climbed 8% to 36,800 in 2016 to its highest year-end total, in part because of new hires in its legal, compliance and technology groups.

"We're making a significant investment in regulatory compliance," Harvey Schwartz, Goldman's finance chief, said in a January conference call with analysts. "We think it's critically important. We actually think it's a competitive advantage."

Google  s Computing Service Lures High-Profile Clients; The division is trying to catch up with Amazon and Microsoft in the public cloud market

Google 's business of selling time on its immense computer network is gaining high-profile customers.

The computing-on-demand division of Alphabet Inc . on Wednesday will announce that Walt Disney Co .'s Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media is using the service. Sources say Alphabet will announce several more new customers at the Google Cloud Platform Global User Conference in San Francisco that starts on Wednesday.

In addition, an executive of Netflix Inc ., a Google cloud customer, is scheduled to speak at the event.

In the past month, Google Cloud Platform has "http:/www.wsj.com/articles/apple-using-googles-cloud-moving-some-data-from-amazon-1458239465": Apple Inc . "http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-cloud-lures-amazon-web-services-customer-spotify-1456270951".

The new customers represent important validation for Alphabet's computing-on-demand division when it is struggling to establish itself as a leading provider of so-called public cloud services, which offer metered computing power over the Internet.

Google Cloud Platform is working to catch up to rivals Amazon.com Inc .'s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp .'s Azure cloud service, which hold greater market share. In particular, it is adding features intended to address the needs of large companies.

Google announced on Tuesday the addition of two new massive data centers, in Oregon and Tokyo, opening later this year. The company said those sites would be the first of more than 10 data centers to roll out through 2017.

Google 's relationships with Apple, Netflix , and Spotify are especially significant steps forward for the search giant's cloud effort. They are Amazon Web Services customers, and they continue to use that service as well.

Google Cloud Platform leader Diane Greene , who at the conference will make "http://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabets-google-taps-enterprise-it-veteran-to-run-cloud-business-1447976698", was hired in part to lure such customers. She previously cultivated similar clientele as she built VMware Inc ., a vendor of data-center software, into a onetime favorite of chief information officers.

Google declined to make Ms. Greene available for this article.

Amazon Web Services , which pioneered the cloud-computing business a decade ago, leads the public cloud market. Morgan Stanley estimates that the service generated $7.9 billion in sales last year, while Microsoft Azure, which has capitalized on longstanding relationships with corporate customers, posted $1.1 billion in sales. Google Cloud Platform tallied less than $500 million, according to Morgan Stanley .

 They are probably No. 3 in the market, but they are a weak No. 3," said Lydia Leong , an analyst with Gartner Inc .

Disney plans to use Google 's storage, database and application service to run  hundreds" of projects including Disney Life, a subscription service in the U.K., the company said.

Spotify said it opted for Google Cloud Platform because the service's data-analytics offerings may help it refine listening recommendations for its subscribers.

Nonetheless, analysts and industry observers believe Google hasn't sufficiently adapted its vast computing network, which is finely tuned to its own operations, for use by outsiders, Ms. Leong said.

 Its challenge is to figure out how to commercialize that platform so that it is consumable by customers," she said.

Moreover, Google trails Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in wooing startups to develop ancillary services that can help customers manage their operations on the network or offer features such as additional security to make its cloud offering more complete.

Madrona Venture Group LLC , a Seattle-based venture-capital firm that invests in cloud startups, regularly gets approached by companies developing businesses that work with Amazon or Microsoft . But it never hears from companies building Google Cloud services, said Madrona managing director Matt McIlwain .

 There's not an ecosystem here [for Google Cloud Platform] in the way there is on AWS," Mr. McIlwain said.

Moreover, the service lags behind rivals in the basics of support such as monitoring and managing its cloud services, Gartner 's Ms. Leong said. Those meat-and-potatoes features are essential to winning corporate contracts, she said.

Ms. Greene will emphasize improvements in that area at the conference, according to a person familiar with the matter.

 If they are going to serve enterprises, they are going to need to have a culture change to meet enterprises where they are," said Ellie Fields, vice president of product marketing at Tableau Inc., which makes data visualization software for all three top cloud services.

Credit Suisse is joining forces with Palantir Technologies, the artificial intelligence company backed by the CIA's venture capital arm, to use data-driven behavioural analysis to root out rogue traders and insider dealing.

Banks have been anxious to improve compliance and surveillance after a string of trading scandals that shocked the industry in recent years - from a $2bn loss UBS suffered at the hands of a rogue trader to a  ¬4.9bn unauthorised trading loss at Socit Gnrale.

The joint venture with the Swiss bank is the first for Palantir , the Palo Alto-based group which counts In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital arm, among its -earliest investors.

Credit Suisse and Palantir declined to discuss financial terms but said the new company, named Signac after the French painter, was an even partnership of cash, employees and intellectual property.

Palantir - whose products are already used by many large banks - and Credit Suisse - which developed an intelligence unit of former foreign exchange traders - are betting their partnership will stand apart from the field by analysing the behaviour of -individuals to better understand the big picture.

The venture will track traders' activities and try to identify aberrations both from their own norms and from those of their colleagues.

Credit Suisse said the UBS and SocGen trading scandals shared what they called "toxic combinations", including trading in internal accounts and a large number of "cancel and correct" trades. The new product will analyse those outliers and marry the data on them with behaviour analysis, such as cell phone usage and door key-card swipes.

"We decided that we have to monitor the behaviour of individuals," said Lara Warner, chief compliance and regulatory affairs officer at Credit Suisse. "When those 'common toxic combinations' come together at an individual level you get an early warning sign."

Credit Suisse is using the product to track its nearly 1,000 traders and plans to roll it out to cover its 4,000-plus relationship managers around the world. The joint venture, the partners hope, will in time be used by other banks.

Palantir is one of the highest valued private technology start-ups in Silicon Valley, after Uber and Airbnb, raising funds last year at a valuation of $20bn.

Growth-focused firm Bregal Sagemount has invested $40 million in Open Lending LLC to acquire a  significant" minority position in the automated lending services provider.

Founded in 2000 and based in Austin, Texas, Open Lending offers loan analytics, risk-based pricing, risk modeling and automated decision technology to automotive lenders in the U.S. through its flagship product, Lenders Protection.

New York firm Bregal in a statement said the funds will allow Open Lending to accelerate its expansion among financial institutions, credit unions and regional banks. Bregal executives Gene Yoon and Blair Greenberg will join the company's board. Financial terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.

The Property Report
U.S. Commercial-Property Sales Plunge

U.S. commercial-real-estate sales plummeted in February, sending the clearest signal yet that a six-year bull market might be coming to an end.

Just $25.1 billion worth of office buildings, stores, apartment complexes and other commercial property changed hands last month, compared with $47.3 billion a year earlier, according to deal tracker Real Capital Analytics Inc. In January, sales were $46.2 billion.

Prices, which had been on a steady march higher since 2009, are beginning to plateau, and have started falling in certain sectors and geographies, according to analysts and market participants. An index of hotel values compiled by real-estate tracker Green Street Advisors, for example, was 10% lower in February than a year earlier, due in part to reduced business and international travel.

Overall, commercial-property values are leveling off. Green Street's broad valuation index was 8.7% higher in February from a year earlier, but in the previous year the index rose 11%.

"Clearly there has been a plateauing," said Jonathan Gray, global head of real estate for Blackstone Group, the world's largest private-property owner.

The question is whether February was a temporary blip or the beginning of a more-lasting pullback. The Green Street index, which tracks higher-quality property owned by real-estate investment trusts, is 24% above its 2007 peak and 102% higher than the trough it hit in 2009.

Mr. Gray and others emphasize that the commercial-property market is much healthier than before the 2008 crash. Rents, occupancies and other fundamental factors are improving for most property types, analysts say. New supply growth has been limited, they point out.

"It's too early to call the end of the cycle," Mr. Gray said.

Still, some are heading for the exit. For example, Radnor, Pa.-based Brandywine Realty Trust has sold $765 million worth of property this year, including Cira Square, the former U.S. Post Office Building in Philadelphia.

Gerard Sweeney, Brandywine's chief executive, said the real-estate investment trust is "accelerating" its property sales. "We've made the call that, given where we are in the real-estate cycle, now is a good time for us to be harvesting value by selling," he said.

The market has slowed primarily because of forces at work in the global capital markets rather than problems stemming from real estate itself. These forces, which also caused global stock markets to plummet in the first two months of this year, have made debt -- the lifeblood of real estate -- more expensive and more difficult to obtain.

The most striking sign has been the sharp decline in bonds backed by commercial mortgages. In 2015, about $100 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities were issued. This year experts believe volume will fall to $60 billion to $75 billion.

Banks and insurance companies are filling part of the void. But they can charge more and be more selective, making loans primarily backed by trophy and fully leased buildings in strong markets.

"There are deals falling out of the system," said Josh Zegen, managing principal of Madison Realty Capital, an investment firm with more than $1 billion of loans outstanding. "I'm able to be very choosy."

The real-estate debt markets began to tighten at the end of last year as concerns grew about interest rates rising and new regulations on lenders, enacted in response to the world financial downturn, began to take effect.

Central banks eased up on their tightening of interest rates, but the real-estate debt market remained choppy at the beginning of the year as global stock and corporate-bond markets convulsed amid signs the Chinese economy was weakening.

As yields of junk bonds soared, real estate became a less attractive investment. At the same time, the spreads between real-estate borrowing rates and Treasury bonds widened greatly.

Today loans that would have been made with interest rates in the 4.5%-to-5% range now are being made above 5%. Borrowers who would have lent up to 75% of a property's value have reduced their so-called loan-to-value ratios to between 65% and 70%.

Those changes mean that many real-estate investments that would have made sense before no longer do.

"Buyers have been hearing 'no' from lenders for the first time in a while," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics.

U.S. News: Some Home Loans Will Be Trimmed

Thousands of homeowners will be eligible to have their mortgage balances cut under a plan approved by the federal regulator of mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to people familiar with the matter.

The plan approved by the Federal Housing Finance Agency marks the first time that Fannie and Freddie will reduce mortgage balances on a large scale for struggling homeowners since the housing crisis erupted. But it doesn't go as far as some housing advocates wanted.

Fewer than 50,000 "underwater" homeowners, who owe more than their homes are worth and are already behind in their mortgage payments, will likely be eligible, people familiar with the matter said.

Fannie and Freddie -- which don't make mortgages but rather buy them from lenders and wrap them into guaranteed securities -- would also forgive principal only in cases where they determine the companies would lose less money with that option than foreclosure or other foreclosure-prevention methods. In addition, the new program will likely be limited to mortgages whose outstanding principal balance is under a certain dollar amount, people familiar with the matter said.

Because of the plan's restrictions, it won't have a significant impact on the national housing market, said Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.

Still "it makes economic sense to do for everyone involved. It will keep some stressed homeowners in their homes, reduce losses to Fannie, Freddie and thus taxpayers, and could if focused, buoy some hard pressed neighborhoods," Mr. Zandi said.

The plan could be announced within the next few weeks, the people said.

About 4.3 million borrowers were underwater as of the end of 2015, according to real-estate data firm CoreLogic, down from 12 million in 2009. Not all those loans are backed by Fannie and Freddie.

In the past, policy makers explicitly rejected reducing the principal of mortgages backed by Fannie and Freddie, which were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis and put into a so-called conservatorship under the FHFA's direction. Conservatives and others have long worried that any program involving principal reduction would signal to homeowners that such steps might be used in future crises.

"Is the role of Fannie and Freddie to make sure your house doesn't decline in value? I don't remember seeing that in the charter," said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.

On the other hand, supporters of principal reduction say the tool is effective in getting some delinquent homeowners to start paying their mortgages again, which in the long-term can save taxpayers money. Some advocates say that the benefits can flow to the rest of the community, as the homeowner becomes more likely to spend to maintain their home.

"Homeowners behave differently when they feel like a glorified renter versus when they feel like they're an owner," said Julia Gordon, executive vice president of the National Community Stabilization Trust, a nonprofit that works in neighborhood revitalization.

Principal reduction at Fannie and Freddie has been debated for years. The Obama administration's signature foreclosure prevention program -- the Home Affordable Modification Program -- encouraged mortgage servicers to reduce principal in some instances.

But the FHFA is independent of the administration and has been slow to roll out a program. Edward DeMarco, FHFA director from September 2009 until January 2014, wouldn't use that option, citing the risk to taxpayers.

Mr. DeMarco, now a fellow at the Milken Institute, on Monday said the FHFA's research in 2012 indicated lowering a borrower's monthly payment mattered most to avoiding foreclosure and that other methods of modifying loans were more effective than principal reduction. Most underwater borrowers still paid their mortgages and "we didn't want to create an incentive for them not to be current," Mr. DeMarco said.

Some left-leaning housing advocates hoped that Mr. DeMarco's successor, former Democratic Congressman Melvin Watt, would move quickly on a broad principal-reduction program. Instead, Mr. Watt took a slower, more-measured approach, frustrating some advocates and lawmakers.

"It has been six years since Congress created FHFA, and in all that time, your agency has never, not once, permitted a family to reduce its principal," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) in a hearing with Mr. Watt in November 2014. Mr. Watt at the time said the agency would come up with a plan soon. Since then, the potential impact of a principal-forgiveness plan has greatly diminished, not just because of foreclosures but also because of rising home values.

Elliptic Enterprises Ltd ., a startup founded by three Ph.D.s in computer science, physics and mathematics, has raised $5 million in a Series A round for its bitcoin fraud monitoring service.

Paladin Capital Group , a Washington-based venture firm with a history of investing in security technology, led the round. New investors also included Santander InnoVentures, the venture arm of banking firm Santander Group ; KRW Schindler; and Digital Currency Group , the investment and bitcoin trading firm of Barry Silbert that is also backed by venture capital. Octopus Ventures reinvested in Elliptic.

As banks and others experiment with bitcoin, their compliance departments will try to avoid any connection with criminal uses of the digital currency.

 For distributed ledger technology to achieve widespread use, compliance departments and regulators will demand independent monitoring capabilities to combat insider trading, fraud, and money laundering," said Mariano Belinky, managing partner at Santander InnoVentures, in a statement.

London-based Elliptic, launched in 2013, says it uses graph analysis and machine learning to find illicit bitcoin transactions. The company operates in the U.S. and Europe.

The company maintains a database where it links anonymous bitcoin addresses with identifiable entities. Its customers include law enforcement agencies and financial institutions.

Chief Executive James Smith, who holds a computer science Ph.D. from Oxford University in natural language processing, started the company with Tom Robinson, a Ph.D. in atomic and laser physics from Oxford, and Adam Joyce, a Ph.D. in math from Imperial College of London .

Elliptic previously launched a secure storage service for bitcoin, similar to the services offered by Xapo Ltd.

Santander rolls out voice-recognition via iPhone for customers on the move; Banks

Thousands of Santander bank customers will soon be able to use voice-recognition technology to tell their mobile phones to monitor and recount their spending habits and make payments on the move.

Santander claims to be the first lender in the UK to enable customers using an iPhone to talk to its banking app in a similar way to how people interact with Apple's virtual assistant, Siri.

In a "friendly" female voice, Santander's SmartBank app can tell customers how much they have spent going back up to a year, or within a certain timeframe, or at a particular shop.

Within the next six months, the bank plans to expand the functions available using voice technology to allow customers to make payments, set up account alerts or report lost cards.

The bank is planning for the app to function securely by analysing the account holder's voice and only responding to that.

Nathan Bostock , chief executive of Santander UK, said: "Technology is rapidly changing how customers bank and pay on the move."

A study by consultancy firm CACI showed that current-account customers visited their bank branch 427m times last year, less than half the 895m logins on a mobile app. Santander has reported a 48 per cent increase in the number of customers using its mobile app over the past two years.

The launch comes as other lenders race to create services based on artificial intelligence and voice biometrics, as more customers shun branches in favour of mobile banking.

This coincides with a shift towards "robo-advice" spurred by financial institutions coming under pressure to cut costs by reducing staff numbers.

HSBC and Barclays have recently revealed voice recognition, although this enables customers only to log on to accounts by speaking.

Royal Bank of Scotland has launched artificial intelligence, called "Luvo", to interact with bank staff and potentially serve customers in the future.

Other banks in the US and Europe, such as ING, have launched voicetechnology services as an option for customers to manage their accounts.

Sigga Sigurdardttir, head of customer and innovation at Santander, said the voice technology, provided by Nuance Communications, was programmed to evolve and become more intuitive the more it was used.

She said: "It's all about creating a seamless customer experience, in line with the trend of having more digital customers than before."

The app provides "simple service on the go" and "allows customers to be in control" of their account, she added.

Ms Sigurdardttir said the bank planned to expand the new app capabilities to android phone users soon.

Santander added it would continue to provide paper and online statements, although more people were expected to turn to mobile banking.

Lloyds launches mobile mortgage interviews

Customers of Lloyds Banking Group will soon have mortgage interviews in their home via video, as fewer customers visit branches and greater numbers opt instead for mobile access.

The state-backed bank is launching its mortgage advice service across a video link that is accessible through a laptop, desktop or tablet computer.

The video service, which was piloted last year, enables customers to have a face-to-face interview online, remov-ing the need to travel to a branch or speak to an adviser by phone. It comes as banks are scaling down networks to cut costs. Lloyds said last month it would close 29 branches as part of plans to shut 200 over three years.

Lloyds is not alone. Jes Staley , chief executive of competitor Barclays, said after announcing a net full-year loss for 2015 that his bank "has not reduced its real estate footprint since the crisis" and that there were "tremendous savings for us to do so".

Figures from consultants CACI show that current-account customers visited their bank branch 427m times last year, compared with 895m logins on a mobile app.

Firms Set Sights on  Fourth Industrial Revolution ; The European industrial and manufacturing sector has traditionally conjured up images of Sheffield steel mills and German automotive factories churning out cars in Rhine-Ruhr.

The European industrial and manufacturing sector has traditionally conjured up images of Sheffield steel mills and German automotive factories churning out cars in Rhine-Ruhr.

Private-equity investment in the sector has typically focused on heavy industry, for example veteran buyout firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice's $1.7 billion acquisition of German packaging manufacturer Mauser in 2014 and Bain Capital's acquisition of Leicestershire-based brickmaker Ibstock.

While the tech industry continues to boom years after the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, the industrial sector has remained relatively steady but shown few signs of growth in the past five to six years.

Deal flow is still down compared with pre-financial crisis highs. The number of deals done has stayed relatively flat at between 83 and 120 each year since 2010, compared with 142 deals in 2006 and 135 deals in 2007, according to data provider Dealogic.

However, there are signs that industry is changing. According to a June 2015 report by consultancy firm McKinsey & Co., the industrial and manufacturing sector is experiencing  the fourth major upheaval in modern manufacturing," following the lean or  streamlining" revolution of the 1970s, the outsourcing phenomenon of the 1990s, and the rise of automation in the 2000s. This shift is known as Industry 4.0, in which advances in data exchange and automation are transforming manufacturing processes.

Big data, improved analytics and increasing computer power and connectivity are all driving this shift in traditional manufacturing and production methods. Fredrik Henzler, partner and co-head of industry value creation at Partners Group, said:  The development will have a tremendous impact on the industrials and manufacturing sector as technology can be used to reduce both the cost of production and the time it takes to bring new products to market."

While new technologies are expected to boost industrial companies' output and make production more efficient, they are not the sweet spot for private-equity investment, according to Mr. Henzler.

New technology alone won't necessarily result in direct profit growth among downstream manufacturers. This doesn't mean that there are no gains to be made in traditional manufacturing. Indeed, Nick Sealy, co-head of European investment banking at Baird, said:  Other sectors may offer higher organic growth rates but high-quality industrial businesses can be more broad-based and deliver strong cash generation."

However, efficient production processes are likely to benefit all segments of industry, from companies focused on traditional heavy industry to those specialized in driverless cars, for example.

By contrast, upstream manufacturers of products such as sensors or data-sharing technology--which enables driverless cars to function--are likely to see a bigger upside. They represent a less mature market that therefore has greater potential for growth, according to Mr. Henzler. Private equity houses should concentrate their efforts on investing in such upstream companies that develop industry-changing technology, as they are most likely to profit from the move toward automation and the Internet of Things, he said.

In today's low-growth environment, companies in the industrial sector grow comparatively slowly relative to other sectors that are less closely tied to GDP, such as health care and tech. Low growth rates impact on national income, meaning consumers are less likely to have money to spend on expensive new products, such as cars.

 The industrials sector is more naturally coupled to GDP than many other sectors," said Andrew Cunningham, a managing director at DC Advisory.

Digital developments in the industrial and manufacturing sector are changing this, providing opportunities for industrial and manufacturing companies to decouple themselves from the general economic cycle and offer investors higher returns. If a company can  decouple" from the general economy then it will become more resilient and can deliver returns regardless of macroeconomic uncertainty.

The sensors sector--which according to Catalyst Corporate Finance was worth $85 billion globally as of autumn 2015 and has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 7.5% over the last three years--is a good example of this.

Self-driving cars are generating huge demand for sensors, which enable cars to accelerate, brake and steer with limited or no driver interaction. A report released by research service BI Intelligence last year predicted that there will be 10 million self-driving cars on the road by 2020--up from none at present. If demand for self-driving cars increases, so will demand for sensors. While there is an established market for cars, the sensor market has a larger opportunity for growth.

Private equity houses have been quick to spot the potential in this sector; snapping up a number of deals in the last couple of years. According to the recent sector update produced by Catalyst Corporate Finance, the majority of sensor deals have been valued at less than $200 million, showing the relative lack of maturity in the sector.

The largest deal in the sensor sector in the past two years was Carlyle and PAI Partners' acquisition of Custom Sensors & Technologies Group in a deal worth $900 million, which closed in April 2014. Other private equity-backed deals in the sector include Parkwalk Advisors acquisition of Cambridge CMOS Sensors in July 2015 and Endless's acquisition of troubled engineering firm Suir.

While there is plenty of opportunity for private-equity firms to capitalize on the changes under way in the industrial and manufacturing sector, they are not the only buyers looking to take advantage of them. The past year has seen strategic appetite for companies in the sector thrive: 70% of all mergers and acquisition deals involved trade buyers in 2015, according to a report produced by DC Advisory in spring 2016.

Tahseen Siddique, vice president of M&A research at Baird, said:  Strategic buyers are competing increasingly fiercely against private-equity firms for deals in the industrials sector and more often than not are winning processes as they can pay in cash and benefit from synergies."

Particularly notable is the increasing appetite from foreign buyers--with trade buyers from the U.S., China and Japan all looking to purchase companies in the industrial and manufacturing sector.

Mr. Cunningham said:  Another big trend we have seen relevant to private equity exits is the revival of interest in European industrial companies from U.S. trade buyers."

He cited the comparative strength of the dollar against the euro and the increased tax efficiencies generated when U.S. firms with cash trapped in Europe invest the proceeds in Europe as oppose to paying a dividend back to their parent companies in the U.S. According to DC Advisory's Industrials 2015 M&A review and 2016 outlook, U.S. purchasers led the way in terms of investment in European industrial companies for the second year in succession in 2015, acquiring 23% of businesses sold in the sector in Europe that year.

Fortune 100 company Honeywell, for example, bought Germany-based water and energy company Elster Group from British buyout firm Melrose last year for $5.1 billion, generating a 2.3 times return on equity.

 Another trend that you can see in many sectors, including in industrials, is that the Chinese buyers are getting very active," said Fredrik tting, a partner at buyout firm EQT's Munich office.

The recent downturn in China has similarly forced Chinese investors to look abroad for growth, with European companies a likely target. In the industrials sector particularly, Chinese companies target European, largely German firms with technical and engineering expertise that they can export back to their domestic market.

ChemChina's purchase of precision technology manufacturer Krauss Maffei in early January 2016, for example, provided it with access to core competencies in process engineering and automation.

Investors Go Bargain Hunting in the Oil and Gas Sectors

This year has so far been characterized by market turbulence, a slowdown in China and falling oil prices. Investments in the oil and gas sectors have been particularly hard hit, with earnings and cash flows on the decline.

Over-levered companies, potential bankruptcies and defaults are all possible in the energy sector in today's economic climate as companies run up against their covenants and need capital investment to keep afloat. EIG Global Energy Partners announced in March 2016 that it was to mark down the unrealized value in a 2007-vintage fund, acknowledging losses in value in its oil and gas assets.

For companies with exposure to the oil and gas sector this is disastrous, to the savvy investor it presents an opportunity. Andrew Cunningham, managing director at DC Advisory, said he expects an increase in distressed investing, with an emphasis on businesses exposed to oil and gas.

Falling valuations in the sector mean that oil and gas companies potentially offer better value than other sectors where entry multiples are higher.

Research from S&P Global Market Intelligence found that of all the sectors it covers in Europe, energy had the lowest implied enterprise value to Ebitda multiples. The sector average for energy stood at 6.8x for M&A activity in 2015, against a high of 17.5x in the financial sector, according to S&P data.

Mr. Cunningham added that while companies haven't yet seen a lot of activity in this area, it is something that is expected to heighten with greater frequency as the year develops.

Zodiac Raises $3M Seed for Predictive Customer Analytics ; Zodiac Inc. has raised $3 million in seed funding for its predictive marketing analytics  software designed to help marketers home in on the most valuable customers.

Zodiac Inc. has raised $3 million in seed funding for its predictive marketing analytics software designed to help marketers home in on the most valuable customers. First Round Capital led the round, with participation from Metamorphic Ventures, Felicis Ventures and Western Technology Investment.

Zodiac, previously called CLVMetrics, requires three pieces of information from the marketer: a customer ID, a time- stamp record of transactions and a record of transaction values, according to Chief Executive Artem Mariychin. Zodiac then uses probabilistic models to predict each customer's likelihood of transacting with the company in the future and about the  basket size" of each transaction. It uses these predictions to forecast a  customer lifetime value," based on a forward-looking prediction of that customer's future spending.

Marketers can then measure the effect of every marketing step they take--such as sending a targeted email--on the individual's customer lifetime value. Marketers might identify a segment of customers whose lifetime value has decreased in the past six months, and then run a targeted campaign to win them back.

Zodiac works with brick-and-mortar retailers as well as online ones. Mr. Mariychin said Zodiac can work with any retailer where the customer can be linked to one ID, such as a credit card or a rewards card. Zodiac operates on a cloud-based software-as-a-service business model, charging clients a monthly subscription fee based on their number of customers.

Mr. Mariychin founded the company along with marketing professor Peter Fader and two other data scientists from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance. Zodiac says its software is currently in use by retailers such as American Apparel and ModCloth.

The one-year-old startup received an investment from First Round Capital's Dorm Room Fund before this seed round. The new funding includes $1.5 million in equity financing from First Round, Metamorphic and Felicis, which closed in December. The remaining $1.5 million was raised as venture debt from Western Technology Investment, and closed in March.

Making Confidential Bank Oversight Less Confidential

NEW YORK Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer is fond of observing that bank supervisors are like spies: When they do their job well, the public doesn't notice.

Bank supervisors are thinking a lot these days about how to change that. If advocates for more inspection disclosure get their way, the public will have a clearer window than it currently does into problems at large institutions and what supervisors are doing to address them though the very prospect makes bank executives squirm.

For supervisors, some of the desire for more disclosure is a product of the political climate. The public has a broad perception, persistent since the financial crisis, that bank oversight is weak. Hence, politicians like Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/bernie-sanders-to-rein-in-wall-street-fix-the-fed.html?_r=0"about how the Fed  has been hijacked by the very bankers it regulates."

William Dudley , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has been at "http://www.wsj.com/articles/dudley-denies-serious-problems-in-feds-regulation-1416588378". He hosted a conference Friday on supervision, part of a broader effort to convince the public of what Fed officials believe: Supervisors are doing a far better job keeping bank risk-taking in line than before the crisis, and they are continually striving to improve.

 We have come a long way since the financial crisis," he said at the outset of the conference, adding:  Reliance on confidential information and confidential actions can make supervision seem mysterious to outsiders, which complicates the evaluation of what policies may be effective or ineffective."

Mr. Dudley, who has been part of Fed efforts to increase transparency on monetary policy, didn't specifically advocate disclosing more about the supervision process. Privately, some supervisors are resistant. They think their closed-door critiques of banks can be effective, and worry that disclosure could politicize that work.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig, often a maverick, said at Friday's conference supervisors should disclose more about problems they find at banks. Doing so would catch banks' attention, he said, and  I think you [would] have an overall more responsive and more accountable banking system."

Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Bank of England's supervision arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority , noted that regulators have already been moving in the direction of more disclosure. Decades ago, bank capital ratios weren't disclosed. Now, supervisors disclose those as well as a lot more, such as how banks fare under  stress tests" examining how their capital levels might hold up during a recession.

 We are publishing things on banks that our predecessors would have been horrified" to see in the public domain, he said.

Still, there are limits even to the most aggressive disclosure advocates. Mr. Hoenig doesn't want to disclose numerical grades of bank performance, which he said would turn supervisors into rating agencies. To be sure, banks already have to disclose material information to investors under securities laws.

The prospect of more public rebukes won't excite bankers. But it could give supervisors more credibility, which is ultimately in the interest of financial executives. Until populist anger about bank oversight lets up, supervisors' desire to prove they are getting tough won't either.

Differentiating Regulation From Supervision

Setting out to model the difference between financial regulation and supervision, "https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr769.pdf?la=en" link the distinction between regulation and supervision to the difference between verifiability and observability. In its purest form, they say, regulation is written into law and enforced through courts, therefore requiring verifiability; in contrast, supervision has discretion and only requires observability. The model assumes that while a bank's possible actions aren't verifiable, some are observable by supervisors, meaning that supervisors can prevent some observable actions but have to rely on incentives to ensure the work is done properly. The model can speak to some issues of supervisory incentives, they say, and allows supervisory costs to include non-monetary costs like opportunity costs.

Basel Rules Fail to Account for Complexity

The Basel Committee 's standardized capital rules fail to take into account differences in national models, and the committee's habit of  papering over" those differences doesn't do anyone any good, "http://www.fedfin.com/blog/2058-karen-petrou-on-how-basel-blessed-russia-and-thus-damned-its-capital-framework" Ms. Petrou warns that by smoothing over national differences in banking systems Basel could jeopardize the efficacy of the rules intended to counteract systemic risk. She scoffs at the notion that national regulators would be able to fill out questionnaires essentially self-reporting as to whether they were in compliance with Basel guidelines, a policy that Ms. Petrou likens to a student grading her own test. The standardized capital rules Basel has laid out are far inferior to a system in which complexity plays more of a role, Ms. Petrou writes.

IHS and Markit to Merge, Creating Data Heavyweight; Inversion deal to create new London-based firm called IHS Markit

By Shayndi Raice, Sarah Krouse and Anne Steele

U.S. information and analytics provider IHS Inc . and U.K.-based market-data company Markit Ltd . said they would combine to create a $13 billion company based in London.

By moving to the U.K., IHS will be able to take advantage of the country's lower corporate-tax rate through what is known as a tax inversion, a way for U.S. companies to avoid paying taxes at home. The new company, to be called IHS Markit, is expecting a corporate-tax rate in the low- to mid-20% range, compared with the 35% U.S. firms pay.

Monday's deal values Markit at about $5.8 billion, or $31.13 a share, a 5.6% premium to Friday's closing stock price.

After the deal is completed which is expected in the second half of the year shareholders of IHS , which has a market value of about $7.5 billion as of Friday's close, will own about 57% of the combined company.

Shareholders of London-based Markit will own about 43% of the firm. Although it will be located in London, the new company will have  certain key operations" in IHS 's base of Englewood, Colo.

Started in a barn more than a decade ago by former TD Securities credit-trading executive Lance Uggla, Markit aggregates information from major bond dealers that is used for research, valuation, trading and reporting about derivatives, bonds, loans and currencies.

The company has become an important provider of data to Wall Street and was initially backed by a dozen large lenders, including Bank of America Corp ., Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., Deutsche Bank AG and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co .

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/markits-ipo-increased-in-size-priced-within-forecast-at-24-a-share-source-says-1403130660"

Jerre Stead , chief executive of IHS, will become CEO of the combined firm until his retirement on Dec. 31, 2017. He also will be chairman. Mr. Uggla, who will be president and a member of the board of directors, will take over as CEO after Mr. Stead's departure.

The two executives, who have been involved in more than 100 mergers and acquisitions over the past decade, discussed merging over breakfast in December after being connected by an investor in both companies, they said. By early January, the deal was progressing with a March 21 deadline to announce the merger.

Messrs. Stead and Uggla said the deal was attractive because their customer bases don't overlap and it represents an opportunity to marry corporate and financial data. IHS serves more corporate customers and Markit provides data to Wall Street banks and asset managers.

 We use content in slightly different ways," Mr. Uggla said.

IHS provides analytics for businesses and governments in more than 140 countries. Founded in 1959, it went public in 2005 and has about 9,000 employees in 32 countries. The firm has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, pursuing a growth strategy by snapping up data providers and rival analytics firms.

It completed four deals in 2015 and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ihs-acquires-opis-for-650-million-1452512380"Oil Price Information Service .

IHS sponsors one of the most important global energy conferences every year, IHS CERAWeek and retains some of the industry's top authorities, including Daniel Yergin , the Pulitzer-Prize winning author and economic researcher. Mr. Uggla said IHS 's energy data was particularly valuable to Wall Street investors trying to size up debt and equity investment opportunities.

IHS and Markit posted a combined $3.3 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2015.

They also said they had identified cost savings of $125 million and revenue opportunities of $100 million by 2019.

What is IHS ?

IHS provides analytics for businesses and governments in more than 140 countries. Founded in 1959, it went public in 2005 and has about 9,000 employees in 32 countries. The firm has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, snapping up data providers and rival analytics firms. It divides its business into three segments:

* RESOURCES: IHS offers analysis on wells, pipeline miles, and regulatory and mineral rights documents, as well as data on oil and gas fields, basins, and power and industrial plants. Its information is used for capital expenditure, production, and capacity industry analysis and forecasts.

* TRANSPORTATION: Within the automotive sector, IHS offers data on original equipment manufacturers, parts suppliers and dealers. Specifically, it provides forecasts of sales and production for light vehicles, medium and heavy commercial vehicles, powertrain, components, and technology systems. As for maritime and trade, it provides data on nearly 200,000 ships, as well as monthly import and export statistics. Its aerospace, defense and security analytics offers specifications for military vehicles, naval vessels and aircraft types.

* MARKETS: IHS 's product-design services provide technical professionals with information to design products, complete engineering projects and address supply-chain challenges. Its offerings include analysis on engineering standards, codes, handbooks and other scientific and technical documents. IHS also offers data within its economics and country risk division to help professionals make decisions on capital investments, country-entry strategies, acquisitions, strategic planning processes, and production and sales forecasts.

Corporate tax inversions fell out of favor in 2014 after the U.S. Treasury Department instituted a series of rules that made it less profitable for companies to move overseas. The Obama administration portrayed companies leaving the U.S. as bad corporate citizens.

The government's move at that time managed to kill several deals, including a $50 billion-plus acquisition by U.S. pharmaceutical firm AbbVie Inc . of Irish drug company Shire PLC .

Still, tax-inversion deals have continued. More recently, the inversion issue has come up in the U.S. presidential election. Last week, presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-urges-treasury-to-set-tax-restrictions-on-inversion-deals-1458316802". He specifically called out Pfizer Inc .'s proposed merger with Allergan PLC . Candidate Hillary Clinton has criticized companies such as Johnson Controls Inc ., a Milwaukee-based auto-parts provider that is in the process of merging with Tyco International PLC that will see its legal domicile move to Ireland, which has a much lower corporate-tax rate.

One person involved in the deal said IHS and Markit don't expect the tax aspect of the deal to raise too many eyebrows in Washington.

The merger is almost one of equals, and the U.K. company's chief executive will lead the combined firm, ultimately, the person said. This suggests the deal is being pursued for strategic reasons and not simply to avoid paying U.S. taxes, the person said.

Moat Raises $50 Million to Help Develop Digital Ad Currency; Analytics  firm aims to take on Google by creating a new currency for buying and selling online ads, similar to Nielsen for TV ratings

The Web media analytics company Moat has raised $50 million in new funding as it looks to take on an ambitious goal. It plans to challenge Google, Nielsen, comScore and other digital media companies by developing a standard metric that would serve as the currency for buying and selling digital ads.

Founded in 2010, "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/05/21/moat-and-mediaocean-partner-to-help-marketers-buy-viewable-ads/"for being one of the leading companies that track viewability determining whether online ads can be seen by real people. But the 125-person company, which had previously raised over $17 million, aspires to do much more. According to co-founder and Chief Executive Jonah Goodhart, Moat is working on a new measurement designed to help Web advertisers and publishers gauge whether people pay attention to digital ads and are impacted by them.

The investment round was led by Insight Venture Partners.

The ultimate goal for Moat will be to have advertisers negotiate ad deals using this new metric, rather than relying on the long-standing practice of billing advertisers based on how many ads are delivered to a Web page by  ad serving" software.

Typically, ad serving data comes from Google the leading ad serving provider in the industry. That data is often used by media companies to track how many ads they deliver and to bill advertisers. In addition, advertisers often use tools from comScore and Nielsen to enhance ad serving data, such as tracking the demographic makeup of the audience that is exposed to an ad campaign.

But as more digital advertising moves away from standard banners on Web pages toward video and native ads on platforms like YouTube, Snapchat and Facebook, Moat sees an opportunity to displace Google and other metrics providers.

Mr. Goodhart said Moat is already well positioned to do this, since it has its own viewability tracking mechanisms plugged into "https://www.facebook.com/business/news/updated-features-for-video-ads""http://marketingland.com/youtube-opens-up-to-third-party-viewability-verification-150208"and Twitter. Plus, a major advertiser, Unilever, is already transacting ad deals using Moat data.

 Our ambition is to build the currency for digital advertising," he said, while emphasizing that Moat sees companies like "http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/solutions/capabilities/digital-ad-ratings.html"and Google as potential partners in this effort.

Moat has successfully pivoted before. The company first launched with the idea of building a crowdsourcing tool for online ad creative, which never took off. Over time, the Moat team built a "http://www.moat.com/"ads, then started selling access to advanced analytics to marketers.

In the past few years, as the "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/01/27/the-push-for-web-ad-viewability-proving-to-be-nightmare-for-publishers-early-on/" to start only buying ads that are viewable, Moat was in the right place at the right time and moved aggressively to build out viewability tracking tools for both desktops and mobile Web pages.

While he declined to discuss specific figures, Mr. Goodhart said that Moat has been profitable for the past two years and that revenue tripled from 2014 to 2015.

 The first thing I wrote down when we started this company five years ago was, we need to make brand advertising more effective online," said Mr. Goodhart. He and his Moat partners Noah Goodhart and Michael Walrath had previously partnered to create Right Media, an early digital ad exchange that was heavily used by direct-response advertisers. It was "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rightmedia-yahoo-idUSN3037037520070430".

With Moat, the plan was to cater more to the kinds of marketers who spent heavily on TV, like car, beer and toothpaste brands.  Most stuff is bought offline," he said.  We're trying to connect those dots. If you look at TV, it has a currency [with Nielsen data]. It may be flawed, but the point is, everyone is on the same page."

Surely, most every digital media company would like to see more TV ad budgets come their way. But getting everyone on the same page for a brand new currency won't be easy. Just getting viewability standards set across the industry has been challenging.

Peter Naylor, head of sales for Hulu, said he started working with Moat a few years ago when brands started pushing the viewability concept. That move led to more ad budgets coming Hulu's way, he said.

So he's impressed with Moat's technology and approach.  They are really in touch with the needs of both sides of the business," he said.  There is an opening there. But [ad] server counting is pretty foundationally sound in the industry."

Megan Pagliuca, global chief executive at Accuen, an agency that specializes in data-driven ad buying, said she's generally on board with Moat's philosophy.  I do think the industry needs to evolve beyond the metrics we have today," she said.  Ad serving data is clearly not enough."

But Ms. Pagliuca said it may be hard for any one company to solve all of the digital ad world's needs. For example, besides tracking whether ads are viewable or command attention, advertisers are looking for help in tracking people across different devices and different media vehicles, she said.

For now, Moat is focused on building out its technology aimed at developing this potential new ad currency, as well as hiring. The plan is to double staff this year, Mr. Goodhart said.  We think we are at an interesting crossroads in the industry," he said.  Where Marketers are saying,  if I can't measure it, I can't buy it.'"

Jefferies suffers 50% fall in revenues

Jefferies & Co foreshadowed a grim set of first-quarter results for the world s biggest investment banks on Tuesday, posting a 50 per cent collapse in net revenues and a  humbling  quarterly loss.

The firm s November year-end, and its trading and advisory focus, means that it has long served as a curtainraiser for the biggest banks on Wall Street, which report figures about a month later. So far, senior executives at banks such as Citigroup have prepared investors for a particularly gloomy period, noting big year-on-year falls in revenues from M&A and capital-raising and much weaker trading.

Jefferies, which is privately owned by Leucadia, said that its first quarter net revenues tumbled across the board, from capital markets (-28 per cent) to asset management (-20 per cent). But the carnage was most apparent in sales and trading, where revenues in fixed-income were down 55 per cent and in equities by more than 99 per cent.

That pushed the firm to a rare quarterly loss of $167m for the period between December and February, down from a profit of $12m a year earlier.

Rich Handler, the firm s chairman and chief executive officer, said that the results reflected  an exceptionally volatile and turbulent market environment  throughout January and the first few weeks of February.

 Almost every asset class 	. 	. 	. 	suffered significantly amid concerns about the pace of global economic growth, outflows from the high yield market, forced selling from hedge funds, uncertainty over China, a potential Brexit, and an overall void in liquidity,  he said.

The bleak first-quarter for the big banks is likely to highlight basic flaws in the investment banking model, where falls in revenues are not met with commensurate falls in expenses. Jefferies  net revenues for the period came to $299m, but it paid $350m in compensation and benefits.

George Kuznetsov, London-based head of research and analytics at Coalition, said that the first quarter for the big investment banks is traditionally strong, as renewed activity by clients normally shows  businesses in a much better light. 

 This quarter it has been exactly the opposite,  he said. Simultaneous slumps in revenues across debt, equity and advisory units suggests  there is no benefit at all in portfolio diversification. 

Jefferies said that its near-total collapse in equities revenues was attributable primarily to a $145m markdown related to two listed equity block positions, one of which was KCG Holdings, a market-maker and high-frequency trader it helped rescue in 2012. KCG, formerly known as Knight Capital Group, hit trouble after flooding the market with unintended trades, prompting a $400m sale of convertible shares in a deal arranged by Jefferies.

Mr Handler urged patience on Tuesday, saying that Jefferies had a  significant long-term opportunity  to gain market share as rivals refocus on retail and commercial banking.

Investment-banking and trading activities have looked brighter recently, Jefferies said, and a big improvement in results   including mark-ups of the KCG position   seemed likely in the current period ending in May.

 While we are early in the second quarter and one can never predict the future, it appears markets have not only stabilised but aggressively snapped back,  said Mr Handler.

 We are humbled by Jefferies' quarterly loss and will strive to deliver the better results that our shareholders deserve and Jefferies is more than capable of achieving,  he said.

High street innovator looks to gain ground in digital push; Interview: Ashok Vaswani

New head of Barclays UK plans to put lender's online offering at front of agenda

Voice recognition, 3D printers and robots serving bank customers evoke the image of a futuristic digital society.

For Barclays' Ashok Vaswani , this digital vision is becoming a reality, and is starting to ripple through the UK's banking sector.

Digital developments are at the fore of 55-year-old Mr Vaswani's agenda in his new role as chief executive of Barclays UK, one of two divisions recently created to drive the future of the banking group.

In its annual results this month, Barclays unveiled a radical restructure, basing the business on two core units comprising the "ringfenced" bank in Britain - Barclays UK - and corporate and international banking.

The move puts Mr Vaswani in charge of consumer and business banking, wealth management and the domestic credit cards business, Barclaycard UK.

"It's the first time we've brought the entire product set together," says Mr Vaswani in his first interview since the new banking structure was unveiled.

"Deepening our relationships is critical to our entire strategy."

Underpinning this goal is Mr Vaswani's focus on employing digital technology to "make customers' lives much easier".

He points out that the bank's "most digitally advanced product" is consumer lending. Barclays' instant lending via mobile, for example, preapproves customers using the bank's data to tailor loans which are then visible on mobile and obtained within six taps.

But Mr Vaswani is also keenly aware of increasing competition in this area and the need to keep costs in check. He sees digital as a way of "pushing through more volume."

While net income remains broadly flat at 8.7bn compared with 2013, just before the retail bank in its current guise was created, costs are coming down. The retail bank's cost/income ratio now sits at 60 per cent, down from 68 per cent in 2013.

Like other banks, Barclays is closing a number of branches within its 1,350-strong network, including three this month, as the number of customers visiting is in perpetual decline.

The bank now has 4.8m customers using mobile banking, who log on about 28 times a month on average, more than three years since the app was launched.

Investors believe the retail bank is a high-quality asset for the group and welcome the new combined UK division.

Rob James, an analyst at Old Mutual Global Investors, says: "It makes a high return - in common with most retail banks - at about 16 per cent, which means that it is capable of both paying a good dividend to the group and also growing its balance sheet when opportunities arise.

"When you put this business together with Barclaycard you have a real gem of a core business."

Barclays took another 1.45bn hit in the fourth quarter for past mis-selling of payment protection insurance , dragging the banking group into a loss in the final three months of the year.

Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, says the retail bank is "a decent, conservatively positioned business making adequate returns, but with weak growth". Unlike other high street banks, he says Barclays does not have a material number of existing mortgage customers paying higher rates, putting the bank under pressure in a low interest rate environment.

However, he believes Barclays is "generally well ahead of peers in terms of technological advance, and offering further scope for cost-efficiency improvement."

While Barclays has pioneered a number of innovative digital products such as "Pingit", its person-to-person mobile payments service, Mr Vaswani is alert to other banks developing superior digital capabilities.

"I'm paranoid . . . I look at big banks, I look at challenger banks. I look at everybody, to stay ahead of the game."

Royal Bank of Scotland revealed this month that it is launching artificial intelligence to interact with staff, to help them assist their small business customers. Mr Vaswani says Barclays is at present experimenting with the technology before launching any AI-based services for consumers.

Mr Vaswani also has grand plans for becoming the bank for entrepreneurs, and is hoping to launch a blueprint over the coming months. The bank is combining its wealth, entrepreneur and business banking customers together into one division - which it dubs "webb" - with a focus on serving high-growth companies.

The launch of Barclays' Eagle labs nationwide, which provides space within certain branches for businesses to use digital equipment from laser cutters to 3D printers, is aimed at helping local companies grow and to win new customers.

"Eagle labs are where we are going to unleash the potential that digital empowerment brings," Mr Vaswani says.

Citic's Swap Is a Step Forward

China's state-run enterprises may not always reform the way investors want them to. But, as an asset swap between two of China's largest such companies shows, they can still better each other's lives.

Citic, the country's oldest state-run conglomerate, said Monday that it would unload almost all of its residential property to China Overseas Land and Investment, one of the largest state property developers. COLI would pay $4.8 billion, not including the value of debt. In exchange, Citic receives a 10% stake in COLI, plus $950 million worth of commercial property.

On the whole, this deal is to Citic's advantage. Given the conglomerate's sprawl from iron ore to a soccer team, handing over property to a company whose sole job is to manage this asset class makes sense.

Citic, whose real-estate and infrastructure arm clocked an annualized 1.68% return on assets in the first half of 2015, was never the best manager. In contrast, COLI posts returns on assets above 8%, with returns on equity above 20%. For Citic to own shares in a company with high returns is a big improvement. The downside is that Citic isn't receiving cash, which it could have deployed wherever it wanted, especially in the services sector. The conglomerate previously said that it needs to "embrace" China's shift from heavy industry to consumption. Owning shares in a property developer doesn't exactly fit that billing.

Citic records an immediate book-value gain of up to $1.4 billion on selling the assets. But that only partially expiates the sins of some other investments. Last week, Citic said it would reduce the book value of its Australian iron-ore project by up to $1.7 billion thanks to falling commodity prices. It took a similar hit last year.

COLI looks like it is smartly boosting scale during a downturn. It is enlarging its land bank by 60%, putting it far above its rival China Vanke's, according to data from Standard & Poor's. It helps that most of the new land COLI is getting is in tier-one or tier-two cities, Morgan Stanley says, where demand is more stable.

As for the price tag of 1.6 times book value, this could be misleading. Chinese developers don't revalue their land banks unless they turn over assets, says Macquarie's David Ng. Citic hasn't been doing so, meaning the market value of this land is almost certainly higher, and that COLI isn't paying such a hefty premium.

Both COLI and Citic shares rallied on news of the deal. Citic, though, still trades a quarter below Citigroup's estimate of its net asset value. This gap will only materially narrow when Citic does more than swap assets and starts shedding troubled business lines.

China Vanke Goes Back to Its Roots With Defensive Bid

Takeover tussles are rare in China. And in an unusual defensive move, the world's largest real-estate developer may fend off its unwelcome suitor by returning to the embrace of its original state owner.

China Vanke said Sunday that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Shenzhen Metro to buy property assets fromthe subway operator, which is fully owned by the municipal government of this southern Chinese city. The deal size is around 40 billion to 60 billion yuan ($6.16 billion to $9.23 billion), mostly financed by issuing new shares. Vanke was founded by the Shenzhen government about three decades ago. The municipal government has since sold its entire stake.

The move is likely Vanke's attempt to unseat its largest shareholder, Baoneng Group, which owns 24% of the company after aggressively buying up Vanke's shares last year. Such hostile situations are unusual because Chinese companies generally have big controlling shareholders. But Vanke's senior management and staff only own around 5% of the company.

Vanke hasn't disclosed at what price the new shares will be issued. Using the price of its Hong Kong shares before the deal's announcement, Shenzhen Metro could get between 24% to 35% of the developer. State-controlled shareholders, including China Resources Group which is friendly to Vanke's management, would be left owning around 40% of the developer, assuming the potential deal is approved by regulators and shareholders.

Vanke's shares in Shenzhen make up the majority of the company's issued shares, but they have been haltedfrom trading since December, pending the announcement of an asset restructuring. The shares in Hong Kong continue to trade since each exchange has its own regulations.

Shenzhen Metro has around 4.5 million square meters in salable gross floor area in Shenzhen, arguably the hottest property market in China right now. The potential transaction would nearly triple Vanke's land bank in Shenzhen, according to Goldman Sachs.

Vanke's shareholders in Hong Kong already like the partnership, sending its shares up 10%Monday. The stock has fallen 20% since December as investors worry that Vanke may take extreme measures, like a "poison pill," to dilute Baoneng's shareholding. Vanke has yet to announce the pricing for the transaction, but Shenzhen Metro has some good assets. This could prove a good deal for both parties.

Vanke's chosen pill doesn't look that poisonous.

Qualcomm's

New iPhone

Chip Angst

Intel's mobile efforts have been long stymied by the fact that it has remained shut out of the most profitable smartphone on the market: the iPhone.

That may be changing. Rumors have circulated that Intel may grab market share from Qualcomm for the modem chip, or baseband processor, handling the iPhone's connections to wireless networks. Morgan Stanley, Cowen andCredit Suissethis week allnoted signs that production of a new Intel chip is gearing up ahead of the expected iPhone 7 launch in the fall.

Less clear is whether the smaller iPhone that Apple reportedly plans to unveil at a March 21 event also would make use of these chips. And it is worth noting that rumors of an Intel chip in the iPhone have circulated in regard to prior generations of the smartphone.

Qualcomm controls about 60% of the baseband market, according to Strategy Analytics. So it makes sense for a major buyer like Apple to seek out a second source on a key component. But analysts say Qualcomm is highly unlikely to lose the entire iPhone business, since its baseband chips still are superior to the competition.

Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein estimates that losing 30% of the Apple business would cut about 7% off Wall Street's consensus earnings projection for Qualcomm's 2017 fiscal year. But Wall Street already projects a 14% decline in Qualcomm'schipset revenuefor the current fiscal year. With the stock already down 28% over the past 12 months, Qualcomm investorsmay be pricing ineven bleaker prospects.

Overheard

To swap or not to swap, that is the question.

China's central bank is preparing new regulations that would make it easier for banks to convert theirbad loans into borrowers' equity. Such swaps are common for creditors to maximize the value of their soured loans, but China currently restricts banks from investing in nonfinancial companies. By giving the troubled companies breathing space on their debt, the lenders could eventually enjoy the upside from their revival.

Creditors of shipbuilder-turned-oil-explorer China Huarong Energy may be the first to try, having agreed to swap loans into equity last week. But its shipbuilding business may not turn around in the near future because of relentless oversupply. As for oil, China Huarong ventured into an oil field in Kyrgyzstan in 2014, right when prices began falling.

For Huarong's creditors, swapping into its shares is just prolonging the pain.

Chinese Group Bids for Starwood

Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. has received a $12.8 billion takeover offer from a group led by China's Anbang Insurance Group Co., threatening to upend a pending deal with Marriott International Inc.

Anbang's move is the latest by Chinese companies looking to snap up properties in the U.S., as they view high-quality real estate as a haven for savings.

The Anbang consortium is offering to pay $76 a share in cash for all shares outstanding of the company. That is a 7.9% premium to Starwood's closing stock price of $70.42 on Friday. Marriott's cash-and-stock deal is valued at $65.38 a share, or about $11 billion, based on Friday's closing price.

In announcing the new bid, Starwood said its board hadn't changed its recommendation in support of the merger with Marriott, but that it is permitted to talk with rival bidders until March 17.

Starwood didn't name members of the group that made the offer. Marriott identified Anbang as the leader of the rival consortium, while saying it was still committed to its deal for Starwood.

A representative from Anbang declined to comment. Starwood couldn't be reached for comment.

Marriott noted that if Starwood were to terminate the deal, it would owe Marriott a $400 million termination fee. Shareholders of each company are scheduled to vote on the deal on March 28.

Shares of Starwood rose 6.9% to $75.27 in late-morning trading in New York. Marriott shares rose 2% to $70.26.

The owner of the Westin and Sheraton brands among others, Starwood said it received the rival offer on March 10 and began discussions with the consortium a day later, after it received a waiver from Marriott allowing it to engage in discussions.

Chinese investment firm Primavera Capital Group and J.C. Flowers & Co. are also part of the group making the offer, people familiar with the matter said. The companies couldn't be reached for comment.

Marriott agreed to acquire Starwood in November. The deal would create the No. 1 hotel company globally -- with more than one million rooms -- and bring together 30 brands across all segments of the loding industry, from Starwood's higher-end W Hotels and St. Regis brands to Marriott's limited-service offerings like Courtyard by Marriott and its extended-stay chain Residence Inn.

Chinese buyers have pushed to buy U.S. hotel properties lately. Asian buyers in recent years have acquired New York's Plaza Hotel and Carlyle Hotel at prices that exceeded $1.4 million a room, according to hotel data tracker STR Analytics.

Anbang struck a deal in October 2014 to buy Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s flagship hotel, the historic Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, for $1.95 billion.

Anbang is also near a deal to buy Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc. from a Blackstone-managed real-estate fund, people familiar with the situation said. That deal would give Anbang a substantial presence in luxury hotels across the U.S. The price Anbang is paying couldn't be determined.

Once a provincial car insurer, Beijing-headquartered Anbang has leapt onto the global stage by making several high-profile deals. The company has spent billions purchasing part or all of insurers in South Korea, Europe and the U.S., as well as taking stakes in listed Chinese developers, a bank, a maker of traditional Chinese medicine and a wind-turbine manufacturer.

Primavera Capital Group is a China-based private-equity firm founded by Chinese deal maker Fred Hu, the former chairman for Greater China at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. A prominent investment banker and economist, Mr. Hu led Goldman's $2.9 billion deal to take a 5% stake in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. Mr. Hu has built ties with a range of China's most important financial figures.

Primavera was also an investor in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. before its initial public offering as part of a financing package raised to repurchase half of Yahoo Inc.'s stake in Alibaba. Mr. Hu's role in that deal and close relationship with Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma won Primavera a coveted investment in Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, China's most valuable Internet finance company, last year.

Chinese companies have done more than $84 billion in deals since the start of the year, according to Dealogic, setting them up to exceed the record $108 billion of Chinese outbound acquisitions reached last year. Fueling these takeovers are relatively loose regulations that allow insurers, funds, trust companies and others outside the formal banking sector to issue higher-yielding trust and other investment products.

Goldman Sachs has extended its push into the financial technology sector on Monday with the acquisition of Honest Dollar, a Texas-based startup that helps small businesses set up retirement saving plans for staff.

Honest Dollar is a web-based service that s tapping demand from the roughly 45m Americans who do not have access to employer-sponsored retirement plans. It s designed to make it easier for small and medium-sized companies, self-employed individuals and independent contractors to establish individual retirement account (IRA)-based savings plans, the bank said on Monday.

 Honest Dollar has created a simple solution to a complex retirement savings problem,  said Timothy J. O Neill and Eric S. Lane, executives at Goldman said.  Together, we have the potential to help millions of people achieve their investing goals. 

Honest Dollar claims on its website that employers can sign up as quickly as in 90 seconds while costs start as little as $8 per employee per month. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal marks Goldman s latest foray into fintech. The bank has invested in bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial, payment technology provider Bluefin Payment and data analytics startup Kensho.

THE MONDAY INTERVIEW
Mindful of mortality; Monday interview: Mark Bertolini, Aetna CEO

The unconventional boss of the US health insurer distrusts hospitals and business school 'poison', writes David Crow

When Mark Bertolini's son, Eric, was struck by a rare type of cancer at the age of 16, his doctors said to prepare for the worst. "Forty-seven people had been diagnosed with the disease before, all of them men between the ages of 16 and 34, and they were all dead," he recalls.

Mr Bertolini, now chief executive of Aetna, the third-largest US health insurer, refused to accept Eric's prognosis. He found an oncologist in Boston who was willing to try an experiment - a "bad" bone marrow transplant that would kill the cancerous cells.

The transplant wiped out the cancer but Eric's body rejected the bone marrow and he became extremely sick. "He went from 140lb to 80lb in a matter of months," says Mr Bertolini. "He was starving."

It was then that Mr Bertolini quit his job as an insurance executive at Cigna and moved into his son's hospital room to manage his care personally.

He downloaded a copy of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine , a bible for junior doctors, and started having fierce arguments with the medics, who thought he was in denial about his son's chances of survival.

By 2003, Eric had made a full recovery, in part because his father had convinced regulators to let him take an unapproved medicine. Today, Eric works at State Street, the asset manager.

Mr Bertolini returned to work with radically different views about the US healthcare system. "Lesson one was that they always viewed him as the lymphoma in room four, whereas I knew him from the delivery room when he was born," he says.

"Their view of him was as a disease not a person."

Eric's story is remarkable - not least because his father ended up giving him a kidney in 2007, following complications resulting from his cancer treatment.

The reality of dealing with health insurers in the US tends to be less uplifting, however. Aetna achieved only a middling ranking in JD Power's consumer satisfaction table in 2015. Customers tend to prefer not-for-profit health plans offered by rivals such as the Kaiser Foundation.

Mr Bertolini, however, believes his personal experience can be applied to his vast employer, which has a market capitalisation of $38bn and 23m health insurance customers.

He points to three changes he has made since taking the top job in 2010. Aetna now encourages people to travel to secure the best treatment, as Eric did. "People tend to want to be near home but when they travel for more than two hours to get specialised care, they have much higher survival rates," says Mr Bertolini; the insurer has dropped a requirement that patients cease curative treatment before being admitted to a hospice; and it is collecting anonymised genetic profiles of members to glean "big data" insights into which drugs work best for which patients.

His son's illness has informed Mr Bertolini's approach to running one of the larger US companies - which is poised to get even bigger with its pending $37bn acquisition of rival group, Humana - as has a horrific accident of his own.

In February 2004, a year to the day after his son was discharged, Mr Bertolini smashed into a tree while skiing in Vermont, breaking his neck and back, injuring his head and damaging nerves. When he regained consciousness a week later, he found that he was alive only because he had fallen headfirst into a freezing river, which acted like an ice-pack on his spinal cord.

His distrust of hospitals, which he says are "full of diseases", kicked in. He discharged himself as soon as he could, clutching "all sorts of narcotics", including the opioid painkillers that are handed out so liberally in the US.

Despite being sceptical about alternative treatments, he found relief in cranio-sacral therapy, which some doctors have dismissed as quackery. "I was a total doubter," he recalls.

"Somebody's going to hold on to my rear end and my head, and I'm going to feel better? Well, what the hell - I was all hopped up on drugs."

Three sessions in, he says he started to feel better; three months later he stopped taking the painkillers.

Unable to go on his daily run, Mr Bertolini turned to yoga, where he met his partner Mari, a yogi who trained in Chennai, India, in the 1980s. He quickly developed a passion for "the whole Hindu view of the world," and he has tried to put this into practice at Aetna, which offers yoga and mindfulness sessions to staff.

"Our chief medical officer said, 'this is voodoo don't you know'," says Mr Bertolini. "And I said, 'well let's do a study'." More than 13,000 Aetna employees have since had a 12-week stint of mindfulness or yoga, and Mr Bertolini says it has resulted in "a dramatic increase in productivity".

He eschews the management texts beloved by other chief executives and accuses American business schools of "poisoning the economic thinking of every businessman in the world", even though he has an MBA in finance from Cornell University. He also decries "these things called spreadsheets".

Instead, he turns to Hindu texts such as the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita for insights, as well as writings by Abraham Maslow, the late humanist psychologist, and Capital in the Twenty-First Century , the seminal book on income in-equality by French economist Thomas Piketty, published in 2013.

It was Mr Piketty's book that encouraged Mr Bertolini to implement a company-wide pay increase last year, which set a $16 an hour minimum for all Aetna employees, equivalent to a one-third pay rise for some of its lowest paid workers.

Mr Bertolini took home $15m in pay, bonus and long-term incentive award in 2014, the last year for which figures have been disclosed, on top of $31m in 2013.

Aetna has also improved its staff medical plan, which dramatically reduced the amount that low-paid employees had to contribute to their healthcare. "When I went out into the field to shake everybody's hands, I kept hearing the same thing: 'I can't afford the healthcare, I'm working two jobs, my family's on food stamps,'" he says.

Mr Bertolini says the stories reminded him of his childhood in Detroit, where his father worked in the auto industry and his mother was a part-time nurse.

"I too grew up in a family that didn't have health insurance at times, that was on government programmes for cheese and bread and milk," he recalls. "It wasn't a bad life, but today it's harder."

The Humana deal is expected to face tough scrutiny from antitrust authorities, amid claims that it will reduce competition and drive up costs.

Mr Bertolini thinks the opposite is the case, that Aetna's size and its assured profitability will give him the freedom to experiment.

"While I may be a little different as a CEO, in how I think about how to invest and play the game, I am very, very focused on making sure we deliver on our results," he says. "Because that's what gives us the ability to do the rest."

On his wrist, Mr Bertolini sports an expensive Swiss watch, a staple for many chief executives, and a nod to the conventional ways of big business. But he also wears two unusual black rings, one in the shape of a skull.

He tells colleagues it reminds him that "time is short".

ECB Wakes Up to Bank-Profit Nightmare

Mario Draghi is worried about eurozone bank profits after all.

The European Central Bank president said in January that it wasn't his job to protect banks and on Thursday insisted that loose policy had so far helped not hindered their profits. But the ECB's big policy moves contained special tricks designed to protect banks against the debilitating effects of negative interest rates.

Investors were initially confused: Bank shares rallied then fell back on Thursday. But bank stocks then rose sharply Friday, especially those of Southern European banks, as the implications became clear.

Negative rates are a nightmare for banks. They have to pay to leave money on deposit at the central bank and can end up paying to own government bonds. At the same time, banks can't pass negative rates to retail depositors either because they fear the money will leave, or in some countries because they aren't allowed to by law.

Bank stocks and bonds have been heavily sold by investors this year because of worries about the sector's profitability and the effects on dividends and coupon payments for some junior bonds.

Mr. Draghi acknowledged Thursday that the pain caused to banks over the longer term would put a limit on how far negative he could push interest rates. To protect banks and stop them from cutting back lending, the ECB launched more targeted lending operations, known as TLTRO II. These offer banks more than 700 billion euros ($780 billion) of fresh four-year funding, according to Barclays, to back their loans to companies and consumers, but not mortgages.

At most this will cost banks nothing. But if they have grown lending by 2.5% by the end of January 2018, the interest rate they pay could drop to the ECB's deposit rate at the time the funding was taken. That was cut to minus 0.4% on Thursday.

This funding is a cheap option to replace banks' maturing bonds with more than 500 billion euros due for repayment in the next two years, according to Standard & Poor's, as well to refinance existing ECB money. The lower costs would add a net 3 billion euros, or up to 2.5%, to annual earnings, according to Deutsche Bank.

Mr. Draghi closed his news conference Thursday with a very deliberate reference to a private European Commission paper on ways to ease costs on an important element of bank capital. The commission isn't releasing the paper, but one of its aims is to suggest more leeway for banks to avoid skipping coupon payments on junior debt known as additional tier-one capital.

Fears about missed coupons were behind the selloff in these junior bonds this year, which infected share prices and senior bonds, too.

These moves are having the desired effect in the markets. Two indexes that measure the riskiness of senior and subordinated European bank bonds dropped sharply. The ECB won't solve the bank profitability problem like this, but at least it is trying to stop making it worse.

The New Test of Success for the European Central Bank

Time to switch focus. Until now, the euro's exchange rate has been closely tracked as an indicator of the effectiveness of the European Central Bank's stimulus programs. Now eurozone corporate bonds are the crucial barometer investors need to watch.

Thursday's decision to add corporate bonds to the ECB's purchase programs marks a shift in President Mario Draghi's strategy. Previously, much of the focus was on lowering the government-bond yield curve, which had the side effect of delivering a weaker euro both to help growth via exports but also boost inflation via higher import prices. Now credit markets have joined the party, which means corporate-bond spreads -- the gap between yields on company debt and underlying government bonds -- are of vital importance.

This is new territory for the ECB. The Bank of England briefly engaged in corporate-bond purchases in early 2009, but total holdings only reached GBP 1.6 billion ($2.3 billion) and the focus swiftly shifted to buying gilts in huge quantities. The ECB is also buying at a different stage in the cycle: The BOE moved when financial markets were truly in disarray and corporate-bond yields were very high. Now the credit cycle is already fairly advanced, although less so in Europe than in the U.S.

Many questions remain about how the ECB will go about its corporate-bond purchases. It is unclear how much of the extra 20 billion euros ($22.3 billion) a month of central-bank cash announced Thursday will go into credit markets. The potential universe of eligible company debt remains to be determined too, although strategists peg it at roughly 500 billion euros.

But there is already some evidence of the power of ECB buying. Some Italian utilities, such as Enel and Terna, got onto the ECB's shopping list last year, and their bonds have sharply outperformed the wider market since then, Bank of America Merrill Lynch notes.

There are pitfalls too. The success of the program will ultimately depend on companies' appetite for investment. And the ECB's largess in lowering the overall cost of borrowing in Europe has led toa rush of euro-denominated bond issuance by U.S. companies. Last year, they accounted for nearly one-quarter of issuance and so far this year for a third, Societe Generale notes. Some of the ECB's efforts may just contribute to more debt building up on U.S. investment-grade balance sheets.

The spread on BAML's European corporate-bond index has already narrowed to 1.43 percentage points from a February peak of 1.63 points. The cost of insuring European company debt against default has fallen very sharply since the ECB decision was announced; cash bonds are slower to move, but there is substantial room for a rally from here.

How far it goes, and how much it stirs the animal spirits of company executives, will determine how effective the ECB's latest gambit proves to be.

Mark Bertolini, Aetna CEO: mindful of mortality

When Mark Bertolini s son, Eric, was struck by a rare type of cancer at the age of 16, his doctors said to prepare for the worst.  Forty-seven people had been diagnosed with the disease before, all of them men between the ages of 16 and 34, and they were all dead,  he recalls.

Mr Bertolini, now chief executive of Aetna, the third-largest US health insurer, refused to accept Eric s prognosis. He found an oncologist in Boston who was willing to try an experiment   a  bad  bone marrow transplant that would kill the cancerous cells.

The transplant wiped out the cancer but Eric s body rejected the bone marrow and he became extremely sick.  He went from 140lb to 80lb in a matter of months,  says Mr Bertolini.  He was starving. 

It was then that Mr Bertolini quit his job as an insurance executive at Cigna and moved into his son s hospital room to manage his care personally.

He downloaded a copy of Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine, a bible for junior doctors, and started having fierce arguments with the medics, who thought he was in denial about his son s chances of survival.

By 2003, Eric had made a full recovery, in part because his father had convinced regulators to let him take an unapproved medicine. Today, Eric works at State Street, the asset manager.

Mr Bertolini returned to work with radically different views about the US healthcare system.  Lesson one was that they always viewed him as the lymphoma in room four, whereas I knew him from the delivery room when he was born,  he says.  Their view of him was as a disease, not a person. 

Eric s personal story is remarkable   not least because his father ended up giving him a kidney in 2007, following complications resulting from his cancer treatment.

The reality of dealing with health insurers in the US tends to be less uplifting, however. Aetna achieved only a middling ranking in JD Power s annual consumer satisfaction table in 2015. Customers tend to prefer not-for-profit health plans offered by rivals such as the Kaiser Foundation.

Mr Bertolini, however, believes his personal experience can be applied to his vast employer, which has a market capitalisation of $38bn and 23m health insurance customers.

He points to three changes he has made since taking the top job in 2010. Aetna now encourages people to travel to secure the best treatment, as Eric did.  People tend to want to be near home but when they travel for more than two hours to get specialised care, they have much higher survival rates,  says Mr Bertolini; the insurer has dropped a requirement that patients cease curative treatment before being admitted to a hospice, and it is collecting anonymised genetic profiles of members to glean  big data  insights into which drugs work best for which patients.

His son s illness has informed Mr Bertolini s unconventional approach to running one of the larger US companies   which is poised to get even bigger with its pending $37bn acquisition of rival group, Humana   as has a horrific accident of his own.

In February 2004, a year to the day after his son was discharged, Mr Bertolini smashed into a tree while skiing in Vermont, breaking his neck and back, injuring his head and damaging nerves. When he regained consciousness a week later, he found that he was alive only because he had fallen headfirst into a freezing river, which acted like an ice-pack on his spinal cord.

His distrust of hospitals, which he says are  full of diseases , kicked in. He discharged himself as soon as he could, clutching  all sorts of narcotics , including the opioid painkillers that are handed out so liberally in the US.

Despite being sceptical about alternative treatments, he found relief in craniosacral therapy, which some doctors have dismissed as quackery.  I was a total doubter,  he recalls.

 Somebody s going to hold on to my rear end and my head, and I m going to feel better? Well, what the hell   I was all hopped up on drugs. 

Three sessions in, he says he started to feel better; three months later he stopped taking painkillers.

Unable to go on his daily run, Mr Bertolini turned to yoga, where he met his partner Mari, a yogi who trained in Chennai, India, in the 1980s. He quickly developed a passion for  the whole Hindu view of the world,  and he has tried to put this into practice at Aetna, which offers yoga and mindfulness sessions to staff.

 Our chief medical officer said,  this is voodoo, don t you know ,  says Mr Bertolini.  And I said,  well let s do a study .  More than 13,000 Aetna employees have since had a 12-week stint of mindfulness or yoga, and Mr Bertolini says it has resulted in  a dramatic increase in productivity .

He eschews the management texts beloved by other chief executives and accuses American business schools of  poisoning the economic thinking of every businessman in the world , even though he has an MBA in finance from Cornell University. He also decries  these things called spreadsheets .

Instead, he turns to Hindu texts such as the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita for insights, as well as writings by Abraham Maslow, the late humanist psychologist, and Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the seminal book on income inequality by French economist Thomas Piketty, published in 2013.

It was Mr Piketty s book that encouraged Mr Bertolini to implement a company-wide pay increase last year, which set a $16 an hour minimum for all Aetna employees, equivalent to a one-third pay rise for some of its lowest-paid workers.

Mr Bertolini took home $15m in pay, bonus and long-term incentive award in 2014, the last year for which figures have been disclosed, on top of $31m in 2013.

Aetna has also improved its staff medical plan, which dramatically reduced the amount that low-paid employees had to contribute to their healthcare.  When I went out into the field to shake everybody s hands, I kept hearing the same thing:  I can t afford the healthcare, I m working two jobs, my family s on food stamps,   he says.

Mr Bertolini says the stories reminded him of his childhood in Detroit, where his father worked in the auto industry and his mother was a part-time nurse.

 I too grew up in a family that didn t have health insurance at times, that was on government programmes for cheese and bread and milk,  he recalls.  It wasn t a bad life, but today it s harder. 

The Humana deal is expected to face tough scrutiny from antitrust authorities amid claims that it will reduce competition and drive up costs.

Mr Bertolini thinks the opposite is the case, that Aetna s size and its assured profitability will give him the freedom to experiment.

 While I may be a little different as a CEO, in how I think about how to invest and play the game, I am very, very focused on making sure we deliver on our results,  he says.  Because that s what gives us the ability to do the rest. 

On his wrist, Mr Bertolini sports an expensive Swiss watch, a staple for many chief executives, and a nod to the conventional ways of big business, but he also wears two unusual black rings, one in the shape of a skull.

He tells colleagues it reminds him that  time is short .

Tech
Intel Considers Sale of Some Venture Capital Assets to Refocus Resources; Sale would allow company to focus on startups in key technology, geographic areas

SANTA CLARA Intel Capital is exploring the sale of part of its venture capital portfolio to focus on the areas that are most strategic to Intel, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The sale, which may not occur, comes from a shift in strategy initiated by Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, who was named to the post in May 2013 when former CEO Paul Otellini retired, the person said.

News of a potential sale was first reported by Bloomberg.

Under Mr. Otellini, Intel Capital was one of the most active venture investors in the world, investing globally in a variety of areas to expand the market for PCs running Intel chips. Since 1991, Intel Capital has invested more than $11.64 billion in 1,440 companies in 57 countries.

Now, however, Intel's challenges are different than they were even three years ago when Mr. Krzanich took over. Mobile devices are overtaking PCs, and cloud computing, security, enterprise software, data centers and the Internet of Things are becoming increasingly important technologies.

A sale could give Intel Capital more resources to focus on startups in those key technology areas and on geographies like the U.S. and China that are especially important to Intel, the person said, although the assets being considered, which could add up to a $1 billion, are a small portion of Intel's total portfolio.

In 2014, for instance, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304157204579473400192410782" in Cloudera Inc., which at the time was marketing a rival version of the big data software Hadoop. Intel set its own version of Hadoop aside. In 2015, Intel led a $100 million investment in Mirantis Inc., which sells subscriptions to the open-source cloud software OpenStack.

Intel has been considering the potential sale since at least the middle of last year, hiring UBS AG to explore a sale of some assets in India, the person said.

But nothing happened because Intel Capital was preparing for a leadership change, with former Intel Capital President Arvind Sodhani getting ready to retire and current Intel Capital President Wendell Brooks getting ready to take over, and the potential sale was viewed as a distraction.

Intel declined to comment on the moves. In a blog post in February, Mr. Brooks said Intel Capital would continue to invest $300 million to $500 million a year in startups  across the full spectrum of technologies where Intel excels."

Shares of Intel climbed after the news, closing at $31.76, up 51 cents.

Markets
What Crisis? Big Ratings Firms Stronger Than Ever; S&P, Moody s and Fitch issue more than 95% of global bond ratings, and profits are nearing all-time highs

The three big ratings firms that played a central role in the last financial crisis never got a downgrade of their own.

Investors still overwhelmingly rely on Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings when deciding whether to buy bonds. The three issue more than 95% of global bond ratings, a total virtually unchanged from the pre-2008 period.

Profits also are nearing all-time highs as they ride a recent wave of debt sales and push into new lines of business.

The resilience of the industry's largest players was on display again this week as Moody's, a unit of Moody's Corp., "http://www.wsj.com/articles/moodys-to-pay-calpers-130-million-to-settle-lawsuit-1457554312" with a California pension fund. The pact resolved one of the industry's last remaining major crisis-related legal headaches and brought the total of fines and settlements to $1.9 billion, a fraction of the amount paid by U.S. banks for missteps during the same period.

 The credit-rating agencies got away so easy, given what they did," said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonpartisan coalition in favor of stronger Wall Street regulation.  The happy days are here again. There's not really been an interruption of the profit flow."

The fallout from the financial crisis was supposed to crimp the credit-ratings model. Firms awarded rosy ratings to residential mortgage bonds that later soured, triggering widespread losses.

Lawmakers and regulators called for a major shake-up of the way the firms made their money. But seven years later, the industry's business blueprint in which banks and debt issuers still pay ratings firms to have their deals graded remains in place despite concerns about its potential conflicts.

 Things remain 80% as dangerous as they were in 2007 and 2008," said U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.), who proposed in 2009 that an independent board assign deals to ratings firms. A proposal was inserted into the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul bill but never implemented.

 The notion that nothing has changed in this industry is pure fiction," said Daniel Noonan, a spokesman for Fitch, jointly owned by Fimalac SA and Hearst Corp.

A spokesman for S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc., said the firm in recent years has enhanced ratings methodology, revised analytics and created a new global committee to identify and monitor risks. Moody's declined to comment.

There were multiple efforts by upstarts to challenge the big three firms, but all fell flat. One, Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc., tried unsuccessfully to persuade investors to pay for the ratings before eventually switching back to the old model used by its larger rivals.

Other attempts sputtered out before they could get going. Chinese firm Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. had its application denied in 2010 over disagreements about how it would be vetted. No new ratings firm has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission since HR Ratings de Mexico SA of Mexico City did in 2012.

 Systemic change is not happening," said James H. Gellert, chief executive of Rapid Ratings International Inc., a firm that gets paid by investors, not debt issuers.

Ratings firms said they have addressed concerns that emerged in the wake of the crisis by beefing up compliance and risk departments charged with making sure business interests don't sway bond grades. They also have new oversight from an SEC division created to police the industry.

All three are less reliant on ratings revenue after expanding their businesses into the collection of broader financial data.

The mortgage-backed bond that helped fuel the housing-market collapse also represents a smaller portion of overall revenue. In the run-up to the crisis, ratings firms pocketed about half of their revenue grading deals involving securitized mortgages or other bonds. Now, that total is closer to 10%.

But the ratings firms are now so large, some observers said, that their removal would cause significant damage to the financial markets. Investors use ratings when buying fixed-income securities.

 They're a necessity," said Philip Hilder, a Houston-based lawyer and a former federal prosecutor.  They are a part of the market. It's not feasible or imaginable to dismantle them or destroy their reputation. You couldn't just give them a fatal blow."

Moody's isn't out of the clear. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/moodys-acknowledges-currency-headwinds-as-profit-rises-14-1423225316" and the Justice Department are scrutinizing the firm's behavior before the crisis, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investigation is similar in scope to one that resulted in the more than $1.3 billion penalty paid by S&P last year.

Both probes center on whether the firms issued inflated ratings that misrepresented the risks of mortgage-related deals. Under its 2015 settlement with the Justice Department, S&P admitted that it kept issuing positive ratings even though it recognized problems with the securities.

There are other signs that scrutiny of the ratings firms is more aggressive now. In January 2015, the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/s-p-sec-two-states-agree-to-roughly-80-million-settlement-1421851682" to win business and mislead investors long after 2008. Andrew Ceresney, the SEC enforcement director, said the regulator's findings at S&P  reflect a deep cultural failure at S&P and a failure to learn the lessons of the financial crisis."

S&P didn't admit or deny wrongdoing, paying a $77 million settlement. It said at the time that it was pleased to have concluded the federal and state probes and  takes compliance with regulatory obligations very seriously."

The industry  may be better at the margins, but it is still fundamentally structurally flawed," said Phil Angelides, former California state treasurer who led the bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which included a case study of Moody's in its 2011 report.  It's a simple fact."

Economy
ECB Ramps Up Stimulus But Disappoints Markets; Markets  enthusiasm fades after Mario Draghi signals that interest rates probably won t fall any lower

"http://www.wsj.com/pro/centralbanking/graphics/what-ecb-qe-stimulus-has-done/"

FRANKFURT The European Central Bank fired off a salvo of measures aimed at bolstering the eurozone's fragile economy but markets brushed off the efforts, raising questions about whether it and other central banks still have the tools to bolster weakening growth and inflation after years of easy-money policies.

Across the advanced world central banks are under pressure to launch fresh monetary stimulus or keep interest rates low in response to volatile financial markets, falling oil prices and a slowdown in emerging markets.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-introduces-negative-interest-rates-1454040311"in January by setting the country's first negative interest rates in an attempt to jolt the economy away from deflation. Federal Reserve officials are "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-almost-certain-to-keep-interest-rates-unchanged-at-next-meeting-1452882343" at their policy meeting next week and leave open-ended as to when they will next raise rates.

Financial "http://www.wsj.com/articles/euro-weakens-european-stocks-rise-on-ecb-stimulus-measures-1457616212"in response to the ECB's larger-than-expected stimulus on Thursday, which included a series of rate cuts, additional bond purchases and ultracheap loans for banks. But investors' initial enthusiasm over the stimulus measures faded when, afterward, ECB President Mario Draghi signaled that interest rates probably wouldn't fall any lower amid concerns about the impact on Europe's fragile banks.

 They gave the market a gift and then took it away within an hour," Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management, said.

It was the second time in three months the ECB ramped up its stimulus in an effort to bolster the eurozone's persistently weak inflation and the second time markets appeared unimpressed.

The euro seesawed, falling as low as $1.082 in response to the new stimulus before recovering during the ECB's news conference and spiking toward $1.12. European stocks ended sharply lower, headlined by a 2% slide in Germany's benchmark DAX. An initial government-bond rally in Spain, Portugal and Italy fizzled. Even in the U.S., markets reacted negatively.

The ECB's latest move  will probably simply continue to benefit primarily the financial markets but do little to alter low growth and low [underlying] inflation," said Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank.

The fresh measures included cuts to all three of the ECB's main interest rates,  ¬20 billion a month of"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-announces-stimulus-plan-1421931011"atop the ECB's current  ¬60 billion ($67 billion) program, and an expansion of its quantitative easing program to highly rated corporate bonds all more aggressive steps than analysts had anticipated. The central bank also announced a series of ultracheap four-year loans to banks, some of which could be paid to borrow from the ECB.

Early on, investors cheered the array of moves.  This has all the hallmarks of the ECB having thrown the kitchen sink at the problem," said Aberdeen Asset Management Investment Manager Patrick O'Donnell.

At a news conference, Mr. Draghi said the stimulus was a response to  significantly changed" conditions in the global economy and financial markets since the ECB's policy meeting in December. At that meeting, the ECB disappointed investors with a smaller-than-expected package of measures that included a 0.1 percentage-point cut to its deposit rate and a six-month extension of its bond purchases.

The fresh stimulus was partly a response to new quarterly economic forecasts, published by the ECB on Thursday, which showed growth and inflation likely falling sharply below the central bank's December projections. It now expects an inflation rate of just 0.1% this year, down from 1% projected in December and far below its target of near 2%.

The ECB has missed its inflation objective for three straight years despite launching its massive bond-purchase program a year ago. The Bank for International Settlements, a central bank for central banks, warned on Sunday that central-bank stimulus may have less traction in financial markets than it once had.

And of course, "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/03/10/ecb-expected-to-expand-stimulus-live/" of the policy statement and news conference, and keep track of the ECB's "http://www.wsj.com/pro/centralbanking/graphics/ecb-scorecard/".

Mr. Draghi brushed off those concerns.  We have shown that we are not short of ammunition," he said.

Undermining that claim, though, Mr. Draghi said the ECB didn't currently anticipate cutting rates any further out of concerns about the impact on banks. Subzero rates act as a tax on banks because they can't easily pass on the costs to customers.

 Does it mean that &we can go as negative as we want without any consequences on the banking system? The answer is no," he said. Those comments helped send the euro soaring against the dollar, and stock and bond markets sprawling.

 Markets seem unsure what to make of the ECB's action, as many may believe that the bank has reached the limits of central-bank policy-making and will run out of ammunition in the future," said Barbara Teixeira Araujo, an economist at Moody's Analytics.

Even if the ECB rejects further rate cuts, Mr. Draghi still has a number of bullets left. The ECB could accelerate its bond purchases further, or extend their likely end-date beyond March 2017, moves that some economists expect later this year. To step up the bond-buying even more, Mr. Draghi could change the program's design by skewing toward the bonds of highly-indebted governments such as Italy, or lifting bond-issue and issuer limits, currently at 33% for most bonds. He could also expand into other assets such as bank debt, or even stocks and real estate.

The ECB decided not to introduce a multi-tier system for its deposit rate, which would impose the highest charges on only a portion of banks reserves, as practiced by central banks in Japan and Switzerland.

Such a system could allow rates to fall even further below zero, but Mr. Draghi said the ECB had decided against it  exactly for the purpose of not signaling that we can go as low as we want." He said its emphasis would shift away from interest rates and toward other policy tools, such as bond purchases.

In that vein, the ECB said it would accelerate its monthly bond purchases to  ¬80 billion from  ¬60 billion, which adds  ¬240 billion to the overall program, and start buying highly-rated corporate bonds in an effort to avoid bottlenecks. It also rolled out a series of four-year loans for banks, whose interest rate can range from zero to minus 0.4%, meaning that the ECB will pay some banks to borrow money if they meet criteria on net lending to the economy.

The loans are designed to help  further ease credit conditions and stimulate credit creation," and will help eurozone banks deal with  sizable upcoming funding needs," Mr. Draghi said.

Nick Kounis, an economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, estimated that the takeup from banks could be up to  ¬1.25 trillion. Mr. Draghi said he expected  very sizable" demand.

The ECB also reiterated its guidance, saying that interest rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period. Mr. Draghi stressed that while it might take longer than expected to reach its objective,  this doesn't mean we have deflation." He said the ECB's actions in recent years had helped avert  disastrous deflation."

But economists said that given the sharp deterioration in the outlook, the ECB may have to announce fresh stimulus soon.  We suspect that the ECB's work is still not done," said Jonathan Loynes, an economist at Capital Economics in London.

Good news - fintech could disrupt finance

Information technology has disrupted the entertainment, media and retail businesses and, most recently, the supply of hotel rooms and taxis. Is it going to do the same to finance? My first response is: please. My second response is: yes. As Bill Gates has said, "We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction." This advice applies to people in the business itself, but also to policymakers.

Finance is an information business. Indeed it already spends a higher share of its revenues on information technology than any other. It seems ripe for disruption by information technologies. Consider its three essential functions: payment; intermediation between savings and investment; and insurance. All these activities are informationintensive. People need to know accounts have been settled. They need to understand how their wealth is being employed and to know that their risks are covered. Not least, the intermediaries need to understand what they are doing.

Today, banks and insurance companies are the core financial institutions. Banks manage payments systems, create most of the economy's money, are responsible for a large proportion of financial intermediation, are creators of financial instruments and act as market-makers and agents. Similarly, insurance companies play the central role in assessing and managing risks.

Why might one hope that new financial technology, or " Fintech " as it is known, will transform these businesses? The answer, especially for banking, is that they are currently not done very well. Banking seems inefficient, costly, riddled with conflicts of interest, prone to unethical behaviour, and, not least, able to generate huge crises.

In a recent speech on the possibilities for a financial revolution, Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England notes that, astonishingly, the unit cost of US financial intermediation seems to be unchanged over a century (see chart). Moreover, income from finance simply rises and falls with the value of assets. That suggests a huge amount of rentextraction. Additionally, 10m US households and 1.5m UK adults still have no bank accounts. Worldwide, banks generate a staggering $1.7tn in revenue, 40 per cent of the total, from the job of making payments. In the computer age, settlement can still take hours or days.

On behaviour, as John Kay has written, "parts of the financial sector today . . . demonstrate the lowest ethical standards of any legal industry". The payment of vast fines seems to be viewed as just a cost of doing business. Finally, the post-2007 banking crises were as big as any in the past. That their economic impact was not still worse than earlier was due to the willingness of governments to bail banks out.

New technology might help change this in at least two ways. First, it might transform payments. One possibility is real-time settlement via distributed ledgers. The advantages of instantaneous settlement are evident. The advantage of distributed ledgers, an element in bitcoin's "blockchain" technology, is an improvement in the robustness of record-keeping. Instead of centralised accounts, the database would be shared across a network of sites, all of which would hold an identical copy. Such technologies might revolutionise domestic and foreign payments. Many businesses are already pursuing this possibility.

A second transformation might be via peer-to-peer lending, in which new platforms disintermediate the traditional businesses in matching savers with investments. Such lending is growing rapidly (see chart). The theory here is that computerised information might allow savers to dispense with the (costly) services of bankers altogether.

Optimists imagine a future in which payments, the creation of money (unquestionably liquid and safe assets), and intermediation would be separated. In this case, the capacity of the banking sector to create havoc would be reduced and so would the perils created by the state's backstop to private institutions. It is, however, far too early to be confident of such benefits. Indeed it is easy to see that new record-keeping and payments systems would create huge security issues. Similarly, opportunities for malfeasance also exist on peer-to-peer platforms. Indeed, these are inevitable with transactions that rest on promises against an inherently uncertain future.

A further potential source of transformation is via "big data". That might transform the quality of lending, for example, which would be a good thing. But the most striking effects are likely to be in insurance. With new monitoring devices, insurers might gain direct knowledge of the quality of driving or of the state of their clients' health. Such information might be used to motivate improvements in behaviour. But it is also possible to imagine improvements in information so profound that risk pools - the basic building blocks of insurance - disappear. If, for example, the insurer knew with a high level of certainty that some customers would get a given disease, that person might become uninsurable. In insurance, some ignorance is bliss. At the least, the way in which knowledge is obtained and used could create huge social questions.

On balance, the opportunities afforded by the application of information technologies to our financial system seem large. The difficulty might rather be to ensure that the benefits accrue this time to the public rather than to a small number of incumbents or even to their more dynamic replacements. Finance, particularly banking, does need a revolution. But this is one area where policymakers cannot just assume things will work out well. It is because finance is so important that a revolution is needed. But for that very reason the revolution also requires careful watching.

The Property Report: Investors Target Students in U.K.

International investors are piling into U.K. student housing, with a flurry of deals showing renewed interest in this small corner of the property market.

Greystar Real Estate Partners of the U.S. has agreed to buy a student-housing portfolio for about GBP 600 million ($856 million) from U.K. private-equity group Round Hill Capital LLC, a person familiar with the deal said.

Last week, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board spent GBP 1.1 billion to acquire the U.K.'s Liberty Living, while a company headed by Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman paid GBP 532 million for another London student-housing portfolio.

Yields on office buildings and other traditional property types have fallen as investors flush with cash and able to borrow at low rates have pushed prices higher. That has some investors looking elsewhere for higher returns.

Traditionally, real-estate investing "has been focused around the main commercial property types of retail, office, and industrial," a February report from the Investment Property Forum, a U.K. industry body, said.

But investors' hunt for higher long-term returns is producing "significant changes in the market," said Jon Neale, head of U.K. research at broker JLL. The fastest-growing sectors are now those deemed "alternatives" -- like student-housing, hotels, health care and privately rented residential real estate -- GBP 11.6 billion of which traded in 2014, a 33% increase from 2013, JLL figures show.

It remains a small part of the GBP 65 billion of U.K. real estate traded last year, but alternatives "accounted for only a few percentage points of volumes just a few years ago," Mr. Neale said.

For U.K. student accommodation, the average investment yield has been 5.8% this year, compared with 5.1% on offices, according to Real Capital Analytics data.

The yield on student housing is down from 6.4% last year, a reflection of rising prices.

There were about $2.4 billion of student housing transactions in the U.K. in 2014, down 18% from 2013, according to Real Capital Analytics. U.S. firms Greystar, LaSalle Investment and Goldman Sachs have been among the biggest buyers in the last two years, the data show.

Last Friday, the Canadian Pension Plan bought 16,700 student rooms in more than 40 residences across 17 cities -- as well as the company that manages the business -- from the Brandeaux Student Accommodation Fund.

This was the Canadian investor's largest-ever real-estate deal in Europe, and its first there in the alternative space, said Andrea Orlandi, head of European real-estate investments.

For CPP, student accommodation provides "a noticeable pickup in the yield" offered by office investments, Mr. Orlandi said.

The opportunity to buy the management company and its team means, "we can look to buy more assets" in a sector "that can, and will, consolidate in the future," he said.

In the Greystar deal Monday, Round Hill is selling three London residences with 2,375 beds, a portfolio it bought for $415 million from Blackstone Group in 2012. Round Hill will retain the student-housing brand Nido, its management business and one student residence in London it bought earlier this year.

Going for the Revitalization Gold Around London s Olympic Park; Stratford, the district that hosted the 2012 Olympic games, attracts investments for long-term renewal strategy

Real-estate investors are betting London is on track to deliver a rare feat: the lasting revitalization of neighborhoods around an Olympic park, years after the games ended.

In many cities over the years, the closing ceremonies have coincided with a slowdown of economic growth in the districts where the games took place.

Venues from the 2004 games in Athens have been abandoned, while many Olympic sites from the 2008 games in Beijing are in disrepair. Relics from the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics have been destroyed or abandoned. The 1976 Montreal Olympics nearly drove the city to financial ruin.

London, by contrast, seems poised for growth. In Stratford, the district that hosted the 2012 Olympics, German lender Deutsche Bank AG and U.K. asset manager Legal & General in January spent a total of 616 million ($878.7 million) in two separate deals on office buildings currently under construction.

The Property Report

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mall-reits-are-on-many-investors-shopping-lists-1457456123"

Before the Olympics, Stratford and other parts of London's East End were among the poorest areas of the U.K., suffering a long-term decline from its industrial past. But years of booming real-estate markets in London, government and private investment in Stratford, and improving transportation have supported Olympic planners' long-term renewal strategy.

 What's happening in Stratford is very much in its infancy," but development plans are  significant," said Gordon Aitchison, director of transactions at Legal & General Property, the property arm of Legal & General.  It's a transformation of the entire area."

Office buildings are a big component. The asset-management arm of Deutsche Bank paid 370 million for a 515,000-square-foot office building scheduled for completion in 2018. The Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. financial watchdog, has already committed to a 20-year lease for around 3,800 of its employees.

Legal & General, meanwhile, bought a 265,000-square-foot office building for 246 million that, when completed next year, will be occupied by Transport for London, which runs the city's public transport network. The building is pre-let for 25 years.

The buildings are part of the International Quarter, a joint venture between Australian property firm Lendlease Group and London & Continental Railways, which manages property assets for the U.K. Department of Transportation. About one-fifth of the four million square feet of planned International Quarter office space is now sold. Lendlease expects to finish development of nine other office buildings by around 2025.

The Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, is in talks to open its first space outside the U.S. in Stratford. Other London cultural institutions, such as the Victoria and Albert Museum and University College London, are set to take up new spaces there.

And the Olympic facilities continue to draw crowds. The aquatic center where Michael Phelps won four gold medals offers swimming lessons to 1,500 children each week. The Olympic Stadium hosted Rugby World Cup games last autumn. The band AC/DC is performing there in June.

In the 1800s, industrialization turned London's East End from farmland into a busy manufacturing hub with a reputation for slums and crime. Trade along the River Lea served the growing manufacturing base. But the industrial area was devastated by heavy bombing during World War II. Areas of East London remain some of the poorest in Britain.

Regeneration was a major part of London's original Olympic bid, said David Goldstone, chief executive at the London Legacy Development Corp. Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London from 2000 to 2008,  wasn't interested in sport. He was interested in regenerating an area of massive deprivation," Mr. Goldstone said.

 I remember talking to the Sydney organizers" about the games it hosted in 2000, Mr. Goldstone said.  It was only during the games that they started to ask,  What are we going to do about the legacy?' " he said.

Development plans in Stratford have coincided with a London real-estate boom. Around $42.5 billion was invested in London commercial property last year, only slightly less that the $45.1 billion invested in all of Germany, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Years of rising prices in London have made the new office space being created in Stratford more attractive. TfL, the tube operator, will pay 36.50 a square foot for their new office space, around half the average London office rent.

Property broker JLL, the leasing agent for the International Quarter, is currently talking to major technology firms, banks and other government agencies looking to cut costs, said Matthew Mycock, a director at JLL. Office rents for the next phase of construction in the International Quarter could be around 45 a square foot, which is still below another East London business district, Canary Wharf, he said.

Another boon for Stratford development: London has been gradually migrating eastward for decades. The recent housing boom, which has seen prices vault to record highs, has helped usher home buyers into the less-expensive eastern areas. The growing population wanting to live near work should support office development, said Jessica Hardman, head of real-estate transactions, U.K. and Ireland at Deutsche Asset Management.

For those living nearby, travel just got cheaper. The London subway network has six zones, with fares rising incrementally away from central Zone 1. In January, Stratford and nine other East London stations changed from Zone 3 to the newly designated Zone 2/3.

Travelers heading into London will pay the lower Zone 2 fare, while those traveling out of London will pay the Zone 3 fare. The change was an effort  to recognize the shifting economic map of London towards east London," a statement from TfL said.

Stratford should continue to benefit from the influx of people, culture and jobs, as well as lower office rents, Ms. Hardman said.

 The Olympic effect was important," she said.  Otherwise it's just another office park."

Alibaba Creates A Giant Valued At $50 Billion

By Kane Wu

Investors are hanging a valuation of more than $50 billion on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s deal-hungry financial-services affiliate, the latest sign of healthy appetite for China's financial-technology sector.

Ant Financial Services Group, China's most valuable Internet finance company, is planning to raise up to 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) in its current funding round from a clutch of new and existing investors, at a valuation of more than $50 billion, according to people familiar with the situation. The round is expected to be completed by mid-April, they said.

The fresh fundraising will give the operator of popular Chinese online payments platform Alipay more financial muscle as it buys stakes in businesses ranging from a Chinese lottery company to China's Postal Savings Bank.

It also sets the stage for Ant Financial's future initial public offering -- the most anticipated Chinese share offering on the horizon. Bankers expect it as early as 2017, potentially on a Chinese stock exchange. The company's thinking on an IPO venue remains unclear, though it said earlier that it is raising money in yuan, which would make a domestic listing easier.

Investors have been pouring money into Chinese financial-technology companies, sending valuations for some soaring. After just over a year of operations, WeBank, a unit of Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. that competes with Ant Financial's MYbank, is raising money at a $5.5 billion valuation, people familiar with the matter said earlier.

Chinese Internet-finance companies benefit from a technology edge over the country's lumbering state banking giants. Companies like Ant Financial think they can use their vast troves of data and analytics to reduce the risk of lending to small borrowers, a market big Chinese state banks have traditionally eschewed in favor of making big loans to other government-owned companies. Now those big companies are suffering as e-commerce operations like Alibaba and JD.com Inc. move into new corners of the economy.

Ant Financial runs the Alipay Internet payments platform, China's largest, which used to be part of Alibaba. The group's chairman, Jack Ma, controversially separated the payment unit from the e-commerce company and brought it under his control, drawing criticism from major shareholder Yahoo Inc. Alibaba said the separation was driven by Chinese government rules that could limit the ability of Alipay to provide certain payment services if it wasn't a domestic company.

Alibaba's record $25 billion initial public offering in 2014 didn't include Ant Financial, but a profit-sharing agreement would allow Alibaba to cash in on any Ant Financial IPO. The affiliate also is effectively controlled by Alibaba executives. Ant Financial Chief Executive Lucy Peng is an Alibaba senior executive, and Mr. Ma personally owns a minority stake in Ant Financial.

Ant Financial often teams up with Alibaba on deals. Over the weekend, the two struck a deal to buy a controlling stake in Hong Kong-listed lottery company AGTech Holdings Ltd. for 2.39 billion Hong Kong dollars ($307.9 million).

In December, Ant Financial invested in Postal Savings Bank of China, whose $10 billion Hong Kong initial public offering is expected toward the end of this year.

Ant Financial, with more than 400 million annual active users, operates a number of products closely linked with Alibaba's e-commerce and online marketplace businesses, including Alipay, online money-market fund Yu'E Bao and MYbank.

The new investors in talks to invest in Ant Financial include CCB International (Holdings) Ltd., according to the people. Ant Financial's existing backers, which could put additional money into the company, include big Chinese insurers, a policy bank and other state funds.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and China International Capital Corp. are advising Ant Financial on the current fundraising, according to people familiar with the situation.

Ant Financial raised more than 12 billion yuan last year in its first round of fundraising, attracting a dozen outside investors led by China's national social-security fund. China's four biggest insurance companies -- China Pacific Insurance Group, People's Insurance Co. of China, China Life Insurance Co. and New China Life Insurance Co. -- took stakes, according to Ant shareholding records.

WSJ.D Technology -- Keywords: Software Is Disrupting Venture Capitalism

Ten years ago, bored by the repetitive nature of his work as a private-equity analyst, Ryan Caldbeck began to think that the job could be done as well by software. Today, he's the co-founder and chief executive of CircleUp, an online crowdfunding platform specializing in consumer-goods companies -- think food, cosmetics and chain restaurants. Mr. Caldbeck's firm has built software that he says does more or less what he once found so stultifying.

Internally, this software is called the "Classifier." It applies so-called machine learning to a pool of big data: more than 10,000 evaluations over four years by CircleUp's human analysts.

The software has been prescreening investments for analysts since March 2014. The result is much higher deal flow. Fewer than 10 analysts collectively evaluate 500 potential deals a month, says a CircleUp spokeswoman. By comparison, a typical private-equity firm evaluates fewer than 500 deals in a year.

During the prescreen, the Classifier crunches a candidate company's financial data: revenue, growth, margins, distribution channels and the like. Other sources are also thrown into the mix, including data from market-research firm Nielsen and quantitative measures of reach and activity on social media, for a total of 92,000 data points per company, says Mr. Caldbeck. Then the machine decides whether the company merits further evaluation by human beings.

The Classifier is nowhere close to fully automating the process of investing in private companies. And compared with the tools available for public markets -- software-driven hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies, or robo advisers for individual investors like Wealthfront and Betterment -- CircleUp's software is primitive.

But CircleUp's effort exemplifies a larger trend in finance, where algorithms play a growing role in markets for areas as diverse as startups and real estate. Software is eating the world, again, only this time it threatens the jobs of precisely the financiers accustomed to disrupting everyone else.

One reason CircleUp could build its Classifier is that the companies in which it organizes investments tend to have very similar business models. The food companies, for example, generally sell similar types of products into grocery stores with nearly identical requirements.

The company's software wouldn't work in tech, says Rory Eakin, CircleUp's other co-founder and chief operating officer. The business models of tech startups vary widely, and those companies can tap a robust network of incubators and venture capitalists. "I don't think there's a problem to be solved in tech investing, but if you have an organic-kale-chip company and you're reinventing the salty-snack category, there's no ecosystem to fund that," says Mr. Eakin.

One such kale-chip maker is Rhythm Superfoods. It was first evaluated by the Classifier, accepted into CircleUp, and is now in 5,000 U.S. stores. On the strength of that growth, the company netted a financing round of $3 million, led by General Mills.

A challenge to further automating the assessment of private companies is a lack of publicly available data. In general, only potential investors get to see a private company's financials.

Once such data is collected, however, there might be other uses. Alexander Mittal, CEO of FundersClub, one of the first online investment marketplaces where accredited investors could pool their money in private deals, says his team is analyzing its four years of data to assess which investors on FundersClub are best at judging companies, as evidenced by how their investments perform.

Using software to pick the humans who are best at picking startups certainly seems like a baby step toward automating the investment process. By analogy, think about how Google's algorithm started out using signals from humans -- how often Web pages linked to one another -- to pick the most relevant pages and has since become more automated.

There's an irony here: CircleUp, which is to some extent trying to disrupt traditional venture capital, is itself funded by venture funds including Union Square Ventures, Canaan Partners and Google Ventures. That isn't lost on CircleUp investor Andy Weissman of Union Square Ventures, who jokes that "our hope is that CircleUp will put us out of business."

The complexities of identifying successful tech companies will probably keep Mr. Weissman safe for the foreseeable future. Still, the truth is that CircleUp and companies like it could eventually take a chunk out of the profits earned by private investors.

It is possible, in other words, that the Warren Buffett of the 21st century will be an artificially intelligent software program.

There are also many categories of private investments that might yield to this same approach, especially in debt financing for segments like agriculture or industrial machinery. This is, after all, what Lending Club is trying to do for consumer debt.

Meanwhile, CircleUp's Classifier is simply making the human analysts the company employs more effective. Even in the relatively straightforward world of investing in consumer goods, people aren't out of the loop -- yet.

Markets
Fed to Unveil New Rules Aimed at Corralling Banks  Risk; Central bank aims to limit how much exposure institutions may have to counterparties

WASHINGTON Policy makers are poised to unveil a new plan Friday that seeks to restrain how quickly risk can spread among the country's biggest banks.

The Federal Reserve 's revised proposal will be the central bank's latest step to minimize the systemic risk posed by the biggest banks not based on size, but on interconnections with other large firms by limiting how much exposure institutions may have to each other and to their counterparties.

Despite its potential significance to stem contagion in financial markets, the rule known as the single counterparty credit limit has spent years on the back burner. Until now, regulators had been focused largely on other high-profile rules tied to capital, liquidity and other curbs on risk-taking.

Interconnectedness between the biggest banks was one of the key problems policy makers identified after the 2008 financial crisis, when "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122145492097035549" Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc . threatened many other large Wall Street firms that had lent to the firm.

 If you actually think about what risk is and really what systemic risk is concentration risk is a huge risk driver, whether it's subprime [lending], or really a big exposure to a single borrower," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing director at Federal Financial Analytics Inc.  That's what the rule is designed to capture."

In "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704682604575369030061839958", Congress required the Fed to impose limits on big banks' exposure to a single counterparty. The Fed first proposed the rules in 2011, but returned to the drawing board after bankers complained about the potential impact.

Fed governor Daniel Tarullo told Congress in 2013 that more study  was needed to help us better assess the optimal structure of the rule."

The central bank conducted its own internal study on the likely impact of the rule and participated in global discussions about the best way to measure banks' exposure to complex financial products such as derivatives.

For the second go-round Friday, financial firms are hopeful policy makers will take a more lenient approach in how they define and calculate credit exposure, which includes loans, derivatives, and other financial contracts. The industry will have a chance to comment on Friday's proposal before the Fed makes it final, perhaps sometime later this year.

The initial proposal took a two-tier approach, capping a bank's exposure to a single counterparty. For banks with more than $50 billion in assets but less than $500 billion, the cap was set at 25% of a bank's capital. A stricter 10% limit was set for exposures between banks with more than $500 billion in assets and nonbank financial companies designated as  systemically important financial institutions."

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304811304577370003039540134", and the Fed's calculation method also overstated single counterparty exposure across banks.

The Clearing House Association, a trade group of large banks, counted 100 instances during 2012 in which 13 of its member banks had an exposure to a counterparty that exceeded the Fed's proposed limits. The amount above: $1.3 trillion, much of that tied to derivatives.

The group urged the Fed to change the way it was counting derivatives exposure.

Without the changes, banks would be forced to unwind and terminate so many transactions that  the risks would obviously be substantial and potentially destabilizing," the association said in a letter to the Fed.

The industry has warned that overly strict counterparty credit limits would mean less bank activity in derivatives markets, and therefore less competition and higher prices. Financial firms use those markets to speculate, but companies also use them to hedge against swings in interest rates, commodity prices, among other events.

In 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , a group of international regulators, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303819704579316584090630274"that the industry has said was more reasonable.

It is unclear whether the Fed will adopt the proposal or  gold plate" it by making it even stricter, as it has done for other international rules, such as capital requirements for the very largest banks.

UK COMPANIES
RBS develops robo-adviser to answer customers' questions; Banks

A robo-adviser named Luvo, programmed to mimic human empathy, will soon be answering customer banking questions at Royal Bank of Scotland in a technology tipping point for the sector.

The state-backed bank is exploring how to make the artificial intelligence service available directly to customers as early as this year, depending on the outcome of a series of trials.

It will initially roll out the new text-based system for bank staff, to help them more quickly serve business customers who have, for example, lost a debit card or need to unlock their PIN.

The new service will have a similar format to the mobile messenger service WhatsApp and will be conducted through mobile or online. Luvo draws parallels with the iPhone's virtual assistant, Siri, as it can predict and answer a number of questions with "personality".

"Its unique psychological profile means it has a warmth to its personality, is approachable, creative and uses a combination of intuition and reasoning when answering questions," RBS said.

The launch comes as UK banks are under increasing cost pressure - and after RBS unveiled its eighth successive net annual loss last week. More customers are turning to digital banking, prompting a large number of branch closures across the sector.

Other firms are developing "roboadvisers" as a low-cost way to deliver investment guidance or wealth management through computer algorithms. A number of digital competitors, such as Nutmeg, have come to market based on this model.

But RBS is the first UK high street bank to unveil a human-like AI service to answer customer queries. The bank said Luvo was aimed at freeing up staff to focus on more complex enquiries.

Mastercard, the US-based card issuer, revealed yesterday that it would also use artificial intelligence to create a virtual sales assistant in the UK. It said the aim was to expand access to knowledge that was previously held among a few employees.

Luvo has been programmed to learn from its mistakes, meaning its answers become more accurate over time, and can respond to a person's mood. Where Luvo cannot answer the question, it refers staff to an expert in the bank.

James Daley, founder of consumer site Fairer Finance, warned of the potential dangers of less human interaction.

"The further away you get from your customers, the less you know them, and the greater the risk of serving them the wrong product, or advice," he said. "If you can build a computer programme that does a good job of delivering good customer outcomes, then great."

Simon McNamara, chief administrative officer at RBS, said: "Luvo is a really exciting new technology that brings artificial intelligence to life and will help our staff serve customers better by resolving their questions and problems much more quickly.

"Its potential is huge and we'll be exploring if Luvo could talk to customers directly to answer straightforward questions, freeing up time for our staff to answer complex issues."

RBS is conducting a series of trials with the technology over the coming months. It believes Luvo has an advantage over human interaction in some instances, as it can filter huge amounts of information in a split second.

RBS emphasised that Luvo provides another channel for staff and potentially customers, who can still opt to speak to a human adviser at the outset.

Tech
Mutual Funds Sour on Startup Investments; Fidelity, BlackRock and other giants cut value of their stakes at faster pace, make fewer new investments

"http://graphics.wsj.com/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch/"

Mutual funds that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304626304579509494155922018" are cutting the value of their startup investments at an accelerating pace and are making fewer new investments.

These are ominous signs for Silicon Valley, where a flood of money into young companies pushed valuations skyward, and subsidized hiring sprees and advertising binges at scores of companies.

The mutual-fund pullback threatens to deepen "http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-silicon-valley-the-hangover-begins-1455930769?mod=ST1" that has already led to falling valuations, shrinking ambitions and layoffs as the receding tide of capital forces startup companies of all kinds to focus on the bottom line rather than growth at any cost.

BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Wellington Management run or advise mutual funds that own shares in at least 40 closely held startups valued at $1 billion or more apiece, according to securities filings analyzed by The Wall Street Journal.

For 13 of the startups, at least one mutual-fund firm values its investment at less than what it paid, the "http://graphics.wsj.com/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch". Those firms are valuing the 13 companies at an average of 28% below their original purchase price.

The companies include mobile-messaging service Snapchat Inc., note-taking software maker Evernote Inc. and health-insurance brokerage Zenefits.

"http://graphics.wsj.com/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch/"

"http://graphics.wsj.com/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch/"

Just three stakes held by the same fund firms were underwater a year ago.

Meanwhile, the fund firms bought only 10 new stakes in startup companies in the fourth quarter, down from a peak of 32 in last year's second quarter, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

The markdowns have stunned many venture-capital investors and blindsided some executives at startups.

Lower valuations by mutual funds could make it harder for all but the most successful companies to raise additional capital at richer prices and lead to "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/11/17/startup-valuations-surge-in-3q-but-data-hints-at-pullback/". That can sap employee morale and hurt efforts to lure new hires with stock options.

 That level of reporting and transparency has never really been a part of the [venture-capital] market, and all of a sudden it came out and it was a shock," said Jeff Richards, a managing partner of GGV Capital, a venture-capital firm based in Menlo Park, Calif.

GGV owns a stake in Web analytics firm Domo Inc., which has been marked down 16% by Fidelity since August. The mutual-fund firm still values the investment 72% above its purchase price.

Fantasy-sports company DraftKings Inc., also partly owned by GGV, tumbled in valuation by an average of 72% in the fourth quarter. Regulators have alleged its service constitutes illegal gambling. DraftKings said daily fantasy sports is a game of skill.

DraftKings declined to comment on the markdown. Domo didn't respond to requests for comment.

Because shares in private companies aren't traded on a stock market, the mutual funds must estimate how much each startup's stock is worth, reporting the amount every month or quarter.

The reversal began in the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-valuations-under-new-scrutiny-1445387006" as the ebullient, sky's-the-limit mood in Silicon Valley grew anxious. Collapsing tech stocks and the punishing market for initial public offerings are now reining in the runaway optimism that gave "http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/" a valuation of at least $1 billion as of February, up from 45 two years earlier.

So far this year, Fidelity and funds advised by Wellington have marked down their estimated values of 13 different billion-dollar startups by at least 5%. No startups have been marked up by 5%.

In contrast, 14 startups were marked up in value in last year's second quarter and only three were marked down, according to the Journal's analysis.

The Journal created an interactive graphic, called "http://graphics.wsj.com/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch/", that shows the estimated share prices for startups valued at more than $1 billion by big mutual-fund firms.

BlackRock, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and funds advised by Wellington are among the largest investors in startups by dollars invested, though those stakes are tiny compared with the firms' overall assets.

According to securities filings, startups have gotten at least $3.8 billion from Fidelity and T. Rowe Price alone, representing roughly 12% of the startups' total funding.

The mutual-fund firms declined to comment on why their opinion of some startups is souring. When analyzing startups, independent valuation committees at fund firms usually sift through financial information from the company and valuations of publicly traded rivals. The committees also look at the share prices paid by investors in previous funding rounds.

Mutual funds depend on a vibrant IPO market to cash in on their private-company investments, usually made by buying stock directly from startups.

No U.S.-based, venture-backed technology companies have gone public so far this year. Last year, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startups-feel-an-ipo-chill-1445309822", down from 30 in 2014. Their shares had fallen more than 30% on average as of mid-February.

The suffering stock market is likely to keep the IPO pipeline shut to companies that previously raised capital at lofty valuations and don't want to go public at a lower price. Through Wednesday's close, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was down 6.1% so far this year.

Many Americans own a piece of private technology companies "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mutual-funds-flail-at-valuing-hot-startups-like-uber-1446174018". Last year, about 45% of the funding rounds that valued a U.S.-based, venture-backed startup at $1 billion or more included a mutual fund, according to securities filings and data from Dow Jones VentureSource.

For example, securities filings show that Fidelity pumped at least $106 million into Zenefits last May as lead investor in a funding round that swelled the San Francisco company's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startups-feel-an-ipo-chill-1445309822".

The next day, Zenefits trumpeted the news in a recruiting note to potential employees.  In case you missed it, we just closed our EPIC series C of $500MIL at a valuation of $4.5BIL which makes us a UNICORN! That would be awesome for any company but for a scrappy, two year old startup it's LEGENDARY!"

In September, Fidelity marked down its Zenefits stake by 48% to $7.74 a share from $14.90. The cut left the company's implied valuation at $2.3 billion.

Zenefits founder Parker Conrad was surprised by Fidelity's move, according to people familiar with the matter. Zenefits called the mutual-fund firm to find out the reason for the cut, the people said.

Two of the people said Fidelity portfolio manager Steven Wymer attended Zenefits's next board meeting. One person said he was asked about the markdown.

A Fidelity spokesman said an independent committee sets valuations for private-company investments, not portfolio managers.

In November, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/highly-valued-startup-zenefits-runs-into-turbulence-1447375220" that Zenefits was falling short of its revenue targets and had started to curb expenses. Mr. Conrad "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/02/08/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-resigns-over-compliance-issues/" in February after coming under fire for what the company has said were inadequate compliance procedures and weak internal controls.

Last week, Zenefits"http://www.wsj.com/articles/zenefits-says-it-is-laying-off-250-employees-1456502872", or 17% of its workforce. Zenefits declined to comment.

Andrew Boyd, head of global equity capital markets at Fidelity, said some executives at startups were surprised when the firm cut the estimated value of its investment. But few follow-up conversations have been contentious.

 They were looking for more clarity on how the [valuation] decision was made," Mr. Boyd said.

Software company MongoDB Inc.'s finance chief sent a 500-word memo to employees after technology-news website The Information reported in August that Fidelity had marked down the company's shares.

 Our public mutual fund investors have limited information about our business," wrote Michael Gordon in the memo, which was reviewed by the Journal.  This is where the complexity and nuance comes in."

Fidelity has cut its valuation of MongoDB in eight of the nine quarters since Fidelity made its investment in December 2013, valuing the shares 58% below what it paid. The software firm's revenue roughly doubled to about $100 million last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

But the company's last valuation of $1.6 billion is a larger multiple of revenue than at publicly traded companies such as Hortonworks Inc., where "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hortonworks-to-offer-proprietary-software-1456534250" at a similar rate.

Fidelity now estimates that MongoDB is worth $6.98 a share. In an interview, Mr. Gordon said employees haven't been focused on the markdowns.

Securities filings earlier this week show that Fidelity marked down in January the value of stakes in 13 of the 26 startups tracked by the Journal. The cuts included a 17% drop for software company Nutanix Inc., which "http://www.wsj.com/articles/nutanix-okta-twilio-and-coupa-ready-2016-ipos-1450982574" for an IPO. A Nutanix spokesman declined to comment.

In a sign of Fidelity's caution, the mutual-fund firm didn't mark up in January the value of any startups tracked by the Journal.

Fidelity also is making fewer new investments in startups because it  couldn't reach mutually acceptable terms as often," Mr. Boyd said. The number of new stakes fell to six in the fourth quarter from nine in the third quarter and 16 in last year's second quarter, according to VentureSource.

Fidelity did invest a fresh $175 million in Snapchat in February at the same price per share where the mutual-fund firm invested last March, according to a person familiar with the matter.

T. Rowe Price bought two new stakes in startups during the fourth quarter, down from five apiece in the previous two quarters. The two new investments by Wellington were its lowest total since the first quarter of 2014.

The BlackRock mutual funds made no new startup investments in the fourth quarter, according to VentureSource.

BlackRock said its valuations  are based on approved pricing methodologies and utilize multiple sources of information." T. Rowe Price said in a statement:  What we are observing now is that the market appears to be bifurcating" into companies that are executing and those that aren't. Wellington didn't respond to a request for comment.

The mutual-fund firms analyzed by the Journal remain far ahead in paper profits on most of their stakes in privately held billion-dollar companies.

For example, mutual funds that invested in car-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc. at $15.51 per share now value the stock at triple that price.

Uber raised "http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-in-fresh-funding-round-that-could-value-company-at-up-to-64-6-billion-1449180409" that valued it at more than $60 billion, a record for any private venture-backed company.

But some venture capitalists anticipate further markdowns by mutual funds. That could make some startups more reluctant to seek mutual-fund money, since public disclosure of their valuations is watched so closely.

Mutual funds often still value their startup stakes at higher prices per share than venture-capital firms do. BlackRock said data-mining software firm Palantir Technologies Inc. was worth $10.70 a share as of Sept. 30. That was 61% more than venture-capital firm Founders Fund's valuation of Palantir on the same day, according to fund documents reviewed by the Journal.

In December, BlackRock increased its Palantir valuation to $11.38 a share. Palantir and Founders Fund didn't respond to requests for comment.

Despite the markdowns, some tech executives see a silver lining. Mr. Richards, the venture capitalist at GGV, said lower valuations by mutual funds are helping him convince entrepreneurs to scale back their expectations.

 Here is some tangible evidence that the market has turned," he said.

Washington Battles Over Munis --- Regulators, Congress at odds over whether banks could sell such bonds in a crisis

WASHINGTON -- Many investors flock to municipal bonds for security.But some federal regulators trying to shore up the banking system aren't convinced the bonds would be easy to sell in a crisis.

The contrast has led to an unusual showdown, with Wall Street, Congress and municipal officials -- all of whom are vested in a robust muni-bond market -- challenging bank regulators' skepticism toward municipal debt.

At issue are new rules aimed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltdown to fund their operations for 30 days.The requirements mean banks have to hold more cash or securities that are easily sellable.

The Federal Reserve and two other bank regulators decided debt issued by states and localities didn't make the cut, when they crafted the rulesin 2014.

Now, Republicans and Democrats alike are advancing legislation to mandate regulators include municipal securities among the rule's definition of"high quality liquid assets,"a category that currently includes cash, Treasury bondsand debt sold by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae.

The House passed such a bill last month.Senators, led by Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.), Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Mark Warner (D., Va.), are working on related legislation.

"We shouldn't make it more expensive for local governments to finance essential investments such as school and road construction by making it harder to access capital markets," Mr. Warner said in a statement.

He added the Senate bill's provisions would be tailored to "appropriately address financial stability concerns while preserving states and municipalities' access to bond markets."

Regulators don't think it is the place of Congress to second guess how they size up securities.

Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, at a congressional hearing Feb. 11, said legislation would "interfere with our supervisory judgments."

Big banks such as Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. have sprung into action in lobbying Congress, along with municipal leaders who fret the rules will diminish bank bond-buying which could raise borrowing costs on infrastructure projects.

Banks underwrite muni bonds, buy them as investments and sell them to clients. The lendershave played an increasinglycentralrole in the thinly traded,$3.7 trillionmarket.

Banks are the biggest buyers of municipal bonds, according to Matt Fabian of Municipal Market Analytics Inc., a research firm.

Since 2013, banks have collectively purchased about $11 billion of the bonds each quarter and now own about $500 billion of the securities, making them the third-largest holders after individuals and mutual funds, he said.

The Fed last summer tried to defuse the criticism by offering a concession, saying it wouldreconsider its earlier version of the rules, and include some investment-grade municipal debt.

Municipal officials retort that those adjustments would cover only a narrow sliver of the securities, and those that do qualify still would receive unfavorable treatmentcompared with debt issued by government-backed mortgage giants and Treasury debt.

Municipal officials also say legislation is necessary because the two other regulators involved -- the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- have yet to make any changes themselves.

Officials at the OCC remain dismissive of including the muni bonds in the rule, according to people familiar with their thinking, while the FDIC is waiting until the rules go into effectnext yearbefore considering amending its version.

Some economists also say the legislation would weaken the bank-funding rule, by allowing banks to rely on thinly traded securities that they worry won't be easy to sell in another crisis.

While default rates on municipal bonds are tiny, the majority of the debt doesn't trade much, according to a Securities and Exchange Commissionreportfrom 2004. It found that less than 1% of municipalsecurities traded more than one hundred times in a roughly 10-month period. Seventy percent of the bonds didn't trade at all.

Economistsnote that some of the most-traded municipal debt in recent months are securities issuedby Puerto Rican borrowers. The island's unsustainable habit of running chronic deficits has left it with some $72 billion of debt it now says it can't repay -- not what most regulators would consider a "high quality" asset.

"The Fed in its proposal went too far in allowing risky securities to be treated as safe, and the legislation would go yet further," said Phillip Swagel, a University of Maryland economistwho served in the George W. Bush Treasury. He said Congress's moves illustrate the danger of letting political forces influence safety-and-soundness regulations.

And he thinks the Fed should have stood its ground.

James McIntire, treasurer for the state of Washington, rejects arguments that munis aren't safe or easily traded. Mr. McIntire, president of the National Association of State Treasurers, cited analysis conducted with the state's financial adviser showing Washington's general obligation debt is at least as liquid as top-rated corporate bonds,which are included in the rules.

Regulators have ignored or dismissed this data, which means Congress must act, he said.

"We really have no alternative," he said, but "to resort to some sort of legislative intervention."

A robo-adviser named Luvo programmed to mimic human empathy is soon to be answering customer banking questions at Royal Bank of Scotland in a technology tipping point for the sector.

The state-backed bank is exploring how to make the artificial intelligence service available directly to customers as early as this year, depending on the outcome of a series of trials.

It will initially roll out the new text-based system for bank staff, to help them more quickly serve business customers who have, for example, lost a debit card or need to unlock their PIN.

The new service will have a similar format to the mobile messenger service WhatsApp and will be conducted through mobile or online. Luvo draws parallels with the iPhone s virtual assistant, Siri, as it can predict and answer a number of questions with  personality .

 Its unique psychological profile means it has a warmth to its personality, is approachable, creative and uses a combination of intuition and reasoning when answering questions,  the bank said.

The launch comes as UK banks are under increasing cost pressure   and after RBS unveiled its eighth successive net annual loss last week. More customers are turning to digital banking, prompting a large number of branch closures across the sector.

Other firms are developing  robo-advisers  as a low-cost way to deliver investment guidance or wealth management through computer algorithms. A number of digital competitors, such as Nutmeg, have come to market based on this model.

But RBS is the first UK high street bank to unveil a human-like AI service to answer customer queries. The bank said Luvo was aimed at freeing up staff to focus on more complex enquiries.

Mastercard, the US-based card issuer, revealed on Thursday that it would also use artificial intelligence to create a virtual sales assistant in the UK. It said the aim was to expand access to knowledge that was previously held among a few employees.

Luvo has been programmed to learn from its mistakes, meaning its answers become more accurate over time, and can respond to a person s mood. Where Luvo cannot answer the question, it refers staff to an expert in the bank to help resolve the query.

James Daley, founder of consumer site Fairer Finance, warned of the potential dangers of less human interaction.

 The further away you get from your customers, the less you know them, and the greater the risk of serving them the wrong product, or advice,  he said.  If you can build a computer program that does a good job of delivering good customer outcomes, then great. 

Simon McNamara, chief administration officer at RBS, said:  Luvo is a really exciting new technology that brings artificial intelligence to life and will help our staff serve customers better by resolving their questions and problems much more quickly.

 Its potential is huge and we ll be exploring if Luvo could talk to customers directly to answer straightforward questions, freeing up time for our staff to answer complex issues. 

RBS is conducting a series of trials with the technology over the coming months. It believes Luvo has an advantage over human interaction in some instances, as it can filter through huge amounts of information in a split second before talking through the answer. The service can also provide help when human advisers are unavailable.

RBS emphasised that Luvo provides another channel for staff and potentially customers, who can still opt to speak to a human adviser at the outset.

Chris Popple, head of digital banking at the bank, said:  Luvo has text-based conversations, but we could think about using speech in the future.

Tech Firms Grapple With How to Make Open Source Pay; Issue gains currency, as private investors pour money into open-source startups

On a sunny November day, representatives of roughly 75 well-funded startups gathered at San Francisco art gallery for a first-time meetup.

Each of the companies in attendance was building a business based on distributing open-source software, which means that any developer can distribute, modify, or openly share the product code.

The companies met that day to address one of the most vexing questions in the industry: how to profit off technology that is free. Open source has been a powerful engine of innovation, but early efforts to capitalize on it by providing technical services around it haven't generated dazzling profit.

Open-source projects underpin services offered by companies such Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc, and open-source-based operating systems such as Linux power many corporate servers, financial trading platforms, and Android phones. However, companies that offer such software as their primary product by and large have found it rough going.

Since most open-source firms don't have a product to sell, they historically made money by selling technical services essentially tech support and consulting services that help companies take advantage of free tools.

 The risk of open source is that you have no intellectual property," said Nick Heudecker, a Gartner Research analyst.  You're developing everything out in the open."

Even though established open-source businesses don't generate the kinds of revenue or profit that investors expect of software companies, there's been an explosion of funding to open-source startups in recent years.

In 2004, nine firms seeking to commercialize open-source software had raised venture funding, according to Lightspeed Venture Partners. As of last year, at least 110 private companies based on open source had raised more than $7 billion in total from venture capitalists, more than double the funding tally in 2013, according to the venture firm Accel Partners.

In recent years, engineers from large tech companies have turned many popular open-source projects into companies. In 2014, a group of LinkedIn Corp.'s engineers took their open-source, big-data software, Apache Kafka, and founded Confluent, a startup aimed at commercializing the technology.

Venture capitalists are eager to fund such companies despite open source's middling track record for generating profit. They say they see a huge market in spreading the innovations that have helped companies such as Facebook serve massive numbers of customers with unprecedented efficiency to businesses beyond Silicon Valley.

Yet, only two open-source companies have gone public: Red Hat Inc., which commercializes the ubiquitous Linux operating system, and Hortonworks Inc., which commercializes the data storage and analysis software known as Hadoop.

Red Hat's market capitalization is less than $14 billion, compared with operating-system vendor Microsoft Corp.'s $407 billion. Hortonworks' value is less than $1 billion, compared with database giant Oracle Corp.'s $143 billion.

 Historically, every open-source company has paled in comparison to their proprietary counterpart," said Peter Levine, general partner at the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, who invests in open-source startups.  Next-generation open-source companies will have innovated on both the technology and the business model."

Some open-source firms are exploring a more profitable path. These companies complement an open-source core by selling proprietary software designed to make the free offering more secure or manageable for corporate customers.

Such products, which aren't shared with the wider open-source community, can command far higher prices and margins than traditional open-source businesses. They tend to be sold for a monthly subscription fee for downloads, bringing in the recurring revenue prized by Wall Street.

But they also risk alienating the community of programmers that builds, maintains and improves the open-source project.

Hortonworks is working on open-source cybersecurity software that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hortonworks-to-offer-proprietary-software-1456534250" owned by third parties, and possibly by Hortonworks itself, the company said recently.

Cloudera, a Hortonworks competitor that also commercializes Hadoop, has amassed more than $1 billion in funding from investors is the furthest along in the experiment. The 10-year-old company says it makes 75% of its revenue from licenses for add-on software. Its proprietary Enterprise Data Hub software suite sells for a minimum $5,500 a month roughly three times what it charges for support services.

The company is  on the road to profitability," said Tom Reilly, the company's chief executive.

NodeSource, a two-year-old open source startup that has embraced proprietary software, released its first commercial product four months ago. Already, the ratio of support to proprietary software sales is evenly split, said NodeSource CEO Joe McCann. He aims to boost proprietary software to 65% of revenue in 2016.

At Cloudera, Mr. Reilly said he doesn't worry that the Hadoop community will view add-ons as a betrayal. Contributors don't mind because the company's proprietary software isn't the kind of database technology that attracts engineers to open-source projects, he said. And, most Cloudera employees still contribute to Hadoop, he said.

 This is the stuff the open-source community doesn't really want to build, but enterprises really need," Mr. Reilly said.

NodeSource minimizes the risk of alienating contributors by asking its internal open-source engineering team for permission before it decides to build a proprietary product, Mr. McCann said.

The proprietary strategy carries another risk, said Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization that manages several open-source projects. Rival developers could build the same tools and make them free essentially stripping the value from the proprietary software.

U.S. Stocks Edge Higher; Energy shares rally on higher oil prices

U.S. stocks rose slightly Wednesday, as higher oil prices fueled a rally in energy shares.

Stocks have rebounded since mid-February, as investors reassessed the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-growth-revised-higher-in-fourth-quarter-1456493673" and a bounce in oil prices alleviated pressures on junk bonds and commodity-sensitive companies.

What isn't clear is whether the stock-market recovery will turn into a sustained move higher.

Underscoring the uncertainty, much of the rally has been driven by short-term investors covering bearish bets rather than by longer-term asset managers stepping in and buying stocks, traders say.

The materials, industrials and energy sectors have gained the most over the past month, though earnings expectations for those sectors remain gloomy amid low oil prices. And even though stocks have tumbled from records, valuations remain elevated compared with long-run averages.

 The overall sentiment on this bounce seems very weak," said Nathan Thooft, head of asset allocation at John Hancock Asset Management, adding that he doesn't expect stocks to advance much further.

"http://www.wsj.com/news/markets"

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-funds-turn-bullish-on-oil-despite-glut-1456924051"

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-turn-finicky-on-corporate-bonds-1456879108"

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-reason-ice-covets-the-london-stock-exchange-1456877966"

While investors had been eager to snap up stocks after pullbacks in recent years, that has changed in recent months, Mr. Thooft said.

 The market has moved from a  buy the dip' mentality &to more of a  sell the bounce' mentality," he said.

On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 34.24 points, or 0.2%, to 16899.32. The S&P 500 rose 8.10, or 0.4%, to 1986.45 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 13.83, or 0.3%, to 4703.42.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-prices-fall-on-surge-in-u-s-stockpiles-1456914160?tesla=y" after data showed a surge in domestic crude stockpiles, settling 0.8% higher at $34.66 a barrel. Energy shares rose the most in the S&P 500, up 2.5%.

Recent economic reports, including a better-than-expected reading on fourth-quarter growth, have added to optimism on the economy.  The stock market priced in a [U.S.] recession, and we're nowhere near a recession," said Kully Samra, U.K. managing director at Charles Schwab.

Some investors say they are encouraged by the bounce in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which tracks airlines, railroads and trucking companies in the U.S. The 20-stock index has recovered all of its losses this year, and now is up 0.1% in 2016.

 You can't hide economic activity from transport stocks," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.  If you're making goods and services, you have to get them somewhere."

Data showing continued strength in the labor market attracted attention Wednesday, especially as investors search for clues about when the Federal Reserve will make its next interest-rate increase. The Fed considers employment and inflation data as it makes monetary-policy decisions.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/adp-reports-stronger-than-expected-february-payroll-growth-1456925823" in February, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a rise of 185,000.

The Labor Department's February jobs report, set for release Friday, is forecast to show that employers added 200,000 jobs last month.

 We need that Goldilocks number on Friday," said Chris Gaffney, president at EverBank World Markets. A headline number sharply above 200,000 could throw the prospect of a rate increase in the short term back on the table, catching many investors offside. On the other hand, a number below 150,000 could revive some fears about the strength of the U.S. economy, he added.

Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%, extending its rally to five consecutive sessions. European stocks have been bolstered by expectations of "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-ready-to-boost-inflation-with-new-stimulus-measures-says-bank-of-france-governor-1456913469" from the European Central Bank at its meeting next week.

Stocks in Japan and Shanghai rose by more than 4% on Wednesday, while shares in Australia gained 2%.

Trading in haven assets was mixed. Treasury prices slipped, pushing the 10-year yield up to 1.848%, from 1.835% on Tuesday. The dollar fell 0.5% against the yen to 113.48. Gold rose 0.9% to $1,241.10 an ounce.

In corporate news, Abercrombie & Fitch reported its "http://www.wsj.com/articles/abercrombie-logs-first-same-store-sales-gain-in-more-than-three-years-1456922094" as its quarterly profit soared 33%. Shares rose $1.27, or 4.4%, to $30.41.

Monsanto cut the midpoint of its fiscal 2016 profit forecast by 11% but saw signs of stabilization in the weak farm economy. Its shares fell 7.19, or 7.8%, to 85.30.

Promises and pitfalls of financial inclusion

Innovations in technology and financial services are enabling previously  unbanked  people in developing countries around the world to gain access to credit and financial services at an unprecedented velocity and scale. It s no overstatement to call this new trend in financial inclusion a revolution.

What s happening is exactly what socially responsible microfinance institutions like ours have been dreaming of for decades and, to be sure, we re excited to be playing our own part in it.

But we worry that understandable enthusiasm for this promising new moment is crowding out the hard, prudent questions that all of us should be asking. No one at this point really knows the limits of the financial inclusion revolution, and we must make sure it doesn t turn into a rough and tumble gold rush that ultimately hurts consumers and financial institutions alike.

Mobile devices are making it easier than ever for people to hold their money in secure  e-wallets  rather than keeping it under the mattress, literally or figuratively.

With relatively little complication and much less friction than ever, they can also apply for, receive and pay off small loans to build their businesses or personal lives.

A rapidly-growing model of agent-based financial services is bringing formal banking to people who either live too far away from traditional banks or simply never trusted them enough to use them. Point of service biometrics are speeding up and adding a critical level of security to the transactions, also giving access to the many consumers who can t read.

There is opportunity also for well-established microfinance institutions like ours to be more efficient and effective. In Tanzania, for example, we have approximately 700 people dispersing about 10,000 loans each month and managing an overall loan portfolio of about $30m. Maintaining such a large workforce relative to a portfolio of that size requires not only a big payroll but also high costs to train and keep employees.

New technologies   particularly credit scoring tools backed by sophisticated big-data analysis   allow financial services providers to process loans more quickly and reduce the time-intensive burden of filling out, filing and keeping track of reams of paper documents.

And we, too, are growing our reliance on a network of agents   small businesspeople who bring our services to more people well beyond the reach of our traditional bricks-and-mortar infrastructure. In our largest network in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have more than 650 agents, who are responsible for 77 per cent of all transactions there.

But the headlong rush by traditional commercial banks and mobile network operators, or MNOs, to lend more money to more people   many of whom have little or no previous experience managing even modest sums of money   might also overextend those customers with debt and turn them into ripe prospects for predatory practices.

Some MNOs are, for example, charging fees of as much as 20 per cent to customers seeking small, one-month loans   an annual yield of 300 or 400 per cent. That s not only a threat to individual borrowers, who could get trapped in a cycle of debt. MNOs can probably expect default rates of 15 per cent or more   far higher than the 5 per cent default limits we would tolerate. Apparently, they can live with that, considering that mobile payments are for many MNOs a sideline business to boost and maintain subscribers to their voice business.

What s more, automated credit scoring enables companies to offer small loans and banking services without ever seeing a customer. We have historically built trust   and thus higher customer success and low default rates   based on first hand knowledge about the communities where we work. We know, for example, that pharmacies in some places will have greater needs during the rainy seasons when their business spikes, or that a family with marriage-age kids will likely be asking us for loans to pay for weddings. Big data analysis might recognize important nuances like this someday, but on-the-ground, human experience still offers an edge.

To be sure, we, too, are shifting more towards using new high-tech credit-scoring tools to become more efficient. We will maintain the high touch that has long helped us manage our risk but integrate new big-data methods and algorithms from MNOs that can both speed up loan processing and ensure a high level of credit worthiness. Call it a hybrid-touch model.

To blunt the potential for risk, it s as important as ever to arm customers, especially the newly banked, with the financial literacy they need to borrow, move and save money prudently and to keep their distance from schemes that might get them into trouble. Some of that education will come with our traditional face-to-face relationships, but new mobile technologies have the potential to deliver not only products and services but also education about how to use them wisely.

There are many good reasons to be encouraged by the new financial inclusion revolution. But we   socially responsible financial institutions like FINCA, commercial banks and mobile operators   must be sure we keep the revolution going without producing a stampede of casualties.

Rupert Scofield is the co-founder of FINCA International and, with Andre Simon, co-chief executive officer of FINCA Microfinance Holding Company.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Deutsche Bank has the most clout on social media

Deutsche Bank, iShares and Standard Life Investments have topped a ranking of global banks and asset managers with the biggest social media influence.

Ignites Europe, an FT publication, conducted research using Klout, the social media analytics website that scores online impact between one and 100. It shows Deutsche Bank at the top of the table, with a score of 91.

IShares, the passive investment business owned by BlackRock, scores highest among pure asset managers, with a Klout score of 79. Standard Life Investments and M&G's Bond Vigilantes each score 55.

Banks have a much larger client base to draw on, with 404,000 people following Deutsche's tweets. Deutsche does not have a dedicated asset management Twitter account.

The tweets of BlackRock are followed by 272,000 people, more than for UBS, the Swiss bank, and iShares, each with around 185,000. Yet the world's largest asset manager has a lower Klout score than its exchange traded fund arm and UBS.

A spokesperson for BlackRock says the company is "exploring its options for social media activation" across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Companies included in the ranking were those managing the highest level of assets in Ucits funds, the European mutual fund structure. Some of the companies run their social media accounts out of the US.

Large numbers of Twitter followers alone do not lead to high Klout scores. Rob Tarkoff, president of Lithium, which owns Klout, says: "The Klout score is made up of over 400 signals from social networks. We apply all these signals to our Klout score algorithm."

Having a single global social media presence is a factor that can boost Klout scores, with all five of the top-scoring companies taking such an approach. UBS decided to close its European Twitter account in May last year and now has one main account.

Investment professionals warn that Klout scores are not a complete reflection of a company's online influence.

Kimberly Yurisich, a director in the wealth and asset management practice at EY, the consultancy, says: "Social media metrics are important indicators for companies to track and monitor, but a fewer number of impactful interactions is more powerful than thousands of meaningless ones."

Matthieu Lesle, head of digital marketing at JPMorgan Asset Management, adds: "[Klout] does not reflect how good you are at executing your strategy and reaching the right people."

In order to engage with clients and prospective customers, companies have focused on providing relevant content, such as views from portfolio managers.

One example of successful content marketing - news or entertainment articles that convey a company's message - is M&G's Bond Vigilantes blog , which has the joint highest score for European-based accounts, alongside Standard Life Investments. The blog is available in five languages.

Dominic Traynor, head of digital marketing at M&G Investments, says the company now has 35 social media profiles across five countries, with their measure of success not just limited to levels of interest but also "shareability" of content.

Mr Lesle adds: "Over the past couple of years content marketing [has been] all the rage."

Among the largest European managers, only Eurizon Capital, the Italian asset manager, does not register a Klout score.

A spokesperson for Eurizon says the company has a LinkedIn account but is "not active on social media at the moment".

Delinquencies rev up in US subprime auto

So how are US car loans doing these days? Well, from Fitch on Thursday:

Delinquencies on U.S. subprime auto ABS have reached a level not seen since 2009 with underperforming loans from recent vintages driving the increase, according to Fitch Ratings.

Subprime delinquencies of 60 days or more hit 4.98% in January, marking the highest level since September 2009 (4.97%). Despite the rise in delinquencies, subprime annualized net losses (ANL) leveled off at 8.72%. Subprime ANL were still up 6.5% year-over-year and are expected to trend higher in 2016 closer to the 10% range.

Weaker performance in the subprime sector is being driven mainly by the weaker credit quality present in the 2013-2015 securitized pools, along with marginally lower used vehicle values.

This isn t the first time we have heard about changing conditions in American auto credit, which smashed through the $1 trillion barrier in outstanding debt "http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/16/autos/car-loans-trillion-dollars/". For example, "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-23/more-subprime-borrowers-are-falling-behind-on-their-auto-loans" picking up a Wells Fargo report earlier this week, which used data from Intex, a structured finance analytics company, to show that  delinquencies on subprime auto loans packaged into bonds rose in January to 4.7 percent, a level not seen since 2010 3.

Last month, the Wall Street Journal "http://www.wsj.com/articles/car-loans-see-rise-in-missed-payments-1420768083":

More than 2.6% of car-loan borrowers who took out loans in the first quarter of last year had missed at least one monthly payment by November, the highest level of early loan trouble since 2008, when such delinquencies rose above 3%, according to an analysis of data performed for The Wall Street Journal by Moody s Analytics.

Jefferies, which tracks about $70bn of auto credit, or around 10 per cent of the overall market and 25 per cent of the subprime market, offered some re-assurance that net charge offs (when the debt is written off) were still tracking historical averages, with specialty finance analyst John Hecht and team saying last week:

Charge-off ratios in the master trusts deteriorated slightly in January, as shown in Chart 23 and Chart 24. NCO rates increased to 3.82%, a 22p increase from the December level of 3.60%. As shown in Chart 24 seasonally we expect charge-offs to improve slightly as we head into the start of the year, although we note that from a historical level, charge-offs in this asset class continue to remain at or near their pre-crisis average.

Hecht s view is that credit is coming off a period of unsustainably benign performance, with the data so far suggesting normalisation rather than systemic weakness for the most part. Still, investors seem skittish, with subprime car lender Santander Consumer, "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3/f7f0c17a-d5cd-11e5-829b-8564e7528e54.html", down about 35 per cent this year. The mood is shoot first, figure out what you ve shot later, as Hecht puts it.

Just for a final bit of historical context, here s "https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2015Q4.pdf" from the New York Federal Reserve in February:

The interesting question we ll "https://twitter.com/M_C_Klein/status/702915729755119616" is where things would be if it weren t for the collapse in gas prices.

Business
Beyond the Oil-Industry Bloodbath; Executives from BP, Hess and Suncor strike a confident stance in a protracted period of low oil prices

HOUSTON Beleaguered oil and gas executives gathered here for a global energy conference sounded a common message: Blood may be in the water, but it isn't ours.

Forced to reckon with a prolonged period of low energy prices, oil chiefs at the annual IHS CERAWeek energy gathering sought to portray themselves as steely survivors in an industry grappling with "http://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-and-gas-cost-cuts-fail-to-energize-investors-1452117138" and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/encana-to-sell-colorado-oil-and-gas-assets-for-900-million-1444304727"

Many executives counted how many previous crashes they had weathered. Some took solace in the musings of  Persian wise men" and philosophers from the 19th century.

Industry leaders nonetheless were emphatic on two points: Their companies will pull through, and whenever the price rebound comes, they will be ready to take advantage of it.

 Times are tough, you'd almost call them brutal right now," said Lamar McKay, BP PLC's deputy chief executive.  But we will adapt. We will make it."

The words at times seemed at odds with immediate financial realities, although many were taking a long view. BP, for example, reported a $5.2 billion loss in 2015 and earlier this month announced an additional 3,000 job cuts.

Hess Corp. chief executive John Hess touted his company's survival prospects, saying among other things he sees lower costs than peers in North Dakota. Yet, the company saw a loss of more than $3 billion in 2015, its first in more than a decade.

 Our company has some of the best acreage," Mr. Hess said.  We can be more resilient as prices recover."

The mood reflects the realization that no cavalry is coming. Energy companies are likely to stay mired for months if not years in a global oil glut that has sent crude prices to $30 a barrel.

That became clearer Tuesday when Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi told a packed ballroom here that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-oil-minister-production-wont-be-cut-to-reduce-global-supply-glut-1456246011". Instead, the world's largest oil exporter is banking on market forces to drive out companies saddled with higher production costs. That, in turn, would reduce global supplies.

Mr. Naimi said his country was prepared to withstand $20 crude if needed to thin the herd.

Oil prices, which had rallied last week on news of a tentative agreement by Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar to freeze oil output before falling on Mr. Naimi's comments Tuesday, edged 0.9% higher on Wednesday to $32.15 a barrel.

Energy companies have cut more than 300,000 jobs world-wide since mid-2014, when crude-oil prices began their tumble from $100 a barrel, according to Houston consulting firm Graves & Co. Globally, nearly $1.5 trillion of spending will be canceled from 2015 to 2019, according to IHS, a consulting and analytics firm. The spending cuts will push U.S. shale output down by 600,000 barrels a day this year and by 200,000 barrels a day in 2017, according to a forecast unveiled here on Monday by the International Energy Agency.

Troubled energy companies also can't count on well-financed white knights to save them by writing fat checks for oil and gas acreage at least not until oil prices show signs of stabilizing, said Bobby Tudor, CEO of energy-focused investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.  There's just no money coming into the system," Mr. Tudor said.

At least 48 North American oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy protection since the beginning of 2015, imperiling more than $17 billion in debt, according to law firm Haynes and Boone.

More are soon to follow, shale pioneer Mark Papa, the former CEO of EOG Resources Inc. and now a partner at energy-focused private-equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC, told attendees. There will be  a lot of bodies, a lot of bankruptcies," said Mr. Papa.

Saudi Arabia's refusal to cut output could bankrupt as many as half of all shale producers, Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. Not his company, though, he said Wednesday in an interview. Pioneer lost $623 million in the fourth quarter and has cut its 2016 budget to $2 billion. But, he also voiced his concern that the industry may not be in a position to take advantage of a rebound.

 When it's time for us to respond in 2019 and 2020, we are not going to be able to respond quick enough," he said.

The prevailing sentiment this week was certainly a departure from the swagger of previous years, when executives emboldened by high prices and the heady promise of shale oil touted multibillion-dollar expansion plans or  moonshot" drilling programs. Still, some CEOs sought to convey confidence that, while the industry may suffer, their companies were well positioned to ride out the storm.

 We will be one of the last guys standing," said Steve Williams, CEO of Suncor Energy Inc., which is selling assets to raise cash for dividends.

While many speakers acknowledged the current hardship, they also took comfort in the idea of an eventual rebound, asserting that the era of low prices has chastened them.

Night is darkest before dawn, said Joe Kaeser, CEO of Siemens AG. His remarks captured the Darwinian mood. To survive a bear attack, one needn't outrun the bear, just out-sprint another person running for his life, Mr. Kaeser joked.

Former BP CEO John Browne, now executive chairman of L1 Energy, quoted "https://books.google.com/books?id=SjcFAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=hegel in expressing hope that the industry will be better prepared compared with past crashes once prices rebound.

 Hegel says if there's one thing history teaches you, it's that history doesn't teach you anything," Mr. Browne said. He added:  I hope that we will actually do the things that we can do properly and just don't get carried away as we did during the high prices."

Economy
Fed Could Face Political Blowback if It Ever Went Negative on Rates; Policy could come under fire if it were to hurt retail depositors, Federal Financial Analytics  paper says

The Federal Reserve may have the legal authority to push interest rates into negative territory, but the politics of such a decision may prove to be a thornier challenge.

That's the conclusion of a new report from Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a Washington policy-analysis firm, which says the Fed will face significant blowback from Capitol Hill if the strategy appeared to hurt retail and small-business depositors.

Fed officials are unlikely to engineer negative interest rates any time soon. They are now focused on whether and when to raise rates in coming months. But they have said they could consider pushing rates below zero if they needed to provide more stimulus during an economic downturn, and the policy is generating interest as other central banks experiment with it.

In a 2010 internal memo, the Fed contemplated a maneuver to push rates into negative territory by charging banks interest rather than paying interest on reserves they deposit with the central bank. But that likely would lead banks to charge depositors  for providing the equivalent of cash-vault services," and could create a political maelstrom for the Fed, according to the Federal Financial Analytics report.

 Charging depositors transforms negative IOER (interest on excess reserves) from a financial-policy challenge into a grassroots political one, especially given the current U.S. focus on income inequality," the paper argues.

On the other hand, the Fed likely has  very little room" to try to resurrect the previous tools it has used to stimulate the economy, given the intense opposition it has faced from Congress in recent years, the paper said. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have also recently taken aim at the interest the Fed pays to big banks.

Negative interest rates,  either through negative IOER or another channel has the possible advantage of being seen as a tax on banks appealing across the political spectrum if politicians are persuaded that community banks are largely exempt from it," the paper said.

In testimony before Congress this month, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the central bank is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-reiterates-concerns-about-risks-to-economy-in-senate-testimony-1455203865" if needed to give the economy a boost.  We are taking a look at them again," she told the Senate Banking Committee.

She said she didn't think the Fed would need to push rates below zero, but it should be prepared to do so if the economy sinks and such a step is needed.

Central banks in Europe and Japan have turned to the once-radical idea of negative interest rates to spur their moribund economies. Many economists believe the U.S. central bank is unlikely to follow suit Ms. Yellen said the Fed is unlikely to lower rates any time soon, never mind going negative but Fed officials are taking the idea seriously. They recently required banks to model how they would perform under negative borrowing costs as part of its annual bank  stress tests."

The political and popular backlash to Japan's decision to take rates negative  is a strongly-cautionary test case for the [Fed], but not one that we believe will dispositively dissuade it from NIRP [negative interest-rate policy] if nothing else seems to."

Markets
On Deck Reports Growing Revenue, But Losses Mount; Operating expenses rose 73% in the fourth quarter

On Deck Capital Inc. reported record revenue and loan volume in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough to drive the online small business lender into profitability.

OnDeck's shares fell 20% to $7.02 in aftermarket trading, though volume after the close was only around 1% of the daily average over the past 65 trading sessions.

The company on Monday reported a net loss of $5.1 million for the final three months of 2015, more than the $4.3 million it reported losing in the same period the year before. On an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, basis, a measure of profitability that excludes some costs such as interest payments and taxes, OnDeck reported net income of $315,000, less than the $561,00 it reported in the same prior-year period.

Gross revenue in the fourth quarter increased 34% to a record $67.6 million, more than the company told investors to expect three months ago. OnDeck had to spend more to drive that growth, though, as operating expenses increased 73% due to higher spending on sales and marketing and technology and analytics.

OnDeck executives said it planned to invest more in technology to secure more partnerships similar to the one it announced with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in December. The company said that deal doesn't preclude others with large banks but that it wouldn't expect the initiative to add much to revenue before 2017.

 We're confident these investments will fortify our leadership position," OnDeck finance chief Howard Katzenberg said on a conference call with analysts.

Much of the higher revenue came from OnDeck selling a record amount of its loans to institutional investors. The company sold $201.9 million of loans, or 40% of the record $557 million it originated in the fourth quarter, through its marketplace.

While On Deck books a revenue gain from such sales, it foregoes receiving interest payments on those loans. The effective yield on OnDeck's outstanding loans also slipped in the fourth quarter, leading overall interest income to fall 2% compared with the third quarter.

Concerns about a potential recession have contributed to the 15% fall in OnDeck's shares since the start of the year, but Chief Executive Noah Breslow said the company isn't currently seeing any weakness in its loan quality.

The worrying signal from US online lending

In recent months, both Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace have hiked the rates they charge their borrowers. The conversation about this has largely focussed on what it says about online lending. Have they been underwriting badly and so now are scrabbling to account for past mistakes? Are they having to offer higher returns to investors who are tempted to put their money elsewhere? Is this the sign of stress that will bring the whole digital house of cards tumbling down?

Forget all of that for a moment and suppose that Lending Club or Prosper loans are just like any other consumer loan. Now ask yourself this question: what do the actions of those lenders say about the US economy itself? The answer isn t re-assuring.

Lending Club"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lendingclub-raises-interest-rates-for-new-loans-following-fed-move-1450818060", raising rates by 25 basis points shortly after the Fed hiked in December. It hiked again in January and is now charging borrowers 47 basis points more on average than it was in November. But as Tracy Alloway "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-29/when-credit-market-concerns-arrive-at-the-marketplace-lenders",  that average conceals a bifurcation: Rates on loans deemed higher quality by the company ticked down 3 bps, while rates on lower-quality ones rose by about 67 bps. 

Prosper was slower. Last week, it finally raised rates but it did so "http://www.wsj.com/articles/prosper-marketplace-boosts-interest-charge-on-its-consumer-loans-1455743138", with rates jumping an average 140 basis points. But again, rates on the safer credit rose relatively little, while rates on the riskier credit rose quite a bit. Rates on the loans Prosper rates as AA or A rose just 20 basis points, according to an email sent to investors. Rates on the C, D, E and HR [high-risk] loans rose 70, 130, 180 and 130 basis points respectively.

So what are Lending Club and Prosper reacting to?

Maybe late last year both companies hired a new underwriting whizz who came in and said,  oh jeez you re doing this all wrong. Rates are way below where they should be. Hike you fools!  Another explanation is that they are having to do more to persuade investors to buy their loans purely on a competitive basis i.e. they re trying to make their loans attractive relative to other assets.

But maybe something about their borrowers changed.

Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of risk analytics platform PeerIQ, tracks credit across the online lending sector. He has seen  delinquencies uptick mildly in the [second half] of 2015 .

 All things being equal, credit risk is vintage specific, and the most recent vintage has a somewhat higher delinquency rate than prior vintages,  he says, with lower-FICO loans experiencing a 2 or 3 times bigger rise than higher-quality credit.

This isn t a massive blowout, it s an uptick, but it s there nonetheless, even when seasonality and geography is taken into consideration, and it s across the consumer loan originators PeerIQ tracks. And again the uptick is higher for riskier borrowers than it is for less risky borrowers.

Moody s has also spotted something going on with the performance of online-originated loans. Earlier this month it put three bonds backed by Prosper loans and sold by Citigroup on "https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-places-on-review-for-downgrade-marketplace-lending-ABS-issued--PR_343705". The move was prompted  by a faster buildup of delinquencies and charge-offs than expected in transactions backed by Prosper-originated loans . Around the same time Moody s also "https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-marketplace-lending-ABS-issued-by-Consumer-Credit-Origination--PR_343675" its loss assumptions for two Blackrock bonds, also backed by Prosper loans.

Brian Weinstein, a former Blackrock fixed income guy who is now chief investment officer at Blue Elephant Capital Management, has a bearish thesis about all of this: people who have borrowed from online lenders are finding it harder to pay their bills now than they were this time last year.

Blue Elephant buys loans from the likes of Prosper and Funding Circle, typically higher quality credit. Weinstein says that defaults have been ticking up since about August last year and that they have moved  rapidly higher  for the lower quality credit. This, he says, is why Lending Club and Prosper have raised rates. And it s why the rates have jumped up so much faster for riskier borrowers than for less risky borrowers. There will be more hikes to come, he argues, as the companies respond to the deterioration in credit.

 I think it s very simple. If you look at our book, [for] the higher quality borrower, the default rates have moved slightly higher. If you look at the lower quality stuff, the default rates have moved rapidly higher. 

The conclusion he draws is that there is  a legitimate economic slowdown that s affecting the lower credit quality borrowers in the United States .

That s all assuming that there isn t just something going wrong with online lending in particular. It s possible   perhaps this is a false signal and we should be more worried than we already are about the ability of this new crop of companies to underwrite.

But consider that the business models of Lending Club and Prosper is to pass-through loans direct from borrowers to institutional investors (largely) and remember that there is more attention on these companies and their credit than most. It s not inconceivable that they might respond faster and more publicly to changes in credit because they are deeply sensitive to any suggestion that they are asleep at the steering wheel.

It s one we ll be keeping our eye on. Perhaps it s a blip. But perhaps it s indicating a real slowdown in growth.

We ll leave you with this thought from Weinstein on the lenders who don t have the name-recognition of Prosper and Lending Club.

 I ve seen some of the loan tapes from other competitors  & I ve seen the guys who take the rejects and the performance is horrific

Peter Clarke

Good hedge

Peter Clarke is hedging his bets. The old Man Group boss, who came unstuck after poor performance in 2012, has reinvented himself with a portfolio career. Last year he joined the board of Essentia Analytics, a fintech business that uses software to help fund managers. He's also been working as a non-exec at a couple of asset managers - Axa, where he chairs the UK investment outfit, and Lombard Odier. Now he has been made chairman of Lancashire Holdings, the Lloyd's insurer. His appointment coincided with weak results from Lancashire. The trend might bring back bad memories of Man in 2012. But for Lancashire chief Alex Maloney , Clarke is just the man to have around. "You learn a lot more when things go wrong than when they go right," he told City Insider. Hold tight!

Dan Rosenfield

Going underground

Mandarins are not always the politically neutral figures they are supposed to be. Testament then to the broad appeal of Dan Rosenfield , who was principal private secretary to two successive chancellors, Alistair Darling and George Osborne, and even had both speak at his leaving do in 2011. Whether he's quite so popular in Whitehall these days is another question. During his subsequent five years as an investment banker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, his highest profile mandate was advising on the Royal Mail privatisation. That was a triumph for investors who bought in at 330p and were selling within weeks at nearly 600p. Not so much for his old paymasters. Now Rosenfield is moving on again - this time to private investigator outfit, Hakluyt. By all accounts, the mandarin turned banker is a jolly nice chap. But BAML executives will still be praying he doesn't repeat the trick of turning on his previous employer, however accidentally.

Rory Tapner

Cold comfort

While markets slide, Rory Tapner , the former CEO of Coutts, is rounding up the great and the good from the investment world to complete a slippery descent of their own. Tapner is scouring the market for teams to take part in the Coeur Blanc ski challenge in France's Mribel. Richard Gower , friend to cocoa trader Anthony "Chocfinger" Ward and co-founder of their firm Armajaro, will be among those trying to forget the flashing red of their trading terminals by riding 52 lifts in one day. And just to prove fat cats have hearts, all teams will be raising money for Snow-Camp, a charity for disadvantaged teenagers. Tapner says it's a test of endurance, not a race. Nothing to do with the fact that five times Olympic gold medallist Sir Steve Redgrave is heading a rival team.

Patrick Spens

Lord Blockchain

PwC is going big on the blockchain. This week it signed an alliance with Digital Asset Holdings, the start-up headed by Blythe Masters , the former JPMorgan investment banker. Now the consulting firm is hiring Patrick Spens , latterly of the Financial Conduct Authority, to study the "transformational potential of blockchain". The appointment rounds off PwC's hiring of 15 blockchain specialists last month. The firm reckons Spens - a Citigroup trader and a hedge fund manager, before in his own words going to "do his bit" at the regulator, policing insider trading - is just the man to spread the blockchain mantra among clients. City Insider has been unable to confirm suggestions that the hereditary peer, who 15 years ago became the fourth Baron Spens of Blairsanquhar, also answers to the title Lord Blockchain.

MARKETS & INVESTING
IBM shake-up efforts rewarded with best rally in nearly 7 years; Wall Street

IBM was on track to post its best rally in almost seven years after Morgan Stanley said the markets had "under-appreciated" Big Blue's transformation efforts.

The computer group has seen its sales fall every year since 2012 as its legacy businesses, such as making servers and business workstations, have deteriorated amid a shift by many companies to host their data and processing operations in shared data centres in the cloud.

Its shares have struggled, too, falling more than 18 per cent over the past 12 months before yesterday's rally.

Chief executive Ginni Rometty has sought to steer the more than century-old technology company toward higher-growth opportunities with investment in "strategic imperatives", which include a move into cloud services, data analytics, mobile user engagement and cyber security.

Strategic imperatives revenues rose 17 per cent last year to $28.9bn, representing 35 per cent of the company's total sales. But that failed to offset declines in other legacy businesses.

Katy Hubert, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, reckoned that IBM's revenue growth was now bottoming, with sales returning to growth by 2019 as strategic imperatives become more than half IBM's total sales.

She upgraded the stock from "equal-weight" to "overweight".

Ms Hubert also flagged IBM's investment in analytics services as perhaps more important than its cloud push amid stiff competition from companies such as Amazon in the cloud sector.

For instance, IBM hopes its Watson super computer service that crunches large amounts of data will have broad-ranging impacts on many businesses, ranging from healthcare to retail.

As part of that plan, the company yesterday unveiled a $2.6bn buyout of a healthcare data company that is meant to bolster its health data and analytics division.

IBM's shares rose 6.3 per cent to $134 in morning trading in New York yesterday, in what would be its biggest one-day advance since March 2009, according to Bloomberg data.

Elsewhere, Walmart shares came under pressure after the world's biggest retailer posted its first annual sales decline since at least 1980.

The company has struggled under competition from ecommerce companies, such as Amazon, as well as the impact of the strong US dollar on its foreign sales.

Walmart also dimmed its sales forecast for this fiscal year from growth of between 3 and 4 per cent to flat.

The shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $63.13, extending their 12-month decline to 27 per cent.

Jack in the Box , a US fast-food chain, meanwhile, fell 15.6 per cent to $64.86 after the company posted weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings.

In midday trading, the S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,920.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.2 per cent to 16,422.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.6 per cent to 4,505.7.

Careers: Bosses Tap Big Data  To Flag Workers' Ills

By Rachel Emma Silverman

The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)

Employee wellness firms and insurers are working with companies to mine data about the prescription drugs workers use, how they shop and even whether they vote, to predict their individual health needs and recommend treatments.

Trying to stem rising health-care costs, some companies, including retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc., are paying firms like Castlight Healthcare Inc. to collect and crunch employee data to identify, for example, which workers are at risk for diabetes, and target them with personalized messages nudging them toward a doctor or services such as weight-loss programs.

Companies say the goal is to get employees to improve their own health as a way to cut corporate health-care bills.

Privacy advocates have raised concerns about such practices. Employees generally have a choice in whether to participate in the programs. The services are new enough that relatively few workers are aware of them.

"I bet I could better predict your risk of a heart attack by where you shop and where you eat than by your genome," says Harry Greenspun, director of Deloitte LLP's Center for Health Solutions, a research arm of the consulting firm's health-care practice.

An employee who spends money at a bike shop is more likely to be in good health than someone who spends on videogames, Dr. Greenspun says.

Credit scores can also suggest whether an individual will be readmitted to the hospital following an illness, he says. Those with lower credit scores may be less likely to fill prescriptions and show up for follow-up appointments, adds Dr. Greenspun.

Welltok Inc., whose clients include Colorado's state employees, has found that people who vote in midterm elections tend to be healthier than those who skip them, says Chris Coloian, the firm's chief solutions officer.

In general, midterm voters are more mobile and more active in the community, strong indicators of overall health, he says.

As employers more actively involve themselves in employee wellness, privacy experts worry that management could obtain workers' health information, even if by accident, and use it to make workplace decisions.

Federal health-privacy laws generally bar employers from viewing workers' personal health information, though self-insured employers have more leeway, says Careen Martin, a health-care and cybersecurity lawyer at Nilan Johnson Lewis PA. Instead, employers contract with wellness firms who have access to workers' health data.

"There are enormous potential risks" in these efforts, such as the exposure of personal health data to employers or others," says Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, who studies health privacy.

Typically, when a company hires a firm like Castlight, Jiff Inc. or ActiveHealth Management Inc., it authorizes the firm to collect information from insurers and other health companies that work with the client company. Employees are prompted to grant the firm permission to send them health and wellness information via an app, email or other channels, but can opt out.

Based on data such as an individual's claims history, the firms can identify an individual who might be considering costly procedures like spinal surgery, and can send that person recommendations for a second opinion or physical therapy.

Spinal surgery, which can cost $20,000 or more, is another area where data experts are digging in. After finding that 30% of employees who got second opinions from top-rated medical centers ended up forgoing spinal surgery, Wal-Mart tapped Castlight to identify and communicate with workers suffering from back pain.

To find them, Castlight scans insurance claims related to back pain, back imaging or physical therapy, plus pharmaceutical claims for pain medications or spinal injections. Once identified, the workers get information about measures that could delay or head off surgery, such as physical therapy or second-opinion providers.

Some firms, such as Welltok and GNS Healthcare Inc., also buy information from data brokers that lets them draw connections between consumer behavior and health needs.

Employers generally aren't allowed to know which individuals are flagged by data mining, but the wellness firms -- usually paid several dollars a month per employee -- provide aggregated data on the number of employees found to be at risk for a given condition.

To determine which employees might soon get pregnant, Castlight recently launched a new product that scans insurance claims to find women who have stopped filling birth-control prescriptions, as well as women who have made fertility-related searches on Castlight's health app.

That data is matched with the woman's age, and if applicable, the ages of her children to compute the likelihood of an impending pregnancy, says Jonathan Rende, Castlight's chief research and development officer. She would then start receiving emails or in-app messages with tips for choosing an obstetrician or other prenatal care. If the algorithm guessed wrong, she could opt out of receiving similar messages.

To steer more J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. employees to doctors in its network, insurer Cigna Corp. analyzed claims data to identify employees who lacked primary-care physicians. Those employees got personalized messages on Cigna's mobile app with recommendations for in-network doctors, says Michael Sturmer, a regional Cigna executive in the Northeast. Employees who had downloaded the Cigna app used in-network providers about 2% more than they did before the system was implemented in 2015.

Some people may feel uncomfortable with the idea that their personal data is being used to predict their future. Castlight carefully test-markets its messages to try to avoid appearing too intrusive, says Mr. Rende. "Every word matters," he says.

Maribeth Quinn says she was surprised to learn that her glucose levels put her at risk for diabetes, news she got in a message three years ago from HealthMine Inc., which says it analyzes health and claims data, but not other personal data. Ms. Quinn, a financial-aid executive at JFK Medical Center in Edison, N.J., has since lost 35 pounds, and is no longer deemed prediabetic. "It was in my face," she says. "That made me do something about it."

Mexico delivers unexpected rate rise with eye on inflation

"http://search.ft.com/search?q=mexico&t=all&fa=people%2Corganisations%2Cregions%2Csections%2Ctopics%2Ccategory%2Cbrand&s=-lastPublishDateTime&f=regions%5B%22Mexico%22%5D%5B%22Mexico%22%5D&curations=ARTICLES%2CBLOGS%2CVIDEOS%2CPODCASTS&highlight=true"s central bank raised the key lending rate by half a point to 3.75 per cent at an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in an attempt to nip in the bud the prospect of rising inflation.

The bank   which followed the US Federal Reserve in lifting rates in December when it lifted rates by a quart of a point, and had been expected to stay in step with the US   stressed its decision was not the start of a rate raising cycle.

It said it had been mindful of steps that the government and state oil company Pemex were taking to shore up the company s ailing finances. Pemex, Mexico s biggest company, which pays taxes that fund about a fifth of the national budget, lost nearly $10bn in the third quarter.

The peso has tested historic lows against the dollar persistently and lurched towards a psychological barrier of 20 pesos recently. On Wednesday it surged almost 5 per cent on the rate rise news to 18.2 to the dollar. It had shed almost 10 per cent so far this year against the dollar.

Mexican authorities until now have said the plunging peso would not spark an inflationary spiral, but the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) said in its statement that international market volatility had increased since December and the outlook for the Mexican economy had  continued to deteriorate .

The impact of that on the peso had  increased the probability of inflation expectations that are not in line with the consolidation of the permanent objective of 3 per cent , Banxico said.

 This does not kick off a hiking cycle but we will be following very closely all the inflation parameters,  Agustn Carstens, Banxico governor, told a news conference with Luis Videgaray, the finance minister.

The unexpected rate rise comes as Mexico is preparing to make new cuts in public spending for next year s budget and to throw a financial lifeline to Pemex, the state oil company, where stagnating oil production and a plunge in international prices has pushed the company into a financial crisis. The government has made clear that help for Pemex is conditional on Pemex helping itself by slashing costs and unproductive projects.

Mr Videgaray said federal spending would be cut by 132.3bn pesos, equivalent to 0.7 per cent of GDP   in line with previous belt-tightening last year. He stressed spending on security and social development would not be affected.

As part of the new austerity drive, Pemex would cut its budget by 100bn pesos, the minister added.

Alfredo Coutio, Latin America director for Moody s Analytics, said the actions went in the right direction but  could be taken as a sign of weakness, particularly because they are taken out of calendar .

He added:  The cost of delaying the adjustment could be higher since the measures are taken in a more deteriorated environment. 

The government has yet to announce what form its help to Pemex will take but Mr Videgaray said it would be up to the new Pemex chief executive, Jos Alberto Gonzlez Anaya, to announce details of the cuts next week. Pemex announces 2015 results on February 26.

 The priority should be to preserve projects that have an immediate impact on production and projects that do not have a positive impact on the net present value of the company should be cancelled,  Mr Videgaray said.

The government said there would be a weakening of growth as a result of the spending cuts and the Pemex rescue plans, but did not say by how much. The spending cuts will be spelt out in the coming weeks, Mr Videgaray said and should be  manageable 	. 	. 	. 	We are analysing options .

Banxico by law transfers excess profits from its operations to the government and the finance ministry says they are set this year to be significantly higher than last year, when they totalled 31.4bn pesos. Some in the market think they could be 10 times that level. Mr Videgaray said some of that cash, which is transferred to the Treasury in April, could be used to help out Pemex, but gave no more details.

Mr Carstens said that bank intervention to prop up the peso would now be made only on an exceptional basis. The bank has been auctioning dollars for months to try   in vain   to stem the peso s depreciation. He said it was hard to specify all exceptional circumstances but said they could include occasions when there were  large deviations in the exchange rate that cannot be explained by fundamentals and temporary factors and respond to a very low volatility in markets .

The peso has been hammered, in part, because it is used by emerging market traders as a proxy   it is the most liquid "http://on.ft.com/1RGebaw". Mr Carstens said he expected that pattern to continue. But he said the exchange rate had been taken to  levels which were not appropriate .

Mr Videgaray, who has long stressed that Mexico is being hurt by external shocks, said the dynamics of market intervention were being altered, but not the principle that  the exchange rate is set by the market .

Mexico has a 70bn credit line with the IMF but that would only be used as a  last resort , Mr Carstens said.

Intersection Names New CEO Amid Push to Bring Free Wi-Fi to New York City; Al Kelly, former longtime American Express executive, becomes chief executive

Intersection, the technology and media company behind the"http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-to-replace-pay-phones-with-free-wi-fi-1451970003", has named former American Express President Al Kelly as its new chief executive.

Intersection was formed last year through the merger of Control Group, which created digital public interfaces, and Titan Outdoor, an out-of-home advertising firm. Intersection is part of the CityBridge consortium of companies working to replace thousands of pay phones in New York City with free Wi-Fi hot spots to create the world's largest and fastest municipal Wi-Fi network, a project known as "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-public-wi-fi-what-to-do-before-using-free-fast-hot-spots-1453232580".

Mr. Kelly, who spent 23 years at American Express in roles that included head of the global consumer group, brings strong experience managing public-private partnerships to his new role. He has previously served as the CEO of the 2014 NY/NJ Super Bowl Host Committee and as chairman of the 2015 Papal visit to New York City.

Helping cities and companies work together is a  kind of model that is going to become increasingly important as cities are looking for ways to diversify their revenue streams," said Mr. Kelly, who is 57 years old.  They're looking for ways to create better experiences for their citizens and they're looking for ways for their cities to stand out as unique and innovative."

Under the LinkNYC project, at least 7,500 Links units will be deployed across the city's five boroughs over the next eight years. In addition to free Wi-Fi, the units will also offer device charging, free phone calls to anywhere in the U.S. and Internet-enabled tablets. LinkNYC, which is still in the early days of its rollout, is expected to bring in at least $500 million in revenue for the city over the next 10 years. The project is supported by advertising, with revenue split between New York City and CityBridge.

 We fully expect that other cities around the world will find interest in this kind of capability," Mr. Kelly said.

Intersection is owned by a group of investors led by Sidewalk Labs, an urban innovation company owned by Google-parent Alphabet. Dan Doctoroff, former CEO of Bloomberg LP and former deputy mayor of New York City, serves as the CEO of Sidewalk Labs and chairman of Intersection.

Mr. Kelly was an attractive candidate for the CEO role because of his experience scaling businesses as well as his experience working with both public entities and brands, Mr. Doctoroff said.

 We have a really incredible opportunity to integrate new technologies into existing infrastructure in cities that can provide benefit to cities, in terms of additional revenue, and for citizens, new services," Mr. Doctoroff said.  There is an appetite for our product and we are going to have to work really hard to fill the demand. What we need to do is scale and do it in a way that prioritizes the most appealing opportunities, and Al really is uniquely qualified to do that."

As Intersection's CEO, Mr. Kelly said he would help the company continue to serve existing clients, push forward on initiatives like LinkNYC and diversify the company's client base around the country and ultimately outside the U.S. The company has media assets in 30 markets around the U.S. Past work includes the creation of  On-the-Go" information kiosks for the MTA New York City Transit and an"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444358404577605353787904554"for OTG Management.

 We are not just showing people ads but improving lives for the citizens of the cities and transit authorities we work with," Mr. Kelly said.

 Our hope is that through much more of a move from static to dynamic advertising and the use of display screens that are multipurpose beyond just advertising that we will certainly open ourselves to a new set of companies that want to advertise [with us]," he said.

Unlike most types of traditional media that have struggled amid consumers' shift to digital platforms, the out-of-home advertising market has steadily grown. The medium, which includes billboards, transit signs and other outdoor displays, has benefited from its ability to reach mass audiences who can't skip over ads and the conversion of some signs to digital displays.

At the same time, outdoor media companies have been ramping up their analytics and measurement capabilities and further integrating technology into the user experience. Magna Global projects global out-of-home ad spending to rise to $7.6 billion in 2016 from $7.3 billion a year earlier.

The decision by the board of the UK s biggest bank is a Valentine s day gift for the City of London and the government, as the bank s review of its domicile had become a litmus test for the country s attractiveness "http://www.ft.com/intl/indepth/london".

BoE course emphasises experience over theories; Monetary policy

Want to be a central banker? A bit less modelling and a few more war stories are on the agenda.

Paul Fisher - the man who as director for markets at the Bank of England turned the theory of quantitative easing into a practical asset-buying programme - is to design and teach a new graduate programme for the BoE.

With the global markets in turmoil and central banks around the world experimenting with negative interest rates, the course's emphasis will be on experiences from people in the macro-economic trenches.

One student on a discussion board run by Rethinking Economics, the group campaigning for changes in the way the "dismal science" is taught, said the BoE's move was "finally an acknowledgment" their arguments had merit.

The group has been pushing for the profession - the reputation of which was bruised by its failure to predict or fully explain the worst financial crash since the Great Depression - to focus more on the topical study of economics and less on mathematical models.

Compulsory modules in the postgraduate certification will include financial regulation in practice, systemic risks in financial systems and the implementation of monetary policy.

Also on the syllabus is the role of macroprudential policy, a relatively new and largely untested addition to the policymaking tool kit, which includes interventions such as the capping of high loan-to-value mortgages.

Mr Fisher, who joined the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee in the aftermath of the financial crash, is to retire this year after 26 years at Threadneedle Street.

He will retain an advisory role after he steps down from the Prudential Regulation Authority, which will include designing the new central banking qualification, to be taught both by Bank insiders and academics from Warwick university.

Tony Yates, a former BoE staffer and now professor of economics at Birmingham University, said the new qualification could help fill a void.

"Before this course, there was a hole in the MSc market left by the insufficiently vocational economic and finance courses, which leaves lots of fascinating and really hard stuff - about monetary policy implementation, for instance, or the reality of a bank balance sheet, or a central bank balance sheet - to be learned on the job," he said.

Other optional modules in the postgraduate diploma include many of today's hot-button topics, including big data analytics, behavioural finance as well as unconventional monetary policy.

The BoE said in a statement the new qualifications - which include a diploma, MSc and MRes - will "equip the next generation of central bankers with the technical expertise and practical knowledge needed to continue to fulfil the Bank's mission".

Backed by funds from The Institute for New Economic Thinking, a research group bankrolled by billionaire George Soros, last year a selection of universities began road-testing a new "core" syllabus that focuses on real world questions - including what inflates a property bubble.

Nasdaq Inc. said it would buy news release distributor Marketwired for an undisclosed price.

Marketwired, which distributes news releases and economic data to investors and media companies, has been owned by OMERS Private Equity, the private equity arm of one of Canada's largest pension funds, since 2006.

Nasdaq, which is known primarily for its eponymous electronic stock exchange, has been expanding into more business services such as investor relations management. In October the exchange operator acquired SecondMarket Solutions Inc., a company that helped private companies facilitate trading of their shares.

In a release, Nasdaq said its clients will benefit from Marketwire's social media tools and analytics.  As our clients' needs continue to expand, we will be well-positioned to offer new tools, content, and services to meet their evolving IR and PR challenges and opportunities," said Adena Friedman, Nasdaq's chief operating officer, referring to investor relations and public relations.

The deal is expected to add to adjusted earnings within a year of closing, which is expected in the first quarter.

The Toronto, Canada-based Marketwired and other competing wires such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Business Wire were allegedly hacked and unreleased information was used facilitate illicit trades. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-charges-nine-in-big-insider-trading-scheme-1439295551".

News release wires have come under scrutiny for their relationships with high-frequency traders. In 2014 "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303802104579449351569200252" to stop providing the releases directly to high-frequency traders.

Nasdaq shares rose 1.5% to $60.87 in morning trading.

Lending Club announces $150m share buyback

Lending Club, the world s biggest marketplace lender, announced a share buyback programme and stressed its durability in a downturn on Thursday, as it attempted to turn round its free-falling stock price.

Since launching a decade ago the San Francisco-based platform has pumped out billions of dollars of loans, mostly by matching consumers keen to refinance expensive credit card debt with investors looking for high returns in a very low interest rate environment. In the fourth quarter last year Lending Club originated $2.6bn of loans, up more than 80 per cent from the same period a year earlier, earning fees of $134m, up 93 per cent.

But in recent months the company s stock price has collapsed amid fears that its machine will sputter in a downturn, once losses start to climb and investors turn away in search of better risk-adjusted yields. The shares dropped 56 per cent last year, ranking rock-bottom on the S&P financials index, and are down another 38 per cent this year.

On a call with analysts on Thursday, chief executive Renaud Laplanche tried to put such fears to rest, stressing that Lending Club had the flexibility to tweak its terms to take account of broad concerns over the US economy, and specific fears over defaults on the lower rungs of its 35-grade pricing system.

He also raised full-year revenue and profit targets and announced a share buyback of up to $150m, which is equivalent to about 6 per cent of the shares outstanding at current prices.

Net income during the fourth quarter came to $4.6m, compared to a net loss of $9m a year earlier.

Lending Club s rearguard action is an attempt to distance itself from other marketplace lenders which put their own balance sheets at risk, earning interest income and reserving for losses. According to Mr Laplanche, his company is better positioned because it serves as a simple matching engine, with notes issued to investors corresponding exactly to the loans it originates. If demand starts to flag on either side, he said, he can turn dials to ensure that returns to all kinds of investors remain attractive enough to ensure steady flows of fees for origination and servicing.

Lending Club has done so in recent weeks, putting up rates for some of its riskiest borrowers.

 We don t pretend to know more than anyone else about where we re going but in times of uncertainty it pays to be prudent,  said Mr Laplanche. The recent move to increase rates for certain classes of borrower was  pre-emptive , he said, designed to  provide additional loss coverage  to investors.

 It is a very dynamic process, and a benefit of our "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/02/04/2152142/the-online-lending-lie/", to be able to discover pricing equilibrium in a very nimble and quick way,  he said.

The buyback could amount to about one-sixth of the company s cash and near-cash on hand. Carrie Dolan, chief financial officer, said that the company would be left with a  robust operating cushion  of cash for strategic investments and acquisitions.

Analysts warmed to the pledge to buy back shares, which prompted the stock to spike by as much as 13 per cent on Thursday morning before settling about 6 per cent higher on the day.

But some noted that Lending Club s continued commitment to strong growth   expecting its operating revenues to grow from $427m last year to $735m this year   could be hazardous.

 Sophisticated hedge funds have analysed the credit quality of Lending Club s issuance on a loan-by-loan basis and think [the company] is lowering the quality of their borrowers, which could lead to trouble,  said Justin Zhen, co-founder of Thinknum, a data analytics company.

FT REPORT - RECRUITMENT
Technology pioneer's success stems from excitement of science; At Work with the FT: Minerva Tantoco, New York City, chief technology officer

Her mother demonstrated chemical reactions in the kitchen, writes Sarah Murray

Minerva Tantoco was "definitely a nerd", she says of her school days. "I had glasses. I enjoyed math and I didn't care who knew it. But I was extremely strong and athletic, so no one messed with me."

In this respect, little seems to have changed. With a cool, easy confidence and dry sense of humour, Ms Tantoco - an avid cyclist and dragon boat racer - comes across as someone who does things her own way.

This has served her well during her three decades in technology. She has held senior positions in advertising, tech and financial services companies. For her present role, she has moved out of the corporate sector and taken on the formidable challenge of working for New York City.

As its first-ever chief technology officer, her to-do list ranges from fostering technology entrepreneurship to extending home internet access to the 22 per cent of city residents who still lack it. She also promotes Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) education among girls.

When I meet Ms Tantoco, she is just back from Nasdaq, the tech-focused stock exchange, where she joined a group of students and coding organisations for the day's opening bell ceremony. "It's all in a day's work," she says. "And every day is different from the next. That's what I tell kids - technology is so fun."

For Ms Tantoco, the "fun" started early. Raised in Queens by Filipino parents, she was soon drawn to science and technology. Her mother - who trained as chemical engineer and became a computer programmer in her 40s - would demonstrate chemical reactions in the kitchen.

"That seemed very exciting to me," Ms Tantoco says. "And on my mother's side, there were a number of very strong scientists and engineers. So it was considered normal in my family to be a scientist, engineer or physician."

From her father, an attorney, she learnt the art of persuasion. So when her parents resisted letting her study at the highly selective Bronx High School of Science (requiring a lengthy commute to what was then a dangerous neighbourhood) she argued her case and brought them round.

It was not the last time she would deploy her persuasive skills. In the early 1980s, she convinced her parents to let her interrupt her studies in artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology and neuroscience to join a Silicon Valley start-up called Manageware.

She met the founders, three Harvard Business School graduates, during a summer trip to California. Overhearing their conversation about designing a system to automate management consulting strategy, she was intrigued. "But none of them were computer people," she says. "So I walked over and said, 'You guys don't know what you're talking about.'"

Impressing upon them that they needed her expertise, she joined the start-up and convinced her parents this was a wise course of action. "I promised to come back and finish my degree in the spring," she says. "And we sold the company five years later in a successful exit."

In the late 1990s, as the internet transformed business after business, Ms Tantoco joined the advertising industry in the role of chief technology officer (CTO) just at the time she was expecting her daughter. "I was the first pregnant CTO," she says.

After developing mobile and wireless services at software specialists Palm in the early 2000s, she moved into financial services and started applying artificial intelligence to workflow tools. "We couldn't find a solution so we invented it," she says. Her team's work resulted in the successful application for four patents.

Some of her banking sector experience would prove helpful in government. As the director responsible for data architecture, she led the redesign and implementation of Bank of America Merrill Lynch's investment banking data warehouse, a project similar to New York City data analytics initiatives.

While at UBS in Hong Kong, in 2014 she received an email inviting her to apply for the New York CTO position: "The more I spoke to people, the more I realised this was a once in a lifetime opportunity."

After accepting the job, there was a slight hitch: "I'd already signed up for a 300-mile bike ride from New York to DC for climate change." This meant telling Bill de Blasio, the city's mayor, she could not start on the appointed date.

"He gave me this look," she recalls. Once again, Ms Tantoco's powers of persuasion would prevail - she arrived at City Hall only after completing the bike ride.

Career Clips

Did you ever consider another career?

I went into college thinking I'd become a doctor. But in one of my courses in psychology, I used this new thing called a mainframe computer. I was like, "Wow - now I know what I want to do." It was one of those things where your future finds you.

What mistakes have you made?

When I was in banking, I went out to our office in Beijing and told the president that we needed more women in technology. She took me to the tech floor said: "It's 60 per cent women." I should have done my homework.

How would you advise a young person entering your field?

If you want to be an innovator and inventor you have to have the vision that will allow you to press on, even when everyone else says you're crazy.

What was the biggest adjustment moving into government?

The public nature of the job - being a very private person, it was anathema.

On the desk

Minerva Tantoco's office is not your average chief technology officer's workspace. Around her is a cavernous chamber lined with white Corinthian columns and decorated with chandeliers and big gilt-framed portraits of former city mayors, New York state governors and other political and military figures.

The chamber once housed courts but Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor, turned it into something resembling a trading floor. Known as the Bullpen, he worked there surrounded by his staff.

A glance across Ms Tantoco's desk provides some clues about her life. A Bronx Science cap is a reminder of her school and an NYC Tech + Innovation notebook points to her role in promoting IT entrepreneurship. A screensaver image shows her with Bill de Blasio (at 6ft 5in, 1.96m, the mayor towers above her) and City Hall's dragon boat racing team.

Her favourite object is a red 3D printed toy (pictured), a gift from Michael Dubno. The Bronx Science alumnus and former IT executive made it in his basement lab, Ms Tantoco says.

"This makes me feel like I'm holding the future in my hand. It's the combination of the information age and industry and that's so fascinating to me."

Hortonworks Seeks Elusive Path to Profit Off Big Data ; Business software firm reports fourth-quarter gross profit of $21.7 million, $179.1 million net loss for year

The market is growing for software that helps companies crunch immense amounts of data, but the path to profit is murky.

Hortonworks Inc., which reported its fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, closed its first year as a public company by beating analysts' revenue expectations while burning through so much cash that it raised follow-on funding.

The company reported revenue of $37 million for the quarter, a 196% increase over the same quarter last year, and gross profit of $21.7 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $46.2 million year-over-year.

Hortonworks, like many other companies that aim to profit from the rising tide of data flowing from connected devices, sensors and apps, is growing quickly as corporate customers try their hand at mining data to gain insights into their business. The company's customer count has more than doubled to 800 since it went public in December 2014, adding Mayo Clinic, Symantec Corp., Progressive Corp. and Noble Energy Inc. to the list. The variety reflects "http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-investors-hortonworks-is-a-big-data-bellweather-1446855724".

But that growth hasn't come cheaply. Hortonworks loses more money than it earns. For the full year, the company reported a net loss of $179.1 million on revenue of $121.9 million.

In January, the company issued 8.4 million additional shares in a follow-on offering to raise $100 million, pricing the offering at $9.50 a share, down from $16 on the day of its IPO. The company spent very nearly the same amount on operations in 2015.

The follow-on funding  in the current environment points to urgency," Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a report last month, when downgrading the company to perform from outperform. Many other analysts are bullish on the company.

 We believe our proposition is unique and adds tremendous value to our customer base," Hortonworks Chief Executive Rob Bearden said during a conference call.

The stock price plunged after the announcement earlier this month, capping a year in which Hortonworks took a beating in the public market. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hortonworks-prices-ipo-at-16-a-share-1418348055", its shares have plunged from $26.38 a 65% pop on the first day of trading to $7.91.

Some of the decline reflects wider trends as the stock market batters technology companies, hitting vendors of enterprise software particularly hard. Tableau Software Inc., a business software company with a mission to help customers  see and understand data" lost half its value last week; Splunk Inc., another big-data company, lost a quarter of its value. Hortonworks shares fell 17% during last week alone.

Some analysts think Hortonworks will emerge as a strong proposition.  When the fear and uncertainty dissipates," around the stock market,  I think you're going to be hard pressed to find a growth profile as attractive as this one," said John Rizzuto, managing director of software equity research at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

However, Hortonworks' status as a young company with limited cash reserves means it will have a harder time weathering the storms, Mr. Rizzuto acknowledged.

The nature of Hadoop makes Hortonworks' business particularly complex. Hadoop is distributed under an open source license, meaning the software is free for anyone to modify or use. The company sells support and services around the free software, including deploying consultants to work with customers, writing code and fixing bugs in Hadoop to suit their needs. This headcount-intensive business is similar to that of Red Hat Inc., the only other public company to commercialize open source software.

Although Hortonworks often compares itself to Red Hat, there is a crucial differences between Linux, a ubiquitous operating system whose code is part of the core infrastructure of the tech economy, and Hadoop, which is notoriously difficult to use and whose utility remains somewhat experimental.

Dawn Lepore Discusses the Path From CIO to CEO; What the former Charles Schwab CIO and Drugstore.com CEO learned along the way

As technology's role in business continues to grow, the chief information officer arguably has become one of the most important people in the C-suite.

But what does it take for a CIO to become chief executive?

Dawn Lepore knows. Before becoming CEO of Drugstore.com Inc., the online retailer she led from 2004 until its sale in 2011, Ms. Lepore was CIO at Charles Schwab Co., where she helped build the brokerage firm's successful e-commerce business.

Ms. Lepore sat down with Nikki Waller, who heads up management coverage at The Wall Street Journal, to discuss what it takes to migrate from a technology role to the corner office. Here are edited excerpts.

The right balance

MS. WALLER: Dawn, you went from CIO to CEO in about five years. How did you do it?

MS. LEPORE: I think it was a little longer than that! You know, I was lucky enough to work for Schwab, which is a company where technology is very strategic. And I think that's one of the most important things as you're thinking about your career as a CIO: Make sure you are with a company where technology is the product, or technology is critical to the business.

I also was CIO at a time when the Internet came along. Schwab came out with Internet trading very early, which allowed us to get some visibility and allowed technology to be viewed even more strategically.

And then I was able to take on other responsibilities. So by the time I left Schwab and I was at Schwab 21 years I had a number of things, including our business for very, very active traders.

MS. WALLER: What is the most underestimated part of the shift from CIO to CEO?

MS. LEPORE: I think it depends on whether it's a public or private company.

I happened to go to Drugstore, which was public, so [that meant] dealing with investors, the earnings calls, the quarterly cadence, which is both good and bad.

On the one hand, you've got a report card every quarter.  This is what I said I would do." And  Did you do it or not?" So, in some ways it's a good structure and good discipline.

But it's also difficult. You've got all sorts of things going on in the company. Some of them are going better. Some are going worse. How do you communicate that?

You can't be overly optimistic. But if you're too pessimistic, then your stock goes down. That piece of it was difficult, especially the first year.

MS. WALLER: Is it easier for CIOs to go on to be CEOs of their own company, or do they need to leap to another kind of business?

MS. LEPORE: I think it's easier to go to another company, especially if you've grown up in a company. I also think it's easier to get a CEO job at a company that is very technology based. Drugstore, for example, was a retail company, but it was completely technology-enabled.

Emotional blackmail

MS. WALLER: What can CIOs do to be seen as business leaders and not just tech leaders within their companies?

MS. LEPORE: I was never a particularly technical CIO. I had some technical training, but I didn't have a computer science degree. I was actually a music major. So the business aspect of it was always more interesting to me. I was always drawn to that. So if that's the case, it's probably a little bit easier to be viewed as a businessperson.

One of the things that one of my bosses said along the way when I was CIO was,  You never emotionally blackmail me, and I really appreciate that." And I thought,  What does that mean?"

And he said,  You know, I've seen so many tech people who come and say,  Well, I can cut my budget, but I can't guarantee the system's going to stay up, you know.' "

So some of it is how you deal with senior management of the company. That's going to be part of how you're judged as a business leader.

JOHN BUSSEY: What common behaviors must a CIO stop doing to become CEO?

MS. LEPORE: One is that emotional blackmail that I was talking about before. The other is too much tech speak. I have seen, or been in situations, where the head of technology almost uses the complexity of technology as,  Well, if nobody else can understand it, then they must need me, right? And so I try to make it sound as complex as I possibly can, and I use lots of acronyms." That doesn't go over well.

The third thing is really making sure that you understand the business of your company, and that you can engage in very strategic discussions about the direction of your business and your competition.

If all you talk about is technology, that's going to limit you.

Challenger banks move to stand out from the crowd

Here lies the big bank that once loaned billions to local businesses, but is now unwilling and unable to support the economy. Fondly remembered by its risk-adverse managers and overzealous regulators, its passing is deeply regretted by local business owners. Rest in peace.

The eulogy for banks  business lending has been on the chalkboard for years as massive losses, regulatory pressure and more nimble competitors threaten a perfect storm.

Surveys from the Bank of England chart an almost uniform contraction of lending to UK businesses from banks and building societies in recent years, despite initiatives such as Funding for Lending, which lets commercial banks borrow funds cheaply from the Bank of England so that they can pass it on in the form of cheap lending to companies. A similar downward trend in lending is evident across much of the developed world.

Meanwhile, investors globally have raised almost $80bn to invest in direct lending funds in the last two years, according to data from industry watchers Preqin. New peer-to-peer lenders such as Lending Club and Funding Circle are aggressively hunting for market share, and even insurers want a piece of the lending game. And policymakers including the European Central Bank are pushing for a more developed bond market to make it easier for companies to access non-bank finance.

Yet like other industry experts, including those that do not work for banks, Steve Dwyre, who heads Lloyds Bank lending to global corporates in industry, technology, media and telecoms, insists the narrative is not simply one of alternative lenders such as crowd funders triumphing over unpopular and ailing banks.

 There s probably too much focus on the crowd and peer-to-peer [sector] which is very small and may well be a flash in the pan,  says Conrad Ford, who runs "https://www.fundingoptions.com/", an online marketplace where small businesses can choose between different capital providers.

Mr Ford analysed a sample of 50 UK small business loans that were sourced through his website in the first nine months of this year with an average loan value of 123,000.

He found that just 18 per cent of loans were met by crowd funding, peer-to-peer lending and wealthy individuals.

Deposit-taking banks were a smaller percentage, at 14 per cent. Still, Mr Ford thinks banks  lending efforts should not be dismissed to the extent they have been.  You have two [UK] challenger banks which came about the same time as crowd funding, both of them individually have lent far more than the entire crowd funding industry,  he says.

The banks, Aldermore and Shawbrook, have collectively loaned more than 10bn, versus the 5.5bn that has been lent by the UK s peer-to-peer sector and crowdfunding combined, according to the "http://www.altfi.com/data/indices/UKvolume".

Bank lending is enjoying a helping hand from new forces in the market as well.

Credit Data Research is offering credit  passports  to small and medium-sized enterprises with detailed analysis of their finances that makes it easier for them to obtain loans from banks, which are wary of losing money, and to access market finance. The company started out in the Italian market 16 months ago. This year it will expand to the UK, France, Spain and Portugal, says founder Alessio Balduini. It has backing from Moody s Analytics, the analysis arm of the rating agency giant.

The biggest lenders in Mr Dwyre s space   accounting for 68 per cent of the 50 loans he analysed   are wholesale funding and debt funds, whose lending is typically short-term.

Among larger companies, funds and wholesale markets (serving banks and other financial institutions) are often the suppliers of choice for longer term debt. Doug Paolillo, an analyst at New York-based data firm Preqin, says direct lending funds typically target loans of five to 10 years  duration to companies with annual earnings of between $5m and $95m.

Mr Dwyre insists alternative lenders  success in this space is not a problem.  We don t want to have the longer term debt on our books because it costs us more,  he says.

 We don t compete on product, we compete on developing a relationship with a client,  says Alison Rose, head of commercial and private banking for Royal Bank of Scotland. When RBS  can t help  customers, it introduces them to other lenders, she adds. The British Business Bank, a government-owned service that helps small businesses to obtain funding, wants banks to be compelled to refer small businesses to other finance providers if banks reject their loan applications.

Lloyds is also looking to act as matchmaker between its clients and their ultimate non-bank lenders, by building out its capital markets business.  That s the big change that came out of this [last few years],  says Mr Dwyre.  We ve been forced to think about who is on the other side of this trade.

Schism Atop Giant U.S. Hedge Fund --- Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, protege called for votes on each other's conduct

By Rob Copeland and Bradley Hope 
1,897 words
8 February 2016
The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)

Employees at the world's largest hedge fund carry around iPads with an app called "Pain Button." It tracks negative feelings like "angry," "frustrated" and "sad" with the twist of on-screen dials.

Pain is part of the "complete honesty" philosophy at Bridgewater Associates LP, which has made more money for investors than any other hedge fund in history. But those same principles have led to an unprecedented showdown atop the Westport, Conn., firm, which manages $154 billion.

Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio and his presumed heir apparent, Greg Jensen, have called for votes on each other's conduct.

The 66-year-old Mr. Dalio has asked the firm's management and stakeholders committees if they believe Mr. Jensen, 42, has "integrity." The term is defined in a 123-page treatise written by Mr. Dalio as never saying something about a person that you wouldn't tell the person directly.

Mr. Jensen, one of two co-chief executives at Bridgewater, asked the same group to decide if Mr. Dalio is fulfilling the succession plan he began in 2011.

Bridgewater is known as much for its idiosyncratic culture as its investment prowess, and Mr. Dalio has long espoused that conflict is essential and helps the firm perform at its best. Employees are told to air disputes openly and then try to resolve them, which sometimes escalates into a vote.

The tumult between Messrs. Dalio and Jensen is an extreme example even for Bridgewater. They have never confronted each other so intensely before, according to current and former employees.

In the past, employees have been fired, or "sorted out," for repeatedly violating the firm's core principles, according to people familiar with the matter. Bridgewater is run on a set of 210 principles that have been downloaded from its website more than two million times.

Principle No. 72 applies even to the billionaires who lead Bridgewater: "Hold people accountable and appreciate them holding you accountable."

The potential impact of the disagreement is unclear. The fact that the votes were called at all has unleashed employee anxiety about Bridgewater's future leadership, people familiar with the matter say.

Messrs. Dalio and Jensen declined to comment in detail about their dispute.

"The question here about Greg is whether he said things about me on tape in our meetings that he did not discuss with me before," Mr. Dalio said in a written statement to The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Dalio, Bridgewater's chairman and co-chief investment officer, said the issue isn't about "a traditional definition of integrity." He said he believes Mr. Jensen has "incredible integrity by any traditional definition."

Mr. Jensen, one of the firm's two other co-chief investment officers, said in his own statement that the disagreements have been "healthy."

"It's the way that they can be resolved that keeps us all here and resulted in the incredible working relationships that have made Bridgewater so successful," he added. "I can't imagine working in any other place."

As of Friday morning, the votes hadn't been completed, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a statement Friday evening after this article was published online, Mr. Dalio said "this particular dispute has already been resolved via our process."

A spokesman declined to comment further, including on the status of the votes.

Mr. Dalio has produced an estimated $45 billion in net gains since launching Bridgewater in 1975 from his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment. The gains top all other hedge-fund managers, according to LCH Investments NV.

The firm was born as a research shop that offered global macroeconomic opinions and veered into investing when Mr. Dalio got $5 million from the World Bank's pension fund in 1985 to trade bonds. Bridgewater has since grown to 1,500 employees.

Because of Bridgewater's impressive long-term performance, its investors include many of the largest pensions in the U.S., such as the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System, and sovereign-wealth funds.

Bridgewater's main hedge fund, called Pure Alpha, has an average annual return of about 13% after fees since its start in 1991.

Bridgewater has stumbled a bit lately. For the first time in more than a decade, the firmmanages fewer assets than it did a year earlier. A widely mimicked fund that uses passive, automated programs to shift investments among asset classes like currencies and bonds fell 7% last year.

Pure Alpha, which makes more traditional hedge-fund investments posted a gain of nearly 5%, outperforming peers.

The principles created by Mr. Dalio aim to remove human emotions such as fear and greed from decision-making and maximize profits. He said Bridgewater's "evidence-based meritocracy" is "not easy for outsiders to make sense of, but it is the secret to our success."

Shortly after organizing the principles in a written list about 12 years ago, Mr. Dalio had them printed, and some employees began carrying the principles at all times.

"Firing people is not a big deal -- certainly nowhere near as big a deal as keeping badly performing people," he writes in Principle No. 130. Any manager who talks about subordinates who aren't in the room is "a slimy weasel," according to Principle No. 5.

While discord is encouraged, Mr. Dalio's words often are taken as gospel. One former Bridgewater employee recalls debating with other employees for as long as an hour whether a misused apostrophe in one of Mr. Dalio's research reports was intentional or not.

Mr. Dalio says most employees "are in fact rewarded" for challenging him. About 20% of the feedback he got in the past two years was negative, he adds.

About 25% of new hires leave Bridgewater within the first 18 months, but the turnover rate declines after that, according to the firm. Bridgewater is a major recruiter of recent graduates from elite colleges such as Harvard University, Dartmouth College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Those who stick around embrace Bridgewater's philosophy. That includes Mr. Jensen, who started at Bridgewater as an intern about 20 years ago. He became the likely successor to Mr. Dalio after the Bridgewater founder began in 2011 to cede some of his control and ownership.

Bridgewater requires employees to watch professionally edited training videos that use case studies to show how the investment firm's principles should be used in day-to-day work. Tens of thousands of hours of videos and transcripts are stockpiled in the "Transparency Library."

One video shows Mr. Dalio standing at a dry-erase board and demonstrating how the marker ink won't fully rub out with an eraser, according to people familiar with the video. Mr. Dalio prods Bridgewater employees at length about why they bought the dry-erase board, why it doesn't work and how the bad decision could have been avoided, those people say.

Other videos feature disputes involving high-level executives. A video that Bridgewater titled "Eileen Lies" details the handling of accusations several years ago against Eileen Murray, a management committee member.

Bridgewater won't comment on the accusations, but people familiar with the video say it describes the discovery that a prospective employee's resume contained a falsehood.

Ms. Murray, who is co-CEO with Mr. Jensen, wouldn't comment. "I can assure you that if Eileen was assessed to be a liar she wouldn't be here today," Mr. Dalio said. "We and she couldn't imagine her working anywhere else."

Technology is helping Bridgewater gather ever more employee data. The firm has hired former officials from the National Security Agency and Central Intelligence Agency, as well as the International Business Machines Corp. scientist who led the development of its Watson artificial-intelligence platform.

Data-mining company Palantir Technologies Inc., one of the most valuable private companies, helps Bridgewater analyze employees' internal ratings.

While at work, Bridgewater employees constantly rate each other on more than 60 attributes, including "willingness to touch the nerve," "conceptual thinking" and "reliability," people familiar with the matter say.

The system feeds data into an ever-growing set of benchmarks, comparable to a stock index, that flag low scores and can eventually lead to a smaller bonus for an employee or even being let go.

In an iPad app called "Dot Collector," employees weigh in on the direction of conversations while they are happening. Employees also are quizzed about the outcome of meetings. Any meeting of at least three people is expected to hold at least one poll, according to people familiar with the matter.

The average employee accumulates more than 2,000 "dots," or individual ratings from other employees, a year, a person familiar with the matter says.

Those ratings are distilled into a "Baseball Card" that shows every employee's average rating for various attributes. The card also includes each employee's overall "Believability Index," which reflects how much weight the employee's opinion has in debates and polls.

The "Pain Button" serves as a kind of diary of unpleasant experiences. It can be used to spot negative patterns, track progress in dealing with conflict and potentially avoid similar experiences in the future.

The app reflects another core tenet at Bridgewater: "Pain + Reflection = Progress." Employees are frequently encouraged to "get in synch" and hash out their disagreements, current and former employees say.

Bridgewater is working on a new app called "Dispute Resolver." When it is finished, the app will suggest ways to handle disputes between disagreeing employees, help escalate the dispute to a mediator or even begin the process of forming a tribunal where both sides submit evidence, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The focus on decision-making is related to Mr. Dalio's belief that "emotional hijackings" can impair decision-making in investments and life.

After honing ideas through debate and discussion, Bridgewater employees write trading algorithms that buy and sell investments automatically, with some oversight.

Those algorithms can be triggered by outside data. For instance, data showing an increase in global shipping might set in motion an algorithm that boosts a particular Bridgewater fund's exposure to capture profits from the change.

A decade ago, employees rated each other as little as once a year, recalls MikeKane, who spent his first year out of college as an associate at the firm.

"It's difficult to have a strong company culture as you get larger," says Mr. Kane, adding that he appreciated Mr. Dalio's willingness to let young employees take on major responsibility and speak their minds so openly.

After Messrs. Dalio and Jensen called for the votes, about a dozen top employees and stakeholders at Bridgewater began reviewing video recordings of meetings, transcripts and other material to prepare, according to people familiar with the matter.

Voters were told to keep quiet. After the Journal asked Bridgewater about the dispute, the firm warned employees in an email that it would find anyone responsible for leaking information, people familiar with the matter say.

Under Bridgewater's policies, vote results and each person's individual votes are made available to the rest of the firm. "All employees see what would be hidden in most companies," Mr. Dalio said.

Markets
Moody s Profit Falls, Hurt by Foreign Exchange; Company expects continued market volatility, issues outlook below expectations

Moody's Corp. said an increasingly divergent credit market has it expecting a slowdown in bond issuance this year, meaning fewer deals for the second-largest ratings company.

For highly rated issuers whose debt is considered safe, the credit markets remain open, said Moody's Chief Financial Officer Linda Huber on an earnings call Friday. But the deal pipeline is starting to slow for speculative-grade issuers whose debt is viewed as riskier.

 We see two classes of issuers. Those with higher quality secular grade names have access and those with lower ratings don't," Ms. Huber said.

Moody's reported quarterly profits of $217.9 million, or $1.09 a share, a decline from the prior year's $236.3 million, or $1.12 a share. Revenue fell 1.3% to $865.9 million. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters projected earnings of $1.05 a share on revenue of $856 million.

For 2016, Moody's anticipates revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range and earnings of $4.75 to $4.85 a share. Analysts had forecast earnings of $5.01 a share on 6% revenue growth.

Moody's expects investment-grade issuance this year to be flat, while high-yield and leveraged-loan debt deals are projected to fall 15% and 10%, respectively.

The dynamic has prompted Moody's, which gets paid to rate bond deals offered by banks or companies, to adopt a muted earnings outlook for 2016 that falls below analysts' projections. Investors sold off Moody's shares on Friday, sending shares down 4.5% to $83.20 in midday trading.

Moody's 2016 guidance  leaves something to be desired" and  management seems to be acknowledging market pressures," said Alex Kramm, an analyst for UBS, in a note to investors.

McGraw Hill Financial Inc., the parent company of Moody's rival Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, said Thursday it expected a 1% decline in global debt issuance in 2016. McGraw Hill CEO Douglas Peterson said"http://www.wsj.com/articles/mcgraw-hill-plans-to-shed-family-name-after-128-years-1454581801" that spreads for lower-rated issuers  have recently widened significantly," with triple-C-rated credits trading at yields of around 12.25% above market benchmarks. That compares with the most highly rated issuers facing yields of around 1%, Mr. Peterson added.

 There's a lot of volatility right now," Mr. Peterson said.

Moody's CEO Raymond McDaniel in the company's earnings call said the trailing 12-month default rate for high-yield debt was around 3%. But Mr. McDaniel expects that level to increase to 4.5% by the end of this year.

In the most recent quarter, revenue at the Moody's Investors Service unit, the biggest revenue driver, fell 4% to $544.6 million. The company said it was flat on a constant currency basis.

In the analytics division, which provides financial data and other types of market intelligence to investors and banks, revenue grew by 3% to $321.3 million.

U.S. revenue edged up 1% to $481.2 million, while foreign revenue fell 4% to $384.7 million. Revenue generated outside the U.S. fell to 44% of total revenue, compared with 45% in the quarter last year.

Investors rely on the bond grades issued by Moody's, S&P and Fitch Ratings. Collectively, they issue about 95% of ratings globally, a total virtually unchanged from before the financial crisis.

World Rates: BOJ Confounds the Robots

TOKYO -- Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda stunned economists and investors last week when he set negative interest rates for the first time. He also stumped a pair of artificial-intelligence programs.

Nomura Securities Co. and Credit Suisse Securities last year created AI programs to analyze BOJ statements for clues to possible shifts in monetary policy. They use a process called text mining on central-bank statements and economic assessments over time to create an index measuring BOJ "sentiment."

The AI programs have very short track records by which to judge them. But Nomura and Credit Suisse recently pointed to readings in October as evidence of their objectivity and usefulness. Both indexes indicated a limited risk of BOJ action then, even though economists' expectations of additional easing were relatively high. In fact, the central bank stood pat.

The results of the BOJ's policy meeting last week, though, count as a miss. Both indexes gave little indication that BOJ board members might hold the view that additional monetary easing was necessary, but the central bank rocked financial markets with a surprise introduction of a rate of minus-0.1% on some deposits in its vaults.

Mr. Kuroda's fake-out of the two programs suggests that computers aren't going to replace human analysts soon.

Both securities firms use the indexes to augment, not replace, human analysis. Credit Suisse said its AI has only a "decent level of indicative value" and only in the nearer term.

Credit Suisse economist Takashi Shiono said the firm has decided to tweak its program after the BOJ's decision last week. He said it is testing a new version of the AI program that incorporates more up-to-date data, including oil and stock prices, as well as more recent statements from Mr. Kuroda.

Nomura is revamping its AI program by including outlook reports, which the central bank will release every quarter, as well as summaries of board members' opinions released about a week after each policy-board meeting, said Yuhki Yamamoto, the brokerage's senior quantitative analyst.

Complicating matters, for humans and algorithms, is Mr. Kuroda's misdirection, apparently for maximum market impact. Ahead of meetings in October 2014 and last week, Mr. Kuroda insisted there was no need for additional easing -- right up until the central bank announced additional easing. He had denied repeatedly in recent weeks that the BOJ was even considering negative rates.

But, "If he tells a lie repeatedly, the AI will learn it," Credit Suisse's Mr. Shiono said.

Back: Crisis-Era Mortgage

By Kirsten Grind

Wall Street wants to bring back the "low-doc" loan.

These U.S. mortgages, which are given to borrowers that can't fully document their income, helped fuel a tidal wave of defaults during the housing crisis and subsequently fell out of favor.

Now, big money managers including Neuberger Berman, Pacific Investment Management Co. and an affiliate of Blackstone Group LP are lobbying lenders to make more of these "Alt-A" loans -- or even buying loan-origination companies to control more of the supply themselves -- according to people familiar with the matter.

Years of easy-money policies by central banks and ultralow interest rates are pushing investors to seek out riskier assets with higher yields, such as these Alt-A loans. Many of these loans come with interest rates as high as 8%, compared with an average of about3.8%for a typical 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. While such relatively high rates for Alt-A loans are attractive to investors, they have proved prohibitive to many would-be borrowers.

Banks have largely stayed clear of the market, putting small and medium-size lenders at the forefront of making these mortgages. Virtually none of these Alt-A loans are being sliced and packaged into securities. Instead, private-equity firms, hedge funds and mutual-fund companies are playing a larger role as buyers, placing the loans into private funds that are sold to institutional investors and wealthy clients.

Unlike some of the most egregious crisis-era loans, the new iterations require borrowers to show good credit and substantial assets or income, even if they can't produce verification of annual wages. Still, there are no regulatory guidelines outlining what constitutes an Alt-A -- or, officially, an "Alternative A" -- mortgage, and each lender has its own requirements.

There has also been a rebranding effort: Most lenders prefer to call these products "nonqualified mortgages" due to the stigma attached to the Alt-A category.

By backing these loans, money managers said they would reach an underserved corner of the housing market: borrowers who have good credit but might be self-employed or report income sporadically. In part because more Americans work that way, some money managers expect the market could increase to hundreds of billions of dollars each year, or more than 10% of the total mortgage debt outstanding.

New York-based Neuberger Berman and Pasadena, Calif.-based Western Asset Management, a division of Legg Mason Inc., are planning to roll out new private funds that invest in Alt-A mortgages in coming months, according to people familiar with the plans. Anup Agarwal, head ofasset-backed securities at Western Asset Management, said he spends "a pretty good amount of time" traveling around the country to find lenders that aren't only willing to make Alt-A loans but have the right set of borrowers.

"This is a pretty niche product, and the reality is it's not easy to do," Mr. Agarwal said.

Most mortgages in the U.S. are made to prime, A-rated buyers, according to strict standards for down payments, loan size and income documentation set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy the bulk of mortgages in the U.S.

Alt-A loans, which don't require that all those standards be met, gained prominence in the years leading up to the financial crisis, with lenders originating $400 billion at their peak in 2006, according to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.

Derided as "liar loans," they were often extended to people who had no proof of income. By February 2010, about 26% of Alt-A mortgages were 90 or more days delinquent, up from 2% three years earlier, according to CoreLogic, a real-estate data and analytics company. That is much higher than conventional conforming mortgages, which saw delinquencies of 7.2% in February 2010, up from 1.4% three years earlier.

The generation of Alt-A loans has been minimal since then. Just $17 billion in Alt-A loans were originated in 2014, compared with $767 billion forconventionalmortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, which estimates that $18 billion to $20 billion were made in 2015.

Some lenders remain reluctant to jump in. Quicken Loans Inc., the second-largestconsumer lender in the U.S. by mortgage volume, considered getting into Alt-A mortgages but decided against itbecause of the regulatory environment, said Bob Walters, the company's chief economist.

"You put yourself at a higher level of risk, and we haven't gone through this to see how it's going to work out," Mr. Walters said.

To drum up supply, Neuberger Berman executives have met with a handful of mortgage firms in recent weeks to try to form a partnershipto make Alt-A loans, people familiar with the matter said.

Money managers want to bankroll the loans while relying on the mortgage firms to handle the process with borrowers, basically acting as a lender, "one step removed from the process," one of these people said.

Rather than find lenders to make the Alt-A loans, Minneapolis-based alternative-asset manager Varde Partners Inc. last October bought a mortgage company that will do it for the firm.

The company likes "having control and visibility over the process," according to a person familiar with the matter.

The efforts underscore a shift in how riskier mortgages are made and sold on Wall Street. Before 2008, large banks would generally make the loans then package them into bonds that they sold to investors.

That market shriveled after the crisis. The Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law required somepackagers of mortgage-backed securities to hold some of the loans.

In addition, Dodd-Frank creates a harbor for all mortgages that meet government guidelines. Any mortgages that fall outside those rules, such as Alt-A loans, are vulnerable to lawsuits from borrowers, which adds to the risk for lenders.

The money managers think that risk is manageable with rigorous underwriting, but it isn't clear if borrowers are as enthusiastic about the revival of Alt-A loans.

W.J. Bradley Mortgage Capital LLC, a Denver-based mortgage firm, realized a disconnect last year when it began offering Alt-A mortgages and hard-to-finance loans to condo buyers for the first time.

After several months, the company had made no loans. Borrowers felt interest rates as high as 7% were too high, said Chief Operating Officer Dan Baruch. The lender is trying again now that investor demand for the product has recently increased. It is in talks with investor partners to offer Alt-A mortgages with interest rates of about 5%.

Malaysia funds sell London property stakes; State investors

Investors look to bank gains and boost a domestic economy rocked by corruption claims

Malaysian state investment funds are cashing out of lofty positions in the London property market, in a sign of the country's growing financial woes as it grapples with claims of multibillion-dollar corruption involving government companies .

The health of Malaysia's state sector is coming under growing scrutiny after Swiss authorities last week said an investigation into bribery allegations linked to the 1MDB investment fund had thrown up "serious indications" that $4bn had been misappropriated from government businesses.

At least three funds active in London property appear to have some exposure to 1MDB's multibillion-dollar debts, although there is no evidence of wrongdoing at any of them. All face calls from the government to invest more at home to jump-start growth after the plunge in world oil prices and the value of the Malaysian ringgit.

The London property investors are also taking the chance to bank big gains, as evidence mounts that prices for commercial buildings are coming off highs.

"It's no secret that Malaysian funds . . . are having to repatriate money. We've definitely seen a trend of them selling," said Richard Divall, head of cross-border capital markets at Colliers, the real estate advisers. "But they got into London very, very early [after the financial crisis] so they are making huge profits."

Malaysian institutions invested particularly heavily in London property from 2010 to 2012, highlighting both the market's attractiveness and the ties between Southeast Asia's third-largest economy and the UK, the former colonial power.

Malaysian funds have spent 2.4bn on London commercial property since 2011, according to Real Capital Analytics, a real estate data company.

But a symbol of the turning tide is the sale under way of 88 Wood Street by the Kumpulan Wang Persaraan pension fund. Kwap paid 215m in 2013 for the 18-storey City of London office building designed by Lord Rogers' architecture practice.

Kwap had already last year raised 210m from the sale of One Sheldon Square in Paddington, which it owned jointly with the Malaysian state Employees Provident Fund, according to RCA. EPF is marketing the Fleet Street headquarters of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, which it bought in 2011 for 148m and which the law firm continues to occupy as a tenant.

Outside the Square Mile, Lembaga Tabung Haji, the government fund for Muslim pilgrims, sold an office building at 151 Buckingham Palace Road in October for about 250m - 22 per cent more than it paid two years earlier. Other foreign investors have started to shift away from central London commercial real estate after prices reached record highs. But the Malaysian move is a reminder of how events overseas could be worsening the vulnerability of the London market.

One driver of the sales is the Malaysian government's request for state institutions including Kwap to provide capital to help fund a Rm20bn ($4.8bn) share-buying spree. The programme is aimed at boosting confidence in an economy battered by the energy price fall, high consumer debt and allegations of misappropriation of money from 1MDB, which the fund denies.

Kwap and EPF had exposure between them of more than Rm3bn to 1MDB as of March last year, while Tabung Haji invested almost Rm1bn in a bond issue by the fund, according to Malaysian media reports. 1MDB says its position is much healthier after it announced billions of dollars of asset sales over the past few months to stave off a cash flow crisis and help cut debt that by 2014 had ballooned above $11bn. More pressure on Tabung Haji was revealed by reports last week that the central bank had warned the fund its financial situation was precarious, because its liabilities exceeded its assets. Tabung Haji did not deny being warned, but said its position was strong and stable.

Tabung Haji made further unwelcome news last week after it emerged that Mohamed Apandi Ali, Malaysia's attorney-general, had been appointed as a director. Mr Apandi Ali last week cleared Najib Razak, the prime minister, of criminal wrongdoing over $680m paid by an unnamed foreign source into his personal bank account.

The national anti-corruption agency has asked for a review of the decision by Mr Apandi Ali, who said the money was a private donation from the Saudi Arabian royal family. The Swiss authorities have said Mr Najib is not a suspect in their investigation.

The Malaysian funds and the central bank did not respond to questions submitted by the Financial Times.

Malaysian developers remain active in residential development. But concerns have grown about a further possible exodus, particularly around the Battersea Power Station development.

Global Finance: Technology Reads BOJ Tea Leaves --- Artificial intelligence  is new tool, but the central bank does the unexpected sometimes

TOKYO -- Investors have spent a lot of time analyzing Bank of Japan statements for clues to its monetary-policy decision Friday. Two firms in Tokyo say they also have computers on the job.

Nomura Securities Co. and Credit Suisse Securities said recently they have artificial intelligence crunching the text of BOJ economic assessments to supplement their human employees' judgment regarding possible policy shifts.

As it turned out, the Bank of Japan did the unexpected on Friday by introducing a negative-interest-rate policy as a sputtering economy, low inflation and turbulent financial markets threaten to undermine Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic-revival plan. The central bank cut its deposit rate on cash deposited by commercial banks in excess of required reserves to minus 0.1% from 0.1%.

Nomura and Credit Suisse have joined data analysts -- including social scientists, journalists and central bankers themselves -- in the growing use of algorithms to quantify text in search of insights into sentiment.

Such text mining, or natural-language processing, might parse BOJ statements for the frequency of words such as "inflation," or phrases such as "weakening expectations."

Credit Suisse said it has created a numerical indicator of the likelihood the BOJ will ease monetary policy.

Designing the indicator, the BOJ Text Index, involved using an algorithm to analyze more than three million Japanese characters contained in 2,400 pages of BOJ statements and reports -- as well as speeches and news conferences by the BOJ governor -- from January 2010 through December 2015.

The program learns as it goes, checking the correlation between keywords for economic or price conditions and keywords indicating concerns or negativity.

Nomura also uses deep learning, in which software mimics human neurological functions, to study and interpret the BOJ's views. The Nomura AI economic-sentiment index is based on analysis of the BOJ's monthly economic reports.

Nomura's research group had been experimenting with AI for about a year and a half, analyzing information from sources such as corporate-financial reports, chat boards and news articles. Last summer, the team decided it was ready to apply the technology to macroeconomic analysis.

Yuhki Yamamoto, Nomura's senior quantitative analyst, who led the project, said AI analysis offers a higher level of objectivity, partly by eliminating human discretion about what words should be analyzed or given more weight.

Credit Suisse cautioned that its index provides only a "decent level of indicative value," and only in the nearer term, and should be used to augment human analysis.

Still, its indicator, which wasn't yet in place, would have flagged a "high chance" of additional BOJ action in October 2014, when the central bank shocked markets with a big expansion of its easing program, Credit Suisse said in a recent report. And it pointed to a limited chance in October last year, when many were predicting action but the central bank stood pat, Credit Suisse said.

Similarly, Nomura's index also had shown an uptick in the central bank's economic assessment before last October's meeting.

"Some market participants had held on to their wrong expectation for easing even though the BOJ's economic sentiment was improving," said Nomura economist Yoshiyuki Suimon.

Of course, central bankers are hardly forthright when talking about their intentions for monetary policy. Sometimes the BOJ comes out of left field, as it did in December when it announced "supplementary measures" to augment its easing program or does the unexpected as it did Friday.

Neither firm's indicator pointed to an expansion of easing Friday, but because they only cover BOJ statements through the most recent monetary-policy meeting, they don't reflect the effects of recent global-market turbulence, which has resulted in the yen gaining strength and Tokyo shares tumbling in recent weeks.

Yutaka Matsuo, an AI expert and a project associate professor at the University of Tokyo, said he doubted that AI-based analysis will become dominant in the financial sector soon. He said he is hopeful such technology will become available within the next 10 years.

The BOJ itself is among central banks watching developments in the field of computational-text analysis, although it is still premature to say it can be useful in policy making, said Seisaku Kameda, head of the economic and financial-studies division at the BOJ's Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies.

Mutual-Fund Fees Tumble Toward Zero --- 'Loss leaders' boost returns but come with new risks; gasps at Goldman

Corrections & Amplifications

A $10,000 investment in a fund with annual costs of 0.03% would grow to $56,949 in 30 years if its portfolio earned an average of 6% annually before costs. A Page One article Thursday about mutual-fund fees incorrectly said it would reach $59,949.

(WSJA Feb. 1, 2016)

(END)

In November, asset manager BlackRock Inc. said it would slash by more than 50% the annual expenses charged to investors in an exchange-traded fund that aims to mimic the performance of the entire U.S. stock market.

By the end of the day, executives at rival Charles Schwab Corp. had matched the price cut. In December, Vanguard Group announced fee cuts of as much as 25% at dozens of its funds.

The cost of investing is tumbling toward zero for some basic portfolios of stocks and bonds as firms duel for customers. The slide has been under way for years but is accelerating as the industry's biggest companies target increasingly cost-obsessed investors.

More than 100 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds now cost $10 or less per $10,000 invested, up from 40 in 2010, according to Morningstar Inc.

BlackRock's move left its ETF with annual expenses of 0.03% and sharply reduced fees at six other funds. Schwab has responded with cuts nearly a dozen times in the past three years.

"That's pretty much the first and only thing I look at: the expenses," says Brolin Walters, a credit-risk analyst at a financial-services firm in Virginia who manages his own investments and recently put more money in BlackRock's iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF.

He pays 0.03%. "If you can do it cheaper than the next guy, then yours is the one I want," says Mr. Walters.

Overall, the average fund tracked by Morningstar charges 1.07%, down from 1.22% in 2005. The steepest slide has been at passively managed mutual funds and ETFs that try to track broad indexes at a fraction of the cost of human money managers who handpick investments.

The consequences are more complicated than they might seem at first. While lower expenses leave people with more money to amass for retirement and other uses, nearly free funds are equivalent to the loss leaders sold by supermarkets as come-ons, some money managers and analysts say.

They say bargain-basement funds help get investors in the door, where they can be pitched pricier portfolios that often are riskier, too.

The strategy is "taste the honey and come in so we can show you all our other products," says Rick Ferri, founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC, an independent financial-advisory firm in Troy, Mich.

Fund companies say the slide toward zero is a huge benefit for investors, many of whom can benefit from a combination of low-cost, plain-vanilla funds and more-complicated ones that offer exposure to niche markets.

But declining costs are pressuring the industry's profit margin, which slipped to 22% in last year's third quarter from 25% a year earlier, according to consulting firm DST Kasina, part of DST Systems Inc.

Fund expenses cover the sponsoring company's costs of investment research, sales and marketing, and other services.

Only the largest asset managers have the operating efficiencies needed to eke out a profit on funds that charge 0.03% or less, so the pressure to get even bigger has become more intense than ever. Firms that use portfolio managers to choose stocks and bonds face an especially brutal squeeze.

Even though actively managed mutual funds did better overall last year than market-cloning competitors for the first time since 2012, clients pulled about $200 billion from actively managed stock and bond funds in 2015, according to Morningstar data. Passively run funds attracted roughly $400 billion.

Actively managed U.S. stock funds suffered their worst annual outflow ever. As costs keep declining, traditional money managers "aren't going to be able to compete" unless they are able to outperform passive funds, says Mark Wiedman, global head of BlackRock's iShares business.

The race to zero has been accelerated by several forces. The Federal Reserve's low-interest-rate policy slashed the income on bonds and cash, making high fees stick out like sore thumbs, analysts say. Young investors are acutely focused on costs and skeptical of advice. And even older investors who were accustomed to putting money into traditional funds felt burned by devastating losses in 2008 and 2009.

Steve Deschenes, head of client analytics and research at the Capital Group Cos., says human stock and bond pickers suffered from an "asymmetry of blame" during the financial crisis. Capital Group is the parent of American Funds, where investors withdrew about $250 billion from 2008 to 2013. Its mutual funds have about $1.1 trillion in assets.

"If you held index funds, you said: 'I held the market, so I expected to lose money in a decline,' " he says. "But if you held money in an active fund, you said: 'My manager didn't sidestep the decline.' "

Some money managers that get much of their revenue from actively managed funds are fighting back, partly by getting more vocal about the potential risks of index investing. They say the strategy forces investors into risky bonds or pricey stocks just because they are part of a benchmark.

AllianceBernstein LP has increased its marketing of actively managed strategies for assets such as high-yield bonds. The firm hasn't cut its fees. "We're not surprised at all to see passive managers compete on fees because that's their only differentiator," said Chris Thompson, AllianceBernstein's head of distribution for the Americas.

For investors, small savings on fees can make a big difference in the long run.

Securities and Exchange Commission economist Timothy Riley calculated in a study released in September that investors could save $25 billion a year -- or more than $200 per household in the U.S. -- by switching from actively managed mutual funds to passive ones seeking to replicate an index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 or Barclays Aggregate Bond Index.

A decade ago, a $10,000 investment in the average actively managed U.S. stock fund cost $97 a year. The stake would grow to $43,591 after 30 years, assuming an average annual return of 6% in the stock market. In the past decade, the stock market had a 7.3% average annual return.

The same $10,000 investment in a fund with annual costs of 0.03% would swell to $59,949 in 30 years.

Samuel Lee, founder of Severian Asset Management LLC, a financial-advisory firm in Chicago, says the biggest asset managers are trying to promote a few dirt-cheap ETFs that establish "a reputational halo of low cost." Costs on other ETFs and mutual funds are being held steady or even climbing, say some industry analysts and executives.

Last year, fund firms launched 117 ETFs that cost more than 0.5% but only 21 with expenses of 0.1% or less, according to Morningstar.

ETF providers say higher-cost funds typically offer exposure to markets or strategies that are specialized, complex and otherwise would be even more expensive for individual investors.

Still, there is no doubt that dirt-cheap funds are sending shock waves through the financial industry. Some executives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gasped at a meeting last fall when the company's asset-management unit introduced a new ETF with annual fees of just 0.09%, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF relies on computer models to form a relatively static portfolio of stocks and is designed to beat the market by using such factors as "value," or stocks trading at cheap prices, and high profitability.

The new fund aims for returns that beat the S&P 500. Its rock-bottom fees undercut one of the world's largest ETFs, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which charges 0.0945% a year. That fund is managed by a unit of State Street Corp. State Street says it hasn't changed the fund's fees.

Goldman's U.S. large-cap stock ETF also costs about one-fourth as much as some rival "smart beta" funds that hold broad baskets of assets selected by criteria other than market value alone, according to the firm. The ETF has attracted more than $250 million in assets so far.

Like many other investment firms, Goldman also is competing against itself. Its asset-management unit is best known for hands-on attention to pension funds, wealthy individuals and advisory firms that cater to rich investors.

"Clients have asked for this product and we are agnostic about whether its growth comes from new or existing clients," a Goldman spokesman says.

Goldman's launch "got a lot of their competitors fretting over the direction things are headed," says Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar.

Marie Chandoha, chief executive of Schwab's investment-management unit, says the company was late to the game when it launched its first ETF in 2009. It decided to compete on price.

She says ultralow fees make ETFs more attractive as "portfolio building blocks" for the financial advisers who keep more than $1 trillion in client assets at Schwab.

The seven funds that BlackRock cut fees on in November provide basic exposure to broad swaths of the stock and bond markets. Such funds hold 22% of the firm's ETF assets. Overall, BlackRock has $4.65 trillion in assets, ranking it the largest asset manager in the world.

Mr. Wiedman of BlackRock says ETFs can be profitable even when their fees are low because of immense asset size. "We are in the business of increasing earnings," he says. "Over time, the revenue growth from volume will outstrip the price cuts in these products."

For example, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market fund would bring in annual revenue of roughly $800,000, based on expenses of 0.03% and recent assets of $2.7 billion. The equivalent fund at Vanguard has about $400 billion in assets.

BlackRock's fund got $302 million in new investor money from Nov. 10 to Jan. 26. The average net monthly inflow since the fee-cut announcement jumped nearly 50% compared with the first 10 months of 2015. Some of the increase reflects seasonal factors such as portfolio rebalancing and trading for tax reasons, a spokesman says.

Meanwhile, higher expenses on other BlackRock funds are helping to subsidize funds that have cut investor fees. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF, which aims to track an index of Japanese stocks, has nearly $20 billion in assets and charges investors 0.48%, meaning it pulls in close to $100 million a year.

Fee-cutting pressure is likely to remain relentless. Vanguard automatically lowers fees as its funds grow. The firm manages about $3 trillion in assets.

Chairman and Chief Executive F. William McNabb III says Vanguard's unusual ownership structure limits its ability to offer loss leaders with fees that are lower than their operating costs.

Instead, the firm has spent much of the last year looking for savings in technology, back-office infrastructure and other areas. It recently encouraged holders of brokerage and mutual-fund accounts to consolidate them.

The only escape from the how-low-can-you-go strategy is by tempting investors with higher-fee funds that offer at least the potential to be worth it.

Since the start of 2014, nearly 200 "liquid alternative" mutual funds have been launched to package commodities, currencies and hedge-fund-like strategies into investments for the masses.

Morningstar says the average annual fee on such funds is 1.67%, compared with 1.22% for the average active fund and 0.68% for index funds.

The First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 ETF holds five other specialized funds at a time and can juggle those holdings as short-term indicators recommend changes. The fund, run by First Trust Advisors LP, is less than two years old and charges 0.94% a year.

The ETF outperformed the S&P 500 by more than five percentage points in 2015 and had nearly $5 billion in assets at its peak late last year. Since Jan. 1, it has declined along with the overall stock market and now has $3.8 billion in assets.

Ryan Issakainen, ETF strategist at First Trust, says the fund offers a sophisticated strategy at lower cost than most mutual funds provide.

While investors often are paying less than ever for some mutual funds and ETFs, they need to be careful, says Matt Hougan, chief executive of research firm ETF.com. "It's going to be like trying to eat healthy in a junk-food restaurant," he says. "There's going to be a lot of temptation."

Move over back office service centres. Farewell also to Irish domestic banks with global expansion plans. Innovation and research and development has become Ireland s best bet at earning a place on the global financial services map.

Citigroup, MasterCard and State Street are among the big names in US financial services to have picked Ireland for R&D projects that will help shape the future of their global businesses.

At the same time, the Dublin start-up scene has many companies offering complex solutions to investment banks and hedge funds overseas, while other newcomers are working in cutting-edge fields such as blockchain and online payments.

 Ireland definitely has a greater concentration of financial services and global technology companies than most other countries of a similar size,  says Sean Croston, head of IT at Irish brokerage Goodbody s.

Susan Dargan, head of State Street Global Services Offshore, says the country has been an obvious location for the funds administration group to develop projects for more than 20 years. Last month, it launched a new financial technology research centre at University College Cork and China s Zhejiang University.

Ms Dargan credits Ireland s appeal to the scale of its international financial services sector and the  breadth of the technology sector , which includes the European headquarters of internet powers such as Facebook, Ebay and Google.

Many point to the country s low-tax environment as an attraction for large corporations seeking a base in the EU. But Ireland s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate   the lowest in a developed English-speaking country   is  not a significant differentiator  for State Street, she says. State Street hopes the Cork project will bear fruit in areas such as assessing the development of virtual and crypto currencies. New insights into investor behaviour, and their willingness to use new technologies such as robo advisers offering wealth management with minimal human intervention, are also on their wish list.

MasterCard has already rolled out an application from its Dublin fintech lab   a new mobile payment system that is being introduced in leisure and drinks venues around the world, including sports venues. The technology, known as Qkr!, allows customers to use smartphones to settle bills through an app to which the venue must also sign up. Venues include UK restaurant chains such as Carluccio s, Wagamama and Ask Italian, alongside some US sports stadiums.

Citi has also rolled out systems developed in Dublin across the world. Its Innovation Lab, founded in 2009, now has 70 full-time employees working on projects for Citi s corporate bank, which has no operational presence in Ireland.

Emmett Kilduff, a former Morgan Stanley banker who founded a Dublin fintech firm in 2012, can relate to having an overwhelmingly international client base.

Mr Kilduff s Eagle Alpha trawls the internet for  data-driven actionable information , which it sells to investor clients. If customers are tweeting product reviews, Eagle Alpha s 20-strong team can analyse the implications for listed companies. They also comb other social media and online signals such as the frequency of Google searches.

 There isn t any other firm globally that provides asset managers with our three types of output   research, analytics and data,  says Mr Kilduff.  We are a tech company at heart. 

A few miles down the road, Donal Gallagher s Quaternion Risk Management has developed open source software for valuing complex derivatives which he says is the only one of its kind in the world. Mr Gallagher is a former executive at the defunct German-Irish Depfa bank who struck out into fintech in 2010. The firm also does consulting

Mr Gallagher had the idea for the company after being horrified by how poorly banks understood the risks they were taking on. Quaternion has grown from two founders to 25 people in Dublin and two in New York and Boston. So far, their clients are mainly in London and Germany but its founder sees potential for growth further afield.  We re just at the start of a new five-year plan,  he says.

Terry Clune, who developed Taxback.com into the world s biggest sales tax refund processor, has similarly ambitious hopes for TransferMate, which he co-founded in 2010. He is attempting to raise  ¬25m for the business, which aims to exploit a global network of licences and bank accounts allowing it to handle a range of foreign exchange transactions in a single day at fees Mr Clune says are less than half those charged by banks. He believes his new business can be bigger than "https://www.taxback.com/en/about-us/", which has expanded to 23 countries with 875 employees.

Ireland has pushed to secure a niche in the global financial services sector before. But back-office jobs, which Ireland worked so hard to win, are also moving to cheaper centres in eastern Europe and Asia. Ireland s distressed banks were also forced to abandon international expansions after a series of devastating losses and bailouts.

Even so, fintech s legion of proponents insist their boom is here to stay.

Rise of big data  tools transforms business intelligence

For the past 50 years, the scattered, unreliable state of data about African business and finance have deterred access to capital and hampered growth.

Now, an array of big-data tools have sprung up to help transform the process for users, including farmers, small-business owners and international stakeholders looking to invest in the region.

"You used to have to go and spend an enormous amount of resources to go on the ground and get information about potential investments or business partners," said Greg Cohen , co-founder of Asoko, the Africa-focused data company.

In November, Asoko raised $1.3m in seed funding from North Base Media, whose partners include the former chief operating officer of Reuters and the ex-managing editor of the Wall Street Journal. The company will use the funds to deepen its research and analysis of over 1,000 privately held companies in Africa and reduce the cost of doing business.

Asoko's fundraising followed Knife Capital's launch in September of Yue-Diligence, an automation platform that helps start-ups become "investor ready" by making the initial due diligence process quicker and cheaper.

Another company trying to facilitate investment is Gro Intelligence, which provides data analytics on agriculture markets, from basic information, such as the production of a country's most important crop, to weather and environmental analyses.

Sara Menker , chief executive of Gro Intelligence, said understanding of agriculture has been "stuck in the 1960s for years", but "today you can create really interesting data products that very large numbers of people can access easily and it doesn't have to be limited to a select few who have the ability to pay a lot".

Since it was founded in 2012, Gro Intelligence has expanded from an exclusively African focus to cover markets around the world. But Ms Menker warns against getting caught up in the excitement that can surround any positive news about African business.

"There is a lot of hype" around the African venture world, Ms Menker said, adding, "there are many who are interested but not quite ready to pull the trigger on actually investing or the size of the cheques are too small."

Despite an increase last year, information technology has still accounted for only 10 per cent of seed investments across Africa since 2007, according to data from the African Private Equity & Venture Capital Association.

Ms Menker said that in the past, the lack of Africa-based funds had been a problem, but some of the region's largest companies had now established internal venture capitalist funds.

Safaricom, a Kenyan mobile network that launched the mobile banking service M-Pesa, set up its Spark venture fund in 2014. The fund will offer Kenyan start-ups investments between $75,000 and $250,000, and made its first investment in November, spending an undisclosed amount in on-demand package delivery service Sendy.

In December, Safaricom was joined by WeChat South Africa, the messaging app backed by Naspers, which has announced its own $3.5m fund to support more tech start-ups.

High-frequency traders in charge at NYSE

On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, high-frequency traders are now in charge.

On Tuesday Barclays became the last of the big investment banks to relinquish the once-hallowed  designated market maker  status by selling its business to GTS, a high-speed trader that accounts for 3-5 per cent of daily cash equities volume in the US.

GTS, which also makes markets in futures, commodities and fixed income products, did not disclose the terms of the deal. However, the high-speed trader will become a designated market maker for 1,200 listed securities, including the shares of Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway, ExxonMobil, Twitter and Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company that was the biggest initial public offering ever.

Barclays  sale marks the latest move in the changing landscape of trading on the exchange. Once the epicentre of US stock trading, now just 13 per cent of shares change hands daily on  the floor . Regulatory change that paved the way for competition and the rise of automated trading ended NYSE dominance and shrunk the profits for floor traders once known as specialists.

Still, a string of technological glitches has lent support to the merits of maintaining a human touch in trading, keeping the NYSE floor alive even as other markets around the world have shut open outcry.

 The industry is transforming to a big data business,  said Ari Rubenstein, co-founder and chief executive at GTS.  It is going to be firms that invest in the technology that will be leaders in that space. 

He added that with volatility on the rise, issuers take comfort in having a human trader managing their listing and providing liquidity when needed.

 In US cash equities, what is unique about the New York Stock Exchange is that it is the only market with human judgment   with a human pilot in charge of each listing. 

In 2014 Goldman Sachs sold its DMM business to Dutch high-speed trading company IMC Financial.

In addition to GTS and IMC, the DMMs on the floor are HFT firms KCG and Virtu Financial, as well as traditional market makers Brendan E Cryan and J Streicher.

The debate as to whether floor trading should even exist nonetheless rages on. While technological problems including the 2010 flash crash raised concerns about turning over too much control to machines, a spike in volatility on August 24 last year when a majority of NYSE-listed stocks opened with delays demonstrated the limits of human traders.

Barclays  team of DMMs will become GTS employees as part of the deal.

 We continue to believe in the DMM model and in the benefits that it can bring to issuers. However, with the evolving market structure, we also believe that a firm specialising in the technology of market making, such as GTS, is best suited to enhance the NYSE DMM business,  said Joseph Mecane, managing director in the electronic equities and credit products business at Barclays.

Barclays took a role on the floor through its crisis-era purchase of Lehman Brothers, which had bought Van Der Moolen in 2007. The British bank then bought Bear Wagner from JPMorgan in 2009 and Labranche in 2010, merging all three.

SMART MONEY
Why human traders will beat the bots for a long time to come

When Garry Kasparov sat down to play the IBM Deep Blue computer the Russian chess grandmaster believed he had discovered a strategy to turn the machine's greatest strength into a weakness. Deep Blue relied on being able to compute a vast database containing games played by past grandmasters, meaning Kasparov was taking on the amassed knowledge of many of the strongest players from history all at once.

But to be able to make use of large parts of its database, Deep Blue required its opponent to play like a typical grandmaster. If Kasparov intentionally made a bizarre opening play the computer would have vast parts of its database rendered useless, as it would have fewer games to reference, and the human could regain the upper hand.

Kasparov's "man verses machine" struggle with Deep Blue is a frequent refrain in discussions about the future of financial trading , and the likelihood that ever advancing technology will render the human fund manager obsolete.

Many human investors are enduring a miserable start to 2016 as stock markets and commodity prices have slumped. At the same time some trend following computer-driven hedge funds have made double-digit returns. Is man once again on the verge of being trumped by the machine like the Russian grandmaster? The answer is no. Here are three reasons why the best human investors are likely to be able to beat the "bots" for a long time to come.

First, human investors can follow Kasparov's strategy and seek to use the strengths of algorithmic trading programmes against them. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, trend-following hedge fund computers know the price of everything, but value of nothing. Human investors who focus on value over the long term, rather than price trends, should always be able to profit.

Hedge fund computers rely on their analysis of millions of data points from past market movements to use this to predict how markets will behave in the future. Broadly speaking, when any large market moves in one direction for a period of time the trend-following computer will be able to profit from this, as many have done this month.

These computers however are not investors in the true sense of the word, but semi-automated trading bots seeking signal within market noise. Their models analyse price data, rather than creatively assessing, for example, how accurately a share that represents fractional ownership of a real business reflects the present and future value.

The ability to process millions of numbers faster than a human fund manager can tie their shoelaces provides an advantage, but it makes such models inherently prone to following the consensus. Episodes from last year, such as the collapse of Hong Kong solar group Hanergy , or the debate over the business model of Valeant , show the limits to superficial, data-based valuation methods.

Until computer traders can develop genuine artificial intelligence they will remain unable to gain an edge over the best human investors in spotting a catastrophic disruptive threat or a revolutionary emerging technology.

Second, the computer-driven hedge fund is run and designed by humans, meaning its cold-eyed technology must contend with the emotional reactions of investors who are human. When many so-called Commodity Trading Advisor hedge funds suffered large losses in 2013, their investors began to pull out their money.

This placed great emotional strains on the humans who designed them. No matter if a mathematical model shows that a large loss is statistically possible, the temptation to fiddle remains great. Even if over the long run your model will be statistically profitable, repeated large losses mean your fund will be forced to close through human weakness.

Third, the advancement and wider adoption of computer-driven trading systems may sow the seeds of their eventual obsolescence. When everyone is using the same trading strategy, no one is left with an edge - the super computers will cancel out each others' advantage.

Raw processing power may have its uses in financial markets, but until scientists develop a truly intelligent investing system, rather than a trend follower, the truly skilled human fund manager has no reason to fear.

Website launch adds to personal data debate

The battle between the public and retailers over who controls personal information is set to intensify with the launch of a data exchange website on Monday that seeks to give consumers far more say in how their details are used.

People.io will enable people to enter personal data   which could range from their gender to banking transactions   in return for credits, which can then be redeemed at advertisers supporting the site. The pilot will start in Shoreditch, an east London district popular with a younger, more tech-savvy population.

The service is designed to allow consumers to take control of their personal data   which is often exchanged between retailers irrespective of whether the public agrees or not   to determine who advertises to them and receive something in return, said Nicholas Oliver, founder and chief executive.

 You will have control over the amount of engagement and updates you receive from these businesses,  he said.  If you only want one update a day, then you ll only receive one a day. 

"http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/" is the latest battleground between the public and advertisers. People are starting to realise the extent to which information they give out   whether to social media sites or insurance companies   is being sold on without creating any benefits for consumers.

EY, the professional services group, has foretold a decline in  free-for-all access to customer data  by 2018, as the public becomes more aware of the value of their personal data.

Mr Oliver said he was in talks with a large high street bank and a multinational consumer goods company which were keen to examine how they can sift through the reams of raw data they hold to be able to offer more tailored services for their customers.

Banks, in particular, would be able to see if someone has just spent money recently at an auto-repair shop, and send them information about a loan for a new car.

Many of the high street banks and their online rivals are currently combing through data to find new ways of engaging with their customers, said Matthew Herbert, director of strategy and digital at the British Bankers  Association. The "http://theodi.org/news/open-banking-working-group-terms-of-reference", founded by industry representatives alongside data and financial technology experts at the request of the UK government, will report next week on how banks can best harness opportunities provided by big data.

People.io is one of several companies that offer to translate personal data into cash or benefits. Digi.me and CitizenMe, which launches in March, both offer a range of options for users wishing to take more control of their personal data.

Not everyone is convinced by these new schemes, however, not least by the idea of collecting all your data in one place. Sandro Gaycken, director of the Digital Society Institute at the European School of Management and Technology, warned that it was a bad idea from a security perspective. When asked whether he would be likely to sign up to a personal data marketplace, Mr Gaycken said he would  never  entrust any company or government with his private information  for a couple of bucks .

Investment groups are racing to create a thinking, learning and trading computer capable of adapting to any market conditions. Will these AI-powered machines become the Warren Buffetts of the future? By Robin Wigglesworth

Nearly three decades ago, Warren Buffett penned an annual letter to his adoring investors mocking an insidious new trend beginning to make its mark in the money management industry: the computer.

"In my opinion, investment success will not be produced by arcane formulas, computer programs or signals flashed by the price behaviour of stocks and markets," he scoffed in his 1987 annual letter . But the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, famous for his long-term strategic thinking, may have short-changed one of the great forces reshaping investment.

Gargantuan strides in computing power have revolutionised virtually every facet of modern life, and financial markets are no exception. The most successful hedge funds on the planet are now scooping up computer scientists, not economists and investment bankers with MBAs. Even staid mutual funds stuffed with the savings of baby-boomers and petrostates now eagerly harness the " quantitative" techniques enabled by modern computing and complex mathematical models.

The next frontier of this technological arms race in finance is artificial intelligence . Advances in AI research have triggered immense interest in the industry, where some believe a thinking, learning and trading computer will make even today's superfast, ultra-complex investment algorithms look archaic - and possibly render human fund managers redundant. Could the next generation's Buffett be a super-algo?

Some of the world's biggest money managers are betting on it. AI investing may sound fantastical, but as sci-fi writer William Gibson said: "The future is already here, it is just not evenly distributed." Bridgewater, the world's biggest hedge fund group, poached the head of IBM's artificial intelligence unit Watson in 2012, and last year BlackRock and Two Sigma, another rapidly growing hedge fund that uses quantitative models, hired two former top Google engineers. Headhunters say computer scientists are now the hottest property in finance.

The quantitative investment world plays down the prospect of machines supplanting human fund managers, pointing out that the prospect of full artificial intelligence is still distant, and arguing that human ingenuity still plays a vital role. But the confident swagger of the money management nerds is unmistakable. Already there are quasi-AI trading strategies working their magic in financial markets, and the future belongs to them, they predict.

"The challenge facing the investment world is that the human mind has not become any better than it was 100 years ago, and it's very hard for someone using traditional methods to juggle all the information of the global economy in their head," David Siegel , co-head of Two Sigma, one of the leading computer-powered hedge funds, said at a conference last year. "Eventually the time will come that no human investment manager will be able to beat the computer." Or, as Agent Smith put it more succinctly in The Matrix : "Never send a human to do a machine's job."

Machine learning curve

Yin Luo first learned to code when he was 11, after his father brought back to China a used Apple II computer from a business trip to West Germany in 1985. But there were no games to buy in Yichun, his home town in Heilongjiang province, so he taught himself to program and made a primitive version of Tanks , where the player shoots down randomly generated aeroplanes.

It was arduous work. The computer's lack of memory meant it crashed whenever the program coding grew too complex. He had no floppy discs, so he learnt how to store the data on cassette tapes. "I just really wanted something to play with," Mr Luo recalls.

But the experience paid off. Today, he is part of a growing tribe of brainiacs on Wall Street exploring the bleeding edge of computer science. Mr Luo is the chief "quant" (quantitative analyst) at Deutsche Bank, where his team has developed an AI algorithm that autonomously scours the financial system for investment opportunities, scraping unfathomably large data sets to unearth profitable patterns to proffer clients.

A network of 20 Linux servers is required to run the hyper-intelligent "linear adaptive style rotation" model, which is based on a "machine learning" algorithm called AdaBoost .

Machine learning is a branch of AI, itself a diffuse term that is often misused or misunderstood. While many people understand AI to mean sentient computers like the arch-villains SkyNet in the Terminator films or HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey , in practice everyday tools such as Google's language translation service, Netflix's film recommendation engine or Apple's Siri virtual assistant deploy rudimentary forms of AI.

Quants have long harnessed increasingly powerful computers to crunch numbers and find statistical signals of lucrative opportunities, but machine learning goes a step further. In essence, a machine-learning algo is a dynamic creature that scans through large data sets - such as stock prices, weather patterns, earnings call transcripts, Facebook posts or Google searches - sniffing out predictive signals in the noise.

Matthew Dixon, assistant professor of finance at the Illinois Institute of Technology, calls machine learning an "optimisation machine that minimises chaos". It can learn the difference between bananas and apples and sort them out, or even teach a computer how to play and quickly master a game like Super Mario from scratch. Machine learning can also be unleashed on "unstructured data", such as jumbled numbers but also images and videos that are usually difficult for a computer to understand.

The technique is not new, but more powerful computers mean that it can now be applied to financial markets . "It's a very promising area," Mr Luo says. "Artificial intelligence can help you find patterns a human would never see. That can give you a huge edge."

But that is not the only advantage of machine learning.

When markets undergo what industry participants call a "regime change" and trusted strategies no longer apply, one of the classic challenges for quants is that their models can often prove useless - or worse. Algorithmic trading strategies that print money one day can blow up the next.

Trading edge

A machine-learning algorithm will autonomously evolve and search for new patterns, adjusting to what works in markets that day, week or year. That means asset managers can use them as a tool to enhance their investment process, perhaps by screening for patterns undetectable by humans, or even to develop strategies and trade by itself.

For Nick Granger, a fund manager at Man AHL, a quant hedge fund, this is the crucial edge. "You see it creating intuitive trading strategies from the bottom up, switching styles according to what works," he says. "We have been successfully using machine learning for the past few years and are interested in investing in it more."

Nonetheless, machine learning has pitfalls. One of the biggest challenges for quants is a phenomenon called "overfitting", when an overly complex or badly coded algorithm finds specious correlations or false signals in the noise of data. For example, a blog called " Spurious Correlations " notes that margarine consumption is closely linked to divorce rates in Maine, and Nick Cage films to swimming pool drownings.

Even if a model works well in testing it can collapse when confronted by real markets. Moreover, new data can itself be affected by the trading algorithm, says Osman Ali, a quant at Goldman Sachs' asset management arm. "If you crunch weather data you're not affecting the weather, but if you trade markets you are affecting them."

Nor can even the most advanced AI trading algos think as creatively as a human, especially in a crisis. Brad Betts, a former Nasa computer scientist now working at BlackRock's "scientific active equity" arm, highlights the 2009 emergency plane landing on the Hudson river by Chesley Sullenberger as an example of when man trumps machine.

Indeed, some quants remain sceptical that machine learning - or AI more broadly - is a holy grail for investment. Many see it merely as a new, advanced gizmo to supplement their existing toolkit, while others argue it is largely a case of clever marketing rather than something genuinely revolutionary.

"People are always desperate to find new ways to make money in financial markets, but they don't always work. Words are cheap and buzzwords are worth nothing," says David Harding , the head of Winton Capital, a quant hedge fund. He points out that the human brain is uniquely adept at pattern recognition, "whether it is a face, a triangle or love. Investment management is perfectly amenable to being addressed by computers designed to spot patterns, but I'm not going to rush to use the latest hot algo to do so."

Future synthesis?

So will human fund managers go the way of the dodo? Perhaps not quite, but the future looks more challenging.

Two Sigma's David Siegel says managing money has become harder as markets and economies have become more complex. "Fifty years ago a human fund manager could possibly know all that was needed to know to invest well. That isn't likely any more," he argues.

Rather than a danger, he sees this as a clear boon. "One day [the global economy] could become too complicated to control and there is no guarantee it will run smoothly. But algorithms could help us understand it better. People talk about how robots will destroy the world, but I think robots will save it."

The direction of travel is clear. Investing is about information management, rational analysis and speed. That plays to a machine's strengths. But human asset managers will adapt rather than disappear. Most probably, the future of investment management will involve a synthesis of human and artificial intelligence that harnesses the power of both.

For example, while a supercomputer can now beat chess grandmasters, both can lose to a human player with the help of a standard laptop and chess simulation program. Similar combinations are the future of money management, argues Robert Frey, a former managing director at Renaissance Technologies, one of the most successful hedge funds of all time. Mr Frey now runs his own fund-of-funds and teaches quantitative finance at Stony Brook University.

"We should let the human brain do what it is good at, and let computers do what they are good at," he says. "Marrying the two is a powerful thing."

Some of the world's biggest insurers have committed more than $1bn to investing in technology start-ups as the industry attempts to catch up with other parts of the financial services sector and boost profitability.

European insurers such as Axa, Aviva and Allianz, along with MassMutual and American Family in the US and Ping An in Asia, have all set up specialist venture capital funds dedicated to investing in start-ups that may be relevant for their core businesses.

The latest deal will be announced this week, with Aviva and other investors putting 1m into AppyParking, a smartphone app that helps people to locate empty parking spaces.

Analysts said insurance has lagged behind other parts of the financial services sector when it comes to digital investment, but add that interest has picked up sharply in recent months in a bid to stay competitive and harness big data analytics.

Franois Robinet , chairman of Axa Strategic Ventures, said: "We've been investing a lot in digital and encouraging people to be innovative, but it is also important to capture innovation externally." The Axa fund initially started in France with  ¬10m to invest but now has  ¬230m to put to work globally.

Last year was a record one for such deals, according to research firm CB Insights. By November, start-up investments by insurers were 43 per cent higher than the whole of 2014 and 725 per cent ahead of 2013.

"The priority is financial return," said Eric Emmons , managing director at MassMutual Ventures. "We're running a for profit venture capital firm. Once companies are in the portfolio, we'll do what we can to make our colleagues at MassMutual aware of them."

Data have been a big focus for investment. Mr Robinet added: "Big data is a buzzword that is thrown around a lot.

"As an insurer, all we create is data and a lot of energy has gone into using it better not just to drive customer centricity but also to underwrite better."

Aviva opens 'digital garage' in bid to boost profitability; Insurance: Big data

Sector begins playing catch-up to fintech start-ups that are winning billions in investment

Few investors would associate exposed brick walls, table footie and vintage posters in London's trendy Hoxton Square with insurance.

But this "digital garage" is one of two sites set up by Aviva to explore and develop all things digital. The other, opened last month, is located in a 1930s art deco former art gallery in Singapore.

"We're being encouraged to break every rule in the book, and not feel constrained by traditional ways of doing things in the industry," says Andrew Brem , the former Asda and Carphone Warehouse executive who was brought in to run Aviva's digital strategy in December 2014. He manages about 100 people at the digital garage, from website creators to data analysts to games developers.

The FTSE 100 insurer is one of several in the sector investing in technology in an effort to harness big data analytics to help remain competitive and boost profitability.

By analysing data, for example, the company has found that pension savers tend to be better drivers, so it offers car insurance discounts to its pension customers.

Germany's Allianz announced the formation of a unit called Digital Transformation in November. Italy's Generali is also investing heavily . And in the US, insurers such as MetLife and MassMutual have committed millions to tech start-ups.

Compared with other industries, however, insurers are playing catch-up . Free of stringent regulation and legacy IT systems, fintech is booming, with start-ups attracting billions of dollars of investment as they tap into new technology providing online financial services from payments and lending to digital currencies and cross-border transfers.

"We are a little bit late to the game," says Kurt Karl, chief economist at Swiss Re. "I'd say we are two to three years behind other industries but the interest has cranked up enormously."

He attributes much of the tardiness to the nature of the industry. "It is a conservative industry. We buy 'bads' rather than 'goods' and the nature of the business makes us cautious." That, however, is starting to change. Investors poured $2.6bn into insurance tech start-ups in 2015, according to data from CB Insights, which tracks private tech investing.

"It is about now that a lot of the millennial generation are beginning to ask about insurance," says Eric Emmons, a managing director at MassMutual's venture capital fund. "They are asking why technology hasn't shown up in insurance, and who will be the first to do it."

The need to digitise and innovate is being fuelled by low interest rates, pricing pressure, regulatory change and the need to diversify.

"The industry has come under an enormous amount of earnings pressure, driven by the low interest rate environment," says Marty Lippert, head of global technology at MetLife. "The industry has to take a different view of how it operates. Efficiencies are important and we have been working hard to take costs out."

The industry is focusing on two areas. The first is the relatively dowdy world of back-office systems.

"Over the past two or three years, big insurers have been looking at legacy systems, which have been creaking at the edges," says Nigel Walsh , head of UK insurance at Capgemini. "You can't deliver modern, agile services on systems that were built 30 years ago."

Only once the basic systems have been fixed, analysts argue, can insurers really start to innovate and use "big data" to take a comprehensive look at risks across the business. Automation is also a part of the process. "There is a big opportunity in taking paper-based processes out," says Mr Lippert.

The second focus is customers. "Customers are getting more savvy," says Mr Walsh. "Expectations have gone up but insurers are not meeting those expectations."

For many insurers customer contact comes once a year - when the policy renewal is due. And few customers relish that moment.

A survey by Boston Consulting Group and Morgan Stanley in 2014 found that customers interacted less with insurers than with any other industry. They also rated their online experiences with insurers below those with other industries. This explains why so much effort has gone into doing the basics better.

At the digital garage, for example, Aviva is developing a system that allows customers to see all their Aviva products on one screen, and is also cutting the number of questions that customers have to answer before buying a product.

But the ambition to get closer to customers goes much further. Insurers see the much-hyped "internet of things" as a huge opportunity. By measuring how people drive (through telematics) or their physical activity (through wearable devices) the industry hopes that it can persuade its customers to cut out risks and so push down the cost of claims. And if they cannot be encouraged to do so, at least the insurers will be able to price risks better.

This guest post is from Lutfey Siddiqi, managing director at UBS Investment Bank, and Simon Smiles, chief investment officer for ultra high net worth at UBS Wealth Management. It s on the back of a UBS white paper for Davos, which "https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/follow_ubs/highlights/davos-2016.html".

__________

The theme of this week s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos is the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The argument is that the world has seen three industrial revolutions   mechanical production and steam power, mass production and electricity, and electronics and IT   and is embarking on an additional one in which artificial intelligence is likely to play a much greater role. As WEF founder Klaus Schwab states in his new book on the subject, the velocity, breadth and depth, and systematic impact of these changes have already set the fourth revolution apart from the third.

Some of the potential consequences have already been widely discussed. Inequality may persist as lower-skill jobs become automated. Growing digitisation may boost cyber risks. Disruptive technologies like big data and blockchain may revolutionise areas like financial services. However, what has received less attention is the degree to which the Fourth Industrial Revolution will exacerbate the current divide in fortunes between developed and emerging markets.

A key example of this is what we would term  the dollar dilemma . The US possesses many of the key attributes necessary for success in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is a hub of technological innovation and remains an attractive destination for investment, company establishment and headquartering. This creates a plausible scenario where the US dollar maintains its structural strength.

Further dollar strength would add to the difficulties of emerging market economies, whose struggles with a strong dollar are already garnering headlines. Countries maintaining dollar pegs would face extra competitive pressures. The cost of debt servicing would also rise for emerging countries and companies that have used the period of low US interest rates and broad dollar weakness since the financial crisis to increase significantly their dollar-denominated borrowing.

Elsewhere, robotics and 3D printing could also materially affect emerging market manufacturing jobs. For some economies on the cusp of joining the global manufacturing and trading system (for example in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Latin America), extreme automation in the US could have short-run negative effects on demographics and employment. Emerging markets that are yet to move from low-income to middle-income status are at risk of squandering their demographic prime.

In addition, the on-shoring of work back to the US from areas with a former labor advantage could be seen as a risk to developing nations. Extreme connectivity may shorten global supply chains. One particular implication will be the role of virtual trade in ideas and intellectual property versus traditional trade in physical goods. Relative advantages in developed market legal protections of intangible ideas may lead to on-shoring from emerging markets to the developed world initially. However, this trend may reverse over the longer term as emerging nations grow and develop their infrastructure to embrace extreme automation and connectivity.

Although cyber security dangers vary between nations, many emerging markets are more exposed. Eurasia Group s cyber risk index, which rates the threat to businesses from 1 to 100, indicates a relatively elevated risk reading of 88 for Chinese firms, versus a safe score of just 14 for Swiss firms. One caveat is that the United States, despite its relatively robust cyber environment, is considered a prestige target by foreign states and dissidents. As a result, Eurasia Group gives it a rating of 77, putting it at far greater risk than most rich nations.

Overall, however, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is expected to entail fewer headwinds for developed markets than their emerging peers.

Emerging markets have more lower-skilled workers and less flexibility to raise skills than developed markets. We have also noted the nearer-term risks of a higher US dollar due to the US  current advantage in Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies. Furthermore, the shift from physical to  virtual  trade may impact emerging market growth drivers and labour forces, at least until investment in the relevant infrastructures are made and bear fruit.

The sensitivity of global trade to global growth already seems to have declined since the global financial crisis. This is one of key reason emerging market growth has been so weak in recent times. A further decline in advanced economies propensity towards imports, along with the risk of a structurally stronger US dollar, could hit emerging markets  earnings and cost of equity at the same time. Hopefully, this disadvantage will also be a catalyst for emerging markets to invest over time and counteract it. Until then, however, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is likely to favour developed market over emerging market assets.

Private-Mortgage-Bond Market Is Recovering, but Slowly

By Joe Light

Sales of the bonds that helped spark the global financial crisis are selling at their quickest pace in five years. But investors and analysts say what is surprising about the market for private-label mortgage-backed securities isn't how strong it is, but how moribund.

Financial institutions issued $61.6 billion in private mortgage bonds in 2015, up from $54.1 billion in 2014 but a fraction of the $1.19 trillion issued at the peak of the housing boom in 2005, according to new data from Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.

What's more, most of 2015's new mortgage bonds weren't formed out of new loans but rather out of repackaged old loans, underscoring how few new mortgages are being securitized, said Inside Mortgage Finance publisher Guy Cecala. "The market's on life support," he said. More than seven years after the financial crisis began, bond issuers, ratings companies and the government are struggling to revive the private-mortgage-bond market.

Private mortgage bonds helped drive the growth of risky mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis and often carried high ratings even though the underlying loans were to borrowers with shaky credit, unverified incomes and tiny down payments.

Few in the mortgage industry want to see the riskiest loans return, but they do want to see private investors take on a greater role. Right now, the vast majority of mortgage bonds are guaranteed by the government through mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or agencies.

Many of the new securities are merely repackaged. For example, in November, Fitch Ratings issued ratings on four bonds packaged by Nomura that were made up of mortgage securities originally issued by now-defunct bank Washington Mutual.

During the crisis, some investors felt burned by bonds that weren't as safe as believed and by mortgage servicers they felt didn't always have their best interests at heart.

To help reconstruct the market, officials from the U.S. Treasury Department over the past year and a half have brought together lenders, investors, ratings firms and other stakeholders to devise new deal terms that the parties are comfortable with.

But some analysts say that the private mortgage bond market's biggest hurdle right now is that lenders think they can make more money by hanging onto loans themselves rather than by securitizing them and selling to investors.

Apart from the repackaged bonds, most postcrisis private-label securities have been filled with jumbo mortgages loans to high-quality borrowers. Large banks such as Wells Fargo & Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. lately have been happy keeping such loans on their balance sheets, restricting the supply available for securitization, said Andrew Davidson of mortgage-analytics company Andrew Davidson & Co.

On the opposite end of the credit spectrum, lenders have had trouble finding a sweet spot of borrowers who don't fit the requirements of government-backed mortgage programs and yet still are low-risk enough to be attractive to investors and meet new federal mortgage rules.

Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions in December issued $135 million in subprime-mortgage-backed securities in which borrowers paid an average rate of 7.5% but had an average credit score of 683 and down payment of 28%.

In comparison, the Federal Housing Administration backs loans to borrowers with credit scores as low as 580 and down payments of 3.5%.

"I don't know if we will ever go to the limits of when the music stopped" during the boom, said Angel Oak head of capital markets John Hsu. "Clearly that was not a place where the industry should have gone."

Some private investors say they want to take on more mortgage-credit risk but are having trouble finding ways to do it. Some investors as a result have turned to new securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Money-management firm AllianceBernstein L.P. invests in the Fannie and Freddie securities, but because of the lack of a private-label market has also turned to buying whole mortgage loans directly from lenders, a relatively cumbersome process that requires the firm to take on some of the responsibilities of managing the loans, said head of securitized assets Michael Canter.

"We want to have more mortgage credit risk in our portfolios," Mr. Canter said. "It's only because of [the PLS] breakdown that we had to venture into the whole loan space."

Aviva opens  digital garage  in technology push

Few investors would associate exposed brick walls, table footie and vintage posters in London s trendy Hoxton Square with insurance.

But this  digital garage  is one of two sites set up by Aviva to explore and develop all things digital. The other, opened last month, is located in a 1930s art deco former art gallery in Singapore.

 We re being encouraged to break every rule in the book, and not feel constrained by traditional ways of doing things in the industry,  says Andrew Brem, the former Asda and Carphone Warehouse executive who was brought in to run Aviva s digital strategy in December 2014. He manages about 100 people at the digital garage, from website creators to data analysts to games developers.

The FTSE 100 insurer is one of several in the sector investing in technology in an effort to harness big data analytics to help remain competitive and boost profitability. By analysing data, for example, the company has found that pension savers tend to be better drivers, so it offers car insurance discounts to its pension customers.

Germany s Allianz announced the formation of a unit called Digital Transformation in November. Italy s Generali is also investing heavily. And in the US, insurers such as MetLife and MassMutual have committed millions to tech start-ups.

Compared with other industries, however, insurers are playing catch up. Free of stringent regulation and legacy IT systems, fintech is booming, with start-ups attracting billions of dollars of investment as they tap into new technology providing online financial services from payments and lending to digital currencies and cross-border transfers.

 We are a little bit late to the game,  says Kurt Karl, chief economist at Swiss Re.  I d say we are two to three years behind other industries but the interest has cranked up enormously. 

He attributes much of the tardiness to the nature of the industry.  It is a conservative industry. We buy  bads  rather than  goods  and the nature of the business makes us cautious. 

That, however, is starting to change. Investors poured $2.6bn into insurance tech start-ups in 2015, according to data from CB Insights, which tracks private tech investing.

 It is about now that a lot of the millennial generation are beginning to ask about insurance,  says Eric Emmons, a managing director at MassMutual s venture capital fund.  They are asking why technology hasn t shown up in insurance, and who will be the first to do it. 

The need to digitise and innovate is being fuelled by low interest rates, pricing pressure, regulatory change and the need to diversify.

 The industry has come under an enormous amount of earnings pressure, driven by the low interest rate environment,  says Marty Lippert, head of global technology at MetLife.  The industry has to take a different view of how it operates. Efficiencies are important and we have been working hard to take costs out. 

The industry is focusing on two areas. The first is the relatively dowdy world of back-office systems.  Over the past two or three years, big insurers have been looking at legacy systems, which have been creaking at the edges,  says Nigel Walsh, head of UK insurance at Capgemini.  You can t deliver modern, agile services on systems that were built 30 years ago. 

Only once the basic systems have been fixed, analysts argue, can insurers really start to innovate and use  big data  to take a comprehensive look at risks across the business. Automation is also a part of the process.  There is a big opportunity in taking paper-based processes out,  says Mr Lippert.

The second focus is customers.  Customers are getting more savvy,  says Mr Walsh.  Expectations have gone up but insurers are not meeting those expectations. 

For many insurers customer contact comes once a year   when the policy renewal is due. And few customers relish that moment. A survey by Boston Consulting Group and Morgan Stanley in 2014 found that customers interacted less with insurers than with any other industry. They also rated their online experiences with insurers below those with other industries. This explains why so much effort has gone into doing the basics better.

At the digital garage, for example, Aviva is developing a system that allows customers to see all their Aviva products on one screen, and is also cutting the number of questions that customers have to answer before buying a product.

But the ambition to get closer to customers goes much further. Insurers see the much-hyped  internet of things  as a huge opportunity. By measuring how people drive (through telematics) or their physical activity (through wearable devices) the industry hopes that it can persuade its customers to cut out risks and so push down the cost of claims. And if they cannot be encouraged to do so, at least the insurers will be able to price risks better.

Drop in venture capital funding illustrates rising caution

Venture capital investment in US tech start-ups fell by a third in the fourth quarter to $11.3bn, signalling growing caution after a year in which it hit levels not seen since the dotcom bubble.

For full-year 2015, venture investment was $59bn, its highest level since 2000, according to the a report by PwC and the National Venture Capital Association, based on data from Thomson Reuters.

The figures come a time when investors are increasingly concerned about cooling valuations for Silicon Valley start-ups, many of which put more emphasis on growth than on profits.

The valuations of groups including Snapchat and Dropbox have been marked down by some of their mutual fund investors, underlining the change in sentiment.

Also denting confidence was the initial public offering of Square, which went public in November at a share price far below the valuation it garnered on private markets.

The drop in venture capital investment in the fourth quarter was most pronounced in sectors such as semiconductors and business services, which fell by 60 per cent and 75 per cent respectively.

However, other sectors boomed over the full year, with funds invested in financial services nearly tripling compared with 2014. Investment in the health sector increased, with life sciences deals up 12 per cent year-on-year in dollar terms in 2015, on roughly the same number of deals.

Investors in the health sector said deal activity could cool in the year ahead as the industry digests the huge investments of 2015.

 We expect 2016 may not be as large in terms of the number of companies funded,  said Ann Lamont, managing partner at Oak HC/FT, a venture capital fund focused on healthcare and fintech.  In part this is because so many companies have been created, people are going to be focused on managing and funding [those] companies. 

The groups that received the biggest investments during the fourth quarter were secretive artificial intelligence company Palantir, which raised $430m, and shopping start-up Jet.com, which raised $350m.

However, some mega-fundraising rounds that began in the year s final quarter were excluded from the data because they were not formally closed by the year end. Uber is in the process of raising $2.1bn while Lyft closed a $1bn fundraising round last week, as both spend heavily to gain share in the online ride-hailing market.

Shares in Experian climbed as much as 3 per cent this morning as the credit checker racked up some decent growth in North America in the third quarter, although currency moves wiped out the group s overall sales growth, highlighting the heavy impact the dollar rally is having on US companies.

Total revenue fell 3 per cent in the three months to December, but stripping out currency moves it rose 6 per cent. Including the impact of currency moves, sales dropped in every region except North America, but without currency moves, sales rose in every region.

In Latin America, sales rose 6 per cent ignoring currency moves, whereas reported sales fell 29 per cent, underscoring the drag exerted by the decline in emerging market currencies.

The group rather darkly explained its success in Brazil:

In Brazil, we benefited from growth across both consumer and business information, including an increasing contribution from delinquency notifications linked to higher volumes of non-performing loans.

In October the company "http://on.ft.com/1NWO79J" at one of its US servers, affecting T-Mobile.

Brian Cassin, chief executive, said:

Growth was balanced, with all four regions contributing within our targeted mid-single digit range. Strategically, we divested a number of smaller assets to further focus the portfolio and we are expanding rapidly in the key areas of Credit Services and Decision Analytics. In North America Consumer Services, we continue to see underlying improvement in trends and benefited in the quarter from one-off revenue for on-boarding of a new affinity client.

Looking ahead, our guidance for the full year is unchanged. While foreign exchange will be a headwind, at constant currency we expect organic revenue growth in the mid-single digit range, to deliver stable margins and to see further progress in Benchmark earnings per share.
