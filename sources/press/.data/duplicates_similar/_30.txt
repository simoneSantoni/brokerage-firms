It is beginning to look like a mass extinction event. In 20 years the number of US public companies has dropped by half. Initial public offerings have dived; mergers and take-privates have risen. There is every reason to mourn this fact - and look at ways to fix it. Regulators started that effort on Thursday night.

But there is also the path of acceptance, laid out in a report this week by Pantheon, an asset manager: invest more in private groups, with their "active ownership model" and "strong corporate governance".

This came in the month that Uber lost its chief executive and two directors following mishandled sexual harassment accusations. Stellar corporate governance was not in evidence at the biggest private technology company. And the same week an investor in Palantir, the data analytics company that is the fifth-highest valued "unicorn", testified about an alleged lack of transparency and trouble selling shares.

On the actual day of the report Blue Apron, the meal kit service, limped towards an IPO at a 25 per cent discount to the price mutual fund investors paid two years ago.

There is certainly a dearth of public stocks. Blue Apron's arrival boosts their number by one, but there are still only about 3,600 US-listed companies compared with double that number in 1996, as has been pointed out by such academics as Ren Stulz and bank analysts including Michael Mauboussin .

Companies that finally offer themselves to the public often do so disdainfully, with multi-class share structures and little prospect of sizeable returns for new investors. Amazon has delivered a 56,000 per cent return since it went public 20 years ago. To match that, the valuation of Snap, the owner of the instant messaging app, would have to rise to $11tn, from $20bn at its March IPO.

In this environment no wonder younger, faster-growing companies look attractive. But only wealthy individuals are allowed to play, and it can be a perilous game even for sophisticated institutions. The likes of Fidelity and T Rowe Price have dipped their toes in. But as Pantheon's Cullen Wilson notes: "Even though they are technically playing in the private market, mutual funds are getting in at the later end. There is a still a larger piece of the company lifecycle that remains significantly more difficult to access, particularly compared with 15 or 20 years ago."

Fidelity's ability to jump the queue at Blue Apron did not help at all. The mutual fund bought in two years ago at $13.33 a share. A lack of appetite among public institutions led to the IPO price being cut to $10, where it closed on the first trading day.

One response might be to get in earlier. But mutual funds are not set up like venture capitalists, which are prepared for most of their investments to fail. Instead their portfolios have to be liquid to adjust for investor panic during downturns. Portfolio managers are typically reluctant to allocate more than 2 or 3 per cent. With the private portion likely to prove difficult or impossible to sell, a fund manager facing investor flight might otherwise be forced to offload good public stocks.

Then there is the information asymmetry. Fidelity insists on quarterly financial statements and regular calls with management. Not all private investors have that clout. Marc Abramowitz, an early investor in Palantir who says he has $60m of the shares, has complained in a court filing that he and other investors were "deprived . . . of any information necessary to assess the value of their investments" and accused the data analytics company of "improperly interfering" with his attempts to sell shares.

Palantir denies the allegations and notes in its own filing to the Delaware Court of Chancery that it had first sued Mr Abramowitz for stealing trade secrets, which he denies.

Whatever the outcome of particular lawsuits, opacity and tension over share sales are a fact of life at many private start-ups. Getting in is hard enough; getting out can be impossible.

On Thursday night the Securities and Exchange Commission, under its new Republican leadership, announced a move to peel back regulations and encourage public offerings. It will allow any company to file for an IPO confidentially and then pick a good moment to press ahead, a manoeuvre previously restricted to those with less than $1bn of revenues.

The reform is tinkering around the edges. Pushing private companies to go public and discouraging delistings are likely to require more regulation, not less.

But at least someone is looking to protect the endangered species. Public markets need reviving; private companies cannot fill the gap.

What Illinois Woes Mean for You --- Individual investors and Wall Street alike are at risk of possible debt downgrade

Corrections & Amplifications

Mutual funds have sold about $100 million in Illinois general obligation bonds since the end of 2016, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. A Business & Finance article Friday about the state's debt incorrectly said funds had sold more than $2 billion of bonds, based on incorrect data received from Morningstar.

(WSJ July 1, 2017)

(END)

Illinois is locked in a political stalemate, and in danger of becoming the first U.S. state to have its debt downgraded to junk status.

S&P Global Inc. threatened to take that action if Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic Speaker of the House Michael Madigan can't agree on a package of spending and taxes by the start of the next fiscal year on Saturday.

Below is a breakdown of what this unprecedented development would mean for everyone from individual investors to large Wall Street money managers.

Who owns Illinois's debt?

Much of Illinois's $25 billion in outstanding general obligation debt is held by individual investors seeking a stable source of income, according to analysts' estimates.

But Wall Street is also exposed via mutual funds, hedge funds and insurers that purchased the state's bonds. Money-management giant Vanguard Group has $1.2 billion spread across seven mutual funds. It is the biggest holder among all mutual-fund firms that had a total of $4.5 billion in Illinois bonds, according to the most recent figures from research firm Morningstar.

What would a downgrade do to those investments?

Not much, say analysts. They predict prices would drop only a few cents in the event of a junk downgrade. The state's uninsured general obligation debt traded this week as high as 95 cents on the dollar.

Junk bonds don't usually trade near par, but state general obligation debt is considered safer because states have broad power to tax and lack the legal ability to declare bankruptcy.

Will investors still get paid?

A junk rating won't affect the state's ability to pay bondholders. State officials have said those payments are their No. 1 priority.

What does a 'junk' rating mean, anyway?

Ratings firms rank debt according to how safe an investment they believe it is. The 12 safest tiers are considered "investment grade," meaning investors have what S&P terms "adequate" protection against the risk of default. Below that, bonds are considered junk, or "speculative grade," meaning they face "large uncertainties" or "major exposure to adverse conditions," according to S&P. Investors who buy junk may earn greater profits if the bonds perform well but they also face greater danger of losses.

Are mutual funds even allowed to own junk municipal bonds?

Most mutual funds have rules limiting their investment in junk-rated debt, but when bonds drop below investment grade they may not be required to sell them. At Vanguard, mutual funds are allowed to hold a "modest allocation" of junk bonds, a spokesman said.

Vanguard's municipal bond team, a spokesman said, is "comfortable with the risk/reward" of investing in Illinois bonds.

How are investors expected to react to a downgrade?

Bonds are still likely to change hands as holders spooked by the state's deteriorating credit sell and high-yield investors take advantage of the opportunity to buy.

Mutual funds have already sold more than $2 billion in Illinois general obligation bonds since the end of 2016, according to Morningstar, andbuyers have been taking advantage of temporary dips. Howard Cure, director of municipal bond research at Evercore Wealth Management, said some of his clients might buy more Illinois bonds if prices drop further.

How would a downgrade affect Illinois?

The most immediate impact would likely be a rise in borrowing costs, making it more expensive to raise money for new projects. Analysts predict investors could demand an additional half a percentage point to a percentage point in interest, meaning the state would pay an additional $5 million to $10 million for every $1 billion it borrows. Illinois already pays a premium. When it last sold tax-exempt debt in November 2016, the state paid yields of 4.4% for 20-year bonds. In contrast, 20-year bonds issued by the state of Wisconsin around the same time yielded 2.8%.

Is Illinois on its way to becoming the next Puerto Rico?

Analysts say no, noting that Illinois's problems are largely political. Unlike Puerto Rico, which is in the midst of a court-supervised restructuring, Illinois has a strong underlying economy and annual revenues that are about 10 times its yearly debt service payments. Puerto Rico, on the other hand, has endured more than a decade of economic distress. "There's no risk of Illinois losing market access," said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics.

Will a junk downgrade spill over affect other states and cities?

It could. New Jersey and Connecticut, among the lowest-rated states after Illinois, may face more scrutiny from investors, analysts said. Both are wrestling with budget problems and mounting liabilities. But New Jersey and Connecticut still have a long way to go to match Illinois's ratings dilemma. They are rated several notches higher by S&P and Moody's Investors Service.

U.S. News: Opioid Addiction Climbs by 500% --- Study of millions of medical claims shows a surge of diagnoses in past seven years

An analysis of millions of Americans' medical claims showed diagnoses of opioid-use disorder surged roughly 500% over the past seven years, according to a review by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

The analysis, which examined the claims of more than 30 million people with commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers between 2010 and 2016, underscores the rising tide of addiction in the U.S. Opioid-use disorder is the clinical term for addiction to opioids, which include prescription painkillers and illicit narcotics such as heroin.

Twenty-one percent of the people reviewed in the analysis filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to BCBSA, with higher doses and longer-duration prescriptions associated with higher addiction rates.

Opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. And the disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration than a low dose for a long duration.

"You have to be concerned not just how long the script goes, but how high a dose you're prescribing," said David Pizza, BCBSA's managing director of strategy and data analytics. "The way in which they're provided is key to addressing the dependency issue," he said.

John Kelly, an associate professor of psychiatry in addiction medicine at Harvard Medical School, who wasn't involved in the study, said the results show "we are now at the public-health equivalent of 'DEFCON 5' with this opioid crisis."

"High-dose, long-duration prescribing practices, which can drive up rates of opioid-use disorder, are still too common. This needs much closer attention and monitoring to curb the onset of new cases of opioid-use disorder," he said.

The analysis also showed that use of medications to treat opioid addiction, such as buprenorphine or methadone, grew by 65% over the period of the study -- a rate dwarfed by the 493% increase in opioid-use disorder diagnoses.

Kim Holland, vice president for state affairs at BCBSA, said the necessary infrastructure to support people getting the treatment they need to address substance abuse effectively is lacking.

The analysis found more people with opioid-use disorder are treated with medication in New England than in the South and parts of the Midwest.

"It tells us there's work to do," said Ms. Holland. "Not everyone is getting the treatment they need."

She said opioids are an important part of a physician's ammunition to help alleviate pain.

"But to recognize potential dangers, it's important to understand the extent to which they are prescribed," she said.

Ninety-one Americans die each day from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. has nearly quadrupled since 1999, even though there has been no change in the amount of pain reported by Americans, the CDC said. Meanwhile, deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled over the period.

Chip Makers Are Cashing In on Digital Currencies, for Now; Spike in GPU chip demand for cryptocurrency mining unlikely to last

It's good to be in the graphics chip business these days. Sometimes too good.

Graphics processors, otherwise known as GPUs, have long been the mainstay of personal computers tricked out for gaming. They are also now "http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nvidia-invaded-intels-turf-1494927600" being built into state-of-the-art data centers and self-driving cars. That has been driving up the stock prices of the two largest companies in the business Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices .

But some business also comes from less-than-stable corners. Graphics chips are also useful for a task called cryptocurrency mining. So-called "miners" are computers that match and update transactions for currencies such as bitcoin and the newly popular format called ethereum. A miner can earn rewards for that activity depending on the number of transactions processed and the value of the currency. Ethereum has proven to be the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-virtual-currency-war-that-threatens-to-tear-bitcoin-apart-1497956400"; its value surged from about $8 in January to just under $400 earlier this month.

That has led to a spike in demand, as GPUs are particularly well suited for ethereum mining. Mitch Steves of RBC Capital estimates that about $100 million worth of GPU processors were added to the networks that mine Ethereum in just 11 days in early June. This has resulted in a shortage of GPU inventory, though neither Nvidia or AMD specifically market their products for this use.

AMD in particular could use all the sales it can get. Its stock price has jumped more than 20% in just the last month, based on a mix of enthusiasm about digital currency mining as well as the launch of a new server chip that will challenge Intel in a key market. Sharp gains over the last year, based on "http://www.wsj.com/articles/amd-chips-away-at-the-hype-1493675690", have driven AMD to about 95 times forward earnings a rich valuation to live up to.

But while the recent rush of GPU sales will likely help both Nvidia and AMD in their next quarterly reports, investors should still be wary. The cryptocurrency markets have long been prone to wild swings ethereum is now about 23% off its peak from two weeks ago, according to CoinDesk. And recall that a spike in GPU demand for bitcoin mining in 2013 also proved to be short-lived. There are a lot of good reasons to be positive on the market for GPU chips. Banking on cryptocurrency speculators isn't one of them.

New York Regulator Seeks Details From Life Insurers Using Algorithms to Issue Policies; Letter to about 160 insurers expressed concern about whether practices are based on sound actuarial principles, or will result in higher rates for certain consumers

New York's top financial regulator is investigating life insurers' use of big data, complicating the industry's efforts to boost sales by forgoing medical examinations in favor of algorithms for sizing up risk.

In the past few years, more life insurers have been waiving requirements for blood and urine samples when selling life insurance. Instead, these firms are relying on outside data such as credit activity, property deeds, college-attendee records, liens, evictions and other public information to give them a sense of an applicant's well-being, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-latest-gamble-in-life-insurance-sell-it-online-1484217026". These data sources are used in conjunction with health-related answers provided by consumers and longstanding industry tools such as prescription-drug databases.

On Thursday, New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo sent a letter to about 160 life insurers, asking for details about their use of new data sources, aiming to ensure practices are in line with state laws and regulations. The Journal has reviewed the letter.

In a statement, Ms. Vullo said her department "supports innovations that reduce the overall time and expense of obtaining life insurance coverage." Her concern is whether practices are based on sound actuarial principles, or will result in higher rates for certain consumers.

The department is acting as venture-capital funding has poured into insurance technology. Last year, investment firms spent $1.7 billion across 179 "insure tech" deals, according to CB Insights, a firm with a venture-capital database. The industry is seen as ripe for innovation because of its heavy reliance on traditional ways of doing business even as consumers increasingly favor online financial transactions.

The state's action shows the power that regulators hold over how and if data scientists, software engineers and other quantitative professionals get their way.

Specifically, the New York letter asks if insurers use algorithmic underwriting, and, if so, what data sources they rely on. It also asks how the information is weighted within an algorithm. The letter asks about disclosures to applicants about the data's use, and what happens with the data after underwriting is completed.

Insurers are trying to reverse decades of declining sales of individual life-insurance policies. They say that details about lifestyle such as years of residence at a single address and steady credit activity can be markers of a stable lifestyle indicating a good risk for a life insurer.

Insurers said the information is used to speed up the application process, and that they divert online applicants back to the conventional application process if issues surface with the nontraditional data. They say they obtain permission from consumers to obtain personal information. Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, databases used in underwriting must provide consumers opportunity to correct errors.

Banking & Finance: AIG Considers Making Deals, Cutting Buybacks

American International Group Inc.'s new chief executive, Brian Duperreault, said Wednesday he is open to slowing down the firm's share buybacks and instead using the capital for acquisitions.

"Shareholders want to see value creation," he said to reporters following the company's annual meeting. "If I can present them something that is better value creation than a share buyback, I won't get a hard time. "

Mr. Duperreault, a onetime lieutenant to former AIG CEO Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, was named CEO in May. His predecessor, Peter Hancock, agreed to depart following pressure from the board.

Mr. Duperreault's task is to improve AIG's profit margins after years in which it has trailed many peers. Many of its woes stem from its near collapse in the 2008 global financial crisis. A U.S. government bailout required it to sell off some prized businesses to fully repay nearly $185 billion provided by taxpayers.

Some activist investors -- including Carl Icahn, who has a representative on AIG's board -- last year called for the insurance conglomerate to improve its results by splitting itself apart. But those same investors have since given AIG some leeway to improve returns using other methods. Mr. Duperreault has promised investors he wouldn't split up AIG and instead would "grow it."

The prior CEO, Mr. Hancock, pledged to complete at least $25 billion in share buybacks and dividends over the two years ending Dec. 31. Through early May, AIG had made good on $18 billion of that pledge.

Mr. Duperreault said Wednesday he will be more receptive to other uses of the cash generated by its businesses. "I prefer to apply the capital to grow the company and create some strategic moves that ultimately benefit the shareholder," he said.

"The likelihood we would continue the [buyback] pace we've been on is low, because I think there are other things that I can use the money for," he added.

The new CEO said he didn't arrive at AIG with a specific acquisition plan or list of deals in mind. "But I'm open for business," he added.

AIG sells property and a wide range of liability insurance to businesses globally and is well known for its coverage of multinationals. It also has a large U.S.-based life-insurance and retirement-savings business and is a leading insurer of cars, homes and other property of the wealthy.

Mr. Duperreault spent 21 years at AIG before leaving in 1994 to run three other companies, including consulting and insurance-brokerage firm Marsh & McLennan Cos. and insurer ACE Ltd. Last year, ACE acquired Chubb Corp., one of AIG's biggest rivals, and now is known as Chubb Ltd.

His last stop before rejoining AIG was Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd., which he helped found in 2013 with principals of hedge fund Two Sigma Investments. Hamilton's goal was to apply computing to underwriting and pricing insurance. Since last year, AIG, Hamilton and Two Sigma have had a joint venture to sell insurance online to small businesses, using data analytics. As part of Mr. Duperreault's move to AIG, the three companies announced an expansion of that partnership.

Discretion assured as Mossad funds start-ups; Israel

Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, is setting up an investment fund for high-tech start-ups in a move that highlights the symbiosis between the country's business community and its security apparatus.

The fund would be looking for new technologies, including encrypting information at high speed, personality profiling based on online behaviour, flexible rob-otics, miniaturised systems, "all-terrain capabilities and silencing solutions for land, sea and air", a government statement said.

Mossad, which is the agency responsible for overseas operations, is also on the lookout for new methods of summarising documents, cataloguing information and extracting semantic connections using machine learning.

The fund will provide grants of up to 2m shekels ($569,000) to finance companies. It would not take equity in companies it invested in but would seek access to intellectual property created by the programmes it financed on the basis of a "non-commercial and non-exclusive licence", the government said.

"We are striving for a win-win situation and feel we have built a model that will serve both us and the entrepreneurs," it said.

The state has long invested directly in high tech through the Israel Innovation Authority, which funds start-ups and research and development. But this is thought to be the first time one of its intelligence agencies has been publicly positioned as a potential investor.

No information was available on the size of the fund. It will be called Libertad, the Spanish word for "freedom" and the name of a ship that ferried Jewish refugees from Bulgaria in 1940 to what was then Mandatory Palestine, later to become Israel.

Israel has one of the world's most vibrant tech sectors outside Silicon Valley in the US. Many Israeli start-ups that became successful internationally were launched by veterans of the Israeli military's high-tech spying and communications units. The largest and best known of these is Unit 8200 , which gathers and interprets signal intelligence on the Palestinian territories and Middle Eastern states.

Unit 8200 is believed to have co-developed, along with the US's National Security Agency, the Stuxnet worm that disrupted computers running centrifuges for Iran's nuclear programme. Veterans of the unit are omnipresent in Israeli business, and include Gil Shwed, founder and chief executive of Check Point Software, and Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze, a navigation app sold to Google in 2013 reportedly for $1.1bn.

Mossad's new fund promises discretion to the companies whose res-earch and development it funds, and says it will not publish their names or restrict them from raising other funds.

"We are committed to mutual commercial discretion and do not publicise the names of the companies we invest in," the government statement said.

In the US, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon invest in and work with Silicon Valley start-ups.

Good morning. Yesterday was frantic for WPP, which was among the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cyberattacks-hit-global-companies-in-europe-1498575793?mod=e2tw". The so-called Petya virus, a form of ransomware, infiltrated company networks and locked some computers, demanding payment in bitcoin for them to be returned back to normal.

Hack to the Drawing Board

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fallout-from-global-cyberattack-extends-into-second-day-1498639146". WPP reacted quickly and told staff yesterday morning U.S. time to log out of its network and shut down their computers as a precautionary measure. Staffers were attempting to conduct business on their cellphones, creatives were reverting back to pen and paper and some employees even

"https://digiday.com/marketing/scenes-paralysis-wpp-employees-draw-play-board-games-wake-cyberattack/" while they waited for instructions on what to do next. On Tuesday, WPP said its operations had "not been uniformly affected" and that many of its businesses were experiencing "no or minimal disruption." There have been no reports of a data breach, and WPP is working with its network service provider IBM and law enforcement agencies to get to the bottom of the issue.

 Sorrell Speaks 

WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell sent out a memo to all staff overnight, that I have reviewed, saying that "contrary to some press reports, WPP and its companies are still very much open for business." Mr. Sorrell said that a group of "highly creative, ingenious and dedicated people" should put those qualities into practice to make sure the company's clients experience no disruption. Business as usual, basically: Madison Avenue is used to long hours, after all.

Beers at Brunch

I have a general rule when it comes to alcohol: Any time after 12 p.m. is permissible. Drinking before midday is socially unacceptable unless you've not been to bed yet. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-eye-opener-beer-for-brunch-1498578974?mod=e2tw", designed to be paired with brunch, WSJ reports. Around 21% of Americans say they are likely to drink beer at brunch, according to Nielsen CGA. Brewers' efforts to magic up a new daypart for beer come as sales of the beverage are falling, both in the U.S. and world-wide. So a marketing effort is under way to convince consumers that they should ditch their Bloody Marys and complement their scrambled eggs or pancakes with flavored beer instead. "We want to make beer more sophisticated," said Felipe Szpigel, president of Anheuser-Busch's High End business unit, which includes Goose Island and Stella Artois. Fill your boots, brewers, so long as it's after noon.

If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em

Verizon, on the heels of creating its new Oath advertising and content unit to house Yahoo and AOL, is looking to "http://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-wants-t-mobile-and-vodafone-consumer-data-to-take-on-facebook-2017-6" including T-Mobile, Sprint, Vodafone and Telefnica, according to Business Insider. Oath's big pitch is that it can couple subscriber data from Verizon and user data from the likes of Yahoo and AOL mail with content brands like HuffPost and Yahoo Sports to deliver targeted ads next to quality content using its ad tech. Licensing data from rival firms would enhance Oath's location and behavioral targeting capabilities and, in the cases of Vodafone and Telefnica in particular, expand its international footprint outside the U.S. In fact, "http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/02/08/aol-uk-strikes-o2-weve-alliance-use-mobile-subscriber-data-take-challenger-status", giving Oath access to 16 million opted-in mobile subscribers.

Mixing It Up at Dstillery

A little CMO Today newsletter exclusive for you: there has been a shake-up in the top ranks at New York-based ad tech company Dstillery, which offers clients a DSP (demand-side platform) and DMP (data-management platform) combo. In September, it plans to launch a new part of the business devoted to artificial intelligence that won't just focus on advertising and customer relationship management, but other ways in which AI can help marketers make decisions. As a result of the shift, the board felt the company needed a new leadership team. CEO Tom Phillips, a former Googler who had led Dstillery since 2009, has left the company. Another recent exit was COO Andrew Pancer, who this month launched a new ad tech company called Fresh Media. Alan Murray and the rest of Dstillery's co-founders will lead Dstillery going forward. The company has raised more than $50 million in funding to date, according to Crunchbase.

Best of the rest

ProPublica unearthed the guidelines Facebook uses to distinguish between hate speech and legitimate political expression. The news organization said the documents indicate that, at least in some instances, the company's "hate-speech rules tend to favor elites and governments over grassroots activists and racial minorities." A Facebook executive said the platform is trying to apply consistent standards globally and that "the policies do not always lead to perfect outcomes."

He replaces Nigel Morris, who has become chief strategy and innovation officer. ["http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/dentsu-aegis-hires-nick-brien-replace-nigel-morris-americas-ceo/1437844"]

Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is suing the New York Times for defamation over a June 14 editorial that linked one of her campaign ads to a shooting in 2011 that severely injured Democrat politician Gabby Giffords and killed six people. The Times posted a correction June 16 saying it had "incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords." A Times spokeswoman said, "We have not seen the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously."

APARTMENTS

Rents, Vacancies

Are on the Rise

The U.S. apartment market delivered a mixed performance in the second quarter as rents increased along with the number of empty apartments.

The national vacancy rate climbed to 4.4% for the quarter from 4.2% a year earlier, according to data released by Reis Inc. Nonetheless, average rents across the U.S. increased 3% year to year in the second quarter to $1,335 a month. That was the smallest year-over-year increase since 2011.

Rents increased or remained flat in all but two of 79 metro areas. That is in contrast to the first quarter, when rents declined in 23 metro areas.

Two of the country's largest and priciest rental markets continued to struggle. Rents in New York declined 1% compared with a year earlier, while San Francisco rents fell 0.3%, according to Reis.

ANBANG INSURANCE

City Official, Union

Urge Transparency

A member of the Santa Monica, Calif., City Council and workers in the hotel industry are asking for new ownership disclosure rules as concerns rise over foreign capital coming into the industry.

Chinese firm Anbang Insurance Group Co. purchased Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc. from Blackstone Group LP last year, taking control of Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, the largest hotel in Santa Monica.

Anbang's chairman, Wu Xiaohui, has been detained by investigators, said people familiar with the matter. Employees at Anbang said the person now in charge is the Communist Party's top representative at Anbang, Chen Ping, according to a previous report in The Wall Street Journal. Anbang said previously that Mr. Wu has "authorized relevant senior executives" to manage Anbang in his absence.

Anbang didn't respond to requests for comment.

LABOR

Worker Shortage

Squeezes Developers

About two-thirds of the contractors who are struggling with the labor shortages gripping the construction industry say it has become a challenge to finish jobs on time, according to a new survey.

More than one-third of contractors said they are being forced to turn work down and 58% said they are putting in higher bids, said the survey sponsored by USG Corp. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Three-quarters of those who said they are having difficulty finding skilled labor said they are simply asking their employees to work harder.

"Basically they're just making people work harder as a way to cope," said Steve Jones, senior director of Dodge Data & Analytics, which was the research partner of USG and the chamber on the project.

The survey was conducted as part of the development of a new economic indicator launched this month named the USG + U.S. Chamber of Commerce Commercial Construction Index. It was designed to gauge such trends as backlogs, revenue projections, access to financing and labor issues.

Two-thirds of the contractors surveyed predicted there would be more workers in the next six months. But 61% of the respondents reported problems finding skilled laborers in such trades as concrete, interior finishes, masonry, electrical and plumbing.

Quincy Jones adds to band of quirky ETFs

The overflowing smorgasbord of exchange traded funds is set to welcome another esoteric dish to the table, with legendary music producer Quincy Jones lending his name to a "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/06/26/2190602/back-on-the-block-with-a-quincy-jones-etf/".

The Quincy Jones Streaming Music, Media & Entertainment ETF will track an index of companies involved in any aspect of the online streaming of entertainment, according to a "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547950/000139834417007875/fp0026379_485apos.htm" to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

With most major asset classes and markets now covered by a few behemoth ETFs such as State Street s $240bn  Spider    which tracks the S&P 500   many smaller passive investment providers have instead been cranking out a steady stream of niche, thematic ETFs. Here is a selection of some of the oddest ones currently being offered to investors or in the works. The often punning stock market tickers are in parentheses when available.

1. Inspire Global Hope Large Cap ETF (BLES)

This year Inspire Investing, a small Californian investment company focused on  biblically responsible investing  launched two ETFs that offered devout Evangelicals a way to invest in an index that screened out undesirable sectors, such as gambling, alcohol, pornography and   controversially   companies that supported lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender rights.

Robert Netzly, chief executive of Inspire, told the FT at the time he expected the two ETFs to attract  hundreds of millions of dollars  in a matter of months, but BLES and its small-cap counterpart are currently stuck at about $60m in total, indicating that the Lord may not be looking favourably on them.

2. Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index (HMMJ)

Horizons ETFs Group, a Canadian provider, in April launched a medical marijuana ETF  designed to provide exposure to the performance of a basket of North American publicly listed life sciences companies with significant business activities in the marijuana industry .

Despite eschewing the available stock market ticker HIGH, the ETF s assets have grown to $82.9m. The performance has been a comedown though, losing almost 14 per cent since inception.

The SEC is also considering the prospectus of an  Emerging AgroSphere ETF  proposed by ETF Managers Group, a small provider that specialises in creating bespoke passive vehicles for other investment groups. Although the medical marijuana ETF has yet to launch, the index it tracks boasts the Bloomberg and Reuters code WEED.

3. The Obesity ETF (SLIM)

Even in Janus Henderson s unusual suite of thematic ETFs   which include funds that invest in the organic food industry, the fitness business and elderly care   the obesity ETF stands out, despite deciding against the more accurate but blunter stock market ticker FAT.

The fund is designed to profit from swelling waistlines around the world by investing in healthcare and medical companies with treatments for obesity and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, cholesterol and sleep apnoea, as well as plus-sized apparel. Its overall assets are stuck at a svelte $2.7m, however.

4. Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR)

PureFunds is one of the more successful niche ETF providers, largely thanks to its timely launch of a cyber security ETF just before a spate of high-profile hacks and data thefts. But it has also given birth to a number of other thematic passive products targeting exposure to trends such as big data (BIGD) and drones (IFLY), as well as a video gaming ETF.

GAMR currently boasts $29.5m of assets invested in companies such as Konami, Nintendo, Zynga and Activision Blizzard. But underscoring some of the technical difficulties for some of these smaller ETFs, its single biggest holding is a $1.5m position in a Treasury money market fund.

5. Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN)

If you believe that millennials are taking over the world, then Global X s MILN is the ETF for you. The provider partly owned by JPMorgan Asset Management has an interesting suite of thematic ETFs designed to give exposure to fintech, social media, artificial intelligence, Catholic values and the internet of things, but last year launched one that aimed to capture the  rising spending power and unique preferences of the US millennial generation .

Perhaps reflecting how stretched the finances of millennials often are, the ETF has only attracted $6.2m of assets in spite of rising over 19 per cent since its inception in May 2016. If someone lists an avocado toast company then expect this ETF to be a big investor.

6. SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE)

The  big three  ETF players   BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street   have generally eschewed smaller, gimmicky ETFs, but encouraged by the promise of an anchor $250m investment from the California State Teachers  Retirement System, State Street last year rolled out a fund that invests in US companies that demonstrate  greater gender diversity within senior leadership .

CalSTRS s backing reflects the fact that research shows that diversely led companies tend to outperform their male-dominated peers over time, and since the March 2016 inception "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/your-money/in-fledgling-exchange-traded-fund-striking-a-blow-for-women.html?_r=0" has returned 18.9 per cent to investors. Its $323m size dwarfs that of a $33.9m Barclays exchange-traded note called Women In Leadership (WIL).

7. Equbot with Watson AI Total US ETF (AIEQ)

IBM s Watson artificial intelligence system became a celebrity when it vanquished a brace of human champions in the game show Jeopardy! in 2011, and is now turning its sights on the stock market. ETF Managers Group and Equbot, a West Coast fintech company backed by IBM, is using Watson to systematically pick stocks that will go into an  active  ETF, according to a recent filing with the SEC.

Active ETFs are subtly different from their traditional counterparts, as they have more freedom to go outside an index and are often less transparent. The Watson-powered  Equbot Model  will daily rank companies based on the probability of them gaining from economic conditions, trends and world events, and betting on 30-70 of those  with the greatest potential for appreciation .

8. Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF (WSKY)

Little distils the current trend towards increasingly narrow, thematic ETFs as well as this Spirited Funds-ETF Managers Group blend. The WSKY fund invests in the biggest whiskey and bourbon makers in the world   such as Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Rmy Cointreau and Brown-Forman   hoping to capitalise on the growing global thirst for the brown liquid.

But the narrower the theme, the greater the exposure to just a handful of companies, negating some of the diversification typically offered by ETFs. The whiskey ETF s three biggest holdings account for almost half its $2.8m of assets.

 Big Data  Company Xcalar Raises $16 Million Series A; Khosla Ventures led new round of $16 million in Series A funding

Xcalar wants to beat Palantir at using big data to provide business insights--without an army of consultants.

The company said on Tuesday that it has raised more than $21 million to date.

Khosla Ventures led its most recent round of $16 million in Series A funding. Other Xcalar investors include Merus Capital, former VMware Chief Executive Diane Greene and Sun Microsystems Co-Founder Andy Bechtolsheim.

Khosla Ventures founder Vinod Khosla said he first became acquainted with the firm through its notable angel investors. Mr. Khosla said he thought Xcalar Founder Chief Executive Vikram Joshi had a different view of the world when it came to big data.

"He felt like a perfect definition of an 'out-there' entrepreneur who had his own view," Mr. Khosla said.

Xcalar also announced a new business analytics platform on Tuesday that will help corporations get more out of their big data.

Mr. Joshi said Xcalar was built to help businesses get more out of existing Hadoop investments. The company has already signed partnerships with Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Tableau, Confluent and MapR. The company currently has deployments and pilots with about a dozen Fortune 100 companies and governments.

Xcalar can be used for many different kinds of business use cases. For example, the company works with everyone from government contractors that supply missiles to financial services companies.

Mr. Joshi believes Hadoop was just the first step in big data, which enabled the breaking down of data silos.

"Now the next step is how do I find those deep, meaningful insights," he said. "That is the problem that we set out with."

Daniel Loeb's Activist Hedge Fund Third Point Takes $3.5 Billion Stake in Nestl; Stake is fund's largest-ever bet on a public company

Billionaire activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC hedge fund has taken its largest-ever initial bet on a public company, with a $3.5 billion stake in Nestl SA, piling pressure on the world's largest packaged-foods company to find ways to accelerate growth.

The stake amounts to about 1.25% of Nestl's shares. That's a small investment for the European giant. But it's an unusually big bet for a U.S. activist fund in Europe, where American investors' sometimes aggressive approach has had mixed success.

Nestl didn't respond to requests for comment.

Third Point outlined an array of changes it believes the consumer-goods giant could make, including improving margins, innovating in its core business and selling noncore assets and its 23% stake in French cosmetics company L'Oral SA.

"It is rare to find a business of Nestl's quality with so many avenues for improvement," Third Point said in a letter to investors on Sunday night.

"Despite having arguably the best positioned portfolio in the consumer packaged goods industry, Nestl shares have significantly underperformed most of their U.S. and European consumer staples peers on a three year, five year, and ten year total shareholder return basis," it said.

Third Point said Nestl has "fallen behind over the past decade," and that while competitors have adapted to changes in how people shop and to more competition from small, local brands, "Nestl has remained stuck in its old ways."

The stake is Third Point's largest initial bet in its more than 20-year history and ranks among the largest in activism history as well.

Mr. Loeb played a big role in shaking up Yahoo Inc. as an activist shareholder and board member some years ago. He is also known for fiery-worded letters to executives and fights at companies like Sotheby's, though in recent years he has tamed his public image and looked to work more quietly with companies. A recent call to split up conglomerate Honeywell International Inc., for instance, found a somewhat open ear at the company, which has said it is already entertaining his idea even if it hasn't committed to a plan.

Mr. Loeb has been among the few U.S.-based activists to venture abroad for some of his biggest investments, where rules of the game are different and there's less of a record of shareholder support for more aggressive campaigns. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp., for instance, was unsuccessful in its recent efforts to coerce Akzo Nobel NV, in which it has shares, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ppg-drops-takeover-bid-for-akzo-nobel-1496310481" with PPG Industries Inc.

Nestl in February said it was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-reports-drop-in-sales-profit-1487230291" after missing that goal for the fourth straight year. The company's new chief executive, Mark Schneider, a health-care veteran, recently said Nestl would look to sell "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-exploring-sale-of-its-u-s-confectionery-business-1497544689", which lags behind rivals Hershey Co., Mars Inc. and Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spruengli AG.

Nestl has also faced calls to consider selling its frozen-food arm, which includes brands like Lean Cuisine and Stouffer's, another business that has struggled as consumers increasingly look to fresh options.

Mr. Schneider has been working to better understand changing consumer behavior and raise Nestl's exposure to higher-growth channels. Last week the company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-buys-stake-in-freshly-putting-healthy-food-deliveries-top-of-the-menu-1497948113" Freshly which sells healthy, prepared meals to U.S. consumers saying it would benefit from its analytics and distribution.

Third Point said Nestl's stagnant per-share earnings over the past five years have translated to slowing dividend growth.

"Without addressing the company's stalled earnings, further dividend increases will be unsustainable at historical rates," said the firm. "While Nestl has stood still, its peers have pursued productivity increases aggressively and made other changes in order to deliver earnings growth and create shareholder value in a slower sales growth world."

Nestl isn't the only consumer-goods company to struggle with slowing growth. Rivals including Unilever PLC, Danone SA and Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC have all grappled with weaker global growth particularly in emerging markets volatile currencies, changing consumer tastes and a difficulty raising prices in an environment of low inflation or even falling prices, known as deflation.

Other consumer-goods companies like Unilever, Diageo PLC and Kraft Heinz Co. have taken a hard line on cost by adopting so-called zero based budgeting, whereby expenses have to be justified from scratch every year. But Nestl has criticized the cost-cutting approach pioneered by Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital Partners LP, with Mr. Schneider on Thursday saying at a conference "we don't believe in that model." The company follows its own cost-cutting program, while simultaneously investing in what it says are high-growth areas of its business such as petfood and coffee.

Mr. Loeb said he thinks Nestl can improve its margins by as much as 4 percentage points over the next several years and that the company should adopt a formal margin target of 18%-20% by 2020. He added that the company should take on more debt to fund share buybacks and sell its stake in L'Oral, which currently makes up 10% of Nestl's market capitalization with a value of over $25 billion, allowing shareholders to choose whether they want to invest just in Nestl or also in L'Oral.

Mr. Loeb drew comparisons with Third Point's 2015 investment in Baxter International Inc., which led the Deerfield, Ill.-based hospital-products maker to give his firm a seat on the board and a role in the hunt for the company's next chief executive.

He described Nestl's condition as similar to Baxter's saying investors there had underestimated the potential possibilities with a new CEO focused on things like better capital allocation, portfolio optimization and margin improvement.

While Mr. Loeb has taken a forceful approach with other companies, he indicated he will be collaborative with Nestl, saying he "intends to play a constructive role to encourage management to pursue change with a greater sense of urgency."

He praised Mr. Schneider, who earned a reputation while CEO of German medical supply company Fresenius SE, for driving strong growth. But he said Mr. Schneider would have to address what he called the "staid culture and tendency towards incrementalism that has typified the company's prior leadership and resulted in its long-term underperformance."

Nestl's shares have climbed recently as investors have high hopes for Mr. Schneider. Fresenius shares rose 1,246% during his CEO tenure. He is credited with boosting revenue at the German firm through geographic expansion and a number of big acquisitions.

Nestl's shares were recently up 3.6% after climbing to a high of over 4% in early European trading.

Third Point is working alongside Jan Bennink, the former CEO of Royal Numico NV, to help formulate its plan for Nestl, saying Mr. Bennink's move to cut costs and sell noncore assets while at the baby-food company had dramatically increased sales and expanded margins before it was sold to Danone. Mr. Bennink who has himself taken shares in Nestl also previously worked as the executive chairman of Sara Lee Corp., overseeing its split into two companies.

Insurance Is a Fun Career! Consider the Zombies, Bacon --- Companies go to extremes to lure hires, from ghoulish videos to free beer

When Acuity Insurance wanted to liven up its image among prospective recruits, it came time to bring in the zombies.

It's the year 2023, and underwriter Carli Miller trudges through the insurer's Sheboygan, Wis., headquarters in a video Acuity has produced.

She is clearly undead -- bloodless gray skin, glazed eyes, ripped clothing -- bumping into zombie colleagues who have overtaken the insurer.

The 27-year-old Ms. Miller narrates and rattles off what she considers Acuity's perks -- the camaraderie, the "jeans days," the great 401(k) plan. "I guess the bottom line is Acuity truly was a great place to work," the ghoul concludes, "and it's a great place to spend eternity -- even if we are undead."

The video, "Zombacuity," ends with a scream -- which might be a sign of what insurance-industry recruiters feel these days.

For some reason, a lot of people just don't want to work for insurance companies, and the firms have been scared into taking extreme measures to lure new hires in and keep them.

Acuity posted its video online to attract prospects. It picked zombies, says Acuity communications specialist Kallyn Vandenack, 30, to show "we really like to have fun around here."

Insurers have put in climbing walls, offered free beer and massages, and published at least one graphic novel to entice and retain new hires. At school-recruiting events last autumn, Acuity served mounds of freshly cooked bacon, whose aroma drifted around the grounds.

"All of the college students swarmed around," says Acuity Chief Executive Ben Salzmann, 61.

Americans under 30 generally aren't enthusiastic about the industry, according to Insurance Careers Movement, an industry group that seeks to inspire young people to pursue insurance careers. "When I think of insurance," one millennial said in recent research conducted for Liberty Mutual Insurance, "it is a sharp poke in the eye."

The industry needs more brains, and soon. It employs about 2.6 million but calculates it must hire 500,000 newcomers over the next several years as a wave of retirements hits, says Robert Hartwig, an insurance professor at University of South Carolina's business school.

Some insurers are taking a page from Silicon Valley's hip offices. Allstate Corp. has a "happiness guru" in a building where it locates many data scientists.

Acuity has in recent years installed ping-pong tables, a working 65-foot Ferris wheel, a 45-foot climbing wall and a 27,000-square-foot fitness center. It has twice-monthly happy hours. Years ago, it dropped its clean-desk policy banning plants, family photographs and food, Mr. Salzmann says.

A graphic novel is Dan Epstein's millennial lure. The CEO of ReSource Pro LLC, which provides processing and advisory services to the insurance industry, co-wrote what is essentially a fancy comic book, "Tomorrow's Insurance," to engage young people in his company and clients about a transformation in the industry around data analytics and machine learning.

At the novel's futuristic agency, Sigma 6 Insurance, the female owner walks among high-tech gear, escorting a mysterious guest who is assessing if the agency can insure a "Mars Colony One Project." The guest leaves definitely impressed.

"We wanted to step out," says Mr. Epstein, 46, "and envision what the industry could be like in 10 years."

Other businesses, too, face labor shortages, says Professor Hartwig, 53, but "it's without question more difficult to attract a worker into the insurance industry."

At a February Rutgers University event, lines of students waiting to meet recruiters from some tech firms ran 25 or more deep. Insurers' booths generally had trickles of guests.

In a queue for the consultancy Accenture, finance major Nicholas Appaluccio, 23, said he wasn't interested in insurers because he considered much of the work there "cut and dried."

Graduate student Shivani Sethi, 24, approached Liberty Mutual's booth upon seeing no line. "I'm open to trying new things," she said, but ultimately took an internship at an online brokerage. Liberty Mutual says it collected 78 resumes and offered interviews to four; two were offered jobs and took them.

Videos are the enticement at firms such as ICW Group Insurance Cos., which last autumn rounded up employees to freeze in position -- at a time when "mannequin challenges" were an internet craze.

In a video, a camera pans the firm's San Diego offices capturing the poses: someone about to sip a drink, another pushing an elevator button, one in midstep. The video, says Trisha Rule, 34, an ICW senior marketing employee, tackles "this misperception about the insurance industry."

Among viewers was Leslee Edwards, 22, who researched ICW on Facebook and "thought it looked like a fun place to work." In May, she started in the workers'-compensation department.

Interns at MMG Insurance in Presque Isle, Maine, helped create a seven-minute video modeled after "The Office" television sitcom.

In it, Melissa McKenney plays an underwriter who uses clairvoyance to size up risks. To dispel conceptions that insurance is "boring or stale," she says, "we wanted to weave in a little bit of humor."

Ms. McKenney, now 23 and an MMG full-timer, says she previously figured insurance was monotonous but has learned it can be "very high-action, very fast-paced."

To keep some new hires away from the rest of the company, Allstate, Liberty Mutual and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. have put some data scientists, app developers and other innovation specialists in digs in neighborhoods popular with startups and given the operations catchy names.

Allstate's Arity operation in Chicago's Merchandise Mart has a full-time "creative culture leader" who helps in recruiting talent. "We're doing everything we can," says Allstate spokesman Justin Herndon, 36, "minus throwing out the red carpet to try to get them in the door."

At Liberty Mutual's Solaria Labs, says spokeswoman Adrianne Kaufmann, 49, there was "a deliberate decision to give it a distinct personality that was more entrepreneurial in feeling."

MassMutual opened a location it calls Haven Life in New York City where it wants "spaces that feel start-uppy" and "whimsical," says Gareth Ross, 41, who has responsibility for data analytics at the 166-year-old insurer.

The location has free beer anytime and some conference rooms named after "contributors to mortality": "Fallen Coconut," "Asteroid Impact," "Insect Attack," "Snake Bite."

'Critical time' to explore the issue, says financial regulator

Buying insurance can be complicated at the best of times. For people with serious medical conditions such as cancer, the process can be even more stressful and expensive.

The Financial Conduct Authority this week called for evidence of the problems people with cancer have buying travel insurance. The FCA said it was a "critical time" to explore the issue.

"It is hugely challenging for [people with cancer] to find insurance," said Lonora Miles, senior policy adviser at Macmillan Cancer Support. "People will get multiple flat declines, sky-high premium quotes, or the insurer might offer them cover, but with an exclusion for the cancer."

She added that while there are also issues finding other sorts of cover, "travel insurance causes the most significant stress and distress". The result, she said, is that people can find themselves travelling without suitable insurance, or even decide not to travel at all.

The FCA pointed to an example of a nurse with breast cancer who was travelling to Dubai. After searching the market, the best travel insurance quote she could come up with was 2,800 for a single-trip policy . It was only after a friend recommended a specialist that she found insurance for 800.

It is likely to be a growing problem. Macmillan estimates that the number of people with cancer will increase from 2.5m to 4m by 2030. "It feels like the insurance industry hasn't taken on board the increase in the number of people with cancer and their needs," Ms Miles said.

The growing use of "big data" is also playing a part. Insurers are keen to use as much data as possible to help them price risks more accurately, but that can lead to problems.

In its Call for Input , the FCA noted: "Those who were likely to have benefited from lower premiums in the past, as a result of larger risk pools, could now find there are fewer options open to them and that they have to navigate an increasingly complex and confusing market to find insurers willing to cover them."

The Association of British Insurers said it wants to engage with the FCA's work. But James Bridge, the ABI's head of conduct regulation, said: "We think there is a functioning market with products for people that have got cancer. There is a specialist market of people with detailed expertise, and there are products out there. Things are much further ahead than they were 10 or 20 years ago."

He added that insurers have to take into account the costs of providing cover when they come up with the premium. "On price, one of the dangers is the idea that because something is expensive, it is poor value. In travel, claims can run to hundreds of thousands of pounds . . . it is fair to have a risk-reflective price."

But not everybody agrees that the prices available in the market accurately reflect the risks. "In any condition, cancer or otherwise, there is a spectrum of risk," said Richard Smith, managing director of Travel Insurance Facilities Group, a specialist insurer. "You can't box them all together."

His company has developed Protectif, a system designed to help insurers to assess each individual's risk.

"The only way to analyse everything is to ask the right sort of questions in the right way. All too often we see premiums in the market which are not justified by the risk because screening tools are not sophisticated enough."

Mr Smith said his system helped to reduce the cost of travel insurance for a patient with lung cancer in remission from 445 to just 21.

TIF is not the only company looking at the market. Bought by Many, which groups together people with similar interests, is also planning to design a travel insurance product for people with medical conditions. It already has almost 1,500 people in its " Travel Insurance for Cancer Patients " group. Other specialists in the market include Allclear and Staysure.

Although the study is focused on cancer, the FCA believes that it will have wider significance. "We believe there is a broad read across from access issues experienced by those who have, or have had cancer and other pre-existing medical conditions in both travel insurance and other protection products," it said.

At Macmillan, Ms Miles is hopeful that the study will lead to better outcomes for cancer sufferers. "We want everybody to have a fair price," she said. "We want better use of data and more transparency about how premiums are calculated. The price needs to reflect the risk accurately, and we are not confident that is the case at the moment."

 Critical time  to discuss the issues faced by travellers, says regulator

Buying insurance can be complicated at the best of times. For people with serious medical conditions such as cancer, the process can be even more stressful and expensive.

The Financial Conduct Authority this week took action, calling for evidence of the problems people with cancer have buying travel insurance. The FCA said it was a  critical time  to explore the issue.

Gormley's Take: Health Insurers Ask Pharma Companies to Prove Value of Pricey Medications; Pay-for-performance deals tie payments to benefits drugs deliver

Drug companies justify high prices by saying their medications deliver significant value. Increasingly, they're being asked to prove that.

Amid scrutiny of pricey medications, insurers are striking deals that reward drugmakers according to how well their medicines actually perform. Cigna, for example, has seven "value based" contracts, said Karen Eldred, a spokeswoman. They include pacts signed last year with Amgen Inc. and Sanofi SA-Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the cholesterol drugs Repatha and Praluent.

The contracts modify the cost of these medications based on how well patients respond to them. Another insurer, Aetna, disclosed a value-based contract with Merck & Co. in October that covers the Type 2 diabetes medications Januvia and Janumet. Merck's rebates on these two drugs will be based partly on their contributions to helping patients achieve treatment goals.

Value-based deals aren't the norm yet, but they will likely become more common. A new survey of 45 health plans by Avalere Health found that a quarter of respondents had at least one outcomes-based contract in place and that 70% had a favorable view of these agreements.

The pay-for-performance trend has biotechnology startups thinking about ways of documenting how their drugs lower costs, such as by helping patients leave the hospital sooner or avoid complications of a worsening disease.

One digital-health startup that could benefit from the trend is Shyft Analytics Inc., a cloud-based data analytics company whose technology can help drug companies pinpoint the benefits their products deliver. Pharmaceutical companies are looking at using Shyft's platform to drive discussions with payers, says Chief Executive Zack King.

Outcomes-based deals could help some companies justify existing prices. But that could cut both ways, Mr. King says.

"You're going to see a lot of therapies not being able to justify the prices," says Mr. King, adding "It's going to provide transparency [in] drug pricing."

A latter-day Rockefeller surveys his data empire; Technology: Alibaba

Ma has proved his mastery but as Standard Oil discovered, no company can run unchecked

If data are the new oil, Jack Ma , English teacher turned China's richest man, is the new John D. Rockefeller.

Like Rockefeller's Standard Oil, Mr Ma's Alibaba is a lucrative and rapidly growing business. This month it forecast annual revenues would rise 45 to 49 per cent, besting analysts' consensus estimates by 10 percentage points and adding $42.25bn to its value - almost an entire Barclays bank - the next day.

"Alibaba is evolving into a big data conglomerate," enthused Jessie Guo, an analyst at Jefferies and one of the many who attended the group's two-day investor conference in Hangzhou this month.

Revenue guidance and discussions at the event "indicate we are at the beginning of data-driven monetisation", added Chi Tsang, head of Asia internet research at HSBC.

Alibaba's vertically and horizontally integrated services span shopping, movies, finance and logistics, all collecting information on people's spending, location and viewing. Once refined, the data are fed back to merchants, who in turn can better target their goods and sell more over Alibaba's ecommerce platforms.

This creates what Bhavtosh Vajpayee, an analyst at Bernstein Research, calls a "potent marketing platform" that demonstrates the link between ads and purchases and in turn has "allowed Alibaba to corner the largest share of digital ad spend in China".

There is proof of this virtuous circle too. The longer consumers shop on ecommerce platforms Taobao and Tmall (and the longer the data trail they leave), the more they shop. The average customer placed 38 orders in their first year on the site; four years later, the tally was 123.

Alibaba has also taken its data engine to new levels. It was buying physical stores well before Amazon set its sights on Whole Foods and is collating data on people's habits in both the online and physical world, enabling more relevant store layout and more efficient management of inventory.

It is also targeting far more products than its US peers, Jeff Zhang , Alibaba's chief technology officer, told investors, citing the example of ads placed by ecommerce group Amazon on social media platform Facebook.

"On Facebook, you see Amazon advertising and the advertising you see is different for everybody, but there are only 100,000 products listed so they are selecting one from 100,000 products to recommend to you. So we have a billion products; one relevant product in a billion to recommend to you requires a higher level of technology."

At the other end, data are routed back to merchants and, in turn, manufacturers, to tell them what items are in demand. Alibaba uses predictive data ahead of its mammoth annual Singles Day shopping frenzy to let merchants know where they should be warehousing goods the day before.

"Now ecommerce giants can see exactly what to manufacture," says Scott Likens, who heads PwC's analytics and emerging technologies business in Hong Kong. "You have manufacturing on demand because you have data on consumers."

Beyond shopping, there is " cloud ", a part of Alibaba that is growing rapidly, even if it is yet to break even. Cloud, says Richard Hatherall, Hong Kong-based partner at Bain & Co consultancy, is "the business equivalent of everyone being on Facebook".

Cloud providers, he says, have a view on a company's creditworthiness because they have them as customers paying them every month for cloud services, as well as the apps they use.

But - as Standard Oil discovered - no company, no matter how large, can run unchecked.

Alibaba's competitors, mainly peers Baidu and Tencent, which together make up China's BAT tech trio, are building similarly vast databanks.

Tencent's WeChat social media platform has almost 940m subscribers, while Baidu collates information from owning the country's leading search engine.

In the core ecommerce business, Alibaba competes head to head with JD.com, which runs a more asset-heavy model similar to Amazon's, owning logistics and warehouses.

Staying ahead in China often means using subsidies to buy market share. Bernstein's Mr Vajpayee notes a generous offering of promotional coupons in recent weeks - which coincides with JD.com's big shopping festival - totalling some Rmb5bn-Rmb6bn ($732m-$878m).

Those subsidies, he says, explain why Bernstein is raising its revenue estimates but keeping its earnings outlook unchanged.

In the $5.5tn mobile payments market , Tencent is narrowing the gap with Alipay, run by Alibaba's financial services affiliate Ant Financial . Tencent is also rapidly building up its cloud business, an area where Alibaba is currently streets ahead.

For Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based consultancy BDA and author of Alibaba - the house that Jack Ma built , Tencent's WeChat exposes a weakness for Alibaba as its own efforts to make Alipay more social were "a bit of a disaster".

That service, called Circles, launched in late November and ended up being used as a somewhat dubious dating site. Alibaba was forced to remove the offending group conversations and block fresh ones with a similar orientation from being set up.

The concern, he says, is that while Alipay can dominate in retail, where Alibaba's core strength lies, it is running neck and neck with Tencent in services such as paying for ride-hailing and food delivery.

He forecasts an evenly split market of 46 per cent apiece in travel, telecom services, utilities and money market funds and a leading 50-55 per cent share for Tencent in games, in 2023.

"How disciplined are they? If Alibaba feels threatened will they accept that or will they keep splurging?" asks Mr Clark. "In a way a duopoly works for government, but can it keep working for investors?"

Mark Mahoney, an internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets, points to the US example: Facebook has grown its top line by 50 per cent-plus for 16 straight quarters; Google at 20 per cent for 29 straight quarters; and Amazon 20 per cent plus for 40 straight quarters. Alibaba for its part has grown between 28 and 60 per cent in each of the 11 quarters it has been listed.

"The long-term winners by now are probably decided," he says. "As they get bigger and [amass] more and more cash, it gets harder and harder to disrupt them."

Background

Top China tech trio in battle for territory

Data are China tech's new battlefront, illustrated this month by some 30 tons of rotting lychees and mangoes - collateral damage of a dispute between Alibaba's logistics arm and a big China courier group, SF Express .

The companies had swapped accusations that the other was trying to grab their user data, and both responded by cutting off data links between them.

The BAT tech groups - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - are in the midst of a data land grab, trying to lay claim to as much client information as possible.

The stakes are high. Whoever commands the bulk of data from China's 730m internet users will be able to dominate the online advertising and ecommerce markets, which collectively generated $930bn in revenue in 2016.

"Alibaba in particular is becoming predatory, and will knock off smaller players if they don't adhere to what they want," says Shaun Rein, founder of consultancy China Market Research Group. "Data are the next big fight."

Alibaba has denied it is acting in a predatory manner, calling the comments "baseless and irresponsible".

"All of this speaks to the tentacles of these two empires [Alibaba and Tencent], and for companies in the middle that get squeezed, it can be very tricky," says Duncan Clark, founder of BDA Consultancy.

Big data are also the fuel that powers artificial intelligence, which has applications in everything from driverless cars to home devices, and is touted as the next big thing in business.

Baidu and Tencent have both set up AI labs in the US and China.

The data harnessed by private tech companies are also valuable to a third party: the Chinese government. BAT has flourished even while foreign participants such as Google have retreated from China due to data security concerns.

Vanessa D'Alancon, analyst at BMI Research, says: "There is little data protection in China, and the new cyber security law gives the government unrestricted access to almost all personal data.

"All companies generally obey the government's demands for data."

Insurance Is a Fun Career! Just Consider the Zombies and Bacon; Insurers use extreme measures to lure new hires, from ghoulish videos to free beer; Allstate's 'happiness guru'

When Acuity Insurance wanted to liven up its image among prospective recruits, it came time to bring in the zombies.

It's the year 2023, and underwriter Carli Miller trudges through the insurer's Sheboygan, Wis., headquarters in a video Acuity has produced.

She is clearly undead bloodless gray skin, glazed eyes, ripped clothing bumping into zombie colleagues who have overtaken the insurer.

The 27-year-old Ms. Miller narrates and rattles off what she considers Acuity's perks the camaraderie, the "jeans days," the great 401(k) plan. "I guess the bottom line is Acuity truly was a great place to work," the ghoul concludes, "and it's a great place to spend eternity even if we are undead."

The video, "Zombacuity," ends with a scream which might be a sign of what insurance-industry recruiters feel these days.

For some reason, a lot of people just don't want to work for insurance companies, and the firms have been scared into taking extreme measures to lure new hires in and keep them.

Acuity posted its video online to attract prospects. It picked zombies, says Acuity communications specialist Kallyn Vandenack, 30, to show "we really like to have fun around here."

Insurers have put in climbing walls, offered free beer and massages, and published at least one graphic novel to entice and retain new hires. At school-recruiting events last autumn, Acuity served mounds of freshly cooked bacon, whose aroma drifted around the grounds.

"All of the college students swarmed around," says Acuity Chief Executive Ben Salzmann, 61.

Americans under 30 generally aren't enthusiastic about the industry, according to Insurance Careers Movement, an industry group that seeks to inspire young people to pursue insurance careers. "When I think of insurance," one millennial said in recent research conducted for Liberty Mutual Insurance, "it is a sharp poke in the eye."

The industry needs more brains, and soon. It employs about 2.6 million but calculates it must hire 500,000 newcomers over the next several years as a wave of retirements hits, says Robert Hartwig, an insurance professor at University of South Carolina's business school.

A graphic novel is Dan Epstein's millennial lure. The CEO of ReSource Pro LLC, which provides processing and advisory services to the insurance industry, co-wrote what is essentially a fancy comic book, "Tomorrow's Insurance," to engage young people in his company and clients about a transformation in the industry around data analytics and machine learning.

At the novel's futuristic agency, Sigma 6 Insurance, the female owner walks among high-tech gear, escorting a mysterious guest who is assessing if the agency can insure a "Mars Colony One Project." The guest leaves definitely impressed.

"We wanted to step out," says Mr. Epstein, 46, "and envision what the industry could be like in 10 years."

Other businesses, too, face labor shortages, says Professor Hartwig, 53, but "it's without question more difficult to attract a worker into the insurance industry."

At a February Rutgers University event, lines of students waiting to meet recruiters from some tech firms ran 25 or more deep. Insurers' booths generally had trickles of guests.

In a queue for the consultancy Accenture, finance major Nicholas Appaluccio, 23, said he wasn't interested in insurers because he considered much of the work there "cut and dried."

Graduate student Shivani Sethi, 24, approached Liberty Mutual's booth upon seeing no line. "I'm open to trying new things," she said, but ultimately took an internship at an online brokerage. Liberty Mutual says it collected 78 rsums and offered interviews to four; two were offered jobs and took them.

Videos are the enticement at firms such as ICW Group Insurance Cos., which last autumn rounded up employees to freeze in position at a time when "mannequin challenges" were an internet craze.

In a video, a camera pans the firm's San Diego offices capturing the poses: someone about to sip a drink, another pushing an elevator button, one in midstep.

The video, says Trisha Rule, 34, an ICW senior marketing employee, tackles "this misperception about the insurance industry."

Among viewers was Leslee Edwards, 22, who researched ICW on Facebook and "thought it looked like a fun place to work." In May, she started in the workers'-compensation department.

Interns at MMG Insurance in Presque Isle, Maine, helped create a seven-minute video modeled after "The Office" television sitcom.

In it, Melissa McKenney plays an underwriter who uses clairvoyance to size up risks. To dispel conceptions that insurance is "boring or stale," she says, "we wanted to weave in a little bit of humor."

Ms. McKenney, now 23 and an MMG full-timer, says she previously figured insurance was monotonous but has learned it can be "very high-action, very fast-paced."

To keep some new hires away from the rest of the company, Allstate, Liberty Mutual and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. have put some data scientists, app developers and other innovation specialists in digs in neighborhoods popular with startups and given the operations catchy names.

Allstate's Arity operation in Chicago's Merchandise Mart has a full-time "creative culture leader" who helps in recruiting talent. "We're doing everything we can," says Allstate spokesman Justin Herndon, 36, "minus throwing out the red carpet to try to get them in the door."

MassMutual opened a location it calls Haven Life in New York City where it wants "spaces that feel start-uppy" and "whimsical," says Gareth Ross, 41, who has responsibility for data analytics at the 166-year-old insurer.

The location has free beer anytime and some conference rooms named after "contributors to mortality": "Fallen Coconut," "Asteroid Impact," "Insect Attack," "Snake Bite."

Travis Kalanick's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-uber-backers-orchestrated-kalanicks-ouster-as-ceo-1498090688" Inc. dealt a potential blow to its efforts in Asia, where the ride-hailing company is locked in a multibillion-dollar battle with local rivals.

Uber "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403" following a costly battle with homegrown rival Didi Chuxing Technology Co. Afterward, Uber said it was sharpening its focus on India and Southeast Asia. But investors and analysts say the San Francisco company's worries at home may add momentum to fast-growing startups capitalizing on a home-field advantage, local knowledge and good relationships with regulators.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ousted-tech-founder-ubers-travis-kalanick-is-in-good-company-1498044863", said investors at Beijing-based Magic Stone Alternative Investments, an Uber investor since 2015.

"The business in which Uber is engaged is an all-out battle, a constant daily battle against city regulators, against taxicab unions," said Ben Harburg, managing partner at the firm. "Travis, while he had many flaws, greatly personified this warrior ethos and was able to execute on this vision and grow the company at such a pace and such a valuation."

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-fires-executive-who-shared-rape-victims-medical-records-1496891613"

Singapore-based GrabTaxi Holdings Pte., known as Grab, led Uber in all Southeast Asian markets except Singapore in cumulative downloads for the 12 months ending in May, according to data from mobile app analytics firm App Annie. Uber did win in India, slipping ahead of Bangalore-based ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola. Ride-sharing companies typically don't disclose rides per day.

"Uber is losing the race in Asia," said Rushabh Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at researcher Canalys. "In the two largest markets here, India and Indonesia, Uber is under serious attack by Ola and Grab, respectively."

In addition to having local connections, Asia's ride-sharing companies are more agile, can adapt quickly to domestic rules and are ensuring better service to keep driver retention high, he said.

An Uber spokesman declined to say whether its strategy may change in the region following Mr. Kalanick's departure.

In India, where the rise of the cheap smartphone is creating millions of potential new customers, Uber has said it is investing more than $1 billion boosting its mapping capabilities, hiring more engineers and training new drivers. But Ola, valued at $5 billion and backed by investors including Japan's SoftBank Group Corp., operates in more cities and says it has more drivers, offering features like auto-rickshaw rides. An Ola spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Kalanick's departure.

A woman who in 2014 was raped by an Uber driver in India is suing the company in the U.S., saying Mr. Kalanick, Mr. Alexander and another top deputy who also left the company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rape-victim-sues-uber-over-handling-of-medical-records-1497559138".

In a statement, an Uber spokesman said: "No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks." Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Alexander didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people, is another key battleground.

While Uber has tangled with regulators and taxi unions globally, Grab has said it works closely with authorities and even has partnerships with local taxi companies. It has recently expanded to offer mobile payments. Grab is valued at $3 billion and is also backed by SoftBank, among others.

"We're well-positioned to win," a spokeswoman said, though she declined to comment on Mr. Kalanick.

Another major rival in Southeast Asia is Indonesia's Go-Jek, a fast-growing motorcycle-hailing startup backed by KKR, Warburg Pincus LLC and others. The company launched its app in 2015 and has expanded to provide food and package delivery, on-demand beauty and cleaning services and more. A Go-Jek spokesman declined to comment.

Uber's management troubles at home could help Grab and Go-Jek woo drivers and users, said Vishal Harnal, a Singapore-based Partner at venture-capital firm 500 Startups, a Grab investor.

"Grab and Go-Jek are going to be able to do a lot more while Uber has other fires to fight," he said.

Rickshaws Plus Technology Equals a Better Commute in Developing World; From big data  to mobile payments, technology is improving informal transportation networks in megacities of Asia and Africa

Corrections & Amplifications

Columbia University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Nairobi, and Groupshot, a technology design firm, were all involved in collecting data on Nairobi's matatu minibuses and creating a map of the system. An earlier version of this article incorrectly omitted MIT, the University of Nairobi and Groupshot. (June 22, 2017)

In cities where a nightmare commute consists of a train delay, it is hard to imagine the challenge of getting around in the developing world's megacities, where a dearth of public transit means residents may have to rely on a rickshaw or an unregulated minivan to get where they need to go.

Routes and times on these informal transportation networks can change without notice, causing people to waste hours in transit, and fares can be unpredictable.

Now, new technologies from big data to mobile-payment systems to geolocation-enabled smartphones are helping to make some of these informal networks safer and more efficient. And that is allowing public officials to better integrate public transportation systems with the informal ones, creating a future in which residents in cities such as Delhi, India, and Bangkok, Thailand, will be able to plan an efficient trip that involves taking a public bus two stops and then transferring to a tuk-tuk (a three-wheeled rickshaw known for its distinctive engine sound).

Identifying patterns

The issue is becoming more critical because in the coming decades, hundreds of millions of people will move to vast urban areas already choked with pollution and snarled by traffic congestion. In 1950, there were two cities of more than 10 million people; by 2040, there will be more than 40. From Lagos, Nigeria, to Karachi, Pakistan, to Kinshasa in the Congo, populations rely on informal mass-transit systems employing everything from minibuses to motorbikes to get them from place to place.

In Nairobi, Kenya, for example, 20,000 colorful "matatu" minibuses operate with little regulation, and many routes are run by local gangs. To maximize income, drivers try to carry as many passengers as possible and drive as fast as possible. The vehicles are poorly maintained and often unsafe.

In India, tuk-tuks account for 20% of motorized trips in some cities. But an inability to match supply and demand can result in inefficient pricing and low usage rates. Drivers spending hours looking for fares are more likely to refuse to take passengers to distant locations, or to jack up rates if they worry about finding a return fare. Residents thus spend even more of their already meager incomes on transportation. Uncertainty about being able to hail a ride also raises safety concerns, especially for female travelers.

Even in areas where local officials want to improve the transportation situation, they often lack good information about riding habits and preferences or about the informal network that most people use, making it difficult to build a public transportation system that connects with the informal one.

But that is starting to change.

In Nairobi, my colleagues from Columbia University, working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Nairobi, and Groupshot, a local technology design firm, produced a map of the seemingly Byzantine matatu system based on GPS data collected from riders' mobile phones. They discovered that these bottom-up networks actually have a logic and pattern to them. With these networks now mapped, users can access the system more easily and efficiently, and local officials can plan bus and train routes around it. This comprehensive database of the matatu system allows easy mapping in Google Maps or other trip-planning applications.

Elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East, a startup backed by an Uber Technologies executive and an investment group formed by the founder of eBay Inc. is compiling information on the routes of minibuses and tuk-tuks so that it, too, can be compiled into network maps. This company, called WhereIsMyTransport, has data for 21 cities, and has fully mapped the informal transportation networks in Gaborone, Botswana, as well as in East London and Cape Town in South Africa.

In South Africa, planners initially intended to replace the informal networks, but they now plan to integrate them more seamlessly into new Bus Rapid Transit systems, since the informal networks are carrying an increasing fraction of passengers in the country. Similar efforts are under way in Manila; Mexico City; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Middle Eastern cities such as Beirut, Cairo, and Amman, Jordan.

In India, local startups have developed new mobile applications so that riders can hail rickshaws more easily, reducing uncertainty for riders and standardizing fares. Data collected through ride-hailing apps also allows for route optimization. And ride-hailing apps improve safety, especially for female riders now able to identify their drivers and more easily report harassment.

Technology also can ease congestion by improving the efficiency of carpooling, already very much part of the culture in many developing economies.

In Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore, the ride-hailing company Grab has created a service called GrabHitch in which people can earn extra cash by allowing others to hitch a ride on their motorbikes.

Even in poorer cities, most people own mobile phones, and thus can pay for rides using mobile payments. This improves safety and convenience, reduces haggling, and enables innovative pricing schemes like peak and off-peak pricing.

Although new forces of information technology, data analytics and local entrepreneurship are coming together to improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the informal mass-transit networks that many in the developing world rely on, that doesn't mean governments are off the hook.

In the long term, rapidly growing megacities will struggle to keep pace with the demand for urban mobility without an increase in government investment.

Tech
SoftBank Invests $100 Million in Cybersecurity Startup; Deal values Boston-based Cybereason at about $1 billion

Japan's SoftBank Corp. is investing $100 million into a Boston-based cybersecurity firm run by former Israel counterintelligence members, the latest high-profile cash injection into a bustling industry offering newfound defenses against global hackers.

The deal, which will be announced early Wednesday, values Cybereason at about $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm, founded in 2012, has raised a total of $189 million so far with investors. The latest investment isn't part of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-saudis-to-launch-100-billion-tech-fund-1495270854" the Japanese firm launched in May with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund.

A string of high-profile cyberattacks, including last month's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wannacry-malware-has-strong-links-to-group-tied-to-north-korea-symantec-says-1495519053" and a series of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/four-men-charged-in-connection-with-yahoo-breach-1489592862" have exposed how hackers are quickly discovering new ways to unearth network vulnerabilities. A spate of startups like Cybereason are pitching a new generation of computer security products that use machine learning and computer algorithms to sniff out problems before they spread.

The WannaCry attack was spotted instantaneously by Cybereason's algorithms requiring no human intervention and no clients were affected, said Lior Div, Cybereason's chief executive, and a former decorated Israeli cyberintelligence officer, in an interview. The firm's clients, including SoftBank and Lockheed Martin Corp., use Cybereason often in tandem with legacy services offered by Symantec Corp. or McAfee LLC.

"Today we're the last line of defense, but I would argue we're the only line of defense because the first line of defense is not working," said Mr. Div, 39 years old.

Cybereason is one of several new cybersecurity startups attracting interest from deep-pocketed investors. Tanium, the world's most valuable cybersecurity startup, valued at $3.75 billion, and CrowdStrike, which helped the Democratic National Committee respond last year to a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intelligence-officials-to-testify-as-senate-examines-russian-hacking-1483612205", both raised $100 million last month. Another cyber firm, Illumio, raised $125 million earlier this month.

SoftBank, which spans a Japanese telecom arm, U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp., and U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings Inc., is increasing its investment staff around the world, betting on technology that it says will be key when everyday items like shoes and microwaves are connected to the internet.

The company recently led a funding round for London-based startup Improbable, which designs virtual worlds for videogames and simulations that can be applied to the real world, as well as Alphabet Inc.'s robot units.

Global security spending is forecast to hit $81.7 billion in 2017, according to market researcher International Data Corp., with forecasts of growth to about $105 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-funds-flood-startups-with-cash-1495661572" during the first three months of this year, up 13% from the same period in 2016, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource.

This new generation of antivirus companies are poised to grow as the industry moves away from blocking hackers by creating digital fingerprints or signatures of computer worms and viruses to stop them.

These new firms can offer more, said Ted Schlein, general partner with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture-capital firm, which has invested in Carbon Black Inc., a Cybereason competitor.

"We are transforming ourselves into the post-signature world," Mr. Schlein said.

Cybereason will use SoftBank's cash injection to further develop its technology, hire more employees and potentially acquire some smaller firms, Mr. Div said. The firm was founded by Mr. Div and two other ex-members of Israel's Unit 8200, the equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency.

Talented hackers will almost always figure out a way to bust into a network, but the key is identifying those initial breaches and preventing deep damage, Mr. Div said.

The Cybereason platform which the firm boasts is "military-grade" is automated and powered by artificial intelligence, able to track vast networks in real-time. "Cybersecurity is a problem that's not going away," Mr. Div said. "The problem will keep evolving forever."

Morgan Stanley is trying to get in on the ground in technology - and in diversity - by launching an "innovation lab" to nurture emerging tech talent among women and ethnic minorities.

A four-month programme will begin in July and culminate in a symposium that will expose companies to potential investors.

Any start-up with seed funding can apply, as long as they have a "multicultural" or female founder, chief technology officer or other member of the C-suite. The bank is targeting four or five companies for its first cohort, building to 10 to 15 over time, to rival similar-sized accelerators such as Techstars and Y Combinator.

Successful applicants will receive $200,000 in investment, in the form of equity or convertible notes; a bit of space on the ninth floor of the bank's global headquarters in Times Square, New York; support from the bank's network of potential customers; and - according to an application form seen by the Financial Times - "impactful content relevant to company growth and scale".

Alice Vilma , executive director of the bank's multicultural client strategy committee, said: "We've seen a lot of the rhetoric around the gap between the ability to access capital for multicultural entrepreneurs and women, especially outside of Silicon Valley.

"If companies are scalable, bankable and investable, and if the only thing they lack is access to capital and networks, we'll provide that, with early-stage growth capital."

Morgan Stanley is aiming at "technology or technology-enabled" start-ups, all the way from artificial intelligence and data analytics, to healthcare and advanced manufacturing.

As such, the effort goes a step beyond the investments all the big banks have been making in fintech, which are mostly later stage.

Morgan Stanley is trying to get in on the ground in technology   and in diversity   by launching an  innovation lab  to nurture emerging tech talent among women and people of colour.

A four-month programme will begin in July and culminate in a symposium that will expose companies to potential investors through showcase presentations.

Any start-up with seed funding can apply, as long as they have a  multicultural  or female founder, chief technology officer or other member of the C-suite. The bank is targeting four or five companies for its first cohort, building up to 10 to 15 over time, to rival similar-sized accelerators such as Techstars and Y Combinator.

Successful applicants will receive $200,000 in investment, in the form of equity or convertible notes; a bit of space on the ninth floor of the bank s global headquarters in Times Square, New York; support from the bank s network of potential customers; and   according to an application form seen by the Financial Times    impactful content relevant to company growth and scale .

Winners will be notified within the next couple of weeks.

Alice Vilma, executive director of the bank s multicultural client strategy committee, said:  We ve seen a lot of the rhetoric around the gap between the ability to access capital for multicultural entrepreneurs and women, especially outside of Silicon Valley.

 If companies are scalable, bankable and investable, and if the only thing they lack is access to capital and networks, we ll provide that, with early-stage growth capital. 

Morgan Stanley is aiming at  technology or technology-enabled  start-ups, all the way from artificial intelligence and data analytics, to healthcare and advanced manufacturing. As such, the effort goes a step beyond the investments all the big banks have been making in fintech, which are mostly later stage.

Morgan Stanley ranks fourth among the big US banks by number of "https://cbi-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017.06.13-Top-10-US-Banks-Fintech-Investments.png", according to CB Insights, a research house, behind Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Its slate includes R3, a blockchain consortium, Kensho, which automates previously human-intensive research, and AcadiaSoft, which helps banks manage collateral for derivatives contracts.

The bank s move to explicitly target women and people of colour also goes beyond initiatives elsewhere.

BBVA, the Madrid-based bank which operates in the US through Compass, announced this month that it had selected 20   "https://www.bbva.com/en/20-social-entrepreneurs-texas-selected-join-bbva-momentums-inaugural-class-u-s/"  to join the inaugural class of BBVA Momentum, a seven-month incubator run in conjunction with the McCombs School at the University of Texas at Austin.

JPMorgan, meanwhile, is the main backer of the Financial Solutions Lab, a $30m, five-year initiative managed by the Chicago-based non-profit, the Center for Financial Services Innovation. The theme for this year s cohort   the third   is supporting the needs of often overlooked segments of society, including people of colour, the ageing, people with disabilities and low-income women.

The "https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/news/pr/fin-lab-announces-winners-of-2017-competition.htm" for the lab, announced last week, include Dave, a mobile app that alerts consumers that they are about to become overdrawn at their bank and offers up to $75 interest-free so they can avoid fees; and Token Transit, which enables people on low incomes to pay for public transport.

One applicant hoping to make Morgan Stanley s first class of 2017 is Ramona Ortega, a former securities lawyer now running Mi Dinero Mi Futuro (My Money My Future), a portal that offers tools to help young multicultural consumers build diversified investment portfolios.

Too many products backed by Wall Street are aimed at digging people out of holes, she says, citing payday loans and apps used to bump up credit scores.

 We want to build wealth, not  health,   she says.  We re helping people thrive, not survive.

CVC Capital Partners, Europe s biggest private equity group, has agreed to buy a large controlling stake in QA, the IT training company for 700m, a person familiar with the sale said.

The buyout giant managed to preempt an auction ahead a competitive bidding process expected for the second half of this year.

 QA is a leader in its field, it has grown tremendously over the last year and it has an excellent management team,  the person familiar with the sale said.

QA is the market leader in the growing IT education and training sector. Its revenues and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have grown by over 20 per cent per year.

QA is helping UK businesses address the acute skills shortage and accelerating pace of technological change, including in key areas such as cyber, cloud and big data.

William Macpherson is expected to continue as chief executive, retaining a significant investment in the company alongside the senior management team.

CVC declined to comment.

CVC Capital Partners, Europe s biggest private equity group, has agreed to buy a controlling stake in QA, the UK IT training company, for 700m.

The buyout group made its purchase to get ahead of QA management s plan to hold a competitive auction in the second half of this year.

Conversations to acquire the company went on for  a number of months before the start of the calendar year , a person involved in the transaction said.

QA provides training for UK businesses that need help filling skills shortages in areas such as cyber security, cloud computing and big data. It runs 1,500 courses at learning centres throughout the country.

The purchase comes at a time when business leaders are increasingly worried about the shortage of digital skills in their workplace. A study published last year by the House of Commons revealed that roughly one in 12 British people have never used the internet.

William Macpherson, QA s chief executive, said the company is well-placed to narrow the growing skills gap.  Employers are not finding the skills in the marketplace and they have to invest in developing the skills , said Mr Macpherson, who will continue as chief executive. He and the senior management team will retain a significant investment in the company.

 Brand-new computer science graduates are covering tech that s three years out of date. That s not helpful when you get into the job market,  he added.

CVC declined to comment.

A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce published in April revealed that 84 per cent of companies say digital and IT skills are more important to their business than two years ago. The survey of more than 1,400 businesses across the UK, also showed half of respondents saying these skills are significantly more important.

However, Mr Macpherson said his company faces challenges.  The challenge is that if you think of "https://www.ft.com/reports/cyber-security?mhq5j=e1"as forever changing, we have to be at the forefront of understanding the cyber problems to teach our clients.

 We need to keep them plugged in with the issues.

New Enterprise Associates has closed its latest massive fund with $3.3 billion. It's the largest venture fund raised to date, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

The new fund, which closed at its hard cap, is just larger than NEA's last pool of $3.15 billion in 2015, which included a $2.85 billion main fund and a $350 million opportunity fund for investing in growth stage "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150415eb4f9q8fh".

NEA's new 16th fund continues a trend of strong fundraising among venture capital firms, as limited partners seek to find growth in new emerging startups. Venture-capital fundraising had a near record-setting year with $44 billion raised "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-fundraising-surges-to-44-billion-1484197263", only second to the dot-com era mania, though fundraising cooled slightly in the first quarter of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fundraising-cools-but-early-stage-stays-strong-1491391804"

Menlo Park, Calif.- and Chevy Chase, Maryland-based NEA has not finished investing out of its opportunity fund, and it hasn't decided if it will raise another one, said Scott Sandell, managing general partner at NEA. The firm has already started investing out of the new main fund.

With the new fund, Mr. Sandell has become the sole managing general partner as part of NEA's long-planned generational leadership transition. In its previous fund, Mr. Sandell joined Peter Barris as co-managing general partner. Now, as planned, Mr. Barris is becoming chairman and remains a general partner. Dick Kramlich, who was chairman, is now chairman emeritus.

NEA, a multistage investor in technology and health care startups, has invested in companies such as Jet.com, Data Domain, Fusion-io, Opower, Opendoor, Desktop Metal and Tableau Software.

Among its many areas of interest, there's particular recent focus on genetics-related startups in healthcare, with prices for sequencing genomes dropping rapidly. Secondly, the firm has looked at startups jumping on the move from online to offline, such as mattress company Casper, a portfolio company. The use of technology tools are transforming previously offline industries, Mr. Sandell said.

"There is this tool kit that is changing the physics of innovation and company-building in a literal sense," Mr. Sandell said.

NEA did a survey and found that its startups are affecting 36 different industries, Mr. Sandell said.

Finally, rapid advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence are affecting every software and cloud-related startup, he added.

NEA's 2009 vintage Fund 13 had an internal rate of return of 18.82%, as of September 30, 2016, according to data posted by the California State Teachers' Retirement System, a limited partner.

Amazon Is Leading Tech's Takeover of America; Tentacles of a handful of tech giants are reaching into industries no one ever expected them to, reshaping our world in their image

Why does a phone maker get into banking transactions? Why does a social network build a virtual-reality headset? Why does an online retailer buy a grocery chain?

Amazon.com Inc.'s just-announced "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-for-13-7-billion-1497618446" is just the most extreme example of a larger, more consequential phenomenon: America's biggest tech companies are spreading their tentacles, pushing into complementary businesses in a play to sustain growth as they saturate the market for their existing goods. Led by hard-charging executives, these companies are fueled by classic ambition combined with the almost messianic attitude of those in Silicon Valley that tech can fix every industry on Earth.

The impact of all this is clear: Existing businesses that can't respond by becoming tech companies themselves are going to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-to-ceos-the-future-is-now-1495791003", and power and wealth will be concentrated in the hands of a few companies in a way not seen since the Gilded Age. The rest of us will have to decide how comfortable we are buying all our goods and services from the members of an oligopoly.

Think about it: Apple Inc., a computer company that became a phone company, is now working on "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-permit-reveals-self-driving-car-testers-with-nasa-experience-1493042728", "https://www.recode.net/2017/6/16/15814908/apple-tv-sony-jamie-erlicht-zack-van-amburg-eddy-cue" and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-new-big-bet-augmented-reality-1496779717", while pushing into payments territory previously controlled by banks, moves that could make it "https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/22/apple-trillion-dollar-company-18-months/" in the world.

Facebook Inc., still seen by some as a baby-pictures-and-birthday-reminders company, is creating drones, virtual-reality hardware, original TV shows, even telepathic "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-facebooks-telepathic-texting-is-supposed-to-work-1497182402".

Google parent Alphabet Inc., still largely an ad company with a search engine, built Android, which now runs more personal computing devices than any other software on Earth. It ate the maps industry; it's working on internet-beaming balloons, energy-harvesting kites and ways to extend the human lifespan. It is also arguably the leader in self-driving tech.

Meanwhile, serial disrupter Elon Musk brings his tech notions to any market he pleases finance, autos, energy, aerospace. He hasn't bothered to gather all his projects under a single stock symbol yet, but he sees them as interlocking. He is delivering satellites to orbit and wants to put colonists on Mars, a backup in case his other planet-saving efforts fail. Those include electric self-driving cars, home energy storage, traffic-easing tunnels and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-hardware-update-for-the-human-brain-1496660400" to help people compete with AI.

What distinguishes Amazon in this group is that it's the company most willing to work on mundane, everyday problems. In the long run, this might be the smarter move. While Google and Facebook have yet to drive significant revenue outside their core businesses, and Apple is only just beginning to, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has managed to create business after business that is profitable, or at least not a drag on the bottom line.

One way he does this is by moving not just laterally from books to consumer packaged goods but vertically, through the supply chains that create and deliver goods. Thus, Amazon used its experience running its own websites to create Amazon Web Services, now a "https://www.geekwire.com/2017/aws-revenue-42-percent-3-66-billion-q1-2017-operating-income-reaches-890-million/". And it's working on its own network of trucks and planes to disrupt UPS. Physical retail still nearly 90% of consumer purchases as of 2016, not including car and gasoline sales is just the latest frontier.

This trajectory wasn't obvious 15 years ago. You couldn't guess that a handful of companies would leverage their expertise, talent pools and capital to eat industries outside their own, or that they would become planet-spanning conglomerates that are as likely to "http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/27/technology/apple-services/index.html"as buy them.

The iPhone, Apple's cash machine, is only 10 years old. Mr. Musk's SpaceX was founded in 2002 and Tesla in 2003. Amazon started Web Services in 2002 and made its first big acquisition (Zappos) in 2009. Google founded its X incubator for far-out ideas in 2010, and Facebook only went public in 2012.

Two things become apparent from this timeline: First, it's flabbergasting how quickly both the revenue and the ambitions of these companies have grown. Second and this should really give us pause they are just getting started.

What does a company like Apple, which has a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash, do with all that money? Anything it wants. The same is true for Amazon, Facebook, Google and "Elon Musk Inc.," an entity with so much marketing savvy and personal charisma that he is able to call upon the financial markets for fresh infusions of cash whenever he needs them, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-supports-his-business-empire-with-unusual-financial-moves-1461781962?mod=e2fb".

A key reason these companies are behaving differently than their peers is that the fundamental technologies of the microchip, the internet, wireless connectivity, just-in-time manufacturing, robotics, big data, etc., have made it possible. Those with expertise in these areas can create businesses that solve existing problems in entirely new ways, or at least more efficiently and profitably. It also doesn't hurt when investors believe this to be true Amazon enjoyed a soaring stock valuation for more than a decade without reporting much in the way of profits.

Here are some thought experiments: Will Amazon eventually sell you personal transportation? Will Apple start a bank? Will Facebook buy a cable network? Is Elon Musk going to build a standing army?

And while we might like how these companies deliver services, goods and innovation in new and exciting ways, eventually we're going to have to ask ourselves, as a country and as a civilization, just how much power we're comfortable having consolidated in the hands of so few businesses.

Imagine a future in which Amazon, which already employs north of 340,000 people world-wide, is America's biggest employer. Imagine we're all spending money at what's essentially the company store, and when we get home we're streaming Amazon's media. The latest update from the Amazon News Network features a smiling Jeff Bezos, president of the newly formed North American Union. I'm joking, of course but only a little.

Snap Faces Tricky Path to Growth --- Social-media company woos ads with pledge for human touch, but algorithms are tested

Corrections & Amplifications

PMX Agency has purchased ads on Snapchat for its clients. A Technology article in the Friday-Sunday edition about Snapchat ads incorrectly said the company doesn't have a business relationship with Snap because a PMX spokeswoman provided inaccurate information.

(WSJA June 19, 2017)

(END)

When the company behind Snapchat hatched plans to earn money from its popular messaging app, it told advertisers their ads would only appear beside content curated by people.

Now, Snap Inc. is in a tricky spot. To boost revenue, the 6-year-old company will ultimately need more of the tailored packages of pictures and videos, called Stories, that advertisers prize. Expanding its offering using only editors could be a slow and costly effort, but letting computers do the work would eliminate the human touch that has helped Snapchat stand out.

Ads accounted for nearly all of Snap's $149.6 million in revenue in the latest quarter, which surged from a year earlier but declined sequentially for the first time.

The Venice, Calif.-based company gets ad revenue from several areas, including publisher content and sponsorships. While Stories is a smaller share -- it could amount to more than one-quarter of ad revenue this year, Barclays PLC estimates -- it is the lever Snap has the greatest control over.

Snap created Stories four years ago to take advantage of the steady stream of pictures and videos people send in private, disappearing messages called Snaps. By allowing users to stitch Snaps together into a narrative arc that could be shared publicly for 24 hours, Stories showed how Snapchat could be more than just a messaging app.

More important, it gave Snap a place to showcase ads. Unlike Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., Snapchat doesn't have a content feed optimized by algorithms. And it doesn't show traditional ads with most of the three billion Snaps.

Facebook, by comparison, pulled in $7.86 billion in ad revenue in the first quarter, driven by ads placed in the news feeds of its 1.28 billion daily users. Twitter had $474 million in ad revenue and 328 million monthly users in the first quarter.

With its stock falling more than 22% since its first earnings report, Snap is under pressure from investors to prove its new form of advertising will grow. "Snap might be able to scale with human editors, but it will be labor intensive and won't make much money," said Pedro Domingos, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington who wrote a book on machine learning.

In the first quarter, Snap editors created more than 450 Stories, called Our Stories, chief strategist Imran Khan said on an earnings call. While Snapchat's 166 million daily users also can create Stories that carry ads, those don't have the ability to go viral. Users see Stories from editors and people they follow, and Snapchat has no equivalent to a "share" or "retweet."

Snap doesn't talk publicly about its process for curating Stories, but former employees say about 50 people scan videos -- as many as 100,000 a day -- to piece them into narratives and weed out inappropriate content.

Workers try to focus on positive Stories, they say.

At the same time that competitors including Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube

are grappling with how to handle inappropriate material, curation lets Snap position its content as high-quality.

"There is a degree of safety for brands with Snap's human curation," said Chris Paradysz, co-chief executive of the digital-marketing firm PMX Agency, which doesn't have a business relationship with Snap. "How that scales is everybody's head-scratcher."

Snap says it is committed to human curation, and the company is testing new software to help editors more quickly and efficiently craft Stories, former employees say. Editors will remain critical to how Snap presents stories in the more prominent "Discover" section of the app, a spokeswoman said.

Still, Snap has hired people with machine-learning expertise, a person familiar with the matter said. And since 2014 Snap has filed for patents related to automated content curation, according to research firm CB Insights.

Last year, Snap tested tools that help create Stories using algorithms.

The company isn't planning on including ads in algorithm-created content, said a spokeswoman, who added that the company doesn't speculate about future plans.

During the first phase of testing, algorithms flagged when users in New York created a burst of Snaps after a statue of Donald Trump appeared in August. Editors then culled the content into a Story, according to a person who saw the tool in action.

A later version of the tool did the work of pulling Snaps together for editors to evaluate. Stories sometimes contained coherent narratives, but often were nonsensical, former employees said.

In March, Snap pushed the experiment further forward, creating a Stories search tool that uses machine learning to scrape information in posts to show users relevant content. The algorithms group related content around themes such as "NYU Law School Graduation" or simple categories such as "turtle." At times they failed to flag foul language, while a video of women in plaid shirts was in the turtle section.

"The hard part for machine learning," Prof. Domingos said, "is understanding what makes a good story."

Baidu, With a Move Into Fintech, Gets Wary Credit-Ratings Look; The search engine's move into unsecured consumer lending and uninsured investment products brings it more risk

BEIJING "http://quotes.wsj.com/BIDU". is among China's tech giants looking to get a leg up in the competitive financial-services market. Credit-rating companies aren't so sure it's a good idea.

Fitch recently placed Baidu on negative watch, citing "significantly higher" business risks as it moves into making unsecured consumer loans and selling uninsured investments known as wealth-management products, which Fitch said are "part of the shadow banking system in China."

Moody's decided last month to place Baidu's bond ratings on review for a downgrade, citing concerns over the firm's short history in the financial-services business.

Baidu's financial services, which also include its mobile payment platform, now account for about 12% of its assets, or 25 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) representing rapid growth for a firm that formed its financial-services group only about a year ago. That has significantly changed Baidu's credit profile, said Moody's vice president and senior credit officer Lina Choi.

"The execution risk is high," Ms. Choi said of wealth-management products, which are targeted at consumers looking to earn more than they could in bank deposits or bonds. "If these investments do not yield expected returns or generate losses for retail investors, that may result in reputation risks to Baidu."

A Baidu spokeswoman declined to comment on the actions by Moody's and Fitch. On Baidu's most recent earnings conference call, however, then-Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li said the firm's financial services were "progressing very well."

The credit-rating firms' reports haven't troubled Baidu's share price, which is up about 8% this year on Nasdaq through Wednesday. Analysts said the bigger issue, reflected in its stock performance, is slowing growth, particularly in its core search business.

"Investors have been concerned about Baidu's slowing growth rate compared with the other internet giants in China," said Marie Sun, an analyst at Morningstar.

Along with Baidu, Chinese tech giants "http://quotes.wsj.com/BABA". and "http://quotes.wsj.com/HK/XHKG/0700". also are moving into the attractive and risky fintech space as they all look to move beyond their core businesses. The fintech products they offer include short-term consumer loans and wealth-management products.

Fitch said Baidu's credit risk is higher than that of Alibaba and Tencent because it doesn't have the financial might of those two rivals, which are more profitable and have stronger cash-generation abilities. Alibaba shares are up 56% this year through Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, and Tencent shares in Hong Kong have risen 44% through Thursday.

Oftentimes, wealth-management products are bundles of corporate loans, trusts and other investment vehicles making it difficult for investors to understand what they are getting. The products have attracted "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-central-bank-seeks-more-control-over-wealth-management-products-1477450399".

Tencent recently joined with China Rapid Finance, a consumer-lending marketplace, to offer more investment products. Tencent also runs a distribution channel that lends users sums ranging from 500 to 300,000 yuan (roughly $75 to $44,000) through its online banking affiliate, with interest rates ranging from 7.3% to 18.25%. The average loan size distributed is around 8,200 yuan ($1,200).

Alibaba Group's financial affiliate, Ant Financial, offers lines of credit and consumer loans with lending limits of 50,000 yuan a month. The company says more than 100 million users have taken out loans, with interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 8.8%.

"There's a good appetite for personal loans and one that hasn't fully been met," said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based tech consultancy. "The online lending platforms allow loan products to extend to a much greater percentage of the population."

Last year, about 160 million Chinese went online to take out loans worth 1.2 trillion yuan ($177 billion). Analytics firm iResearch expects China's lending to grow at an annual rate of 50% for the next three years.

One reason China's internet giants have waded into the fintech business is the vast amount of data they collect, and which they can use to assess creditworthiness in nontraditional ways, such as by analyzing a person's search history or online video-watching patterns.

Baidu's finance group has focused particularly on the education-loan market, where it says it has a market share of roughly 75%. Typical borrowers are 20- to 35-year-olds who are attending a trade school or signed up for language or IT programs.

A Baidu financial-services group executive said the company now has partnerships with more than 2,500 educational institutions in China and provides, at peak times, 3,000 loans each day to students.

When Truman Chu needed a loan to help pay for his M.B.A. degree at Tsinghua University, the 33-year-old didn't turn to traditional banks but instead went to China's internet search giant.

Mr. Chu applied for a loan from Baidu two years ago, after hearing about its lending program in association with Tsinghua's School of Economics and Management. He filled out an application on his smartphone while walking through campus. Fifteen minutes later, he received confirmation for a loan for 118,000 yuan ($17,370), which covered tuition for his first year of business school.

"It was so convenient, unlike commercial banks where you have to go to a designated bank and line up and apply for it," said Mr. Chu, who is repaying his loan in three years at an annual interest rate of nearly 6%.

Most of Baidu's education loans are for less than 30,000 yuan (roughly $4,400), though a small number of elite graduate loans can range higher. The Baidu executive says the company aims to serve one million students a year.

Baidu said it offers sales incentives to some of the schools it works with and wires money directly to the institution when the loan is approved.

Baidu's consumer interest rates range from 10.8% to 18%, with 70% of its consumer loans falling between 13% and 15%. For elite education loans, such as M.B.A. programs, Baidu's interest rates are lower to stay competitive with state-run bank rates. The average loan amount made by Baidu is 15,000 yuan ($2,200), with many borrowers getting more than one loan.

In the U.S., average graduate or professional federal loans charge interest rates between 5% and 6%; private loan rates vary from 9% to 12%.

Baidu says its loans are an option for students who can't get traditional bank loans. Mr. Natkin notes that there is a risk the borrowers don't fully understand the debt they are taking on.

"We've seen a number of loan products that have been problematic," Mr. Natkin, the Beijing consultant, said, referring to unscrupulous peer-to-peer online lending practices. Still, industry executives see the huge potential of China's online lending marketplace.

"The Chinese market is unique in that it's still relatively new in terms of offering unsecured credit to consumers," says Douglas Merrill, founder and chief executive of Zest Finance, an online lender that has worked with Baidu on underwriting technology. "There's a massive opportunity to create a whole new credit ecosystem."

Tech Companies to Watch (A Special Report) --- Medical Benefits That Work: Collective Health says insurance can be less costly for employers and less frustrating for workers

2. As costs for health care keep rising, Collective Health Inc. is counting on companies turning to it for better ways to spend their medical dollars.

Collective Health administers health benefits for businesses that self-insure, meaning they cover their employees' medical claims themselves instead of paying premiums to an insurer. Most large and many small and midsize companies self-insure because it lets them customize their benefits and save money in the long term.

Collective Health uses enterprise software that boasts strong analytics that can help its customers yield insights from their own data and so better manage costs. It says its system also helps clients connect their employees with resources to manage budding health concerns before they worsen, and its call-center staff have incentives to not just answer questions but to guide plan members to the right care.

Since securing its first customer in 2015, Collective Health has grown to handle health benefits for 77,000 employees and their dependents across 15 clients, including eBay Inc., Activision Blizzard Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc.

Chief Executive Ali Diab has raised $150 million in venture capital for the San Francisco company, whose self-proclaimed ambition is to make people love their health-insurance plan.

"What Ali's really done well is he's built a mission-driven company," says Mohamad Makhzoumi, a general partner with New Enterprise Associates, which invested in Collective Health.

Mr. Diab co-founded the company in October 2013 after experiencing a personal health crisis earlier that year. On a March afternoon he was sitting at his desk in San Francisco when he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen that would land him in the hospital for emergency surgery to treat an intestinal illness.

When he returned home, his insurer denied most of his hospital claims, saying the surgical procedure was experimental and resulted in a longer-than-normal hospital stay.

"I felt like I got the world's best care," the 43-year-old Mr. Diab says. "But the experience of understanding how I should pay for my care, what was covered, what was not covered, felt like a world apart." Mr. Diab, a technology entrepreneur, decided to use his experience to make health insurance better.

Much bigger companies, such as insurer UnitedHealth Group, are administering benefits and processing claims for self-insured companies, too. But Collective Health executives believe their execution and tech infrastructure will help them stand out.

For instance, Collective Health says its benefits statements are written at a third-grade reading level to reduce frustration for patients trying to understand what their insurer is telling them. Collective Health's platform, meanwhile, was built with data and analytics in mind, so that employers can look at claims data to predict costs more quickly, says Mr. Diab, who previously led product management and business operations for mobile-advertising startup AdMob Inc.

Mr. Diab's tech savvy and the medical expertise of physician and co-founder Rajaie Batniji are what sold Collective Health investor Blake Byers, a general partner with GV, the venture-capital arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc.

Dr. Byers says he was impressed with Mr. Diab's frankness about the difficulties their startup would face. Measured in his words and projections, Mr. Diab doesn't fit the archetype of the fast-talking Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Dr. Byers says.

"I had an immediate high degree of trust in the statements he was making," Dr. Byers says.

As costs for health care keep rising, Collective Health Inc. is counting on companies turning to it for better ways to spend their medical dollars. 

Collective Health administers health benefits for businesses that self-insure, meaning they cover their employees' medical claims themselves instead of paying premiums to an insurer. Most large and many small and midsize companies self-insure because it lets them customize their benefits and save money in the long term. 

Collective Health uses enterprise software that boasts strong analytics that can help its customers yield insights from their own data and so better manage costs. It says its system also helps clients connect their employees with resources to manage budding health concerns before they worsen, and its call-center staff have incentives to not just answer questions but to guide plan members to the right care. 

Since securing its first customer in 2015, Collective Health has grown to handle health benefits for 77,000 employees and their dependents across 15 clients, including eBay Inc., Activision Blizzard Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. 

Chief Executive Ali Diab has raised $150 million in venture capital for the San Francisco company, whose self-proclaimed ambition is to make people love their health-insurance plan. 

"What Ali's really done well is he's built a mission-driven company," says Mohamad Makhzoumi, a general partner with New Enterprise Associates, which invested in Collective Health. 

Mr. Diab co-founded the company in October 2013 after experiencing a personal health crisis earlier that year. On a March afternoon he was sitting at his desk in San Francisco when he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen that would land him in the hospital for emergency surgery to treat an intestinal illness. 

When he returned home, his insurer denied most of his hospital claims, saying the surgical procedure was experimental and resulted in a longer-than-normal hospital stay. 

"I felt like I got the world's best care," the 43-year-old Mr. Diab says. "But the experience of understanding how I should pay for my care, what was covered, what was not covered, felt like a world apart." Mr. Diab, a technology entrepreneur, decided to use his experience to make health insurance better.

Community-Bank Closure Stirs Ire

Did regulators shut down Guaranty Bank too soon?

People with ties to the Milwaukee-based community lender are calling on lawmakers and regulators to review the closure, saying they could have found private investors if they had been given a few more weeks. That, they say, would have avoided the $146.4 million price tag for taxpayers under a deposit-insurance program and prevented the loss of hundreds of jobs at its branches serving lower-income communities.

Deeming the bank "severely undercapitalized," the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on May 5 shut down Guaranty, a family-run bank with 119 branches in five states, most of them located inside grocery stores. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ., the bank's receiver, has sold it to First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co . at a steep discount. Roughly half of the bank's 1,000 employees have lost their jobs as 109 branches were shut down.

The bank's former executives say their plan to raise $100 million in fresh capital was moving along after they hired an investment banker in March. Two investors had made conditional commitments to invest a total of $55 million and were scheduled to visit the bank May 11 and 12.

"It's a travesty that they came in and shut us down weeks before recapitalizing," said Doug Levy, who stepped down as chief executive of the bank his family founded in 1923. "These investors were ready to invest," Mr. Levy said, describing them as well-regarded private-equity funds.

Bank failures have been rare in recent years. Guaranty, which had about $1 billion in assets, was among six banks to fail this year and the second largest after First NBC Bank"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-regulators-close-first-nbc-a-new-orleans-lender-1493420283" with $4.74 billion in assets.

Guaranty's troubles started during the financial crisis after its home-equity-loan portfolio declined sharply, and were compounded by a dispute with insurance companies over coverage for those loan losses.

The OCC said it decided to shut down Guaranty after "finding that the bank had experienced substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to unsafe or unsound practices." The bank failed to submit an acceptable capital-restoration plan, the regulator added.

Mr. Levy's team contests these points. The bank's capital, they say, had been stable at about $1 billion in recent years, while earnings were improving and nonperforming assets had diminished. The bank reported a $4 million loss for 2016, but that was due to a write-off related to settling the insurance dispute.

"Every month, the bank was making money. It was getting cleaner. What was the rush?" said Steve Hovde, the veteran Chicago investment banker hired by Guaranty. "I firmly believe this didn't need to be shut down," adding he had made weekly reports to the OCC on the progress of the capital-raising plan.

The regulators' decision to close Guaranty was discretionary, said David Baris, a Buckley Sandler LLP lawyer who represented the bank: Its capital ratio (the ratio of tangible equity to total assets) of 2.1% was above the 2% threshold under which banks are deemed "critically undercapitalized" and must be placed in receivership within 90 days.

Anita Gentle Newcomb, a banking consultant who isn't involved in the case, said the fact that potential investors made conditional commitments was no guarantee they would eventually put in capital.

The law allows a failed bank to mount a legal challenge to the FDIC's receivership but Guaranty didn't do so before the deadline.

The Levy family is now asking lawmakers to hold a hearing and calling for the OCC to conduct an internal investigation. "We are truly heartbroken about the injustice against our primarily minority employees, our low- to moderate-income customers and the FDIC fund," Mr. Levy said. An OCC spokesman declined to comment.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Fed Considers Easing Capital Rule Seen as Hampering Swaps Market

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON An esoteric requirement that bankers and some U.S. officials have long said discourages firms from participating in the derivatives market and makes the financial system less safe is on the regulatory chopping block.

At a private meeting in Washington this spring, senior bankers from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and other large U.S. financial firms pressed policy makers for changes to the rule. Their concerns were highlighted in a blueprint for a broad regulatory overhaul released by the Trump administration late Monday. The report from the Treasury Department recommends "significant adjustments" to the capital requirement in question, among other changes to capital rules.

The Federal Reserve, amid pressure from banks and some U.S. officials, has already begun laying the groundwork to ease the rule, according to people familiar with the central bank's thinking. The Fed, which helped craft the rule, has yet to reach a decision on how exactly to refashion it, but is taking a fresh look at the measure, holding staff-level discussions with other regulators and teeing up a potential rollback late this year, as the Trump administration continues to fill regulatory posts with officials amenable to easing Obama-era rules. No decision is imminent, these people said.

The rule calls for banks to hold additional capital against collateral, known as margin, that they collect from clients on certain swaps transactions. Banks and some U.S. officials say the rule makes it uneconomical for banks to participate in such transactions.

Swaps are derivatives contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in certain benchmarks. Companies use these contracts to hedge risks or make bets in such areas as fuel prices or interest rates.

The swaps at issue are routed through so-called clearinghouses, entities that take fees to guarantee swaps transactions should one side of a trade go belly up. Banks, which pay to be members of clearinghouses, post margin to a clearinghouse on behalf of their customers. Banks manage the margin for the duration of the swap, which can be several years.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which oversees the multitrillion-dollar swaps market, hosted the April meeting where the bank officials and regulators raised concerns about the capital rule's effects on the swaps market. CFTC officials have warned for years that the existing requirements are driving banks away from the low-margin business of managing customers' cleared swaps.

As fewer banks offer such services, that could increase prices for businesses that enter into these contracts to hedge business risks, CFTC officials say. As banks stop serving smaller clients because it doesn't make sense for them financially, the officials say, that undermines a key plank of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law requiring that most swaps be cleared.

The rule the Fed is now thinking of relaxing is called the "supplementary leverage ratio," which the central bank and two other banking regulators completed in 2014. The leverage ratio is one way of curbing bankers' risk-taking. It measures capital funds that banks raise from investors, earn through profits and use to absorb losses as a percentage of assets. By holding banks to a minimum ratio, regulators effectively restrict banks from making too many loans without adding new capital.

Under the leverage ratio, U.S. banks must maintain capital equal to roughly 3% to 6% of any asset, including loans, investments and real estate. That includes the margin that banks hold for their customers' cleared swaps transactions.

The leverage ratio itself has broad support, but many U.S. officials and industry executives have come to believe that the U.S. version is too strict when it comes to swaps margin. U.S. firms point out that the margin is legally "segregated" meaning banks can't touch the cash. Nevertheless, the leverage ratio increases the amount of capital banks must use to fund so-called swaps clearing activities.

Acting CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlohas urged banking regulators to change the rule, saying collateral from bank customers should be excluded from the leverage calculation. He estimated easing the rule would significantly reduce capital costs for banks' clearing units, though he said those changes would translate into only a small capital reduction at the bank holding company level.

"This dramatic reduction in costs on a service imperative to managing systemic risk in swaps is entirely worth the trade-off of a minuscule reduction in balance sheet protection," he said in a speech at an industry conference in Lisbon last month. "The financial system will be safer and more stable for it."

Mr. Giancarlo's message echoed by his Obama-appointed predecessor Timothy Massad  has resonated with some at the Fed, including Jerome Powell, who recently took over as the central bank's regulatory point person. In public remarks, Mr. Powell has said the Fed ought to take another look at how the rule is calibrated, warning it can lead to "excess costs" at banks.

"We're kind of undermining that clearing mandate and the ability of smaller customers to get their products centrally cleared or to have access at all to hedging," Mr. Powell said at an April industry conference in Washington. "I think we need to look again at the calibration of the leverage ratio in the United States for the large institutions, and I think there are a number of ways to get at that."

The Treasury Department agrees. In its report Monday, the administration recommended a series of possible changes to the capital requirements, from excluding customer margin from the leverage ratio to "recalibrating" the ratio so that it imposes less of an overall burden on banks.

Treasury Report Raises Expectations Era of Increased Oversight Is Over

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON The Trump administration's new plan for bank oversight is raising industry expectations that a postcrisis era of heightened regulation is over.

A report from the Treasury Department, released Monday, contains dozens of specific recommendations that can be executed by financial regulators.

Bankers and analysts said they expect the proposal will be a catalyst for changes to the Wall Street rule book once President Donald Trump's banking-oversight nominees are confirmed.

The report shows a desire by officials to take a lighter touch after years of new restrictions adopted in response to the 2008 financial crisis and the severe recession that followed.

It fleshes out statements in recent months by Mr. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , a former banker who has said the administration won't throw out bank rules wholesale, but that many aspects of the current regulatory regime are too restrictive.

"The greatest impact would be it would allow management and our board to go back to running and planning for the future of the company, as opposed to spending lots of mandated, repetitive hours reviewing and updating regulatory matters," William Demchak , chief executive of PNC Financial Services Group Inc., said in an interview.

He added that some changes, such as narrowing the scope of so-called liquidity rules, could free up the Pittsburgh-based firm to do more lending.

Many of the Treasury's proposed changes dovetail with bankers' previous recommendations, for instance in J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon's shareholder letter earlier this year.

"The road ahead remains long given the sluggish pace of personnel shifts, but these recommendations should be viewed as an undeniably positive policy signal for banks" said Isaac Boltansky , an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading LLC , in a note to clients.

Craig Phillips, the counselor to the U.S. Treasury secretary who played a central role in drafting the report, presented the recommendations to a conference hosted by two bank trade groups Tuesday.

"This is not a plan to help banks," but rather ideas meant to boost economic growth, he said. "There is a lot to do with regulatory overlap, fragmentation and duplication. This is one of the biggest issues," he added.

Mr. Phillips told the assembled crowd to expect additional reports on other topics including unwinding failed firms, designating companies systemically important, nonbank financial services and markets oversight.

Liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups said the recommendations would undermine protections against fraud and excessive risk-taking. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said that of roughly 300 entities that the Treasury Department said it consulted for the report, 244 came from the banking industry. The report says officials met with the banks of all sizes as well as consumer groups and others.

"Too many hardworking Americans still haven't fully recovered from the financial crisis, and Washington should be focused on protecting them by holding Wall Street accountable, not doing its bidding," Mr. Brown said in a news release Monday.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) in a statement Tuesday welcomed "reasonable and meaningful recommendations to the existing, and all too often, one-size-fits-all regulatory landscape."

Mr. Crapo appeared at the banking conference and said he believed some of the report's recommendations requiring congressional approval could win bipartisan support, especially those affecting small and medium-size banks.

Mr. Crapo also said he was open to a new idea raised in the Treasury's report: granting more power to the Financial Stability Oversight Council . The council was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and empowered to watch over the stability of the financial system.

The council includes the most powerful U.S. economic officials: the Treasury secretary, the chair of the Federal Reserve, and other top regulators.

Republicans for years have talked about hamstringing or abolishing the council. The Treasury report said Congress should grant it the power to assign a "lead regulator" to make decisions about policy matters involving multiple federal agencies.

Mr. Mnuchin has already used his position as chair of the council to push regulators to begin a review of the Volcker rule, a Dodd-Frank provision banning banks from certain types of trading, according to people familiar with the matter. That rule is enforced by five regulatory agencies, all of which have seats on the council.

"I don't like to generally consolidate even more power in such a powerful entity," Mr. Crapo said. "However, we are running into situations where the law gives up to five agencies the authority to administer one statute and they can't even get a consistent rule."

Treasury's suggestion "might be the right way to approach it," he said.

WSJ Pro: Trump Blueprint Will Help Senators Craft Regulatory Rollback, Lawmaker Says

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) on Tuesday said the Trump administration's broad blueprint for rolling back postcrisis rules will help senators craft a bipartisan financial overhaul.

Mr. Crapo said he is working with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the panel's ranking Democrat, on a bill that would ease requirements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law and other industry regulations.

The pair haven't announced the specifics of any plan, and he didn't offer specifics on how the Trump administration report might help lawmakers craft a deal. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate so far have only been able to agree on relatively minor changes to Dodd-Frank.

"It's going to be complicated...in terms of the subject matter and the scope that we have chosen for our legislation, but also in terms of the politics," Mr. Crapo said, speaking at a conference hosted by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and The Clearing House, both industry trade groups.

The comments came a day after the Trump administration released a detailed road map for President Donald Trump's promise to revisit a wave of regulations put in place after the financial crisis. The proposals would affect activities ranging from mortgage lending to Wall Street trading.

Mr. Crapo highlighted some of the Trump administration's recommendations that he said could be included in his bill. They include recommendations that Congress raise the $50 billion asset threshold at which big banks face stricter rules under Dodd-Frank, as well as changes to the structure and authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .

Mr. Crapo described the forthcoming legislation as the biggest item on his committee's agenda. He said Dodd-Frank changes would comprise a "huge part" of the bill because the law represents "a huge part of our regulatory system."

The remarks underscore how Senate lawmakers are unlikely to take up the Financial Choice Act, a GOP-backed measure that cleared the House along party lines last week. Mr. Crapo said his aim is to advance a bipartisan bill.

Another priority, he said, is an overhaul of the housing-finance system, to limit government control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , he said.

Mr. Crapo said any legislation to emerge from his panel would strike a middle ground between calls to liquidate Fannie and Freddie and remove the government's role in backstopping the housing market and those who advocate for the government to simply recapitalize and release the companies from government control.

"It will be something in the middle," he said.

Craig Phillips, the counselor to the U.S. Treasury secretary who managed the regulation report, said at the same conference that the ideas in the document are meant to boost economic growth. "This is not a plan to help banks," Mr. Phillips said.

Mr. Phillips said the Treasury was "very excited" about a Senate banking panel hearing July 22 in which regulators are expected to testify about using regulations to help the economy. "There's a lot to do with regulatory overlap, fragmentation and duplication. This is one of the biggest issues," Mr. Phillips said.

WSJ Pro: Treasury Plans More Reports on Financial Oversight

By Rachel Witkowkski

WASHINGTON The Treasury Department isn't done studying oversight of the financial industry.

It also will produce reports on other topics including unwinding failed firms, designating companies systemically important, nonbank financial services and markets oversight, said Craig Phillips, the counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who spearheaded the regulation report released Monday. Some of the reports could comes as early as this fall, he said.

The Treasury released a report on Monday detailing its review of Obama-era rules put in place for the banking industry after the financial crisis, recommending dozens of changes sought by the industry to ease its regulatory burdens.

Mr. Phillips said officials also plan to look at sectors of the financial services industry that are more lightly regulated than banking, such as private-equity firms, insurance companies and financial technology companies that offer banking services.

"A tremendous amount of business has left the regulated space" and "this is a very interesting area to explore, optimize this large growth for financial services and rationalize the regulatory approach," Mr. Phillips said at a financial services industry conference.

Mr. Phillips said the regulation report, ordered by President Donald Trump in a February executive action, is meant to help economic growth. "This is not a plan to help banks," he said. "There's a lot to do with regulatory overlap, fragmentation and duplication. This is one of the biggest issues," Mr. Phillips said.

The Treasury is also reviewing how nonbanks are designated a "systemically important financial institution" as well as a process created by the Dodd-Frank Act to unwind failing financial firms outside of traditional bankruptcy, called the Orderly Liquidation Authority. House Republicans passed legislation last week that would end both sets of regulations.

Treasury is expected to release several reports on its regulatory findings in the coming months.

Cohn Leads Search for Next Fed Chief

By Nick Timiraos and Kate Davidson

The White House is set to launch its search for the next Federal Reserve chief, according to a senior official, and it will be managed by Gary Cohn , the former Wall Street executive who some market strategists believe could be a candidate for the post himself.

Officials won't publicly outline any timetable for their decision or shortlist of candidates. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's term runs through January, and President Donald Trumpdidn't rule out her reappointment in an April interview.

Ms. Yellen's reappointment isn't an outcome many observers expect because of Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of her during the final weeks of last year's presidential campaign. But his willingness to consider her speaks to the amicable relationship they have forged since Mr. Trump took office, observers say.

Since taking office, the president and his advisers haven't publicly questioned the Fed's actions including its decision to raise short-term interest rates in March. The Fed has also signaled it is likely to raise rates again at its two-day meeting that concludes Wednesday.

An alternative to Ms. Yellen could be Mr. Cohn, who became Mr. Trump's top economic adviser after a 26-year career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc . Mr. Cohn has emerged as a key intermediary in the administration's relationship with the central bank.

When publicly asked if he is interested in the Fed job, Mr. Cohn and other White House officials have said he is focused on his current job. But former colleagues said he has cultivated an appreciation for the power of the Fed during his long career on Wall Street and for the institution's relative freedom during his current stint in Washington.

While Mr. Trump's 2016 criticisms of Ms. Yellen suggested the central bank would face a rough time with the new administration, the president and Ms. Yellen are off to a surprisingly smooth start.

Weeks after his inauguration, Mr. Trump held court with Ms. Yellen in the Oval Office. Seated behind the office's Resolute desk, he told her she was doing a good job, according to people familiar with the exchange. Ms. Yellen sat across from Mr. Trump in a chair next to Mr. Cohn, who arranged the meeting.

The Republican president told Ms. Yellen he considered her, like himself, a "low-interest-rate" person, those familiar with the exchange said. During a conversation that lasted about 15 minutes, they discussed how economic policy might help the millions of U.S. citizens who felt left behind during the postcrisis recovery.

Mr. Trump's April comments marked a reversal from last year, when he accused Ms. Yellen of keeping rates low to help Democrats.

Mr. Trump and his administration have, so far, opted to stay neutral in public on Fed decisions, a contrast to his administration's criticisms of other nonpartisan institutions such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Congressional Budget Office and the courts.

"The Fed will do what they need to do, and we respect the powers of the Fed," Mr. Cohn said in a March interview on Fox News, one of his rare public comments on the central bank.

Mr. Trump wants a fast-growing economy, and that means he won't want the Fed raising interest rates so aggressively that it thwarts any boom. Ms. Yellen, for her part, wants to preserve the independence of an institution that faces more political hostility than at any time in a generation.

On paper, the White House and the Fed appear headed for a collision. The president wants to raise the economy's annual growth rate to at least 3%, but Fed officials think demographic trends and slow productivity growth mean the economy can grow sustainably at around a 2% rate.

With the unemployment rate at 4.3%, the Fed would likely accelerate interest-rate increases if Mr. Trump's administration took steps to lift growth in a way that simply boosted short-term demand. This hasn't been a problem yet because Mr. Trump's administration hasn't managed to move its agenda through Congress.

 There was a lot of uncertainty about how this was going to play out. I would say,  So far, so good.' '

 Donald Kohn , ex-Fed vice chairman

Some observers caution against reading much into Mr. Trump's silence on Fed policy because the central bank hasn't done anything to upset the administration.

Stocks have moved to record highs while federal borrowing costs have fallen. A likely Fed move Wednesday would lift its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%, a very low level historically.

But if the Fed takes action Mr. Trump perceives to be threatening, he could become more vocal, said Peter Conti-Brown, a financial historian at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School .

"The minute that  Morning Joe' has a report about a Fed action that could harm Donald Trump, set an egg timer and see how long before he tweets," Mr. Conti-Brown said.

Though Mr. Trump and Ms. Yellen were born two months apart in neighboring boroughs of New York City, they couldn't be more different.

One, from Queens, is the brash celebrity developer who relies heavily on his gut, professes little interest in academic expertise and brings a deep skepticism of established institutions to Washington.

The other, from Brooklyn, is a risk-averse economist who prepares meticulously for speeches and meetings, has vacationed with suitcases full of books and has spent her career in the halls of academia and central banking.

Their placid relationship reflects Mr. Cohn's leading role. Ms. Yellen meets regularly with Mr. Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , who also spent much of his career at Goldman Sachs .

Mr. Cohn has emphasized to colleagues the importance to markets of not publicly second-guessing monetary-policy decisions, following a rule established in the Democratic administration of former President Bill Clinton by another Goldman-executive-turned-presidential-counselor, Robert Rubin , who later became Treasury secretary.

Mr. Cohn takes pride in convincing Mr. Trump of the economic benefits of respecting the Fed's independence, including not firing off verbal or Twitter attacks on the central bank, according to people who have discussed the issue with him.

Mr. Trump can put his stamp on the institution by filling three open seats on the Fed's seven-member board of governors.

The Fed chairman and vice chairman jobs come open next year. Many Wall Street and Washington observers expect Mr. Trump to select his own candidate for the top job, possibly Mr. Cohn.

Mr. Cohn knows several central-banking officials from their time at Goldman Sachs , including New York Fed President William Dudley, the bank's former chief economist, who met with Mr. Cohn in the early weeks of the administration.

All of this comes at a time when the Fed is facing the most intense political scrutiny in decades. The financial crisis and its aftermath prompted lawmakers to debate monetary policy in a way not seen since Paul Volcker was Fed chairman in the 1980s.

The harshest criticism has come from congressional Republicans. Many resented the Fed's extraordinary measures to boost economic growth long after the 2007-09 recession, with ultralow borrowing costs making former President Barack Obama's deficits smaller than forecast.

Republican lawmakers also said the Fed worked too closely with Mr. Obama's Democratic administration and Democrats in Congress to overhaul postcrisis regulation through the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

Some vitriol aimed at the Fed may ease once Mr. Trump makes his appointments, senior White House officials said.

Fed officials have defended the regulations. "We've accomplished a lot. We have a much safer system," Ms. Yellen told graduate students in Ann Arbor, Mich., in April.

Some White House officials believe Dodd-Frank gave the Fed too much power. They are preparing to nominate a Fed vice chairman for bank supervision, Randal Quarles, who served in the Treasury Department of former GOP President George W. Bush, who could favor a lighter touch.

White House officials also have expressed reservations internally over the Fed's postcrisis purchases of mortgage-backed securities one of the extraordinary measures it took to stimulate growth. Some critics said the purchases amounted to fiscal policy by determining the allocation of credit in the economy. Mr. Trump's administration is considering nominating Marvin Goodfriend, a respected monetary economist who has articulated those reservations, to the Fed board.

These concerns haven't been aired publicly by the administration, in contrast with Mr. Trump's comments during last year's election, when he said Ms. Yellen should be "ashamed of herself" for keeping rates low.

"There was a lot of uncertainty about how this was going to play out," said Donald Kohn , a former Fed vice chairman who met with Mr. Cohn in February. "I would say,  So far, so good.'"

Beijing Gives Banks the Go-Ahead for Yet Another Lending Binge

By Anjani Trivedi

China's banking regulator should know better by now: loosen the reins and debt soon piles up.

While Beijing is carrying out a high-profile campaign to reduce leverage in its financial markets with one hand, with the other it is encouraging more potentially reckless borrowing. This week, the regulator put pressure on the country's big banks to lend more to small companies and farmers, while the government announced tax breaks for financial institutions that lend to rural households. That follows recent guidance that banks should set up "inclusive finance" units.

If the goal of lending to poorer customers sounds noble, the concern is that the execution will only worsen Chinese banks' existing problems, namely high levels of bad loans and swaths of mispriced credit. Bank lending to small companies is already growing pretty fast, with non-trivial sums involved: It jumped 17% in the year through March to 27.8 trillion yuan ($4.084 trillion). That compares favorably with the 7% rise in loans to large- and medium-size companies over the same period.

But lending standards are set to get even looser. Banks have been told they should tolerate higher nonperforming loan ratios for small companies and agriculture-related lending, meaning they need to worry less about credit quality. The regulator also asked banks to keep interest rates on such loans at an "appropriate" level effectively allowing banks to ignore the proper pricing of risk.

This all flies in the face of efforts to cull bad credit from the economy. Chinese banks are already given plenty of leeway to classify loans how they like: The new measures may only encourage them to avoid writing off bad debt. It isn't clear, either, how allowing small businesses and farmers to borrow even more will help China Inc. cure its addiction to debt-fueled growth.

If banks were free to price loans in line with credit risk, more lending to poorer parts of the economy might improve their net interest margins. Chinese banks typically charge small- and medium-size enterprises around 8%-12% on loans, well above the benchmark rate. But if banks prove more lenient on lending rates, in line with the regulator's demands, even that benefit will be mixed.

China's big banks have rallied an average 10% so far this year and are trading at 0.7 times to 0.8 times their book value. With a stream of risky borrowers headed the banks' way, investors may be giving them too much credit.

Elizabeth Warren Calls for Targeted Deregulation of Community Banks

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTON Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Tuesday that Senate Democrats are willing to pursue targeted changes for regulations affecting community banks and credit unions as Congress moves to review postcrisis financial regulations.

But the Massachusetts Democrat, Congress's leading critic of Wall Street, said she would stand fast against changing laws to roll back consumer protection or to help big banks.

Ms. Warren's remarks at The Wall Street Journal's CFO Network Annual Meeting came a day after the Trump administration unveiled a road map for easing regulatory requirements for all types of financial institutions.

"There are places where we should do targeted changes in laws and regulations to make sure community banks don't have to endure regulations &for problems like disrupting the entire U.S. economy when they really don't pose that kind of threat," Ms. Warren said.

While House Republicans and the Trump administration have unveiled plans to unwind various postcrisis financial regulations, many of them require legislative actions that are only possible with the support of at least some Senate Democrats. That gives leverage to senators like Ms. Warren who lead debates on regulating banks.

"We can work together when you are not changing the law," she said.

The Trump administration's report released Monday made recommendations that largely reflect financial industry's wish lists, from easing capital and liquidity requirements to reducing regulatory exams such as "stress tests."

A section of the report was devoted to overhauling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , the independent agency Ms. Warren helped to create. The Treasury Department report described the CFPB as an "unaccountable" agency that has abused its authority and recommended steps to restrict its power.

Ms. Warren said that polls have shown some 80% of the general public and 55% of the supporters of President Donald Trump wanted the agency left in the current state, if not made more powerful.

Ms. Warren was particularly critical of House Republicans for passing a bill last week that she said included measures to roll back rules for large financial institutions to the point where they are weaker than regulations that existed before 2008.

"I've got to say to a crowd like this everyone should be saying: No. No. No. No. No," she said. "This ought to be one of the things that should unite all of us in saying we are not in favor of deregulation that puts the American taxpayer, and more importantly, the American economy, at greater risk."

Government to Back Bank's Loans to Black Business Owners

By Sharon Nunn

WASHINGTON The Small Business Administration said Wednesday it is teaming up with New Orleans-based Liberty Bank to guarantee loans for black business owners, the first such partnership between the agency and a black-owned bank.

The government agency and the U.S. Black Chambers plan to back as much as 50% of some business loans provided by Liberty Bank in an attempt to remedy one of the most widely voiced complaints from black business owners that they can't get adequate capital for their enterprises when they need it.

Just 47% of black business owners got the full amount of funding requested from banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, compared with 76% of whites, according to a survey of entrepreneurs conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014, the latest data available.

Exacerbating the credit gap, many black business owners forgo seeking capital in the first place. The fear of being rejected was the top reason cited by black business owners who chose not to seek capital, with 59% saying they didn't think they would be approved.

In general, lending backed by the Small Business Administration helps shield banks from loans that are considered riskier, typically labeled as such if the bank lacks adequate capital or if the business owner has a lower credit score or business revenues. The backstop gives banks the ability to lend to small-business owners who typically wouldn't qualify for traditional business loans.

The formula for deciding whether a loan is risky includes three factors that continue to plague black-owned banks and businesses. Black-owned banks have significantly less capital on hand than other banks, and black business owners statistically have lower credit scores and revenue than their white counterparts.

"Most lenders have a box, and the access to it is so high that many businesses are unable to reach it and are left out, specifically African-American businesses," said Ann Duplessis, vice president of Liberty Bank. "This allows us to be flexible. We [can] mitigate that disadvantage."

IBM Launches Watson for Financial Regulation

By Gabriel T. Rubin

International Business Machines Corp . on Wednesday formally launched a Watson product for financial regulation, rolling out artificial-intelligence tools to help financial institutions comply with rules and detect possible financial crimes.

The technology giant's entry into the regulatory-compliance space, where a number of firms already use AI to manage immense amounts of data, comes after it purchased financial consultancy Promontory Financial Group in September.

IBM is looking to build on the Jeopardy-winning Watson's presence in the health-care sector, where the company has used partnerships with and acquisitions of health-care providers to improve care, particularly for cancer patients.

"We were very convinced after our experience in health care that it wasn't a technology-alone solution," Alistair Rennie, general manager of Watson Financial Services, said in an interview. "You need to partner with experts who know the process, who have the expertise."

Watson's move comes as financial firms continue to shift to AI and so-called "machine learning" to manage data that must be analyzed for regulatory compliance and crime prevention.

IBM rolled out three Watson tools on Wednesday. One analyzes regulatory text to identify obligations that companies might face and help assess whether the company's compliance programs are sufficient to comply with the rules. Another assists banks in detecting suspicious customers or transactions, and a third seeks to make "big data" at financial firms more accessible to decision makers when developing new business strategies.

Other technology firms already provide similar services. Digital Reasoning, an artificial-intelligence firm based outside Nashville, Tenn., has contracts with Nasdaq for monitoring global trading and works with Goldman Sachs Group Inc . to prevent financial misconduct by traders. The firm counts Goldman Sachs , Credit Suisse and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . as investors, among others.

The role of these companies, said Digital Reasoning founder and president Tim Estes, is to take the huge amounts of unstructured data from their client firms and make it usable for compliance and surveillance purposes.

"All the data is there it's a bunch of crude oil in the ground. We're the refiners above ground," Mr. Estes said in an interview.

Unlike IBM , Digital Reasoning has less of a focus on anti-money-laundering compliance, at least for now, he added.

Mr. Rennie, of Watson Financial Services, said that clients would likely look to IBM to work on specific issues, and then over time move toward a "more holistic, end-to-end" use of Watson technology to deal with their compliance responsibilities.

Eugene Ludwig, the chief executive of Promontory and a former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency under President Bill Clinton, said the new technology would benefit regulators, too.

"Regulators should be quite cheered by this," he said in an interview, pointing to anti-money-laundering compliance as an area of where both firms and regulators would mutually benefit. "To the extent that the [suspicious activity reports] filed by institutions are more accurate and usable, that's a huge help for regulators doing their job."

To be sure, Watson and other machine-learning technologies have a long learning process as they encounter more data and unfamiliar information. Some previous Watson projects in the health sector have struggled to meet their ambitious goal of transforming cancer care.

Still, the upshot for these systems is promising, Mr. Ludwig said: "The neat thing about cognitive technologies like Watson is that they learn."

Q&A: What's Holding Back Fintech

Jonathan Larsen is the new chief innovation officer at Chinese insurance giant Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd . 601318 -2.60% The former global head of retail banking at Citigroup Inc ., Mr. Larsen now runs Ping An's $1 billion Hong Kong investment fund, which is on the hunt for deals in the financial-technology space.

Mr. Larsen spoke with Andrew Dowell of The Wall Street Journal to discuss where fintech is headed and what he thinks is holding it back.

Edited excerpts follow.

MR. DOWELL: Why are banks still so bad at technological innovation?

MR. LARSEN: There's an enormous amount of opportunity to overhaul banking and financial services generally. So why hasn't it happened yet?

I can tell you, it isn't an easy transition. First, clients are quite sticky in their preferences and their behavior, so while it may make sense to us to move everybody on to mobile instantly, there are plenty of people who are quite happy and comfortable with the way they're doing business. Second, most of these banks have layers and layers of technology. Simply wiping the floor and starting over is an option, but it's a very challenging, risky and costly option. And third, regulators put brakes on institutions everywhere. Cloud computing is a really good example. There are very few regulators in the world who [truly understand] cloud computing and have clear guidelines about what is and isn't acceptable.

MR. DOWELL: How would you assess fintech's prospects?

MR. LARSEN: This technology transformation is going to happen. But it's going to happen at different paces in different markets and in different areas of the business. Think of the functions that take place within financial-services institutions as being sort of decomposed or atomized, and then re-solved in a new way using technology.

And some of those things can scale to be business models. I think we've seen that clearly in mobile payments.

MR. DOWELL: Ping An also has a position in Chinese lender Lufax. Do you want to talk a little about what Ping An's interest is in fintech?

MR. LARSEN: In the last decade or so, Ping An has made a massive investment in technology. It has 20,000 technology developers and scale platforms that run on blockchain. We're doing advanced research into voice recognition and facial recognition for all kinds of different applications.

Alongside that, [founder, chairman and CEO] Peter Ma has been able to incubate and create new platforms repeatedly. Lufax is a good example. We're talking about a $19 billion company as of its last valuation round. GoodDoctor.com is another one 140 million registered users, consulting physicians via chat and image.

There are probably a dozen similar potential platforms that are at various stages of incubation within the group. And then there is a huge amount of effort around artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular.

Our vision is that our business will be a data business.

MR. DOWELL: What types of investments is the $1 billion Global Voyager Fund seeking?

MR. LARSEN: Our focus will be mostly strategic and our sweet spot is investments in the $10 million to $30 million range. That will naturally lead to bigger opportunities for companies that are in their rapid scaling phase. [We want to invest in] people we can learn from. We can access their capabilities through joint-venture agreements, distribution deals, technology deals, licensing. The cooperation can take many forms.

Europe's First Brexit Shot: It Wants Clearing Back From London

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine and Max Colchester

Europe fired its first broadside at the City of London since the Brexit vote, making a grab for the U.K.'s vast clearing market.

The European Union 's executive arm proposed plans Tuesday that could force clearinghouses that do a large of chunk of business in euros to move into the EU. In a draft law, the European Commission also said that large, or "systemic," clearinghouses operating outside the EU would be subject to tougher oversight including on-site inspections and access to financial accounts.

While Tuesday's proposal isn't the nuclear option the U.K. had feared an automatic relocation of clearinghouses that clear lots of euro-denominated contracts it is a bold signal that the EU is prepared to play tough as Brexit negotiations begin.

The proposed new supervisory powers give the EU more leverage to push clearing business into the bloc. It is the latest skirmish in an increasingly heated battle over thousands of jobs in the U.K.'s financial center, across banking, insurance and asset management.

"As we face the departure of the largest EU financial center, we need to make certain adjustments to our rules," said EU financial-services chief Valdis Dombrovskis.

A clearinghouse sits between the buyers and sellers of instruments such as commodities and derivatives, pledging to complete the deal even if one side reneges. This business deep inside the financial plumbing is one of London's crown jewels, attracting trillions of dollars of derivatives trades. The U.K.'s know-how in clearing and settling those trades has in turn acted as a magnet for capital and expertise.

In 2016 the U.K. cleared $1.18 trillion of interest-rate derivatives every day, making it the second-largest clearing location in the world after the U.S., according to the Bank for International Settlements .

Now that position, built up over the last 50 years, is under threat.

Britain currently clears more euro-denominated interest-rate derivatives than other EU countries combined about three-quarters of the EU total.

European authorities fear that after Brexit, the U.K. won't be answerable to EU courts or regulators, a problem if a major London clearinghouse topples over. The biggest clearer of euro-denominated credit-default swaps, LCH. Clearnet Group Ltd., for instance, is based in London and wouldn't fall under EU supervision after Brexit.

Under the proposed law, EU supervisors would tighten oversight and then decide whether to encourage big euro clearers to move into the trading bloc. If they don't comply, European banks that clear with them will get hit with an extra capital charge. This would choke off a chunk of their business.

EU officials said Tuesday's proposal won't affect its current deal with the U.S., which took nearly four years to reach and allows U.S. entities like CME Group Inc . and Intercontinental Exchange Inc . to do business with European banks.

The Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority will define what a "systemic" clearinghouse is, based on volumes and other criteria. The proposal would give clearinghouses 12 to 18 months to prepare to move their business.

The ECB has previously sought to limit the clearing of euro contracts outside of the eurozone, but it was rebuffed by the European Court of Justice in 2015. The ECB didn't appeal the decision in what was largely seen as a political compromise with the Bank of England .

Clearinghouses in London have argued that forcing them to move activities into the EU would push up the cost of clearing and potentially cause financial instability.

"In taking steps to shift power away from U.K. clearing houses, the EU could damage itself unnecessarily," said Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, which promotes London as a financial center.

The industry boomed when political leaders pushed clearing of over-the-counter derivatives onto clearinghouses in the wake of the financial turmoil triggered by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.

The clearing battle comes as the U.K.'s Brexit negotiations spin into disarray after last week's inconclusive general election in Britain. Talks between the two sides may not start next Monday as originally planned, Britain's Brexit minister said.

That has raised the possibility that Britain might change course and maintain closer ties with the EU, analysts say. But amid the political uncertainty, bank executives are sticking with plans to shift activities out of the U.K, according to people familiar with the matter.

Banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . and Goldman Sachs are among those hunting for office space in Europe to ensure they can keep serving clients there after Brexit. Several banks are working on the assumption that these European entities will be shifting trades through an EU clearinghouse.

Brazil Judge Sentences Ex-Rio Governor in Corruption Case

By Paul Kiernan

RIO DE JANEIRO Former Rio de Janeiro state Gov. Srgio Cabral was sentenced to 14 years in prison Tuesday for corruption and money laundering, becoming one of the most high-profile Brazilian politicians yet convicted in the sprawling Car Wash probe.

Judge Sergio Moro found Mr. Cabral guilty of receiving around 2.7 million Brazilian reais ($816,450) in bribes and laundering some of the proceeds. The money had been skimmed off an overpriced construction contract for a refinery built by state-owned oil company Petrleo Brasileiro SA , or Petrobras , on the outskirts of Rio.

Mr. Cabral's attorney said he plans to appeal but declined to specify on what grounds.

Once considered a likely presidential candidate, Mr. Cabral rode the commodity boom to political stardom during his 2007-14 term, as Rio experienced a fleeting renaissance that culminated in its winning bid for the 2016 Olympics.

With state coffers flush with cash from rising oil prices, Mr. Cabral attacked the city's notorious crime problem by implementing a community policing program in favelas, or slums, long controlled by drug gangs. He propped up employment by drastically expanding the state's payroll and spent billions of dollars on infrastructure projects, such as a new Metro line, whose costs, prosecutors say, have been inflated by corruption.

As a result, Rio state is now in the throes of an epic fiscal crisis, unable to pay the salaries or pensions. After falling in 2012 to the lowest level in decades, violence has come roaring back, with more than 5,000 murders last year and 920 killings by police officers, in a state home to some 16.6 million people.

"The failed situation of Rio de Janeiro state cannot be ignored, as the suffering of the population and civil servants, which despite being the result of many factors, also has its origins in the systematic graft by the ex-governor and his associates," Judge Moro wrote in his ruling.

Tuesday's case is only the first to be ruled upon against Mr. Cabral, the son of a well-known music critic who rose from modest origins in Rio de Janeiro's working-class north side.

In addition to Car Wash, Mr. Cabral is the target of parallel investigations into graft from Rio's state health-care system, infrastructure projects and public works ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.

Altogether, prosecutors allege the ex-governor diverted more than $100 million from public coffers, stashing the proceeds in offshore bank accounts and laundering much of the money by purchasing luxury goods such as diamonds.

In March, the Car Wash task force in Rio de Janeiro repatriated 250 million reais from foreign bank accounts allegedly controlled by Mr. Cabral's "criminal organization," prosecutors said. The money was handed over to the state government, which used it to pay the overdue salaries of 147,342 employees.

"That represents just part of the money that has been apprehended, with still more believed to be hidden," prosecutor Leonardo Cardoso de Freitas said at the time. "These numbers give an idea of how big the cost of corruption is in Brazil."

Pro Short: Ex-SEC Lawyer Liftik Moves to Quinn Emanuel

A former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who helped steer the agency's asset-management oversight during the Obama administration has moved to Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Michael Liftik joins the law firm as a partner in its Washington office focused on government and internal investigations, Quinn Emanuel says. Liftik, who was an SEC enforcement attorney earlier in his career, recently served as deputy chief of staff to former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White . Liftik served as White's staff liaison to the Financial Stability Oversight Council , an umbrella group of US financial regulators that monitors threats to the banking system and securities markets. The council's study of mutual funds holding less liquid assets foreshadowed rules passed by the SEC in October that required funds to hold a cushion of easy-to-sell assets.

LendingClub Looks To Restart Securitization Program

LendingClub (LC) is looking to sell $279.4M in bonds backed by unsecured personal loans the online lender made to consumers with less-than-stellar credit, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency . LC is looking to restart its program of securitizing its loans after an attempted 2016 bond deal was marred by data-integrity and disclosure issues, eventually leading to the resignation of its CEO. Kroll expects net losses on the loans backing the transaction--called Consumer Loan Underlying Bond Credit Trust 2017-NP1--to rise to as much as 22%, above the loss rate of prior securitizations of similar loans.

China Needs Reforms to Improve Pricing of Risks, Says Moody's

Moody's will unlikely change its sovereign rating on China again in the near future, but will reassess its credit implications if the government pushes reforms to improve pricing of risks, says Marie Diron, sovereign-debt analyst at the firm. "We think that there has been misallocation of capital in the past because risks aren't fully priced in some sectors," she says at a forum. In that case, even if the country's debt levels are higher, its ability to service its debt burden will be better, she adds. (liyan.qi@sj.com)

Wells Fargo Creates New Executive Role For Customer Needs

Wells Fargo (WFC) is creating a new customer segment executive role in its retail bank to be led by Andrew Rowe, who joins from Bank of America (BAC) where he was most recently a risk executive for consumer products and channels. "It's an area of opportunity for growth for us," Mary Mack , head of WFC's retail bank, said in a statement. "We know that among our current retail banking customers, there are many small business owners and affluent customers who could also have those unique needs met at Wells Fargo ," she said. Rowe's hiring follows questions from analysts and shareholders about how WFC will grow as it contends with fallout from its sales practice scandal paired with low rates and a sluggish economy.

CFOs Take on Higher Profiles in Activist Campaigns

Finance chiefs are increasingly in the hot seat in activist campaigns. The kinds of opportunities activists exploit are changing, and some practitioners are recalibrating their tactics in ways that bolster the CFO's profile. After the 2008-09 financial crisis, US companies built up cash on fears of more turmoil. That made them targets for activists who could score a bump in share price by pushing management to use cash for a dividend increase or share buyback. Those opportunities are scarce. Now activists are pushing for changes to a companies' processes and operations to boost returns. Operational changes are more arduous than buybacks for finance executives.

Geopolitical Risk a Top Concern for Individuals

Individual investors in the US say geopolitical risks ranks as the top threat to the investment climate in the coming year, according to a Wells Fargo /Gallup survey of 1,005 adults with total savings and investments of at least $10,000. Three-quarters of investors were "very or somewhat worried" about flare-ups in tensions around the world, while 69% said they were concerned about the political climate in the US and 49% said they were worried about the economy. "Given recent headlines, it's not surprising that investors are more concerned that geopolitical risks pose a greater threat to their investments than the economy. While the news may be concerning to investors, we advise clients not to let those anxieties impact their investment plan because that doesn't change the underlying positive fundamentals of the economy," said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

China's Bond Yields Throw Another Curve

In the latest sign of stress in a market pressured by Beijing's effort to clean up a debt-laden financial system and weak economic prospects, the yield on 10-year bonds fell to 3.55% on Tuesday, compared with the one-year paper's 3.61%, a situation unseen since June 2013, when an unprecedented cash crunch jolted Chinese markets and nearly brought the nation's financial system to its knees.

What Led to the Housing Boom and Bust

The 2008 housing boom and bust stemmed from overly optimistic expectations by financial institutions and banks, "http://www.nber.org/papers/w23502.pdf" by Manuel Adelino, Antoinette Schoar and Felipe Severino for the National Bureau of Economic Research . Their findings support the "expectations view" of the mortgage crisis that inflated expectations for house prices led banks to underestimate the potential for losses. A drop in interest rates in the early 2000s made home purchases more affordable and acted as a catalyst for changes in mortgage demand and house price growth, they say. Credit standards may have subsequently fallen, since lenders were willing to rely on collateral values when making lending decisions, they write. The researchers say that as their results confirm, "the distribution of [combined loan-to-value] levels (for purchase mortgages at origination) stayed stable across the boom period, which suggests that lenders almost mechanically lent against increasing house price values."

Industry Needs to Improve Efforts on Global Digital Payments

Payments professionals need collaborate on a global, real-time payment system, with full transparency and full cost disclosure, Anthony Brady, managing director and head of global product management for BNY Mellon Treasury Services, "https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/better-isnt-good-enough-in-improving-global-payments-system" Initiatives like the global payments innovation, developed by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , or Swift, are building momentum, and financial markets are moving closer to a 24/7 operating system, he says. Industry efforts need to go further, and "will naturally start with global financial institutions and the providers and technologies that support them," Mr. Brady writes. But those efforts may miss those living in poverty, who have been "severely underserved" but stand to benefit most from global payment transformation, he says.

Investor anxiety over the Federal Reserve's likely decision to soon begin reducing its $4.5 trillion in assets stems in part from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-calm-unnerves-investors-awaiting-fed-shift-on-4-5-trillion-balance-sheet-1497412860" this year and a belief by many analysts that the tranquility won't last.

Community-Bank Closure Stirs Ire

Did regulators shut down Guaranty Bank too soon?

People with ties to the Milwaukee-based community lender are calling on lawmakers and regulators to review the closure, saying they could have found private investors if they had been given a few more weeks. That, they say, would have avoided the $146.4 million price tag for taxpayers under a deposit-insurance program and prevented the loss of hundreds of jobs at its branches serving lower-income communities.

Deeming the bank "severely undercapitalized," the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on May 5 shut down Guaranty, a family-run bank with 119 branches in five states, most of them located inside grocery stores. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ., the bank's receiver, has sold it to First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co . at a steep discount. Roughly half of the bank's 1,000 employees have lost their jobs as 109 branches were shut down.

The bank's former executives say their plan to raise $100 million in fresh capital was moving along after they hired an investment banker in March. Two investors had made conditional commitments to invest a total of $55 million and were scheduled to visit the bank May 11 and 12.

"It's a travesty that they came in and shut us down weeks before recapitalizing," said Doug Levy, who stepped down as chief executive of the bank his family founded in 1923. "These investors were ready to invest," Mr. Levy said, describing them as well-regarded private-equity funds.

Bank failures have been rare in recent years. Guaranty, which had about $1 billion in assets, was among six banks to fail this year and the second largest after First NBC Bank"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-regulators-close-first-nbc-a-new-orleans-lender-1493420283" with $4.74 billion in assets.

Guaranty's troubles started during the financial crisis after its home-equity-loan portfolio declined sharply, and were compounded by a dispute with insurance companies over coverage for those loan losses.

The OCC said it decided to shut down Guaranty after "finding that the bank had experienced substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to unsafe or unsound practices." The bank failed to submit an acceptable capital-restoration plan, the regulator added.

Mr. Levy's team contests these points. The bank's capital, they say, had been stable at about $1 billion in recent years, while earnings were improving and nonperforming assets had diminished. The bank reported a $4 million loss for 2016, but that was due to a write-off related to settling the insurance dispute.

"Every month, the bank was making money. It was getting cleaner. What was the rush?" said Steve Hovde, the veteran Chicago investment banker hired by Guaranty. "I firmly believe this didn't need to be shut down," adding he had made weekly reports to the OCC on the progress of the capital-raising plan.

The regulators' decision to close Guaranty was discretionary, said David Baris, a Buckley Sandler LLP lawyer who represented the bank: Its capital ratio (the ratio of tangible equity to total assets) of 2.1% was above the 2% threshold under which banks are deemed "critically undercapitalized" and must be placed in receivership within 90 days.

Anita Gentle Newcomb, a banking consultant who isn't involved in the case, said the fact that potential investors made conditional commitments was no guarantee they would eventually put in capital.

The law allows a failed bank to mount a legal challenge to the FDIC's receivership but Guaranty didn't do so before the deadline.

The Levy family is now asking lawmakers to hold a hearing and calling for the OCC to conduct an internal investigation. "We are truly heartbroken about the injustice against our primarily minority employees, our low- to moderate-income customers and the FDIC fund," Mr. Levy said. An OCC spokesman declined to comment.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Fed Considers Easing Capital Rule Seen as Hampering Swaps Market

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-considers-easing-capital-rule-seen-as-hampering-swaps-market-1497432602" and some U.S. officials have long said discourages firms from participating in the derivatives market and makes the financial system less safe is on the regulatory chopping block.

At a private meeting in Washington this spring, senior bankers from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and other large U.S. financial firms pressed policy makers for changes to the rule. Their concerns were highlighted in a blueprint for a broad regulatory overhaul released by the Trump administration late Monday. The report from the Treasury Department recommends "significant adjustments" to the requirement in question, among other changes to capital rules. The Federal Reserve, amid pressure from banks and some U.S. officials, has already begun laying the groundwork to ease the rule, according to people familiar with the central bank's thinking.

Treasury Report Raises Expectations Era of Increased Oversight Is Over

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-report-raises-expectations-era-of-increased-oversight-is-over-1497386822" for bank oversight is raising industry expectations that a postcrisis era of increased regulation is over.

The report from the Treasury Department, released Monday, contains dozens of specific recommendations that can be executed by financial regulators. Bankers and analysts said they expect the proposal will be a catalyst for changes to the Wall Street rule book once President Donald Trump's financial nominees are confirmed.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-financial-blueprint-will-help-senators-craft-regulatory-rollback-lawmaker-says-1497376722" Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) on Tuesday said the Trump administration's broad blueprint for rolling back postcrisis rules will help senators craft a bipartisan financial overhaul.

Mr. Crapo said he is working with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the panel's top Democrat, on a bill that would ease requirements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law and other industry regulations.

WSJ Pro: Treasury Plans More Reports on Financial Oversight

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-department-plans-additional-reports-on-financial-oversight-1497384984" studying oversight of the financial industry.

It also will produce reports on other topics including unwinding failed firms, designating companies systemically important, nonbank financial services and markets oversight, said Craig Phillips, the counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who spearheaded the regulation report released Monday. Some of the reports could comes as early as this fall, he said.

Cohn Leads Search for Next Fed Chief

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/beneath-the-uneasy-peace-between-donald-trump-and-janet-yellen-1497346203" for the next Federal Reserve chief, according to a senior official, and it will be managed by Gary Cohn , the former Wall Street executive who some market strategists believe could be a candidate for the post himself.

Officials won't publicly outline any timetable for their decision or shortlist of candidates. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's term runs through January, and President Donald Trumpdidn't rule out her reappointment in an April interview. Ms. Yellen's reappointment isn't an outcome many observers expect because of Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of her during the final weeks of last year's presidential campaign. But his willingness to consider her speaks to the amicable relationship they have forged since Mr. Trump took office, observers say.

Beijing Gives Banks the Go-Ahead for Yet Another Lending Binge

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-gives-banks-the-go-ahead-for-yet-another-lending-binge-1497431723" should know better by now: loosen the reins and debt soon piles up.

While Beijing is carrying out a high-profile campaign to reduce leverage in its financial markets with one hand, with the other it is encouraging more potentially reckless borrowing. This week, the regulator put pressure on the country's big banks to lend more to small companies and farmers, while the government announced tax breaks for financial institutions that lend to rural households. That follows recent guidance that banks should set up "inclusive finance" units.

Elizabeth Warren Calls for Targeted Deregulation of Community Banks

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-calls-for-targeted-deregulation-of-community-banks-1497387239" that Senate Democrats are willing to pursue targeted changes for regulations affecting community banks and credit unions as Congress moves to review postcrisis financial regulations.

But the Massachusetts Democrat, Congress's leading critic of Wall Street, said she would stand fast against changing laws to roll back consumer protection or to help big banks.

Government to Back Bank's Loans to Black Business Owners

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-to-back-banks-loans-to-black-business-owners-1497432603" said Wednesday it is teaming up with New Orleans-based Liberty Bank to guarantee loans for black business owners, the first such partnership between the agency and a black-owned bank.

The government agency and the U.S. Black Chambers plan to back as much as 50% of some business loans provided by Liberty Bank in an attempt to remedy one of the most widely voiced complaints from black business owners that they can't get adequate capital for their enterprises when they need it.

IBM Launches Watson for Financial Regulation

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-launches-watson-for-financial-regulation-1497412862" on Wednesday formally launched a Watson product for financial regulation, rolling out artificial-intelligence tools to help financial institutions comply with rules and detect possible financial crimes.

The technology giant's entry into the regulatory-compliance space, where a number of firms already use AI to manage immense amounts of data, comes after it purchased financial consultancy Promontory Financial Group in September. IBM is looking to build on the Jeopardy-winning Watson's presence in the health-care sector.

Europe's First Brexit Shot: It Wants Clearing Back From London

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-first-brexit-shot-it-wants-clearing-back-from-london-1497353899" at the City of London since the Brexit vote, making a grab for the U.K.'s vast clearing market.

The European Union 's executive arm proposed plans Tuesday that could force clearinghouses that do a large of chunk of business in euros to move into the EU. In a draft law, the European Commission also said that large, or "systemic," clearinghouses operating outside the EU would be subject to tougher oversight including on-site inspections and access to financial accounts.

Brazil Judge Sentences Ex-Rio Governor in Corruption Case

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-judge-sentences-ex-rio-governor-to-14-years-in-corruption-case-1497380194" to 14 years in prison Tuesday for corruption and money laundering, becoming one of the most high-profile Brazilian politicians yet convicted in the sprawling Car Wash probe.

Judge Sergio Moro found Mr. Cabral guilty of receiving around 2.7 million Brazilian reais ($816,450) in bribes and laundering some of the proceeds. The money had been skimmed off an overpriced construction contract for a refinery built by state-owned oil company Petrleo Brasileiro SA , or Petrobras , on the outskirts of Rio.

Pro Short: Ex-SEC Lawyer Liftik Moves to Quinn Emanuel

A former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who helped steer the agency's asset-management oversight during the Obama administration has moved to Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Michael Liftik joins the law firm as a partner in its Washington office focused on government and internal investigations, Quinn Emanuel says. Liftik, who was an SEC enforcement attorney earlier in his career, recently served as deputy chief of staff to former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White . Liftik served as White's staff liaison to the Financial Stability Oversight Council , an umbrella group of US financial regulators that monitors threats to the banking system and securities markets. The council's study of mutual funds holding less liquid assets foreshadowed rules passed by the SEC in October that required funds to hold a cushion of easy-to-sell assets.

China's Bond Yields Throw Another Curve

In the latest sign of stress in a market pressured by Beijing's effort to clean up a debt-laden financial system and weak economic prospects, the yield on 10-year bonds fell to 3.55% on Tuesday, compared with the one-year paper's 3.61%, a situation unseen since June 2013, when an unprecedented cash crunch jolted Chinese markets and nearly brought the nation's financial system to its knees.

Hive AI Automates Image Recognition for Media Companies; The company's technology identifies actors, celebrities and logos in photos or videos

Machine learning and image recognition companies often require loads of data in order to fine tune their software to work well.

Castle Global decided to solve this problem by generating its own data. The startup built a number of consumer apps, including chat app Chatous, Q&A app Kiwi, local classifieds app Plaza, and Melon, an app for meeting and chatting with people.

These apps, with about 50 million users combined, provide the company with reams of data.

Castle Global then built an internal product to identify objects within images in its apps--for things like offensive content.

That technology became Hive AI, which the company has launched and sells to a variety of media companies. It hopes to expand to other verticals. Customers include GIF company Tenor, Yellw.co, a social app in Europe, and unnamed large media companies.

Castle Global, with 90 people, has raised $15 million, including a $13 million Series A led by 8VC with participation from Founders Fund and General Catalyst, as well as a $2 million seed led by General Catalyst.

Media companies can use Hive AI's API to identify celebrities, actors, musicians and politicians, and identify brands or other objects within images or videos.

Media companies can use Hive AI to identify when viewership increases or decreases during a television show, news show or television or video ad--based on which people are on screen. It's also used for user-generated content.

Automatically extracting this type of data from large stores of photos or videos is not easy, but Hive can do this quickly, said Kevin Guo, co-founder and chief executive at Castle Global.

"We go frame by frame and find this scene with this person who was on for 3 minutes and see what happened to viewership," Mr Guo said. "Typically it's hard to tag that manually. We can find every logo present. We dynamically do all this to find trends and patterns."

The company initially built the product by building its own form of Mechanical Turk with workers to identify objects, such as a dog or a cat. Then it uses that data with machine learning for Hive to identify objects on its own.

This technology for labeling data is just as critical as the large amount of data it has amassed to identify images, Mr. Guo said.

"It surprised us, to be candid, how powerful the technology has been and the accuracy and breadth of its use cases," said Alex Kolicich, a member of the investment team at 8VC.

Jonathan Larsen is the new chief innovation officer at Chinese insurance giant Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd. The former global head of retail banking at Citigroup Inc., Mr. Larsen now runs Ping An's $1 billion Hong Kong investment fund, which is on the hunt for deals in the financial-technology space.

Mr. Larsen spoke with Andrew Dowell of The Wall Street Journal to discuss where fintech is headed and what he thinks is holding it back.

Edited excerpts follow.

MR. DOWELL: Why are banks still so bad at technological innovation?

MR. LARSEN: There's an enormous amount of opportunity to overhaul banking and financial services generally. So why hasn't it happened yet?

I can tell you, it isn't an easy transition. First, clients are quite sticky in their preferences and their behavior, so while it may make sense to us to move everybody on to mobile instantly, there are plenty of people who are quite happy and comfortable with the way they're doing business. Second, most of these banks have layers and layers of technology. Simply wiping the floor and starting over is an option, but it's a very challenging, risky and costly option. And third, regulators put brakes on institutions everywhere. Cloud computing is a really good example. There are very few regulators in the world who [truly understand] cloud computing and have clear guidelines about what is and isn't acceptable.

MR. DOWELL: How would you assess fintech's prospects?

MR. LARSEN: This technology transformation is going to happen. But it's going to happen at different paces in different markets and in different areas of the business. Think of the functions that take place within financial-services institutions as being sort of decomposed or atomized, and then re-solved in a new way using technology.

And some of those things can scale to be business models. I think we've seen that clearly in mobile payments.

MR. DOWELL: Ping An also has a position in Chinese lender Lufax. Do you want to talk a little about what Ping An's interest is in fintech?

MR. LARSEN: In the last decade or so, Ping An has made a massive investment in technology. It has 20,000 technology developers and scale platforms that run on blockchain. We're doing advanced research into voice recognition and facial recognition for all kinds of different applications.

Alongside that, [founder, chairman and CEO] Peter Ma has been able to incubate and create new platforms repeatedly. Lufax is a good example. We're talking about a $19 billion company as of its last valuation round. GoodDoctor.com is another one -- 140 million registered users, consulting physicians via chat and image.

There are probably a dozen similar potential platforms that are at various stages of incubation within the group. And then there is a huge amount of effort around artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular.

Our vision is that our business will be a data business.

MR. DOWELL: What types of investments is the $1 billion Global Voyager Fund seeking?

MR. LARSEN: Our focus will be mostly strategic and our sweet spot is investments in the $10 million to $30 million range. That will naturally lead to bigger opportunities for companies that are in their rapid scaling phase. [We want to invest in] people we can learn from. We can access their capabilities through joint-venture agreements, distribution deals, technology deals, licensing. The cooperation can take many forms.

Immelt leaves a GE lacking in thrust; Long-expected move comes as earnings hopes fade, with no sign of benefits from digital strategy

The Electrical Products Group conference, one of the big events of the year for US industrial companies, is held at a club in Florida with four golf courses overlooking the Gulf of Mexico.

But Jeffrey Immelt 's final appearance as chief executive of General Electric was anything but relaxing.

In a question-and-answer session with analysts last month, he suggested it would be difficult for GE to reach its target of $2 of earnings per share in 2018, an objective set in 2015.

Asked about succession planning, Mr Immelt said: "We've got a deep bench. We've got a disciplined process. And I think we've got it well on track."

The board has been planning since 2013 for Mr Immelt to leave this summer, so disappointment about earnings may have had nothing to do with yesterday's announcement of his departure. By September he would have been in the job 16 years, against the 20-year tenure of his predecessor, Jack Welch.

But by stepping down now Mr Immelt is leaving under a cloud. A let-down on earnings looms after many years of share price underperformance, while an activist investor, Trian Fund Management, is applying pressure.

The appointment of John Flannery from the healthcare equipment division suggests a desire to avoid a big shake-up. "This is not any hint of a sea change in GE's management," says Brian Langenberg, an industrial strategist.

"Flannery has executed efficiently at healthcare for the past three years. But the onus is on him now to prove he can improve on the performance of the past 10 or 15 years."

Mr Immelt has shown that one of the hardest tasks in any field is succeeding a widely admired leader. In his day Mr Welch was the epitome of the superstar chief executive. He was lucky enough to lead GE through the US boom of the 1990s, and managed to convince many people that his company, with its jet engines and fridges, was part of the internet revolution.

He has genuinely improved GE's performance, but he also delivered growth by acquiring a motley assortment of businesses, many of them in financial services, that were seen as valuable simply because Mr Welch surrounded them with his aura.

Mr Immelt, a bluff former college football player with a ready laugh, became chief executive in 2001 after the dotcom bubble had burst. He was never going to be able to work the same magic on investors.

He set about reshaping the group portfolio, offloading businesses where GE had no competitive advantage, including a controlling stake in NBCUniversal, and domestic appliances.

The process culminated in 2015 with the most radical move of all, selling most of the financial services operations that had at times generated more than half of group profit. Assets of $260bn were sold, and much of the proceeds returned to shareholders.

After all these upheavals, however, the share price has stubbornly failed to respond. On Friday the stock closed 30 per cent below where it was on September 10 2001, the day Mr Immelt took over.

The blow dealt by the financial crisis is certainly part of the reason, but even since the depths of the downturn in February 2009, GE's shares have merely performed in line with those of its rivals United Technologies and Siemens. It has greatly underperformed Honeywell, which Mr Welch had tried to acquire.

Part of the problem has been Mr Immelt's willingness to overpay. GE spent about $11bn in 2010-11 on suppliers of equipment and services to the oil and gas industry, and was caught out when crude prices slumped in 2014.

Weak markets for oil and gas equipment are the principal reason the group's earnings are falling short of aspirations.

More recently Mr Immelt has been betting on GE's future as a "digital industrial" company, using sensors and advanced data analytics to monitor and improve the performance of its locomotives, wind turbines and other heavy equipment.

The company says the investment has not yet started to pay off, however, and it will be next year at the earliest before the benefits start to show up in earnings.

When Trian, a hedge fund, revealed its stake in October 2015, it positioned itself as a friendly but vigilant investor, supportive of the strategy of withdrawing from financial services, but keen to see improved performance. It suggested that earnings could be "at least" $2.20 per share in 2018.

With Mr Immelt gone, the company may give up on even the possibility of reaching $2 next year.

Analysts at Stifel forecast EPS of $1.90 for 2018, up from $1.60 for this year. Such an outcome would disappoint Trian and other shareholders who have likewise been hoping for better.

It is not clear how much more the new boss can achieve in the short term. Further disposals are possible, with the healthcare business that Mr Flannery has been running the most likely candidate. But analysts at JPMorgan note there could be "countless dis-synergies" in areas including pensions costs and taxes, which made a "quick fix" from a further break-up unlikely.

In time Mr Immelt's digital industrial strategy could pay off. The technologies he has been investing in have exciting potential.

When Jack Brennan, lead independent director, paid tribute he said the benefits of Mr Immelt's work would be felt "in the years to come".

Company veteran

'Finance guy' has limited operational experience

In selecting John Flannery as its chief executive, General Electric is turning to a company veteran.

He has spent 30 years at the US conglomerate, much of it at GE's financial services arm that outgoing chief executive Jeff Immelt has largely sold off .

Analysts said Mr Flannery, below, had a strong background in finance, but some noted he had limited experience of running GE's core divisions. When he was appointed head of GE's healthcare division in 2014, his past work on the company's mergers and acquisitions strategy fuelled speculation he had been charged with spinning off this unit.

Mr Flannery, however, said chief executive Jeff Immelt had given him just one instruction - improve organic growth. Yesterday, as GE announced Mr Flannery's appointment as Mr Immelt's successor, the company highlighted what it regarded as his strong record at the healthcare division.

The company said Mr Flannery, 55, had increased organic revenue at the unit by 5 per cent, and profit margins by one percentage point.

He first joined GE in 1987, working at GE Capital, the group's financial services arm, where he initially evaluated the risks associated with leveraged buyouts.

Scott Davis, analyst at Barclays, described Mr Flannery as a "finance guy, spending most of his time in GE Capital and also in roles at Corporate (notable head of M&A)". "His business operating experience is light for a GE CEO," he added.

Where the Ride-Sharing Industry in Asia Is Headed; Grab's Anthony Tan and nuTonomy's Doug Parker on driverless cars and other ride-sharing trends

Few battles in the tech world have been as bruising as the global ride-sharing wars. Who will come out on top?

In Southeast Asia, Singapore's GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. is slugging it out with Uber Technologies Inc. and others for dominance. Grab is now in 55 cities across the region. It launched a mobile-payments business known as GrabPay, recently bought an Indonesian e-commerce firm and is teaming up with Cambridge, Mass., startup nuTonomy Inc. to test self-driving cars in Singapore.

Grab co-founder Anthony Tan and Doug Parker, chief operating officer of nuTonomy, sat down with Jason Anders, The Wall Street Journal's global business editor, to discuss where the industry is headed in Asia.

Edited excerpts follow.

Perfect complement

MR. ANDERS: Ride sharing is booming, especially here in Asia. Anthony, Grab is focused on Southeast Asia, on letting folks hail private cars, taxis and motorbikes. But lately, you've been pushing pretty aggressively into mobile payments and other businesses. Why?

MR. TAN: The payments experience and the entire ride-sharing experience they are perfect complements, right? Today we do about 2.5 million rides a day. That's a lot of small transactions, ranging from $3 or $4 to $11. And you just sort of use GrabPay all the time. That frequency builds a habit. That habit then becomes something you're comfortable with. Our credit wallet, because of that, has grown about 80% month on month.

MR. ANDERS: You recently bought Kudo, a company in Indonesia that helps consumers who don't have internet connections, or even bank accounts, buy things by connecting them with local agents. What does that have to do with ride-hailing?

MR. TAN: Think about the digital divide in Asia 630 million people and a lot of them still don't have a bank account. They don't have smartphone penetration growing very fast. Kudo has about 400,000 agents across Southeast Asia. They are community guys and they come up to [others in the community] and they say, "Hey, if you want access to any of the e-commerce sites, I can get you access. Do you want to sign up as a Grab driver?" They have been signing up thousands of drivers on a daily basis.

MR. ANDERS: So Doug, nuTonomy is looking to make the case that not only do we not need to own cars, we actually don't need drivers. How do you convince ride-hailing companies that this is where they should be investing?

MR. PARKER: There has been a big step change in experience from the taxicab drive of the 1990s in New York City to the taxicab or Uber, Grab or Lyft drive of today. Autonomous [driving] is the next big step change. Your experience today is about 10 times better than the old taxicab ride, but there are things you probably don't like about it. Maybe I would like to sit in the front. I'd like to look out a front window, control the radio myself, control the temperature.

Autonomous is also going to be a safer ride. Something like 1.4 million people die every year in auto accidents. That's equivalent to 10 747s crashing every day. You would never let United get away with something like that, or Boeing. So once you have big companies taking on this role of driving the cars, we are going to end up with a safer, more comfortable, more efficient ride.

MR. ANDERS: You've worked with Grab on a test in Singapore. And you just announced you're going to collaborate with Lyft on a similar test in Boston, with real-world riders. What are you learning from these tests?

MR. PARKER: When you start putting people [in self-driving cars] who aren't roboticists or scientists, what they tell you is amazing. They have a lot of fear when they first get in, when the car starts driving itself. But after five minutes, they're playing with their phones. So there is this very fast adoption curve. But when the car goes to make a turn at a busy traffic light for the first time, it is a little scary.

It's kind of like people who are scared of flying. They aren't scared of the engineering, or that the plane won't fly. It's that they have no control. It's the same thing with autonomous cars. We have to get used to the fact that the car is going to make the right choice. Every time.

MR. ANDERS: How long will it be before I hail a car, and it picks me up without a driver in it?

MR. PARKER: We will still have a safety driver in the car for a number of years. There is a long process to convince regulators that this is safe. We have to find the right way to prove, through on-road tests, that this is entirely safe to take the driver out. Part of that is we're going to have remote safety officers who will monitor the cars and take over if there is a problem.

'Brothers in this'

MR. ANDERS: NuTonomy is working with different ride-hailing partners and auto makers. Many of these companies are locked in some pretty bitter blood feuds. How do you stay neutral?

MR. PARKER: Right now, we're trying to work with the good guys the Grabs and the Lyfts of the world that really want to drive a better experience for people. But also, at this point, Grab and Lyft aren't competing with each other. We actually have three partnerships with ride-hailing companies. We haven't announced the third one yet.

MR. ANDERS: You haven't announced the third one yet? Here we are. Let's have it.

MR. PARKER: I know. It's a great forum. But &

MR. ANDERS: Anthony, let's talk about competition. Uber gave up the fight with Didi [Chuxing Technology Co.] in China, and I know Didi is one of your investors. How are you going to avoid one of these really protracted, and wildly expensive, battles in Southeast Asia?

MR. TAN: It is very different in Southeast Asia. For one thing, Grab embraces the taxi world. In Singapore, Grab combines all the taxis, all the cars, with one touch of a button. And because we work so closely with the Singapore government, they have allowed us to be the first company with the ability to price dynamically for taxis, which is essentially a public utility vehicle. So with just Grab, you now get taxis that can have dynamic pricing at peak hours, and be cheaper than the meter during off-peak hours.

MR. ANDERS: If Didi wanted to acquire Grab outright, would you be open to it?

MR. TAN: Right now, we work hand in hand. They aren't types who say, "I want to be the boss, and that's it." They are much more like, "We're brothers in this. How do we make sure that we win this local style, respecting the local nuances."

They realize that Southeast Asia is a fragmented market. The countries are similar in many ways but still so different in terms of language, religion, etc. The ability to embrace that fragmentation but also see the common patterns is what Didi likes about us.

Where VC Money Is Going in China; Connie Chan and David Su discuss venture-capital trends, and what investors can learn about products that come out in China first

Venture capitalists are often among the first to recognize big trends in technology, and, if they're lucky, to back the companies best positioned to profit from those trends.

Wall Street Journal reporter Rolfe Winkler sat down with two successful VCs familiar with China's tech market, Connie Chan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and David Su, founding managing partner of Matrix Partners China, to find out where tech and the money are headed next. Edited excerpts follow.

MR. WINKLER: Where is venture capital flowing right now, in China and the U.S.?

MR. SU: Software services is a space we've been investing in over the last four years. Human capital is getting increasingly expensive in China. In the last four years we probably invested in about 30 companies in early to early growth stage. We're seeing tremendous growth in that space.

We're also looking at security. We're looking at enterprise-security, internet-security companies.

MS. CHAN: A couple of years ago my partner, Marc Andreessen, wrote an essay saying "software is eating the world." We think that same message holds true today. If you look now at all these traditional industries that were not software-led, they are doing whatever they can to build software teams, engineering teams. Look at the auto industry, for example.

We're seeing so much disruption happening. We're looking at a lot of areas where traditional industries are getting massively disrupted by software.

MR. WINKLER: Why doesn't Andreessen invest in China?

MS. CHAN: We have a strong operating-partner focus where we introduce networks of investors, engineers, product designers, marketing folks to all of our portfolio companies. And a large part of our network is centered in Silicon Valley. So our biggest value-add is most likely to a company that has its headquarters in and is based in the U.S. Most likely Silicon Valley. We have made investments outside of the country. But that's definitely not the norm.

However, we do spend a lot of time thinking about China. I come to China, I come to Hong Kong quite frequently because I think there's so much to learn. There are so many portfolio companies trying to figure out their China strategy.

MR. WINKLER: You're trying to find investment dollars for your portfolio companies?

MS. CHAN: It runs the gamut. I help companies meet with Chinese investors. I introduce them to Chinese media, I get them to the right person. I teach them about their Chinese counterparts, and that's probably the biggest value-add. Because a lot of consumer companies enterprise, too some of them aren't ready to think about entering the China market yet. However, there is so much to learn from just studying the similar type industry, a similar type company in China. And so this is something I regularly do.

MR. WINKLER: We've heard many times that China is full of technology copycats. That has reversed a little bit. Give us examples where you've had a portfolio company learn something product-wise, rolled something out because they saw it here first.

MS. CHAN: Earlier this year we made an investment in LimeBike [a bike-sharing company based in San Mateo, Calif.]. After talking to lots of my Chinese investor friends who had invested in Ofo and Mobike, the two leaders in bike sharing in China, I learned about the unit economics of this model, and I saw some very strong product market fit. In many ways, LimeBike is kind of a China copycat in the sense that they're taking that Mobike, Ofo model and bringing it to the states.

MR. WINKLER: David, you are an original investor in Ofo. I think you did the series A at about a $30 million valuation? And now they're at $2 billion, in what, 12 months?

MR. SU: It was just operating in several universities in Beijing. They were doing maybe 30,000 to 40,000 rides a day. As of last week we are doing, like, 20 million daily average rides. They have maybe seven million bikes in a hundred cities. So Ofo and Mobike now dominate the bike space. The growth has been phenomenal.

MR. WINKLER: Are these companies profitable?

MR. SU: Not yet. Ofo is going through this neck-to-neck competition with Mobike. Both are getting subsidies and waiving periods of usage. But eventually, when things settle down, I think the numbers will work.

MR. WINKLER: Payments is so strategic for some of these companies,

MR. SU: Yes. I think the next few years you will see lots and lots of innovation in payment on mobile that's going to drive a lot of consumption, change in behavior. I think all this is driving a lot of changes in consumers. And there's very minimal friction to using these services.

MS. CHAN: The way Chinese app companies think and the designers think is they want to grow deep, not just wide. Meaning, they want to control all aspects of your day from morning to night. It might just start with your transportation but it can branch beyond that.

MR. WINKLER: Why do they want to control all that?

MS. CHAN: Because you get more of the users' time. You can send them to different services, different apps, you control distribution, you can do different kinds of advertising. You get more data around that consumer. So anything that's a daily-use, high-frequency app is very valuable. And I think China, with the super app design model, recognizes that biking is one of those companies.

MR. WINKLER: What companies starting today will be the next Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent?

MR. SU: We were looking at software services and security. You know, this is a space we're very interested in. No. 2: all this micropayments. If you walk today in Shanghai and Beijing you are starting to see pop-up KTV [karaoke TV] booths with two or three seats. You scan your phone, you open the door, you go in and you can sing two songs, take pictures with your friends, capture the image and send it to whatever account you have. It's instant gratification. And that's all powered by mobile, powered by payment. Areas like that we are very interested in, where young consumers will be very interested.

MR. WINKLER: I want to ask about liquidity for investors. Is it a problem for venture capitalists and for their investors that some of your successful investments aren't going public, they aren't selling themselves, they aren't giving you cash to return to your limited partners?

MR. SU: I think in that aspect we have done pretty well over the years. I think even with Didi Chuxing [the Chinese ride-sharing giant], which is now a $50 billion company, the last two rounds we have managed to liquidate some of the ownership to the new investors, the hedge funds and the big private-equity players who are interested to buy some stake.

MR. WINKLER: How much did you sell?

MR. SU: A small portion of it. But enough to make our investors happy. And we're a very early investor in Momo, which is arguably the No. 2 social-network company in China. They just reported results a few days ago. They have maybe 80 million monthly active users. They are pioneering the live streaming digital space. They are doing, like, $1 billion revenue with $300 million net profit this year. So the company's $8 billion. We have managed to return money to our limited partners.

MR. WINKLER: You have a reputation for being one of the top VC firms. I think you're still waiting for your Snapchat, right? Benchmark just got Snapchat out the door, Sequoia did WhatsApp. Huge cash return. What's going to be your first liquid unicorn?

MS. CHAN: We've had a lot of really good exits already. They're not necessarily always in the consumer space, but we've had some in the consumer space as well.

MR. WINKLER: But something that large, that really justifies your reputation as one of the top five firms.

MS. CHAN: Okta had a great public offering this year. And we're very early stage investors in a lot of the big brands, like in Airbnb, or Pinterest, Okta, Instacart, so forth.

MR. WINKLER: You're early stage in Airbnb?

MS. CHAN: Early stage, yes.

MR. WINKLER: I thought you were at the $1 billion valuation there.

MS. CHAN: We're a series B investor.

MR. WINKLER: At the $1 billion valuation? Or 

MS. CHAN: We're the series B investor.

MR. WINKLER: OK. It's probably about 30 times your money so far, so that's still pretty good.

Neiman Marcus Abandons Effort to Sell Itself; Luxury store chain to focus on e-commerce, technology as pricing pressure facing high-end retailers continues

Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. isn't for sale.

After announcing plans earlier this year to explore a potential deal, Chief Executive Karen Katz said Tuesday the talks have ended and the luxury department store chain has the right strategy to go it alone.

"We believe that we can deliver better shareholder value by remaining an independent retailer," she said in an interview. "Any discussions about a partial or full sale of the company have been terminated."

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson's Bay Co. had approached the private-equity firms that own Neiman Marcus"https://www.wsj.com/articles/neiman-marcus-hires-advisers-to-explore-strategic-alternatives-1489499472". Last week, the Journal reported that the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/talks-to-combine-neiman-marcus-and-saks-have-stalled-1497035663" after the parties couldn't agree on a price, according to people familiar with the situation.

Ms. Katz said Neiman Marcus is continuing to invest in e-commerce, which accounts for a third of total sales. The company is building an analytics team to better target potential customers, and is tackling the issue of how to offer better service online. "We are committed to investing in new technology so we can remain a leader in the online luxury business," Ms. Katz said.

The upscale retailer nevertheless continues to face significant challenges, including nearly $5 billion in debt piled on through two leveraged buyouts, and softer demand for luxury goods.

On Tuesday, Neiman Marcus reported that sales for the three months through April 29 fell 4.9% to $1.11 billion.

The company had a net loss of $24.9 million compared with a quarterly profit of $3.8 million a year earlier.

In April, Neiman's owners Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board chose to issue new debt to cover interest payments through Oct. 14. Earlier in the year, they abandoned plans to take the company public.

Ms. Katz said the Dallas-based company has about $600 million in liquidity including cash and credit lines, and that sales trends have improved from the October-ended quarter, when revenue fell 7.4%, and the January period, when revenue dropped 6.1%.

She pointed to a pickup at stores in Texas and Florida as well as improved online traffic. Texas is benefiting from the company's new Fort Worth store, which is a prototype that offers more services and weaves technology into the shopping experience.

But she conceded that the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/neiman-marcus-finds-even-wealthy-shoppers-want-better-deals-1492362386" is here to stay.

"The promotional environment is part of the world we live in," Ms. Katz said, adding that the price transparency created by the internet has made it even more important for stores like Neiman Marcus to sell exclusive items that can't be found anywhere else.

What's Holding Back Fintech? Jonathan Larsen of Chinese insurance giant Ping An says it's partly customers, partly technology and partly regulators

Jonathan Larsen is the new chief innovation officer at Chinese insurance giant Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd. The former global head of retail banking at Citigroup Inc., Mr. Larsen now runs Ping An's $1 billion Hong Kong investment fund, which is on the hunt for deals in the financial-technology space.

Mr. Larsen spoke with Andrew Dowell of The Wall Street Journal to discuss where fintech is headed and what he thinks is holding it back.

Edited excerpts follow.

MR. DOWELL: Why are banks still so bad at technological innovation?

MR. LARSEN: There's an enormous amount of opportunity to overhaul banking and financial services generally. So why hasn't it happened yet?

I can tell you, it isn't an easy transition. First, clients are quite sticky in their preferences and their behavior, so while it may make sense to us to move everybody on to mobile instantly, there are plenty of people who are quite happy and comfortable with the way they're doing business. Second, most of these banks have layers and layers of technology. Simply wiping the floor and starting over is an option, but it's a very challenging, risky and costly option. And third, regulators put brakes on institutions everywhere. Cloud computing is a really good example. There are very few regulators in the world who [truly understand] cloud computing and have clear guidelines about what is and isn't acceptable.

MR. DOWELL: How would you assess fintech's prospects?

MR. LARSEN: This technology transformation is going to happen. But it's going to happen at different paces in different markets and in different areas of the business. Think of the functions that take place within financial-services institutions as being sort of decomposed or atomized, and then re-solved in a new way using technology.

And some of those things can scale to be business models. I think we've seen that clearly in mobile payments.

MR. DOWELL: Ping An also has a position in Chinese lender Lufax. Do you want to talk a little about what Ping An's interest is in fintech?

MR. LARSEN: In the last decade or so, Ping An has made a massive investment in technology. It has 20,000 technology developers and scale platforms that run on blockchain. We're doing advanced research into voice recognition and facial recognition for all kinds of different applications.

Alongside that, [founder, chairman and CEO] Peter Ma has been able to incubate and create new platforms repeatedly. Lufax is a good example. We're talking about a $19 billion company as of its last valuation round. GoodDoctor.com is another one 140 million registered users, consulting physicians via chat and image.

There are probably a dozen similar potential platforms that are at various stages of incubation within the group. And then there is a huge amount of effort around artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular.

Our vision is that our business will be a data business.

MR. DOWELL: What types of investments is the $1 billion Global Voyager Fund seeking?

MR. LARSEN: Our focus will be mostly strategic and our sweet spot is investments in the $10 million to $30 million range. That will naturally lead to bigger opportunities for companies that are in their rapid scaling phase. [We want to invest in] people we can learn from. We can access their capabilities through joint-venture agreements, distribution deals, technology deals, licensing. The cooperation can take many forms.

Navigation and visual technology are a key part of autonomous vehicle makers' road to a successful debut.

One startup, AEye Inc., has raised $16 million in Series A financing led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and another unnamed investor. Also participating were Airbus Ventures, Intel Capital and Tyche Partners.

AEye aims to differentiate from many competitors by providing Lidar along with computer vision technology that can scan a scene and quickly identify objects, said Luis Dussan, chief executive of AEye.

Most competitors can capture loads of data but are unable to quickly process and analyze that data in real time, he said.

"We're not just Lidar," Mr. Dussan said. "We're a unique combination of both. The idea that you can separate data gathering from processing that's where the key bottleneck of this is in our industry."

This technology makes it easier to identify "corner cases" that are typically difficult for autonomous vehicles to identify on the fly, Mr. Dussan said.

The company hopes to begin releasing this technology later in 2017 and in early 2018, Mr. Dussan said.

Startups working on Lidar or related technology include Luminar, which has raised $36 million from Canvas Ventures, Peter Thiel and others; Blackmore Sensors & Analytics; Quanergy Systems Inc., which has raised $134 million from Delphi Automotive, Samsung Ventures and others; and DeepScale Inc., which is backed by Bessemer Venture Partners and Greylock, according to PitchBook Data Inc.

Founder of Indonesia's Go-Jek: We're Beating Uber, Grab

HONG KONG GoJek is beating its international rivals in the race for users at home in Indonesia, according to Nadiem Makarim, co-founder of the fast-growing motorcycle-hailing startup.

"In terms of competition, we're clearly number one across verticals," said Mr. Makarim, speaking Friday at The Wall Street Journal's D.Live Asia conference in Hong Kong.

Go-Jek, which is backed by KKR & Co., Warburg Pincus LLC and others, is locked in a battle with Uber Technologies Inc. and Singapore-based Grab for Indonesia's more than 250 million consumers.

The company launched its app in 2015 and is named after the motorcycle taxis, or ojeks, that customers can summon on its platform. It has since expanded to include food and package deliveries, on-demand beauty, cleaning services and more.

Mr. Makarim said his startup has 10 million weekly active users, roughly 40 million app downloads, 50% of the country's transportation business and 95% of Indonesia's food-delivery market.

A Go-Jek spokesman said Mr. Makarim was citing third party data when referencing app downloads, but declined to reveal the third party's identity. According to mobile-app analytics firm App Annie, no ride-hailing company in Indonesia had more than 20.1 million app downloads through April.

"There are huge hidden costs of trying to do business in multiple countries at the same time," he said, when asked about competition. He said regulation, financing and staffing are among the biggest challenges. "This is what people don't talk about very much."

That said, he did concede that Go-Jek itself thinks "all the time" about expansion beyond Indonesia's shores. He declined to comment on reports that Go-Jek was recently in talks or had raised new funds from investors.

William Tanuwijaya, founder of PT Tokopedia, an Indonesian online marketplace that has received funding from the likes of Sequoia Capital and SoftBank, concurred that local talent and knowledge of the local market are key.

"It's our responsibility" to move the 1% of retail now going to online sales to 10% in next four our five years, he said.

Tokopedia has a run-rate of $1.4 billion in GMV gross merchandise volume, the amount of business transacted which is about 16 times higher than in 2014, Mr. Tanuwijaya said.

He declined to comment on reports that the company had been in talks about an investment from Chinese e-commerce company JD.com.

This story has been updated to include information on app downloads in Indonesia from mobile-app analytics firm App Annie.

LSE lifts guidance for earnings margin growth

The London Stock Exchange Group has raised its earnings margin growth forecasts for coming years to further underline its reorientation from equity trading to high-value market data and clearing.

The exchange said it expected group earnings margin growth, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, to be around 55 per cent by 2019, up from 46.5 per cent last year and ahead of an RBC Capital Markets forecast of 52.2 per cent. The exchange released the information before an investor event on Monday afternoon.

The new figures and presentation came only two weeks after the LSE snapped up Citigroup s global bond analytics business for $685m in the first significant deal since the collapse of the exchange s proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Brse. In the last seven years under chief executive Xavier Rolet, full-year income has grown from 671m to 1.6bn, driven by data and analytics, exchange-traded funds and fixed income indexes.

The LSE also forecast double-digit revenue growth in over-the-counter clearing from 2017-2019, as more off-exchange deals are processed through its centralised clearing house LCH.

It also targeted raising Ebitda margin growth at LCH from 35.6 per cent last year to  approaching 50 per cent  by 2019. Shares in the group came off lows but were trading down 34.09.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Slow adoption of technology hurts asset managers; INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Risk of losing market share to digitally savvy disrupters

Money managers have been criticised for being too slow to adopt technology, putting them at risk of losing market share to digitally savvy businesses seeking to disrupt the investment industry.

According to a poll of 458 asset and wealth managers, shared exclusively with FTfm, only 27 per cent of wealth managers offer robo-advisers , and only 31 per cent use big data.

Asset managers have also been slow to embrace blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. It is used by just 6 per cent of respondents.

The asset management industry's need to modernise comes as it is grappling with pressures ranging from tougher regulation to stronger competition. Passive investment vehicles such as index-trackers and exchange traded funds, which allow investors to invest more cheaply, have grown at record-breaking levels, while customers increasingly expect slick online services.

Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the consultancy that conducted the poll, said investment companies that failed to modernise risked losing business to more digitally clued-up competitors from other industries.

"There is no doubt that mega-indexers and large wealth managers will continue to attract the lion's share of the new money in motion. Some are developing proprietary robo-platforms. Others are forming alliances with fledgling robo-advisers.

"Their competitors will need to respond in order to survive, at a time when the internet giants are beginning to show an interest in money management."

Google has previously commissioned research on how it could enter the asset management industry while Facebook recently received regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland allowing it to operate a payments service.

Almost three-quarters of asset and wealth managers said cost pressures would accelerate digitisation. Fifty-four per cent said differences between themselves and competitors in the fees they charge would prompt them to embrace technology more quickly.

Forty-eight per cent think the rise of passive products will spur them to embrace digital innovation, and the same number think increasing competition from fintech start-ups and internet companies will be a factor.

The slow rate of change is often attributed to the difficulty of grafting new technology on to existing IT systems .

"The social media and website piece is much easier to do," said Tom Brown, global head of investment management at KPMG, the professional services firm. "It is much more difficult to get into digital solutions."

Millennials will soon comprise the largest part of the workforce. They are known for expecting slick online services, and 41 per cent of managers think the demographic will be an important factor in shaping the industry.

U.S. Probe Sheds Light on Charities' Role in Boosting Drug Sales; Drugmaker donations to charities assisting prostate-cancer patients have dropped in wake of federal investigation, leading drug sales to fall

U.S. sales of blockbuster prostate-cancer drugs have dropped sharply since the start of a federal investigation into charities that help patients pay for these drugs, as the manufacturers have reduced donations to the charities and instead given away the medicines for free.

Drugmakers donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to charities that help U.S. patients cover out-of-pocket costs for drugs. In turn, the drugmakers rely on the charities to effectively boost the sales of those drugs. The assistance ensures patients fill their prescriptions, and insurance pays the rest of the tab.

Every $1 million donated to charities can lead to up to $21 million in sales for drug companies, according to Citi Research. Because very few companies make prostate-cancer drugs, they tend to donate proportionally more to these charities than manufacturers of other treatments do.

Federal prosecutors in late 2015 started to investigate charities that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, and at least six companies including the top two prostate-cancer drugmakers, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc. have received federal subpoenas seeking information about their dealings with the charities, according to securities filings.

It is unclear what the prosecutors are looking into, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, which securities filings said sent the subpoenas, declined to comment.

Donations to funds providing prostate-cancer drug assistance have fallen off since the investigation began, according to industry officials, analysts and charities.

With the foundations less able to help patients, the drug companies decided to give away more of the drugs for free. Sales of the two top-selling prostate-cancer drugs, J&J's Zytiga and Pfizer's Xtandi dropped 14% and 11% respectively in the first quarter from a year earlier.

The companies "got scared and stopped funding the cancer-assistance programs," said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Ronny Gal. "So instead, they gave the drug for free. When you give patients [a drug] for free, it comes off your sales number."

The sales drop offers a window into a Byzantine arrangement that has drawn criticism for increasing health-care costs by keeping patients on ever-costlier medicines.

Patient-assistance charities help patients skirt some of the hurdles that insurers use to control spending: copays, coinsurance and high deductibles. Faced with the hurdles, patients who can't afford their share may seek a cheaper alternative, or not get their prescription filled at all. But once a foundation covers the patient's share, the prescription gets filled and the drug's manufacturer gets paid for the much larger balance of the cost by the patient's health plan.

Zytiga lists for $9,400 a month and Xtandi for $9,900, according to wholesale-acquisition-cost data from Truven Health Analytics. Medicare drug plans vary widely, but out-of-pocket costs for cancer drugs like Zytiga can surpass $7,000 a year, according to a 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.

For commercially insured patients, drug companies run their own foundations that assist low-income patients. But for Medicare patients, certain kinds of assistance from company-controlled foundations could run afoul of anti-kickback law that bars financial inducements in government-run programs.

Around the time that Medicare's drug benefit, known as Part D, went into effect in 2006, many independent charities began to spring up. They include the Patient Access Network Foundation, which is among the leading providers of charitable financial assistance to prostate-cancer patients.

To avoid crossing anti-kickback rules, the charities aren't supposed to use their aid to steer patients to any particular company's drug.

The eight biggest charities got more than $1.1 billion in donations mostly from drug companies in 2014 the latest available data to provide financial assistance to Medicare patients, according to Bernstein Research.

Starting in late 2015, companies including J&J, Pfizer, Biogen Inc., Celgene Corp., Gilead Sciences and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. received subpoenas or other requests for information about their relationships with these foundations, according to securities filings. Biogen, Celgene and Gilead declined to comment. Valeant said it is cooperating.

A J&J spokesman said the company donated more than $47 million to various independent charities last year to help patients get treatment "regardless of the medicine prescribed by the physician" and J&J checks to make sure the foundations comply with all laws and regulations. J&J has said federal prosecutors from Massachusetts asked for records "pertaining to payments to any" charities that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients.

Pfizer has said prosecutors asked for materials regarding the Patient Access Network Foundation and other charities.

The PAN Foundation wouldn't say whether it has also received subpoenas.

"PAN has really always prided itself as being a trustworthy and compliant organization. We put a premium on operating within guidelines," PAN Foundation CEO Daniel Klein said.

Pfizer CEO Ian Read said during a recent earnings conference call that government scrutiny of the charities has had a temporary "chilling effect" on the availability of the assistance. He said he expects the matter to be resolved this year, and Pfizer will keep making donations to the foundations to "help ensure that patients can afford medically necessary drugs."

Among the patients who wound up getting free drugs from a manufacturer because a charity wasn't accepting applications was John Kleck.

Mr. Kleck, 75 years old, a retired elementary-school teacher living in Pittsburgh, was prescribed Zytiga in late March. He couldn't afford the $2,900 he owed out of pocket for the first month of the prescription, said Bethany Lyon, the social worker at the UPMC CancerCenter who helped him secure assistance. Ms. Lyon said she checked with the PAN Foundation and other charities and couldn't find one making grants, so she sought J&J's help.

Mr. Kleck met J&J's eligibility requirements, and the company is providing the drug free for the rest of the year.

Mr. Klein, the CEO of PAN, said the charity received $582 million in drug-company donations last year. Health-department rules bar the charity from saying which companies made the donations, he said.

Last year, the PAN Foundation gave out nearly 10,000 grants to prostate-cancer patients with incomes less than five times the federal poverty level, most of them insured by Medicare, according to Mr. Klein.

But Mr. Klein said the foundation didn't get enough donations to its prostate-cancer fund to meet demand and therefore didn't take applications during the second half of last year. After a donation early this year, the fund reopened in March until running out of money a week later, after helping 1,500 patients.

The Patient Advocate Foundation, another leading prostate-cancer charity, said it also was closed earlier this year but reopened in recent weeks. A third charity, Good Days, didn't respond to requests for comment.

CrowdFlower Inc. is working behind the scenes with companies racing to build self-driving cars and intelligent assistants.

The company said it raised $20 million in fresh funding to use crowdsourcing to find people to help companies prepare data for machine learning algorithms.

More than one million contributors work for the company's platform, helping corporations categorize and collect data, annotate images and transcribe audio files.

Industry Ventures led the round with new investor Salesforce Ventures. Canvas Ventures, Microsoft Ventures and Trinity Ventures also participated in the round.

As interest in artificial intelligence explodes, CrowdFlower Chief Executive Robin Bordoli said companies face a "bottleneck." Machine learning models don't work without comprehensive sets of training data. But many companies do not have access to structured data sets, creating tedious work for their highly paid data scientists.

With customers like eBay, Etsy, Toyota, American Express and Twitter, CrowdFlower is helping companies across industries structure their data for machine learning models. The company has handled a wide variety of data, ranging from medical images to consumer packaged goods.

The platform allows customers to continue to own their data, and CrowdFlower does not have to store the data on its own servers if that is a concern. For particularly sensitive data, CrowdFlower can require the contractors sorting the data to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

"It's the customer's data," Mr. Bordoli said. "We just hand high-quality data back."

In addition to preparing the data to train the models, the company also provides what it calls "human-in-the-loop" workflows. If an algorithm is confident in a result, automation takes over the process. But when it reports a low rate of certainty, a CrowdFlower contributor steps in and checks the machine's work.

As CrowdFlower raises fresh funding, it faces competition from two newer companies, MightyAI and Scale. But Mr. Bordoli said the company's greater competitive threat is companies trying to do this data categorization themselves.

Gartner Research Vice President Svetlana Sicular said competition is not the greatest challenge for CrowdFlower. For a time it seemed the company had entered the market too early, she said. Many companies are not aware they can use crowdsourcing to improve the quality of their data, and she said many are concerned about privacy.

"CrowdFlower is pretty well-known among those who are leaders [in machine learning], but it is virtually unknown to mainstream enterprises," she said.

The company plans to use its funding to invest in marketing, sales, partnerships and distribution.

Tech sector rolls into banking heartland with customer loan offers; Financial services: Small business

Amazon's push into lending shows how the landscape has been reshaped since the crisis

Stephan Aarstol had a cool product (paddle boards) and a cool equity investor (Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks).

Yet the San Diego entrepreneur, fresh from a 2012 appearance on the hit US TV show, Shark Tank , could not get a single bank to lend him money to order more boards from plants in Thailand and China.

Then he got a $25,000 loan offer from Amazon, where he was selling through the company's third-party marketplace programme, using its network of warehouses to store, package and ship orders. A few months later came another offer: $140,000.

"Holy cow, this was like, easy money," says Mr Aarstol, founder of Tower. "They already know what I'm selling, they have a history and a projection of sales, and they have the asset in their warehouses. Why wouldn't they give me a loan?"

Amazon's push into lending shows how the landscape of banking has been radically reshaped since the crisis and how traditional banks are facing tough new competition.

Lenders such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have been beaten back by tougher rules on capital and a squeeze on profits from ultra-low interest rates. Many have reviewed loan books and found that serving small businesses - the engine of the world's biggest economy - is no longer worth their while.

Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation show that loans of less than $1m accounted for 20 per cent of total loans to commercial and industrial businesses in the US at the end of last year - down a full 10 percentage points since 2007.

Meanwhile, specialists in ecommerce have begun to make use of their troves of data, which appear to give them better, deeper insights into customers' ability to handle a loan than any bank could manage. Amazon has supplied $3bn to sellers on its marketplace platform since launching a lending pilot six years ago.

"We see the metrics, minute by minute," says Peeyush Nahar, vice-president for Amazon Marketplace. "Are they shipping out on time? Is the product what they say it is? How well are they serving customers?"

Others such as Square, the payments processing company, and PayPal, the money transfer company, have been piling in, too.

"The power is going to those who have the data," says Matt Burton, chief executive of Orchard, a New York-based provider of analytics to online lenders. "That used to be the banks. Now it is the retailers."

Square, whose sleek white terminals sit on counters in shops across the country, has originated about $1.5bn of loans since the public launch of Square Capital, its lending arm, three years ago.

Speaking to investors at a JPMorgan conference last month, Square chief executive Jack Dorsey raved about the combination of lending and other product lines, such as tools for managing inventory and analysing sales.

"We see that when a seller . . . hooks up multiple parts of our ecosystem, it's just phenomenal," he said. "It not only helps them run their business and grow their business, but it's also retention for us because it's really hard to get all these parts from elsewhere."

PayPal chief Dan Schulman made a similar point last month about PayPal Credit, which has supplied about $3bn in loans to more than 115,000 businesses around the world since launching three years ago. Its offering is slightly different from Amazon's; instead of lending directly to merchants, it adds a button on their website so they can offer PayPal loans to customers, as they go through check out.

"If a consumer uses PayPal Credit, they spend twice as much with PayPal as a consumer who doesn't use credit with us," Mr Schulman told investors at a conference hosted by Bernstein. "And so honestly, I would do credit even if the economics were break-even on it. The great news is they're better than that."

In the first quarter , "other value-added services" at PayPal, which is revenues principally from interest and fees on PayPal Credit's loan portfolio, came to $376m, 23 per cent higher than a year earlier.

One satisfied customer is Tylor Fischer, sales manager at Dave's Guitar Shop in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He says he has noticed a pick-up in sales of high-end instruments such as Gibson, Fender and Paul Reed Smith guitars since the business began offering PayPal Credit about two years ago. "It's been a good addition," he says.

As for Mr Aarstol, he now gets most of his working-capital needs through a $1.5m line of credit from Bank of the West, the San Francisco-based retail-banking arm of BNP Paribas. The bank has come in with an interest rate lower than Amazon's.

But last year he still accepted about $300,000 of loan offers from the Seattle-based group.

"I don't want the ability to borrow to disappear," he says. "If the banks melt down tomorrow, I want to have that relationship established."

Tech
Asian Tech Firms Look to Climb Out of Silicon Valley's Shadow; Mobile payments, online shopping and messaging-service platforms appear to be evolving more quickly in Asia

HONG KONG Hundreds of millions of newly connected consumers are giving Asian tech firms a leg up against Silicon Valley in key emerging technologies.

At The Wall Street Journal's D.Live Asia conference on Friday, Asia's top technology investors and companies outlined how information gleaned from a massive and growing smartphone user base has informed the continent's pursuits in artificial intelligence, a type of machine learning that needs troves of consumer data to evolve.

Artificial intelligence, a field that includes voice-activated digital assistants, driverless cars and robotics, is one of the tech world's current obsessions. But the sheer number of web users in Asia compared with the U.S. and Europe, combined with deeper knowledge of local markets, is creating a dynamic where user feedback more so than raw engineering power has become an important asset.

"AI is the new electricity," said Andrew Ng, a Stanford University professor and former top AI scientist at Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Baidu Inc., the Chinese internet giant. "Whatever industry you work in, I think AI will likely transform it."

Mr. Ng's sentiments were echoed by other speakers at the WSJ's D.Live Asia event, where AI was a frequently discussed topic. But participants also discussed how doing business in China has changed, the cutthroat mobile-payment space and unparalleled mobile adoption in Southeast Asia one of the few places exhibiting growth in a fast-maturing tech world.

Going forward, much of the focus will be on harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence. The U.S. had a clear advantage with the first wave of smartphone apps and software, but newer services like mobile payments, online shopping or messaging-service platforms appear to be evolving more quickly in Asia which as a region has a size advantage in web-connected users.

Connie Chan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture firm whose investments include Airbnb Inc. and Facebook Inc., sees instances where China's internet titans such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tech-companies-now-copycats-of-chinese-peers-andreessen-horowitz-partner-says-1496987481", as well as replicated efforts. For instance, Ms. Chan said, Apple Inc. recently added payment services to its iMessage chat service, taking a page from Tencent's playbook.

"I love this reversal of what 'China copycat' can mean," Ms. Chan said. "It no longer just means a Chinese company copying the States, it can mean a U.S. company copying China."

Microsoft Corp., which has been in China for decades, is now "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-seeks-closer-partnerships-with-chinese-firms-1496998965?tesla=y" and taking a different approach, said Alain Crozier, the company's chairman for Greater China. For instance, Mr. Crozier cited a customized version of Windows 10 made for the Chinese government that was completed through a joint venture with the state-owned CETC.

"You have to change your business model," Mr. Crozier said. "I share maybe more than I used to share."

But the time-tested lessons in China are contrasted with the lesser-tapped markets of Southeast Asia, which is undergoing explosive growth in mobile users.

In Indonesia, the world's fourth-largest country with a population of more than 250 million, Singapore's GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd. and Indonesia's Go-Jek are slugging it out across the region. Grab co-founder Anthony Tan, meanwhile, spoke of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/grabtaxi-co-founder-didi-isnt-interested-in-buying-usfor-now-1496977303", now covering 55 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar.

But Go-Jek, the motorcycle-hailing startup, said it was defending its home territory successfully, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/founder-of-indonesias-go-jek-were-beating-uber-grab-1496986235". "In terms of competition, we're clearly number one across verticals," said Nadiem Makarim, co-founder of Go-Jek.

JD.com Inc., China's second-largest online retailer after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., also has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jd-com-plans-expansion-in-developing-markets-1497002111?tesla=y". Other Chinese giants will help pave the way, said JD.com's Chief Executive Richard Liu.

"I believe in the next 10 years, many Chinese brands will become global brands," said Mr. Liu, citing hardware firms Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. as examples. "It is then that Chinese e-commerce platforms can take these brands overseas and win consumers in Europe and the U.S."

The advantages of Chinese firms aren't based only on their sizable user bases. In China, emerging tech sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-supports-certain-tech-sectors-top-venture-capitalist-says-1496992857" as part of China's latest five-year economic plan, said Jenny Lee, managing partner of GGV Capital.

This funding has drawn new startups into these sectors, she said. It is only in recent years that China has attained the technology levels needed to join the race in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and cloud computing, she said. "Ten years ago, there was no cloud infrastructure in China," Ms. Lee said. "Today the story is very different."

South Koreans are so reliant on Kakao Corp.'s messaging app that it has become dominant in other areas, like mobile payments and taxi hailing. Now, the South Korean firm is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kakao-to-launch-voice-activated-ai-services-in-third-quarter-1496976286", with a rollout of some features in the third quarter of this year, said Kakao Chief Executive Rim Ji-hoon. Sizable user bases are critical to these so-called deep-learning databases getting smarter.

The Asian tech advantage is more clear-cut in other areas. China has already sped ahead in getting its consumers to do their shopping online, said Yuri Milner, founder of the prominent tech investment firm DST Global. But he "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yuri-milner-online-spending-will-fuel-world-wide-growth-1496974807". Only 6% of consumer spending world-wide takes place online, a figure he expects to rise to 15% by 2025, a number that "is pretty close to the Chinese number today."

A Dimon Heir Will Leave J.P. Morgan; Matthew Zames is the latest in a string of potential successors to the CEO to depart

Matthew Zames, the chief operating officer at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/25/as-j-p-morgan-departures-mount-zames-case-to-replace-dimon-builds/" to Chief Executive James Dimon, is leaving the firm, the bank said Thursday.

The departure of Mr. Zames, 46 years old, will kick off a new round of speculation within the bank about possible heirs to Mr. Dimon. But it will also reinforce views that the longstanding chief of the biggest U.S. bank by assets isn't going anywhere soon.

Mr. Dimon, widely viewed as the most powerful executive on Wall Street and a statesman for the banking industry, has told people within the bank that he plans to stay in his role for another five years, executives said, though the number hasn't changed as the years pass.

Mr. Dimon sent a memo to employees Thursday detailing Mr. Zames's decision to leave, saying, "While I am sad to see him leave, I respect his decision and all he has done for J.P. Morgan Chase," according to a copy of the memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

"Jamie has been public on numerous occasions he would like to be here another five years or so," Mr. Zames said in an interview Thursday. "I want to get back to &running a business."

Mr. Zames didn't want to stay since it was unlikely he would be named CEO of J.P. Morgan in the near future, or at all, people familiar with the situation said. What's more, people within the bank viewed Mr. Zames's chances to gain the top spot to have fallen within the past year or two, according to employees and executives.

A bank spokesman said that while Mr. Zames wants to run a business now, the J.P. Morgan CEO job "is unlikely to open up in the next several years."

The decision for Mr. Zames to leave in the coming weeks was amicable and was Mr. Zames's decision, the spokesman for the bank said.

While he aspires to be a CEO at another company, it won't necessarily be in finance, Mr. Zames said. He added that he is leaving the bank without another job lined up because he wants to "take time and make the right decision for me."

In departing, Mr. Zames becomes the latest in a string of potential successors to Mr. Dimon who have either chosen to leave rather than wait, or been pushed out. Such executives have included Jes Staley, who is now CEO of Barclays PLC; Bill Winters, currently CEO of Standard Chartered PLC, and Charles Scharf, who until recently was CEO of Visa Inc., among others.

With Mr. Zames now out of the running, current executives viewed as potential CEO-successor candidates include: Gordon Smith, head of the consumer-banking business; Daniel Pinto, head of the firm's corporate and investment-banking business; Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of its asset-management business, and Marianne Lake, the bank's chief financial officer.

Mr. Zames was elevated to his current role of chief operating officer in the wake of the "London Whale" trading scandal that cost the bank around $6 billion. The former head of the bank's fixed-income business, he was widely credited with helping to sort out the fiasco within the bank's chief investment office.

He is known throughout the bank as someone with a trader's personality, who is blunt and passionate about his work. He was said to have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-ramping-up-efforts-to-cut-wasteful-expenses-1404840177" a few years ago with an iron fist, which frustrated some executives and employees.

There are also "Zames guys," or employees who have worked alongside him and respect his work, especially in the corporate and investment bank. Some employees who had worked with Mr. Zames said they were surprised and disappointed in his decision to leave the bank.

In his current role, Mr. Zames oversaw a number of groups across the bank, including cybersecurity, technology, real estate and other functions. Earlier, he held roles across the investment-banking and trading businesses.

His role became more important in recent years as J.P. Morgan and other banks were tested by cyberthreats and upstart fintech companies. J.P. Morgan responded by boosting its tech budget to $9.5 billion annually, according to a letter Mr. Zames wrote for the company's annual report in April that also highlighted the bank's hiring of outside programmers and its push into robotics and machine learning. "I have never been more excited about the opportunities ahead," Mr. Zames wrote at the time.

Executives on the bank's operating committee will take on Mr. Zames's responsibilities, a spokesman said.

Mr. Zames was one of the bank's most highly paid executives. According to J.P. Morgan's most recent proxy statement, Mr. Zames was awarded total pay of $19 million for his work in 2016, up from $18.5 million the prior year and $17 million for 2014.

According to a regulatory filing by the bank Thursday, Mr. Zames will be entitled to a future severance payment of $900,000, plus discretionary payments of $4.625 million in February 2018 and $4.5 million in February 2019.

Mr. Zames's 2016 pay was the same as that of Ms. Erdoes and Mr. Pinto. It was $9 million less than the $28 million pay package the bank awarded Mr. Dimon.

HONG KONG Electric vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence are poised for growth in China due to the government's support of these sectors, said Jenny Lee, managing partner of GGV Capital.

In China, "the technology business model cannot exist without government support," said Ms. Lee, speaking at The Wall Street Journal's D.Live Asia conference in Hong Kong on Friday.

Companies in these emerging tech sectors are receiving government subsidies and other support as part of China's latest five-year economic plan. This funding has drawn new startups into these sectors, she said.

It is only in recent years that China has attained the technology levels needed to join the race in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and cloud computing, she said.

"Ten years ago, there was no cloud infrastructure in China," she said. "Today the story is very different."

Based in China and Silicon Valley, GGV Capital was an early backer of major Chinese internet companies including e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co.

Ms. Lee joined GGV Capital in 2005. She was ranked No. 10 on the Forbes Midas List of the world's top venture capitalists in 2015, the highest ranking ever for a woman.

Tech
Uber in Talks to Acquire Team of Car-Parking Startup Luxe; Discussions also involved technology that startup was designing to enable short-term car rentals

While Uber Technologies Inc. wrestles with a string of controversies, the ride-hailing company is in advanced talks to acquire much of the engineering team from a struggling car-parking service, according to people familiar with the matter.

Uber is discussing bringing on part of the engineering team from Luxe Valet Inc. in what is known in Silicon Valley as an "acquihire." The talks had also involved technology that Luxe was designing to enable short-term car rentals, said one of the people.

Luxe, which is based only about a three-minute drive from Uber's headquarters in San Francisco, employs about 60 people, not including its parking valets. Founded in 2013, Luxe was known for its app that let drivers in big cities summon valets who would park the cars for them in underused lots at discount prices.

The startup raised more than $75 million in funding, including from rental-car company Hertz, and expanded into several big cities including New York and Los Angeles. But it pulled the plug on the app last month and said it would launch a new parking service this summer.

On Wednesday, Uber was interviewing Luxe engineers to determine which it would keep after the acquisition closes, according to a person familiar with the matter. Chief Executive Curtis Lee and co-founder Craig Martin will continue with what remains of Luxe, said one of the people. Uber isn't likely to take the Luxe name as part of the deal, the people said. Terms of the deal couldn't be learned.

Uber hasn't been particularly acquisitive though it has raised about $15 billion in equity and debt financing. Last year, it bought self-driving truck company Otto for around $680 million and artificial-intelligence firm Geometric Intelligence for an undisclosed sum. Before that, it bought mapping startup deCarta in 2014 and some assets of Microsoft's Bing mapping service.

Luxe was part of a generation of startups that launched several years ago in the wake of Uber's success and improvements in mobile technology. Investors piled money into startups that gave people a way to summon just about anything with a tap of a smartphone. To keep costs low, the startups typically relied on freelancers to perform the tasks, whether it is cleaning houses, running errands or delivering food.

Known as the "Uber for parking," Luxe dispatched attendants who wore bright-blue track jackets and rode around on Razor scooters, picking up cars and fetching them when it was time for the driver to go home. It reached deals with parking lots for discounted rates.

In 2015 it began converting hundreds of parking attendants to employees who could work full or part-time, paying for expenses such as cellphones and uniforms, plus health benefits. But as it expanded to more cities, Luxe encountered expensive contracts to park cars in garages, eating up cash.

Luxe earlier this year pared back its service to just San Francisco, New York and Chicago and laid off some workers, including customer-service representatives.

More recently, Luxe set up valet parking stands and offered lower rates at Luxe-branded parking lots. Luxe had been planning a service to allow for short-term car rentals in conjunction with its biggest shareholder, Hertz, owned by Herc Holdings Inc., according to one of the people. But that plan was called off after Hertz's CEO was pushed out in December.

Uber is embroiled in an "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-fires-more-than-20-workers-in-harassment-investigation-1496774806"in the wake of a former engineer's blog post about a permissive attitude toward sexual harassment and sexism. It is expected to release on Tuesday the results of a probe of its practices led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.

Stock Pickers Ride Tech Giants' Surge

It is one of the least creative trades of the year -- and one of the most profitable.

Many stock pickers that have beaten the market in the early months of the year have five of the best-known technology companies to thank: Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

Those five stocks have accounted for 41% of the S&P 500's market-capitalization advance this year through Wednesday. Of the 101 top-performing actively managed U.S. stock funds this year, 84 count two or more of those technology firms in their top five holdings, according to Morningstar Inc.

The best-performing funds by definition pick the best-performing stocks. While funds in the past have had large holdings of big tech firms, what's unusual about 2017 is that the biggest stocks are doing particularly well, meaning investors must make more outsize bets to beat their benchmarks.

The average price gain for the S&P 500's 10 largest U.S. stocks was 12% through the first five months of this year, the second-highest mark for that group over the past two decades, according to WSJ Market Data Group. The S&P 500's tech sector had gained 20% this year through May, compared with the broader index's 7.7% advance.

Yet gains by big tech companies have left some investors uneasy, concerned that prices have run up too far, too fast but also reluctant to pare holdings on the market's strongest performers. Facebook, Apple and Amazon all climbed at least 32% this year through May; Alphabet was up 25%, while Microsoft had tacked on 12%.

A survey of nearly 200 fund managers last month by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that money managers view the tech-oriented Nasdaq Composite Index as the world's "most crowded trade."

"These stocks are up 30% [this year], and so are they getting pricey? Yeah," said Michael Lippert of the Baron Opportunity Fund, which owns big slugs of Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix Inc. and is up 29% this year through Tuesday. "But ask yourself: What else do you want to own five years from now?"

The rally in technology and internet stocks is in some ways reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, when the promise of the information superhighway translated into bullishness that ultimately imploded with excess.

In the dot-com boom, as now, there was pressure on fund managers to place large bets in the technology sector to keep up. Fund managers say one difference between then and now is that firms like Amazon and Alphabet are more deeply entwined in the day-to-day lives of their customers, enjoy more of an edge over competitors and are expanding into more industries.

"The reality is there are relatively few winners in the U.S. economy now," said Justin White, manager of the T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund, which is up 21% this year, according to Morningstar. It has large holdings of Amazon and Facebook shares.

The boost from big technology companies is helping stock pickers achieve one of their best starts to a year since the end of the financial crisis. Nearly half of all actively managed U.S. stock funds, about 49%, beat their benchmark through May. That is the highest percentage of those funds outperforming in that period since 2009, when 56% did so.

The firms that try to beat the market have faced pressure in recent years from funds that aim to mimic the performance of broad market indexes, often at a much lower cost.

The best-performing large-cap growth stock fund this year tracked by Morningstar is the $4.7 million Zevenbergen Genea Fund, which was up 40% through Tuesday. Amazon by itself represented nearly 10% of the fund's portfolio holdings as of the end of March. The fund, launched in 2015, is a new entrant from Zevenbergen Capital Investments, a $2.15 billion Seattle-based asset manager that has focused on growth stocks for three decades.

"The strong keep getting stronger. We don't see that theme changing any time soon," said Anthony Zackery, a portfolio manager at Zevenbergen. "Recent performance is a manifestation of the scale these companies have built out in recent years."

Some fund managers say they are wary of how fast tech shares are accelerating. Mr. White of T. Rowe Price said he dialed back some of his bets on technology firms because their shares have risen so much this year. He said, however, that he is reluctant to hold less of the sector than his fund's benchmark because there is still potential for further gains.

The growth of large technology stocks this year is "obviously unsustainable," said Gavin Baker, manager of the $15.1 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio. But he said the group was hit hard in late 2016, creating a low starting point.

Mr. Baker, whose fund is up 25% year to date, called Google, Amazon and Facebookartificial intelligence companies that he expects to expand over the next five to seven years.

By some comparisons, the shares have room to run. Tech stocks were an even bigger proportion of the S&P 500 back in 2000, representing 34.5% of the overall index compared with 23% today, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. And valuations were higher then. The average stock price of S&P 500 tech shares trades at 19 times the earnings that analysts expect over the next year, according to FactSet. That is above the S&P 500 index's price/earnings ratio of 17.7, but is far below the P/E of 53.4 that the tech sector traded at in March 2000.

Stock pickers say one of the biggest threats Google, Amazon and Facebook are likely to contend with is new regulations targeting online privacy and the way customer data is collected and used. Investors also say that, while antitrust concerns are a risk, especially in Europe, there is no way to predict their timing or impact.

There are also risks that as the companies expand they will compete with each other as their business models sprawl into new, overlapping industries.

But the flip side, some say, is the dominance itself. Says Mr. Lippert of the Baron fund: "We are going to have a winner-take-all or winner-take-most world."

The High Price of Not Completing College in Four Years; Most students take longer to graduate, so schools are trying to do something about that

Corrections & Amplifications

An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Indiana's Frank O'Bannon Grant as the Frank O'Brian Grant. (June 12, 2017) 

How can you save over $20,000 on college costs? Graduate on time.

At four-year schools, only about 40% of full-time students graduate on time, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education.

For some students, it is because they sign up for too few courses in certain semesters and don't earn enough credits in time. Other students can enroll in too many courses that don't count toward a degree. In still other cases, students have to work to cover their expenses, which sometimes interferes with studies.

Such delays add up. An additional year of school in a public four-year college will cost $22,826, on average, according to the nonprofit Complete College America. Then there is lost income to consider. Students who stay in school an additional year miss out on about $45,327 in salary, on average.

All told, Complete College America estimates that an extra year of college can cost as much as $68,153.

More colleges and universities are trying to improve their on-time graduation rates. The move, some say, is a response to the rising cost of tuition and stagnating family incomes. But it also makes financial sense for the schools. When students are on track to graduate on time, dropout rates fall and revenues rise.

Many new initiatives urge students to earn more credits each semester. To that end, a number of colleges now charge a flat rate for a semester, rather than charge by the credit. Adams State University in Alamosa, Colo., revised its tuition policy so that students pay the same for 20 credits as they pay for 12, and have an incentive to take a heavier course load. Also, its tuition won't increase for four consecutive years for full-time students.

"We are trying keep the cost of education as low as possible," says Karla Hardesty, director of marketing and enrollment management at Adams State.

The average course load for degree-seeking undergraduates at Adams State rose 11% between the fall of 2010 and the fall of 2015, according to school officials. The university's goal is to have more than 20% of its students graduate in four years by 2020. For the freshman class of 2009, the rate was 11%.

Focus on 15

Students at many colleges take 12 credits a semester, or 24 credits a year, which is considered full time by federal financial-aid programs. But students usually need 30 credits a year to earn the necessary 120 credits to graduate on time.

If students start taking more credits from the outset, education experts say, it sets a precedent that is likely to stay with them throughout their time at school. Students at four-year schools who took 15 credits their first semester or 30 credits their first year were more likely to graduate than students who attempted 12 or 24 credits, according to a recent study of data from Tennessee public colleges.

"The longer students stretch out their studies, the more life intervenes and the more likely students won't finish," says Davis Jenkins, co-author of the "http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/media/k2/attachments/momentum-15-credit-course-load.pdf" and senior research scholar at Columbia University's Teachers College. The report also found that students who stayed the course paid $52 (14%) less per credit and $13,310 (20%) less per degree.

Some states have made enrolling in 30 credits a year a requirement to receive state scholarship money. New York state's Excelsior scholarship, included in the 2018 state budget, requires recipients to enroll in 30 credits. Indiana's 21st Century Scholar and Frank O'Bannon Grant, both approved by the Indiana General Assembly in 2013, also predicate funding on earning 30 credits.

Miami-based Florida International University this fall will start encouraging students to consider earning credits in summer. Promoting a summer semester may offer more flexibility for students who work and attend classes, says Elizabeth Bejar, vice president for academic affairs.

Congress made it possible for more students to attend summer sessions when it signed an appropriations package last month that included an amendment to the Higher Education Act allowing students to use Pell Grants year round.

Guided pathways

In another approach to helping more students graduate in four years, some schools now require, or encourage, picking an area of study as early as possible. Degree maps, which show all of the courses required for each major (in the right sequence), are promoted on some college websites and through introductory courses.

"Students should be clear on what to do and when, not just handed a book and told to figure it out," says Courtney Brown, vice president at the Lumina Foundation, a private foundation that works to make higher education more available.

One big reason for failing to graduate on time, experts say, is that certain required courses aren't offered frequently enough for all students who need them to enroll.

Temple University, based in Philadelphia, works to prevent such situations with its Fly in 4 Graduation Partnership, an agreement that offers certain safeguards but requires students to be proactive in their class scheduling. To participate, students must be full-time freshmen or transfer students who begin in a fall semester, and they must agree to complete 30 credits a year. The students are also required to meet with an academic adviser at least once a semester, register early each semester and let advisers know immediately when a required course isn't available so that a possible solution can be found.

For a Fly in 4 student who meets all of his or her obligations but still fails to graduate on time because a required course wasn't available at the necessary time, Temple says the student can complete his or her degree requirements fee and tuition free. But if students fail to meet the terms of the contract, Temple won't pay for any additional time in school.

For the first Temple students who signed the contract, in 2014, 61.6% are on track to graduate on time in 2018. For those who declined, 46.5% are on track, school officials say.

Data analytics

Another tool being used to keep students on track: data analytics. At Georgia State University, in Atlanta, about 100 full-time advisers receive electronic alerts when students enroll in the wrong course, a course out of sequence or receive a bad grade. The advisers must then reach out to students within 48 hours.

"We are trying to approximate elite institutions that notice and redirect students when they make a bad choice," says Timothy Renick, vice provost at Georgia State, where 80% of students work full or part time.

The school's four-year graduation rate has doubled to 29% over five years. Moreover, the average bachelor's degree student is graduating with eight fewer credit hours than five years ago, translating into about $15 million in savings for this year's graduating class, Mr. Renick says.

The University of Texas in Austin has used data from academic transcripts and personal records to identify the 25% of students least likely to graduate on time. Those most at risk are put in the University Leadership Network, which pays students $5,000 each year if they earn 25% of their degree requirements and maintain a 2.0 grade-point average, school officials say. Students also are required to attend weekly seminars and do internships on campus.

David Laude, senior vice provost at the University of Texas, says the school's four-year graduation rate rose to 61% in 2016 from 50% in 2011. The goal for this year's graduating class was 70%, he says, but the school doesn't know yet if it met that goal.

"It creates a network on campus," he says. "So when students have a problem, they seek out someone at UT rather than taking a bus home."

Tech
Face-Lifts and Finance: Where China's Tech Titans Are Hunting for the Next Big Thing; Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu jostle to get into lifestyle apps to keep fueling their turbocharged growth

SHANGHAI In the search for new growth in the world's biggest internet market, China's three tech titans are spending billions of dollars on dozens of fronts to find the next big thing.

The latest battleground is China's lifestyle trends, with companies investing in apps that offer a variety of services including food, face-lifts, child care and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/braking-bad-thieves-and-pranksters-lay-waste-to-chinas-share-bikes-1491230284". E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., social-media champion Tencent Holdings Ltd. and search engine Baidu Inc. are betting that one-stop shops that match merchants with consumers represent the next wave of consumption.

China's internet giants have been on a tear. Alibaba said Thursday that revenue in fiscal 2018 "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-shares-rise-after-cfo-says-revenue-growth-will-accelerate-1496930842", sending its shares higher. Both it and Tencent have notched stock-price gains of more than 40% this year, with analysts "https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-just-the-fangs-chinas-tech-rally-has-more-bite-1496811330".

Still, the country's market of 731 million internet users is peaking, with several times the number of people accessing the web and shopping on smartphones as in the U.S. As growth opportunities narrow, the big three internet companies are increasingly cutting across each others' businesses, including online video streaming, cloud computing and internet finance.

With deep pockets and a powerful influence on day-to-day Chinese life, the companies have amassed a tangled array of investments, becoming kingmakers for startups and contributing to a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-quandary-too-much-money-chasing-too-few-ideas-1493291432" that has created more than 100 billion-dollar startups in China, surpassing the number in the U.S.

Tencent, China's most valuable company by market capitalization, is a global gaming giant and owns China's largest social network, WeChat. The app is prevalent in the lives of its more than 900 million monthly users. In recent years, Tencent has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-mobile-payment-battle-becomes-a-free-for-all-1463945404". According to research firm Analysys, it had 40% of China's mobile-payments market, snatching some of that from Alibaba, whose affiliate Ant Financial at one time monopolized the industry.

Alibaba which runs China's most popular e-commerce websites, Taobao and Tmall, and has more sales than Amazon and eBay combined chronicles the spending habits of more than 450 million customers through its payments affiliate. It competes neck and neck with Baidu on internet mapping services in China.

Baidu, whose market capitalization has lagged behind that of its two rivals of late, dominates internet searching in China and is often referred to as China's Google. It has bet heavily on artificial intelligence and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/baidu-to-open-source-its-self-driving-technology-1492566430", a field that Tencent is moving quickly into.

The frenzy to invest means the three tech giants sometimes overlap. Tencent and Alibaba are both investors in China's ride-hailing app, Didi Chuxing. Baidu and Tencent also jointly back electric-car maker NextEV, which will start production of an electric SUV in China this year.

Currently, these three companies are fighting over the untapped segments of Chinese consumer lifestyles such as booking real-world services through the internet, referred to in the industry as online-to-offline services.

China's internet-driven lifestyle-services industry is forecast to grow to 7.8 trillion yuan by 2020 ($1.15 trillion) from almost 5 trillion yuan in 2015, according to Sanford C. Bernstein, dwarfing that of the U.S.

Alibaba has backed Koubei, a lifestyle search engine that is the newest entrant into the field. Koubei said in February that it had raised $1.1 billion from investors, giving it a valuation of $8 billion. Weeks later, Tencent-backed Meituan-Dianping said it had raised 1.5 billion yuan ($218 million) to start a venture-capital fund to help restaurant- and leisure-related merchants grow.

Those apps go further than those available elsewhere, such as Yelp Inc. Users can not only order food and make an appointment with a hairdresser, they can also book day trips, holidays and educational classes, and hail rides.

Meituan-Dianping dominates China's industry, with 75.5% market share last year, according to Analysys. Baidu's Nuomi is second, with 24%. Koubei has yet to establish a major presence.

The competition offers another prize: a wealth of big data companies can use to unlock more money in a market where user growth is slowing. The data those services yield gives the companies more power to target consumers with tailored advertising, helping them capture a larger slice of the online-advertising pie. All three say their data analytics will win them a greater share.

Beijing-based Baidu said it is accelerating efforts to use its artificial-intelligence technologies, such as virtual-reality hotel tours, to boost merchants on its platform. Its location and search data can also advise merchants on optimal locations to open a physical store: Several consumers searching for a manicure salon in an area could indicate demand for one.

Koubei, whose name translates to "word-of-mouth" said it can sell services to businesses that want to better manage their customer base and customize promotions.

"Restaurants know very little about their customers," said Koubei CEO Samuel Fan, whose app leverages Ant Financial's customer database. "They don't know if he lives nearby, or is he a student or a professional? How does he shop online? We offer them our database of information to give them this insight."

Meituan-Dianping, the $18 billion industry leader, uses order and browsing history to send targeted ads. It has added ride-hailing and homestay bookings to the app.

The company has five million merchants on its platform, the most among the three. Nuomi has two million, while Koubei has 1.5 million.

Koubei's funding salvo may delay profitability in the sector, but Meituan-Dianping's investors aren't perturbed. Meituan-Dianping's first-mover advantage and user reviews will help it hold on to its lead, said early-stage investor James Mi, Lightspeed China Partners' co-founder.

"In such industries, there is usually only space for one big player," Mr. Mi said.

Beyond Limits Brings Cognitive Computing to Industrial Firms; BP makes $20 million investment in data-mining startup

Industrial companies are aiming to turn the reams of data that their machines produce into improved business.

Beyond Limits, which uses artificial intelligence that came out of the NASA, has raised $20 million in Series B funding from BP Ventures. The company, which launched in 2012, has raised $25.5 million in total.

The technology was used in space exploration missions and is now licensed from California Institute of Technology, which manages NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Caltech is a shareholder in Beyond Limits.

Industrial companies generate tons of valuable data but little of it gets captured and it languishes in emails and elsewhere.

"We're trying to capture knowledge where you have humans involved in the decision-making loop and deploy that in a cognitive agent," said AJ Abdallat, chief executive of Beyond Limits. "Think of it as a data scientist in a box."

Beyond Limits' technology collects data, analyzes and interprets it and makes recommendations and alerts users on critical issues such as well efficiency, safety issues, or oil exploration. The company's artificial intelligence allows the system to reason and recognize anomalies even if there are insufficient rules or data. For example, when a Tesla crashed into a white truck while on "autopilot" mode, the car's system didn't sense a truck there because it recognized the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-draws-scrutiny-from-regulators-after-autopilot-feature-is-linked-to-a-death-1467319355". But Beyond Limits says it has a physics model in its reasoning software and could recognize that it's not possible for a truck to disappear so quickly, Mr. Abdallat said.

The startup has focused on the oil and gas industry initially, but it can be applied to other areas such as health care. Companies like BP can use the technology to analyze data and help find oil reservoirs, improve the efficiency of wells, and predict when problems could arise.

BP has been working with Beyond Limits for about a year and is now testing the technology in two areas with others in the works, said Meghan Sharp, managing director of BP Ventures, who is joining the company's board. BP Ventures, which is expanding beyond energy to digital technology, has invested about $325 million via about 41 investments total.

"Beyond Limits' technology and AI has the potential to relate to every aspect of BP's businesses and technology operations in the future," Ms. Sharp said.

In automation, Beyond Limits is focusing on surfacing and flagging critical information for customers, but eventually the software could also take corrective actions.

"The first generation of the product just captures and deploys knowledge and predicts and flags that we have a problem here," Mr. Abdallat said. "In the second and third generation, if they want the system to take some correction action or pursue something that might not be in the original mission" that would be possible.

Cybersecurity Startup Darktrace Doubles Down on Machine Learning ; Led by a marketer-turned-CEO, the company takes a unique approach to a crowded market

Chief Information Officer Michael Sherwood says Darktrace Ltd. has helped the Las Vegas city government detect unusual activity on its networks using artificial intelligence for several years.

Now, he says, the British-founded company enables Las Vegas to fight back against bad actors too. With its new product Antigena, Darktrace is pushing further into automation and has created a system that can respond to unusual network activity without human intervention.

"It's the next layer of security we've never had before," Mr. Sherwood said.

With dual headquarters in Cambridge and San Francisco, Darktrace was one of the first companies to talk about applying artificial intelligence to cybersecurity.

Darktrace likens its defensive technology to the human immune system's approach to fighting diseases. Just as an immune system learns what is normal in the body's environment and detects abnormalities, Darktrace's AI learns what is normal in a company's network and notifies security teams when it senses something is amiss.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-brexit-kkr-buys-stake-in-u-k-cybersecurity-company-darktrace-1467889513", the company announced it raised $65 million in fresh financing. Recently Darktrace said its U.S. business has surpassed Europe in sales.

After raising more than $100 million to date, the company is vying for a slice of the highly competitive and fragmented cybersecurity market.

Boosted by concerns about high-profile data breaches and ransomware attacks, world-wide spending on information security is expected to top $113 billion by 2020, according to Gartner Inc. That is up 20% from the $90 billion that is expected to be spent world-wide in 2017.

Gartner analyst Avivah Litan says she's seen a surge of interest in applying machine learning and advanced analytics to cybersecurity.

"Darktrace was one of the first to bring it out there," she said.

She said the company's product is able to help security teams sort out bad traffic from good traffic on their networks.

"They're one of the best at marketing, but they aren't the only provider," she said.

Competitors include Cisco Stealthwatch, Vectra Networks and LightCyber, which was acquired by Palo Alto Networks.

Founded by Cambridge University mathematicians, former British intelligence spooks and partners at Invoke Capital, Darktrace has had an unusual rise to its perch as a highly funded cybersecurity startup. Chief Executive Nicole Eagan has no previous experience in cybersecurity which is unusual in the tightknit industry.

Before becoming Darktrace's top executive, Ms. Eagan worked as chief marketing officer at Autonomy Corp., which proved to be a troubled acquisition for Hewlett-Packard Co. After Autonomy was acquired for $11 billion in 2011, H-P later accused the company of improperly reporting $709 million in revenue and took a $8.8 billion write-down on the deal.

Autonomy Chief Executive Mike Lynch was embroiled in lawsuits with the company, but as this legal battle ensued, he founded Invoke Capital, where Ms. Eagan also worked. Invoke was an early investor in Darktrace, and Mr. Lynch remains on the company's board.

"A customer has never asked me about Autonomy," Ms. Eagan said in an interview. She said Mr. Lynch has mentored her as a first-time chief executive but isn't involved in Darktrace's day-to-day business.

Ms. Eagan said she has earned respect in the industry for being at one of the first companies to bring machine learning to cybersecurity.

Han Sikkens, a managing director at Darktrace investor Summit Partners, said Ms. Eagan's background was a "positive."

"Darktrace," he said, "took a different approach to the market."

Commercial real-estate values declined slightly in May, primarily because of weakness in the retail sector, according to Green Street Advisors' latest commercial property index released Tuesday.

The index, which tracks property owned by real-estate investment trusts, fell 0.4% to 125.7. The index over all has been at roughly the same level since June of 2016, after rising steadily since hitting a postcrash low of 61.2 in June 2009.

Malls, which have been under pressure from competition with online retail, fell 2.8% in value between April and May and are down 5% in the past three months, Green Street said.

But the value of industrial property continues to rise thanks partly to strong demand for space in warehouses and distribution centers from e-commerce companies. Green Street's index for that sector hit a record 124.5 in May, up 8.5% over the past 12 months.

The run-up in commercial real-estate values that began in 2009 was fueled partly by an improving economy, which pushed up rents and occupancy rates, and partly because property yields were attractive in a low-interest-rate environment.

But investor demand has cooled as concern has grown that prices are near their peaks in the current cycle. In the first four months of 2017, investors purchased $121.1 billion worth of commercial real estate, compared with $146.5 billion during the same period in 2016 and $172.3 billion in 2015, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

Tracy's Take: A Big Financial Regulatory Week

Empty Seats at Federal Panels Bring Uncertainty

House Poised to Approve Dodd-Frank Replacement

Trump Considering Economist Marvin Goodfriend for Fed Board

Tech Teams Rush to Catch Up as New Accounting Rule Looms

Finding the Substance in a Big Financial Regulatory Week

Monday marks the start of a big week for financial regulatory nerds, with two moments that have been anticipated for months: a House vote on the Financial Choice Act and the release of the Trump Treasury Department's first financial regulatory policy recommendations.

Neither of these events heralds change in the near term. But in combination, they will give clues about how the continuing tug-of-war between different parts of team Trump is playing out in the financial sector.

The Choice Act, the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-approves-plan-to-undo-parts-of-dodd-frank-financial-law-1493916205" from Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), is expected to pass the House along party lines. The legislation isn't likely to become law. No similar proposal has been made by anyone in the Senate, and there is no indication that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) is interested in considering it.

Mr. Hensarling, famous for his focus on winning the debate, will have scored some points in that regard. The House will have approved legislation embodying his view of a better bank regulatory system: one where firms that meet a tough 10% leverage capital ratio operate under significantly simpler and looser rules than they do today.

It isn't clear how much sway Mr. Hensarling and his fellow conservatives hold in the Trump administration. White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have praised Mr. Hensarling's work without offering a broad endorsement of specific policies.

The second event coming this week is the release, as early as Tuesday, of the Treasury Department's report on financial regulation, drafted in response to President Donald Trump's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-executive-actions-toward-scaling-back-dodd-frank-financial-regulation-1486148274".

It is conceivable that the report, coupled with inaction by the Senate, will leave Mr. Hensarling's plan to collect dust. Take the idea of a higher leverage ratio: Mr. Cohn, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., is already "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-cohn-in-his-own-words-on-financial-regulatory-policy-1481625001", and the big bank executives meeting with Treasury officials in recent months want the administration to make the leverage ratio easier to comply with, not harder.

How the Treasury report handles that issue and others will speak volumes about whether they favor Mr. Hensarling's approach, or whether they want to take a more centrist tack.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Empty Seats at Federal Panels Bring Uncertainty

By Brent Kendall

WASHINGTON When the Federal Trade Commission leveled deceptive-advertising allegations against DirecTV in 2015, all five FTC commissioners were on the job. There were four when Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc . and Rite Aid Corp . began trying to win antitrust clearance for a proposed merger later that year. And when the FTC sued Qualcomm Inc . early this year, there were three.

Now just two commissioners remain. It is a predicament never before seen in the agency's 102-year history, one making life more complicated for these companies and others with delicate business before the FTC.

Similar stories are unfolding across official Washington, as the unexpected election victory by President Donald Trump and a slow transition process added to the usual disruption triggered when power changes hands. While some of the positions were unfilled even before Mr. Trump took office, left open by tradition for the next president to fill, they could remain empty for more months, making 2017 a year of prolonged uncertainty for businesses eager for clarity from regulators.

DirecTV , Walgreens, Rite Aid and Qualcomm all declined to comment about the situation at the FTC.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has lacked a quorum since February, because its rules require at least three commissioners, and it has only two. The commission can't hold its monthly meetings or vote on matters like approving new pipelines. Mr. Trump announced two FERC nominees last month, and they appeared before a Senate committee on May 25. The nominations must be reported out of the committee and confirmed by the Senate.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also is operating with depleted ranks, having slipped to two members in February when a commissioner left. The effect has been to sideline for now most of the plans of its acting Republican chairman, J. Christopher Giancarlo, who wants to ease rules adopted after the financial crisis. The other commissioner is Sharon Bowen, a Democrat who generally opposes the rollback. The White House has nominated a former House aide to fill one vacancy but hasn't tapped anyone for the two others. The commission has operated at less than full strength for nearly two years.

On the National Labor Relations Board , Mr. Trump hasn't nominated any candidates for two open seats, and Democrats still hold a 2-1 majority. The board has had three members since August. The president did elevate Republican Philip Miscimarra to chairman, so he can stall decisions he disagrees with. But many businesses are anxious for Mr. Trump to appoint Republicans to reverse Obama-era rulings.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is operating with three members (including one who arrived last month) and two vacancies (which have been open for more than a year). The situation effectively grants every commissioner a veto because agency rules require that at least three commissioners be present for a vote on new rules.

The challenges are most pronounced at panels with only two sitting members like the FTC, which enforces antitrust and consumer-protection laws. The commission can't challenge a merger or a questionable business practice, or approve a settlement, unless Republican Maureen Ohlhausen , the acting chairwoman, and Democratic Commissioner Terrell McSweeny agree.

The situation was on display recently in the DirecTV case. When FTC lawyers and DirecTV told a judge they had reached a tentative settlement agreement, Ms. McSweeny wrote the court that there was no deal without her and she didn't think the settlement terms did enough to protect consumers.

As with many open slots, the Trump administration hasn't settled on who should fill the FTC's vacancies.

"The design of the FTC doesn't contemplate three vacancies," said Jon Leibowitz, a former FTC chairman who is now a partner with Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP . "A lot of companies are trying to sort through how to deal with a two-person commission."

A White House spokesman Saturday wouldn't discuss the vacancies on the commissions, saying the administration doesn't comment on personnel issues.

Several factors have contributed to the FTC's short-handedness. A Republican commissioner left in 2015 to return to academia; a Democrat resigned last year for private practice; the Democratic chairwoman named by former President Barack Obama resigned after Mr. Trump took office. Mr. Trump designated Ms. Ohlhausen the FTC's acting chairman, but hasn't installed her permanently in the post, though she remains a candidate.

In separate interviews, the two remaining FTC commissioners said they often agree on the agency's proper course even as they acknowledged disagreements on some prominent matters.

"On the day-to-day business of the commission, it's getting done. It's not gridlock," Ms. Ohlhausen said in an interview.

Said Ms. McSweeny: "The truth is, we're an awfully functional agency."

Even down to two members, the commission has approved some closely scrutinized mergers, including China National Chemical Corp .'s $43 billion takeover of Syngenta AG and Sherwin-Williams Co .'s acquisition of Valspar Corp , a deal valued at more than $11 billion.

But Ms. Ohlhausen and Ms. McSweeny disagree about an FTC lawsuit, initiated in the last days of the Democratic majority on the commission, alleging Qualcomm engaged in unlawful tactics to maintain a monopoly on cellphone chips. The company denies the charges.

Awkward moments have arisen, as when FTC lawyers recently filed a brief urging a federal judge to reject Qualcomm 's motion to dismiss while acknowledging that Ms. Ohlhausen doesn't support the suit.

The FTC also could be tested on the proposed Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, as the companies try to address agency concerns the deal would hurt competition and threaten higher drug prices. If Ms. Ohlhausen and Ms. McSweeny did deadlock on what the FTC should do, the companies could complete the deal without having to shed any stores.

The two commissioners declined to comment on specific cases, but each said generally they wouldn't abandon their views in any particular matter because there was no one at the FTC to break a tie.

"I'm going to vote the way I think is right," Ms. Ohlhausen said. "I'm not going to support a case I don't believe in purely to avoid a conflict. And I'm not going to do the reverse either."

"I agree with that 100%," Ms. McSweeny said.

PRO SHORT: House Poised to Approve Dodd-Frank Replacement

House Republican leadership threw its support behind the GOP's replacement for the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, which the chamber is expected to approve along party lines by the end of the week. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) on Friday urged his colleagues to support the bill, which analysts say is unlikely to advance in the Senate. "It will rein in the overreach of Dodd-Frank that has allowed the big banks to get bigger while small businesses have been unable to get the loans they need to succeed," Mr. Ryan said. The plan would unwind major parts of Dodd-Frank by relieving healthy banks of some regulatory requirements and forcing failing firms through bankruptcy rather a liquidation process by the regulators. It would also repeal the Volcker rule restricting banks from speculative trading.

Trump Considering Economist Marvin Goodfriend for Fed Board

By David Harrison and Peter Nicholas

President Donald Trump is considering nominating Marvin Goodfriend, a former Federal Reserve economist and current Carnegie Mellon University professor, for a spot on the Fed's board of governors, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

If nominated and confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Goodfriend would fill one of three vacancies on the Fed's powerful, seven-member board.

As reported in April, Randal Quarles, a top Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, is expected to be nominated for another position on the Fed board, as its vice chairman for bank supervision.

Both Mr. Goodfriend and Mr. Quarles have been critical of various aspects of the Fed's response to the 2007-09 financial crisis. The fact that both are under consideration suggests a willingness on the part of the Trump administration to rein in some of the Fed's ability to stimulate the economy in downturns and to take unprecedented action in a crisis.

Messrs. Goodfriend and Quarles couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The Federal Reserve declined to comment. A White House spokeswoman said, "We have no announcement at this time."

The New York Times reported earlier Friday that Mr. Goodfriend was under consideration for a Fed board seat.

He has criticized the Fed's buying of mortgage-backed securities as part of its postcrisis asset purchases aimed at lowering long-term interest rates. He has said the Fed should limit its bond-buying to Treasury securities except in limited circumstances when it has been given explicit permission by Congress.

In a March appearance before the House Financial Services Committee , Mr. Goodfriend said the Fed should welcome more oversight from Congress to enhance its credibility. He also recommended that Fed officials compare their policy decisions against a mathematical rule such as the so-called Taylor rule.

Mr. Quarles who now runs the Cynosure Group, a Salt Lake City-based investment firm he co-founded also says the Fed should hew closer to monetary policy rules. In a 2015 Bloomberg television interview, he said the Fed's current approach was generating uncertainty in financial markets.

Fed officials, including Chairwoman Janet Yellen, oppose legislative proposals to require the Fed to adopt such a policy rule, saying it would limit their flexibility to set interest rates.

Mr. Goodfriend also has criticized Fed loans to struggling financial institutions during the 2007 crisis, arguing in 2014 congressional testimony that such lending "exposes taxpayers to losses if the borrower fails subsequently."

He served as research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond from 1993 to 2005. Previously, he was a senior staff economist on the president's Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan administration and has advised foreign central banks including the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank .

The final open position is expected to be filled by a community banker, as a result of a law requiring that someone on the Fed board have experience in that industry.

Mr. Trump also will be able to name a new Fed chair if he chooses not to nominate Ms. Yellen for a second term, which would begin next February. But her term as a governor expires in 2024, so she could stay on the board until then even if not picked to stay in the top job.

Tech Teams Rush to Catch Up as New Accounting Rule Looms

By Vipal Monga

A major accounting rule change is stressing finance staff and creating headaches for technology departments at some of the world's largest businesses.

Public companies like Verizon Communications Inc ., VZ -0.15% Hortonworks Inc . HDP 0.16% and Workday Inc . WDAY 2.87% are facing higher costs as they spend months to comply with a new rule that will change how they book revenues.

For large corporations, the task is arduous and complicated: Accountants are scouring thousands of bills and contracts to determine if they must change how they book the sales for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15.

Meanwhile, tech departments are writing new code, upgrading their systems and investing in expensive new software as they work to ensure their increasingly automated finance operations can keep up.

It's not clear all of them can.

Almost a third of 300 finance and technology executives surveyed in March by Ernst & Young LLP said they are at risk of lagging behind in their rush to comply with the new revenue recognition rules. More than a fifth were concerned their finance and tech upgrades wouldn't be complete by the end of the year, leaving only a partially functioning system in place, requiring manual workarounds.

"Companies are finding it is very difficult to translate accounting rules from the new standard into usable business requirements," said John McGaw, a partner with Ernst & Young .

The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board, known as FASB, imposed the new rule because it wanted financial statements to more accurately depict the timing, uncertainty and volatility of doing business. The rule will align a company's booking of revenue with the sales of products and services that generate it. In theory, the new standard will allow investors to more easily compare revenue bookings between companies.

Corporations have been wrestling with the implications; many are still assessing how to apply the rules.

Telecommunications giant Verizon sells wireless service and handsets to more than 100 million customers, among its many businesses. The company has long relied on software that automatically logs the information for each contract on its financial statements.

After the accounting change, Verizon will credit more of its revenue to equipment sales and recognize it earlier. In effect, the company will account for revenue from many contracts differently from the way it bills customers, forcing it to reprogram its accounting software.

"It starts as an accounting exercise and ends up as an IT project," said Tony Skiadas , controller for the New-York based company. "It uses up a lot of resources and puts pressure on the team."

Verizon began the work three years ago, he said. He wouldn't reveal how much the effort has cost, but employees have already spent thousands of work hours on the project. As the finance staff determined how the accounting needed to change, Verizon 's software programmers wrote new code to transcribe information from the contracts to the financials.

"Doing it all on a spreadsheet is not tenable," said Mr. Skiadas.

The revenue rule was initially supposed to go into effect last year, but companies successfully lobbied FASB for a one-year delay. Even with that grace period, many are still struggling to meet the new deadline, said Tony Sondhi, an accounting consultant and a member of FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force.

"For a large company, it's not unusual to spend eight to 12 months implementing new software," he said.

Large companies often have legacy IT systems cobbled together over decades and through multiple acquisitions. Changing something as integral as revenue recognition often means dismembering the complex systems and then putting them back together, he said.

Even companies with newer systems are finding the change taxing.

Hortonworks uses a cloud-based system by Oracle to manage its finances. The Santa Clara, Calif., data analytics business will be able to make changes to its system without tearing down and rebuilding a legacy back office system, said a spokeswoman.

Yet, the company's administrative costs will rise, said Scott Davidson , the chief financial officer, during a February earnings call. He wouldn't say by how much.

"It impacts every aspect of how you go to market and run the business, requiring changes in systems, processes and reporting both internally and externally to investors both public and private," said Mr. Davidson in a statement emailed to The Wall Street Journal. "It's a very heavy lift for us."

Finance and human resources software developer Workday employed a team of five full-time accountants to review more than 6,000 contracts as it prepared for the new rule. The Pleasanton, Calif., company adopted the new standard early and changed its accounting on Feb. 1.

"The biggest surprise was how much work it was," said Robynne Sisco , the finance chief. The staff had to manually reallocate revenue between subscription sales and consulting fees. The work took six months to complete, she said.

As some companies adopt the new rule, they will also restate financials going back two years, forcing them to audit multiple years' worth of results. The simultaneous audits made the work even more challenging, said Ms. Sisco.

Adding to the pressure: the 2019 deadline for companies to begin reporting leases on their financial statements. The lease accounting rule will create another round of IT upgrades as corporations skim contracts to collect information on leases they have signed and bring them onto their financials.

"It's another big technology commitment," said Ms. Sisco.

China Bitcoin Exchanges Allowing Withdrawals Again

By Chao Deng

BEIJING Bitcoin exchanges in China are again allowing withdrawals of the virtual currency, having upgraded their systems in response to heightened government scrutiny.

It ends a three-month moratorium that began shortly after regulators launched an investigation into the exchanges and as they threatened to shut down ones that skirt the rules. Authorities were concerned bitcoin could be used to bet on a decline in the Chinese yuan, as well as to move money out of the country, evading controls on capital outflows.

China's three major bitcoin exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin of Beijing and BTCC of Shanghai, say they began allowing customer withdrawals last week.

Huobi and BTCC said they have updated their systems to verify client identities and guard against money laundering; OKCoin said it is continuing to "focus on" those issues to satisfy regulators.

Those were among the requirements in draft guidelines circulated to exchanges by the People's Bank of China this spring. The central bank is likely to circulate a more comprehensive set of regulations, according to people familiar with the matter. People at the exchanges say they haven't yet received formalized rules.

The three exchanges are China's largest, although yuan-denominated trading altogether accounts for only 6% of global volume. China accounted for the majority when trading volume was at its zenith.

The plunge in Chinese demand hasn't stopped the price of bitcoin from rocketing to all-time highs. Demand in Japan has soared since rules there established the virtual currency as a legitimate payment method.

One bitcoin was worth $2,597 as of Monday evening Beijing time.

Treasurers Weigh Investment Changes Amid European Money Market Fund Reform

By Nina Trentmann

The majority of European companies will consider changing their investment policies in response to new money-market fund rules and other regulatory changes, according to a survey by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co .

Nearly 60%, or 75 of the 129 European companies J.P. Morgan surveyed, said the new rules could result in changes to where they keep their cash. The group included 42 companies with cash assets exceeding $5 billion and 36 companies with between $1 and $5 billion in cash. Globally, J.P. Morgan surveyed a total of 378 companies, with assets under management totaling $1.2 trillion.

The Council of the European Union , one of the EU's main decision-making bodies, in May approved reforms that impose stricter liquidity requirements and limit redemptions on money-market funds. The new rules are expected to go into effect by the end of 2018 or in early 2019.

"Corporate treasurers are reevaluating their cash-decision making," said Jim Fuell, head of J.P. Morgan 's global liquidity sales unit. "While firms are still in the process of understanding the regulations, we expect there to be strong future investments in money-market funds," Mr. Fuell said.

Investors and corporations view these funds as an alternative to cash because, like a bank deposit, they can be quickly converted to cash. Around  1.2 trillion ($1.35 trillion) is currently invested in European money-market funds, according to the Institutional Money Market Funds Association.

The new rules prescribe mandatory liquidity fees, as well as redemption hurdles, or so called gates. These additional fees, in combination with the European Central Bank 's negative interest rate policy, are expected to make so called constant net asset value funds less attractive.

"The short term investment landscape will become more complex," Mr. Fuell said.

Corporate treasurers and investment managers at 44% of the companies surveyed said they needed more time before making changes to their investments. Meanwhile, 43% of companies said mandatory liquidity fees and redemption hurdles would be the most important factor in their decision making process.

A new category of funds, so called low-volatility net asset value funds, will likely attract significant amounts of corporate cash, Mr. Fuell said, as they are the most akin to the constant net asset value funds that are available now.

The changes in Europe are expected to be less dramatic than the reforms that came into effect in the U.S. in October 2016 because the liquidity fees and redemption hurdles apply to all money-market funds in Europe.

The U.S. rules triggered a rush of cash from prime funds   money-market funds that invest primarily in corporate debt securities   into U.S. treasury and government funds, which are not subject to liquidity fees and redemption hurdles.

Futures Trader Banned After Pleading Guilty to  Spoofing'

By Dave Michaels and Alexander Osipovich

WASHINGTON A former futures trader at Deutsche Bank AG was permanently barred from the industry after admitting he conspired to manipulate the price of gold and silver futures contracts.

David Liew, a trader who was based in Singapore, also pleaded guilty in federal criminal court in Illinois on Thursday to using illegal spoofing techniques from 2009 to 2012. Regulators and prosecutors have cracked down on spoofing, which involves sending fake offers intended to push prices in a direction that benefits the trader's other orders. Congress made it illegal through the 2010 Dodd Frank financial overhaul law.

Mr. Liew manually placed hundreds of orders on an electronic trading platform operated by CME Group Inc . that were intended to trick other market participants into altering their prices, according to a plea agreement in his criminal case. Mr. Liew coordinated with other traders at his bank and was taught by other metals traders at the bank how to spoof, according to court documents.

Mr. Liew carried out his trades on CME's Comex division, a major venue for precious-metals futures trading. In May, an average of about 289,000 of the flagship Comex gold futures contracts and 87,000 of the main Comex silver contracts changed hands each day, according to data on CME's website.

According to one chat cited by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , Mr. Liew told a trader at another bank that he "sold out &by just having fake bids." The CFTC said in its order that Mr. Liew pushed silver prices down to benefit the other trader's positions.

In another instance, the same trader asked Mr. Liew, "yo, can u help me push silver down?" Mr. Liew then helped accomplish that, triggering other customers' "stop loss" orders that are filled only when a price moves a predetermined percentage. Mr. Liew then bought back silver contracts at the lower price, cutting his exposure and generating a profit, the CFTC's order said.

A lawyer for Mr. Liew didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Neither court documents nor the CFTC's order identified Mr. Liew's employer, but people familiar with the matter said he worked for Deutsche Bank in Singapore.

The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015 that U.S. officials were investigating at least 10 major banks for possible rigging of precious-metals markets.

Mr. Liew was a junior trader who joined his employer in 2009 after earning his undergraduate degree. He started at the bank in its global analyst program and was later assigned to the metals trading desk.

The criminal charges to which Mr. Liew pleaded guilty this week carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to court documents.

The CFTC regulates futures trading in the U.S. and reached an agreement with Mr. Liew to ban him from trading commodities or futures. The CFTC's order didn't impose a fine on Mr. Liew because he cooperated with its investigation, indicating his information could be beneficial to regulators and prosecutors if they pursue other traders involved in the scheme.

Goldman's Venezuela Bond Trade Wasn't Reviewed by Top Execs

By Liz Hoffman

When a small brokerage firm contacted Goldman Sachs Asset Management last week offering to sell $2.8 billion of deeply discounted Venezuelan bonds, the response was a quick "yes."

Buying the bonds for pennies on the dollar was a no-brainer for fund managers in the unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., according to people familiar with the matter.

Internally, the purchase didn't receive heightened scrutiny. The two co-heads of the unit, GSAM, were informed only after the trade had been completed, the people said. The trade didn't reach Goldman's firmwide standards committee, which often vets deals that carry potential blowback, they added.

An ensuing uproar over that trade, which critics say extends a financial lifeline to Venezuela's embattled government, caught top executives at Goldman off guard, the people familiar with the matter said. In part, this was because asset management is viewed as a straightforward business not prone to controversy.

In the past, Goldman's image troubles have typically involved complex financial transactions involving its trading or banking businesses.

The incident shows how, a decade after the financial crisis, Goldman lives in a spotlight unique even on Wall Street. That is thanks to the public drubbing it took over financial-crisis-era actions, perceptions of political influence that have only increased with former executives in top spots of the Trump administration, and a knack for making money when others are losing it.

The Venezuelan imbroglio also highlights how the priority of the firm's asset-management business to make money for its fund investors can clash with Goldman's postcrisis push to view potential business with an eye toward protecting its reputation.

"How could you criticize a money manager for buying something so cheaply? That is what they do," said Diego Arria, a former governor of Caracas and former Venezuelan ambassador to the United Nations who disapproves of the bond deal. "But the perception is terrible."

In a statement earlier this week, Goldman said: "We recognize that the situation is complex and evolving and that Venezuela is in crisis. We agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will."

Goldman has been more sensitive to its public perception in recent years.

In 2010, after a government lawsuit accused the firm of defrauding mortgage-bond investors a suit it later settled for $550 million, agreeing it had made mistakes the bank formed a firmwide standards committee to reshape its business practices and mend its reputation.

Training sessions for employees, many of them run by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein , stressed the importance of protecting Goldman's standing in the eyes of clients and the public.

"Everyone has to have big eyes, big ears, know what's going on around them, and be policemen for the organization," Mr. Blankfein said at a 2012 training session. "At the end of the day, we only have one reputation. We rise and fall together."

Goldman has become choosier about taking on new business, executives say. It backed away last year from underwriting a Russian government bond under pressure from the U.S. State Department . It has shied away from some deals involving coal companies, concerned about backlash from environmental groups, and hasn't taken on investment-banking work for Venezuela in years.

Underwriting a stock offering for a company with murky financials or structuring a complex bet on mortgages carry obvious red flags. Those matters are often presented to senior management for final approval, according to people familiar with the firm's practices.

But those lines are less clear in Goldman's asset-management arm, which manages $1.3 trillion on behalf of pension funds, mutual funds and other big investors. As a so-called fiduciary, it is obligated to act in the best interests of its investors; portfolio managers are given wide latitude to buy and sell securities.

In the case of Venezuela, Goldman's portfolio managers who focus on emerging-market debt had been actively looking to buy the country's beaten-down bonds. They believed President Nicols Maduro would eventually be swept out of power and that the securities would rally, according to people familiar with the matter.

Yet the transaction drew a swift, public rebuke from opposition groups in Venezuela because the bonds had been held by the central bank, which reported an infusion of cash the day the deal was completed.

Meanwhile, the country's economy is in free fall, and street protests and food shortages are a daily occurrence.

Ironically, GSAM's value to Goldman is its steady-state nature: predictable fees, which have churned higher as assets under management have swelled.

Its share of the firm's total revenue has doubled since 2009 to 19%.

Now, the Venezuelan deal threatens to roil other businesses within the firm. Goldman bankers worry that aiding a widely disliked government will anger clients in the region, according to people familiar with their concerns.

Sunrun Opens Internal Probe into Alleged Manipulation of Sales Data

By Kirsten Grind

Executives at solar energy giant Sunrun Inc . have asked the company's board of directors to independently review claims by former employees that they were manipulating sales data around the time of Sunrun 's initial public offering.

According to a statement on its website, Sunrun made the request to its audit committee following a Wall Street Journal article published May 22.

The story quoted former employees saying they held back on internally reporting hundreds of customers who canceled their contracts for home energy systems during a roughly five-month period in the middle of 2015.

Sunrun didn't directly address the allegations at the time of the Journal's story, saying in a statement from Chief Executive Lynn Jurich it had "reviewed the digital audit trail in our systems" and "turned up no evidence that our employees changed cancellation dates in our systems to delay the reporting of cancellations."

In its new statement, the company said: "Sunrun 's executive team is committed to transparency and looks forward to taking any and all appropriate actions in response to the Audit Committee's eventual findings. We remain committed to doing what is right for our customers and shareholders at all times."

San Francisco, Calif.-based Sunrun , the largest publicly traded residential solar company in the U.S., and Tesla Inc .'s SolarCity Corp . are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for masking the number of customers backing out of contracts, the Journal has reported.

Sunrun has declined to comment on the investigation. SolarCity has said the company has focused on reporting the quality of its installed assets, not "pre-install cancellation rates." The SEC has declined to comment.

Citadel Securities Hires Barclays 's Electronic Equities Chief

By Alexander Osipovich

Barclays PLC 's head of electronic equities trading is leaving the bank to take one of the top jobs at giant electronic market-making firm Citadel Securities LLC .

Joseph Mecane will become Citadel's new head of execution services, a role in which he will oversee its business in equities, options and exchange-traded funds, Citadel said Friday. He is to start in September, a Citadel spokeswoman said.

Mr. Mecane joined Barclays in November 2014, five months after the bank was hit with a civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general, accusing it of misleading customers of its "dark pool" for off-exchange stocks trading.

A former New York Stock Exchange official, Mr. Mecane faced the task of mending relationships with Barclays clients. Barclays paid around $70 million last year to settle the suit and related litigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission , admitting violations of federal securities laws as part of the deal.

Citadel Securities trades stocks, bonds, options and currencies in markets around the world. It handles more than a third of U.S. retail equities orders, paying online brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade to execute their customer's orders and trade against them.

It was founded in 2002 by billionaire Ken Griffin , who also leads the Chicago-based hedge fund giant Citadel LLC , although the two businesses say they are operated independently.

The announcement of Mr. Mecane's hire comes two months after Citadel Securities said it had recruited Stephen Luparello, a key former SEC regulator, to join the firm as its general counsel.

House Speaker Ryan Backs Dodd-Frank Replacement Bill

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) throws his weight behind Republicans' replacement for the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law. The Financial Choice Act is expected to get a House vote next week. "It will rein in the overreach of Dodd-Frank that has allowed the big banks to get bigger while small businesses have been unable to get the loans they need to succeed," Ryan's statement says. The bill is likely to pass the House but analysts say it's dead on arrival in the Senate. (ryan.tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

Chinese Banks Don't Quite Look Like Lehman

Chinese regulatory tightening has pushed up funding costs for banks, but they are less vulnerable to a liquidity squeeze as they are primarily funded by deposits, says a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report. It highlights that deposits account for 80% of total funding for Chinese banks, while interbank borrowing--short-term instruments that allows banks to lend to each other--is less than 25%. In comparison, deposits accounted for less than 10% for Lehman back in 2007, while its interbank borrowing was more than 50%. Even interbank borrowings are backed up by bonds and certificate of deposits in China, while Lehman's were backed up by bonds as well as riskier assets like stocks and mortgage-backed securities.

DOJ Won't Ask Supreme Court To Review AmEx Case

The Justice Department said it won't ask the Supreme Court to review its antitrust case against American Express (AXP). A federal appeals court last September reversed a lower court ruling that said AmEx violated antitrust rules because it didn't allow stores that accept AmEx cards to encourage shoppers to use cheaper Visa (V) or Mastercard (MA) cards. The ruling was a win for AmEx because it meant merchants that accept its cards wouldn't be able to ask shoppers to use different cards. An AmEx statement says that the company "will continue to vigorously defend," the last court ruling. "We believe the DOJ's decision not to proceed sends a strong signal that this seven-year litigation should come to an end." (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

Australian Housing Sector's Trend Still Down

April's sequential increase in Australia new-home sales doesn't alter a weaker trend, says Commsec, contending the sector has peaked in terms of activity and is likely to be more subdued the next year. While acknowledging that overall new-home sales remain healthy, the firm says new regulatory clamps on mortgage lending and resultant tight lending standards will have a more-lasting impact on housing activity. Higher home prices and borrowing costs are making potential buyers more circumspect, adds Commsec. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

Chinese Companies Move Deeper Into Shadow Banking

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-companies-move-deeper-into-shadow-banking-1496574002" some companies to a murkier form of financing as it gets harder to secure bank loans or tap the bond market.

New loans from so-called trusts, firms that raise money from individuals and corporations to plow into riskier areas of the economy, reached 882.3 billion yuan ($129.5 billion) in the first four months of this year, according to data from the People's Bank of China , nearly five times as much as the same period in 2016. One area of concern for authorities as they tackle soaring Chinese debt is loans that banks disguise as investments. A shift to trust lending would make it even harder to gauge the true extent of credit in the system.

Applying Financial Regulation to Tech and E-Commerce Giants

Technology and e-commerce giants, with their large customer bases and capacity to leverage data from their primary businesses into financial services, pose challenges for financial regulators, according to "http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2017/06/01/techfins-and-the-regulatory-challenges-of-data-driven-finance/" at Columbia Law School. "How do these firms fit within the framework of financial regulation, and to what extent do their activities signal arbitrage opportunities and deficiencies in the current regulatory system?" they ask. They argue that the rise of these firms in the financial services realm "may be the single most important development in financial services since the 2008 global financial crisis," given that they are an entirely new kind of market participant, they are more efficient than other established financial intermediaries, and established thresholds for imposing financial regulation do not necessarily apply to them. They conclude that "financial data gathering and analytics should be regulated if they exceed a certain size."

Are All Analysts Created Equal?

New research finds that experience makes analysts better watchdogs, "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2517502" by finance professors Fei Xie, Daniel Bradley, Sinan Gokkaya and Xi Liu. Other studies have shown that industry experience improved analysts' earnings forecasts and stock recommendations, but the study by Prof. Xie and his colleagues zeroes in on an analyst's impact on things like the quality of firms' financial disclosures, CEO compensation and CEO turnover. "Our collective findings indicate that industry-expert analysts provide external monitoring of firm managers and improve corporate governance," the researchers write.

Weakening FSOC Raises the Odds of a Financial Crisis

Parallel efforts by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to pare back the role of the Financial Stability Oversight Council would reverse the progress that has been made toward addressing jurisdictional gaps in regulatory policy, "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-01/financial-regulation-calls-for-20-20-vision" for Bloomberg View.

Tracy's Take: A Big Financial Regulatory Week

Empty Seats at Federal Panels Bring Uncertainty

House Poised to Approve Dodd-Frank Replacement

Trump Considering Economist Marvin Goodfriend for Fed Board

Tech Teams Rush to Catch Up as New Accounting Rule Looms

Finding the Substance in a Big Financial Regulatory Week

Monday marks the start of a big week for financial regulatory nerds, with two moments that have been anticipated for months: a House vote on the Financial Choice Act and the release of the Trump Treasury Department's first financial regulatory policy recommendations.

Neither of these events heralds change in the near term. But in combination, they will give clues about how the continuing tug-of-war between different parts of team Trump is playing out in the financial sector.

The Choice Act, the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-approves-plan-to-undo-parts-of-dodd-frank-financial-law-1493916205" from Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), is expected to pass the House along party lines. The legislation isn't likely to become law. No similar proposal has been made by anyone in the Senate, and there is no indication that Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) is interested in considering it.

Mr. Hensarling, famous for his focus on winning the debate, will have scored some points in that regard. The House will have approved legislation embodying his view of a better bank regulatory system: one where firms that meet a tough 10% leverage capital ratio operate under significantly simpler and looser rules than they do today.

It isn't clear how much sway Mr. Hensarling and his fellow conservatives hold in the Trump administration. White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have praised Mr. Hensarling's work without offering a broad endorsement of specific policies.

The second event coming this week is the release, as early as Tuesday, of the Treasury Department's report on financial regulation, drafted in response to President Donald Trump's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-executive-actions-toward-scaling-back-dodd-frank-financial-regulation-1486148274".

It is conceivable that the report, coupled with inaction by the Senate, will leave Mr. Hensarling's plan to collect dust. Take the idea of a higher leverage ratio: Mr. Cohn, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., is already "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-cohn-in-his-own-words-on-financial-regulatory-policy-1481625001", and the big bank executives meeting with Treasury officials in recent months want the administration to make the leverage ratio easier to comply with, not harder.

How the Treasury report handles that issue and others will speak volumes about whether they favor Mr. Hensarling's approach, or whether they want to take a more centrist tack.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Empty Seats at Federal Panels Bring Uncertainty

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-seats-go-unfilled-on-federal-panels-businesses-face-uncertainty-1496589147" has added to the usual disruption triggered when power changes hands, and many commissions critical to business have empty seats, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission .

While some of the positions were unfilled even before Mr. Trump took office, left open by tradition for the next president to fill, they could remain empty for more months, making 2017 a year of prolonged uncertainty for businesses eager for clarity from regulators.

PRO SHORT: House Poised to Approve Dodd-Frank Replacement

House Republican leadership threw its support behind the GOP's replacement for the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, which the chamber is expected to approve along party lines by the end of the week. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) on Friday urged his colleagues to support the bill, which analysts say is unlikely to advance in the Senate. "It will rein in the overreach of Dodd-Frank that has allowed the big banks to get bigger while small businesses have been unable to get the loans they need to succeed," Mr. Ryan said. The plan would unwind major parts of Dodd-Frank by relieving healthy banks of some regulatory requirements and forcing failing firms through bankruptcy rather a liquidation process by the regulators. It would also repeal the Volcker rule restricting banks from speculative trading.

Trump Considering Economist Marvin Goodfriend for Fed Board

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-considering-economist-marvin-goodfriend-for-fed-board-1496443627" nominating Marvin Goodfriend, a former Federal Reserve economist and current Carnegie Mellon University professor, for a spot on the Fed's board of governors, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

As reported in April, Randal Quarles, a top Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, is expected to be nominated for another position on the Fed board, as its vice chairman for bank supervision. Both Mr. Goodfriend and Mr. Quarles have been critical of various aspects of the Fed's response to the financial crisis. The fact that both are under consideration suggests a willingness on the part of the Trump administration to rein in some of the Fed's ability to stimulate the economy in downturns and to take unprecedented action in a crisis.

Tech Teams Rush to Catch Up as New Accounting Rule Looms

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-teams-rush-to-catch-up-as-new-accounting-rule-looms-1496655003" from the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board is stressing finance staff and creating headaches for technology departments at some of the world's largest businesses.

For large corporations, the task is arduous and complicated: Accountants are scouring thousands of bills and contracts to determine if they must change how they book the sales for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15. Meanwhile, tech departments are writing new code, upgrading their systems and investing in expensive new software as they work to ensure their increasingly automated finance operations can keep up.

China Bitcoin Exchanges Allowing Withdrawals Again

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-bitcoin-exchanges-allowing-withdrawals-again-1496658845" are again allowing withdrawals of the virtual currency, having upgraded their systems in response to heightened government scrutiny.

It ends a three-month moratorium that began shortly after regulators launched an investigation into the exchanges and as they threatened to shut down ones that skirt regulations. Authorities were concerned bitcoin could be used to bet on a decline in the Chinese yuan, as well as to move money out of the country, evading controls on capital outflows.

Treasurers Weigh Investment Changes Amid European Money Market Fund Reform

"https://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2017/06/05/treasurers-weigh-investment-changes-amid-european-money-market-fund-reform/" will consider changing their investment policies in response to new money market fund rules and other regulatory changes, according to a survey by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co .

Nearly 60%, or 75 of the 129 European companies J.P. Morgan surveyed, said the new rules could result in changes to where they keep their cash. The group included 42 companies with cash assets exceeding $5 billion and 36 companies with between $1 and $5 billion in cash. Globally, J.P. Morgan surveyed a total of 378 companies, with assets under management totaling $1.2 trillion.

Futures Trader Banned After Pleading Guilty to  Spoofing'

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/futures-trader-banned-after-pleading-guilty-to-spoofing-1496424588" at Deutsche Bank AG was permanently barred from the industry after admitting he conspired to manipulate the price of gold and silver futures contracts.

David Liew, a trader who was based in Singapore, also pleaded guilty in federal criminal court in Illinois on Thursday to using illegal spoofing techniques from 2009 to 2012. Regulators and prosecutors have cracked down on spoofing, which involves sending fake offers intended to push prices in a direction that benefits the trader's other orders. Congress made it illegal through the 2010 Dodd Frank financial overhaul law.

Goldman's Venezuela Bond Trade Wasn't Reviewed by Top Execs

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldmans-venezuela-bond-trade-wasnt-reviewed-by-top-executives-1496411586" Goldman Sachs Asset Management last week offering $2.8 billion worth of deeply discounted Venezuelan bonds, the answer was a quick "yes," according to people familiar with the matter.

Buying the bonds for pennies on the dollar was a no-brainer trade for fund managers in the unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc . And, internally, the purchase didn't appear to receive heightened scrutiny. The two co-heads of the unit, GSAM, were informed only after the trade had been completed, people familiar with the matter said. The trade didn't reach Goldman's firmwide standards committee, which often vets deals that carry potential blowback, they added.

Sunrun Opens Internal Probe into Alleged Manipulation of Sales Data

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sunrun-opens-internal-probe-into-alleged-manipulation-of-sales-data-1496433996" Inc. have asked the company's board to independently review claims by former employees that they were manipulating sales data around the time of Sunrun 's initial public offering.

Sunrun said it made the request to its audit committee following a Wall Street Journal article published May 22. The story quoted former employees saying they held back on internally reporting hundreds of customers who canceled their contracts for home energy systems during a roughly five-month period in the middle of 2015. Sunrun and Tesla Inc .'s SolarCity Corp . are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for masking the number of customers backing out of contracts, the Journal has reported.

Citadel Securities Hires Barclays 's Electronic Equities Chief

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-securities-hires-barclayss-electronic-equities-chief-1496421634", Joseph Mecane, is leaving the bank to take one of the top jobs at giant electronic market-making firm Citadel Securities LLC . He will become Citadel's new head of execution services, a role in which he will oversee its business in equities, options and exchange-traded funds.

Mr. Mecane joined Barclays in November 2014, five months after the bank was hit with a civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general, accusing it of misleading customers of its "dark pool" for off-exchange stocks trading. A former New York Stock Exchange official, Mr. Mecane faced the task of mending relationships with Barclays clients.

Blockchain-related job adverts surge

The number of job adverts on LinkedIn for blockchain-related positions has more than trebled in the past year, illustrating how demand is booming for people with the skills to harness the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies.

Experts say demand for blockchain expertise is far outstripping supply, making it one of the hottest areas for technology recruitment. As thousands of blockchain-based start-ups are being created, established companies in many sectors from financial services to retail are scrambling to get to grips with what the new systems can do.

 Is there a talent bubble? Yes. We haven t even seen it yet,  said Jerry Cuomo, IBM s vice-president of blockchain technologies.  There is an entirely new way for businesses to interact   it is awesome and as this takes root it will be revolutionary. 

The best blockchain engineers can command a salary above $250,000, Mr Cuomo said.  It is on the high side of what a really talented consultant or software engineer can earn,  he added.  Demand is exceeding supply, so we are seeing shortages. It is up there with the cloud and artificial intelligence as a really hot area. 

Blockchains are a decentralised settlement technology that powers the issuance of cryptocurrencies such as "http://www.coindesk.com/price/", the value of which soared to more than $2,500 last week, up almost fivefold in the past year.

LinkedIn data requested by the Financial Times show there were more than 1,000 blockchain-related job adverts on the site last week, more than treble the level of a year ago. The number of blockchain ads is growing at more than 40 per cent each quarter.

Almost 10,000 people on LinkedIn list blockchain as a skill, half of them in the technology industry and a quarter in the financial services sector. LinkedIn does not include blockchain among its official list of skills, but so many people are citing it as a custom skill that the site is considering adding it to the ones it formally tracks.

 Professionals in related areas such as cryptography and machine learning may want to look at the roles available and the skills they need to develop, as there is certainly a growing demand within the technology, finance and insurance industries for blockchain expertise,  said Josh Graff, UK country manager at LinkedIn.

Blockchain technology has attracted renewed interest in the past few weeks thanks to virtual tokens being issued by companies to raise money via an  initial coin offering  as an alternative to selling shares.

In total, there are more than 850 different cryptocurrencies with a total market capitalisation above $92bn   more than Goldman Sachs, Ford or Nike   according to "https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/".

 It is a hot market at the moment because most of the large corporates want to be able to say they have a blockchain team,  said Michael Mainelli, who runs blockchain training courses for senior executives and boards at his consultancy Z/Yen.

The majority of the people listing blockchain as a skill on LinkedIn are based in the US, followed by the UK, France, India, Germany and the Netherlands.

 " Europe's financial watchdog moved to stop European countries from watering down rules governing the asset management industry in an attempt to win business from companies affected by the UK's Brexit vote.

The European Securities and Markets Authority warned that UK-based asset managers that want to continue to sell funds to European clients when Britain leaves the EU would need substance - or staff on the ground - in the countries where they base their funds.

The regulator said so-called delegation , whereby asset managers register funds in the EU but outsource investment decisions back to portfolio managers in London, would only be "possible under strict conditions".

 " Janus, the US fund house, and Henderson Global Investors, the UK asset manager, completed their all-stock merger to create a global investment company with $331bn in assets under management.

The new company is listed in New York and Australia, after Henderson delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Janus Henderson Group said the merger should deliver "compelling value for shareholders", with annual cost savings of $110m.

 " The London Stock Exchange bought Citigroup's fixed-income indices business, as the exchange bets that appetite for passive investment products will continue to grow.

In the first significant deal since the collapse of the exchange's proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Brse, LSE spent $685m to acquire the US investment bank's global bond analytics business, including the flagship World Government Bond index.

The acquisition will increase the assets under management of the LSE's FTSE Russell indexing franchise from $12.5tn to around $15tn.

 " The German financial regulator is trying to lure English-speaking asset managers to set up shop in the country in response to Brexit .

BaFin will run a workshop for asset managers about Brexit and Germany's fund market in June, where it will set out its position on regulating the asset management industry.

 " Investors have pulled more than $10bn from SPY, the world's largest exchange traded fund, so far this year, as a price war deepens in the passive fund industry.

The fund, also known as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, is from State Street, the US bank. It has lost out to its chief competitors, BlackRock iShares' IVV and Vanguard's VOO, which have sucked in $14bn and $7bn so far this year. SPY has assets under management of $230bn.

The number of job adverts on LinkedIn for blockchain-related positions has more than trebled in the past year, illustrating how demand is booming for people with the skills to harness the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies.

Experts say demand for blockchain expertise is far outstripping supply, making it one of the hottest areas for technology recruitment. As thousands of blockchain-based start-ups are being created, established companies in many sectors from financial services to retail are scrambling to get to grips with what the new systems can do.

 Is there a talent bubble? Yes. We haven t even seen it yet,  said Jerry Cuomo, IBM s vice-president of blockchain technologies.  There is an entirely new way for businesses to interact   it is awesome and as this takes root it will be revolutionary. 

The best blockchain engineers can command a salary above $250,000, Mr Cuomo said.  It is on the high side of what a really talented consultant or software engineer can earn,  he added.  Demand is exceeding supply, so we are seeing shortages. It is up there with the cloud and artificial intelligence as a really hot area. 

Blockchains are a decentralised settlement technology that powers the issuance of cryptocurrencies such as "http://www.coindesk.com/price/", the value of which soared to more than $2,500 last week, up almost fivefold in the past year.

LinkedIn data requested by the Financial Times show there were more than 1,000 blockchain-related job adverts on the site last week, more than treble the level of a year ago. The number of blockchain ads is growing at more than 40 per cent each quarter.

Almost 10,000 people on LinkedIn list blockchain as a skill, half of them in the technology industry and a quarter in the financial services sector. LinkedIn does not include blockchain among its official list of skills, but so many people are citing it as a custom skill that the site is considering adding it to the ones it formally tracks.

 Professionals in related areas such as cryptography and machine learning may want to look at the roles available and the skills they need to develop, as there is certainly a growing demand within the technology, finance and insurance industries for blockchain expertise,  said Josh Graff, UK country manager at LinkedIn.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- Monthly Monitor: U.S.-Stock Funds Rise, but Many Investors Look to Bonds

By William Power

There's an old Wall Street expression about long stock rallies: It's too early to leave the party, but stay close to the door.

Many investors seem to be following that approach. While the stock market continued to hit records in May -- boosting U.S.-stock mutual funds and ETFs by an average of 0.4% -- investors fear they've seen the best of the corporate-earnings gains that drove the market in the beginning of the year, and they are looking to the bond market and overseas instead.

"The whole 'reflation trade' is history," says Marc Chaikin, founder and chief executive officer of Chaikin Analytics in Philadelphia, referring to investors who had been selling bonds and buying stocks after the November election of Donald Trump. The bet was that the new president's expected moves to stimulate the economy would lead to higher inflation.

While stocks do continue to hover at highs, bonds have come back from that postelection selloff. Mr. Chaikin says, "In 20 of [the past] 21 weeks, money has been flowing into bonds. So that's pretty interesting since the assumption after the Trump victory is we'd be seeing money flowing out of bonds, and that hasn't been the case."

The stock-fund gains in May have left investors with a solid 6.4% year-to-date average return, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.

The bond-market rally boosted funds focused on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt (the most common type of fixed-income fund) by an average of 0.7% in May. The funds are now up 2.5% for the year to date.

The bond-fund buying has been intense despite the Federal Reserve's telegraphing of what it plans to do with rate increases. Another increase is expected in mid-June. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields, yet investors generally expect the Fed's increases to be gradual -- not generating a sharp rise in yields.

International-stock funds, meanwhile, rose 3.4% in May, and are up nearly 15% for the year to date. Many investors have followed the advice to park at least some of their portfolio in overseas stocks. The U.S. market's gains have often undercut that strategy. So far this year, though, the international diversification has paid off.

"Growth stocks [in the U.S.] performed very well last month, but value stocks were down -- in Europe everything was up across the board," says Mr. Chaikin. "Money is going into Europe. I call this a momentum trade because Europe has really outperformed since the beginning of the year -- France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. Fund money is chasing the European economy."

Markets
What Is Thematic Investing? It centers on identifying the ideas and trends that are most likely to reshape the economy for years to come

The world has changed, and through necessity so has the world of investing. That has given rise to something called thematic investing.

"Unfortunately, a lot of investors have built up expectations of investing returns based on the returns of the past," says Jay Jacobs, director of research at New York-based fund-management company Global X.

He points to slowing population and economic growth in the U.S. as part of the reason that investing returns in the future likely won't mirror those of the post-World War II period. "There's a growing mismatch between expectations and what is needed to reach retirement goals," he says. Put more simply, the investing ideas that worked in the past likely need to be reworked.

For some ultralong-term investors, that means looking for decadeslong themes with the potential to change the economy across traditional industry lines.

For example, now that people are living longer, aging likely will lead to "a more proactive approach to health and wellness," says Mr. Jacobs. For investors, that may mean looking for investments centered on what is expected to be the growing need and demand for specialty health services.

There also will be a huge transfer of wealth between the baby boomer generation and their children, the millennials, says Mr. Jacobs. Such a transfer will affect many industries, including tax planning, money management and real estate. The companies in those industries that can successfully woo millennials likely will do better than those that can't.

Then there is the introduction of disruptive technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and lithium-battery technologies, which is a theme that crosses a number of industries. Lithium is extracted by mining companies. It is used in the automobile sector for batteries and vital for powering smartphones. If the trend continues, resource companies that specialize in these specialty minerals stand to increase their profits, and investors that bet on them could enjoy gains.

Why Remote Work Can't Be Stopped; The proportion of Americans who only worked remotely rose to 20% in 2016 from 15% in 2012, Gallup surveys indicate

When Dell recently surveyed its 110,000 employees about their work habits, it discovered something surprising: While only 17% of Dell's employees were formally authorized to work wherever they prefer, 58% were already working remotely at least one day a week. That's good news, says Steve Price, chief human resources officer at Dell. In 2013, the company had said it wanted half its employees to work remotely for at least part of their week & by 2020.

In contrast, International Business Machines recently gave thousands of its home-based employees a choice: Start working at one of IBM's regional offices or "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-a-pioneer-of-remote-work-calls-workers-back-to-the-office-1495108802". IBM once boasted that 40% of its employees work outside traditional offices, it has its own in-house tools to facilitate remote work, and it regularly "https://www.ibm.com/blogs/smarter-workforce/2017/05/making-telework-work-insights-siop-2017/". Other companies that have reversed course on remote work include "https://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2013/02/25/at-yahoo-working-from-home-doesnt-work/", "http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/banking/article9200630.html" and "http://www.courant.com/business/hc-aetna-work-at-home-20161010-story.html".

Despite these moves by big companies, data indicates that the remote-work trend in the U.S. labor force is inexorable, aided by ever-better tools for getting work done anywhere. Surveys done by Gallup indicate that in 2016, the proportion of Americans who did some or all of their work from home was 43%, up from 39% in 2012. Over the same period, the proportion who only work remotely went to 20% from 15%. Amazon.com, American Express, UnitedHealth Group, and Salesforce.com allow employees to work remotely at least some of the time.

IBM"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-a-pioneer-of-remote-work-calls-workers-back-to-the-office-1495108802" it hasn't found remote work saves money. It also said the shift away from remote work isn't aimed at cutting costs though inevitably some employees leave as a result. Other companies, though, cite saving on rent among a variety of reasons for letting employees work remotely. They say it also improves employee satisfaction, helping retention and recruiting.

The larger truth is that nearly every company that employs knowledge workers is still learning which jobs can best be done remotely, as the tools to accomplish remote work become increasingly powerful.

Making the transition in a big company isn't easy, Dell's Mr. Price says. What is absolutely essential is getting everyone the right tools. This can be expensive and time consuming, even for companies whose primary purpose is building those tools.

To understand the issues, it's helpful to look at a company that has always been almost entirely remote. Automattic, maker of WordPress, the content-management system that "https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all", has 558 employees spread across more than 50 countries, up from 302 in December 2014.

Despite its growth, the company is getting rid of its custom-designed, light-filled, 14,250-square-foot office in a hip San Francisco neighborhood. On an average day, maybe five workers will show up, dwarfed by the cavernous space and nearly outnumbered by the ping-pong and foosball tables that mostly sit idle.

With teams that may be spread across a dozen time zones, Automattic relies on Slack for synchronous communication, Zoom for weekly video conferences and its own internal system of threaded conversations for documenting everyone's work and for major decisions.

When everyone is forced to communicate through these tools, no one is left out, says Mark Armstrong, whose site, "https://longreads.com/", was acquired by Automattic in 2014. "Everyone knows that feeling where you're the one on the conference call and everyone else is in the room together," he says.

A distributed workforce can have other benefits, says Julia Amosova, a "happiness engineer" at Automattic. The online communication required allows for radical transparency, since anyone in the company can search across all internal communications. "Most of the meetings were held behind closed doors at other places I worked at," she says. "I didn't have the same feeling of unity and inclusion."

Unless you're a pure software company like Automattic, being 100% remote probably isn't an option. Dell isn't planning to get any more of its employees working remotely, Mr. Price says. "Engineering, leadership, R&D, sales and customer support those are roles that don't lend themselves very well to remote work. Not everybody gets to do it." Roles where it does work include HR, legal, marketing, analytics, data science and other support functions, he adds.

For workers in an office, collaboration occurs naturally, says Jason Owen-Smith, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan who has studied collaboration and innovation at academic research institutions. His research indicates that for every 100 feet of overlap between the typical daily walking paths of people in a building, there's a 17% increase in the likelihood two researchers who have not previously worked together will collaborate on a new project and a 20% increase in the likelihood they will get their project funded.

In one building Dr. Owen-Smith and his team studied, the men's and women's restrooms were at opposite ends of the facility: Same-gender collaborations went up and mixed-gender collaborations were suppressed. Famously, at Pixar, Steve Jobs put the bathrooms in the center of the building, to force people to cross paths multiple times a day.

For remote workers, the communications tools they use daily are the equivalent of these common spaces. The canonical example, owing to its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/slack-scores-200-million-at-3-8-billion-valuation-1459533234", is the group-chat service Slack. It's designed to make it easy for employees to communicate in ways that aren't so different from the way they would around a water cooler or a conference table. Slack's playful features, like on-demand animated GIFs, make it good for collegial interaction, while its library of chatbots and integrations with other enterprise software make it useful as a hub for communicating about and controlling many aspects of a business.

What matters even more than the tools is the process that underlies them, says Jason Fried, co-founder and chief executive of Basecamp, which makes digital project-management and collaboration tools, and the author of "https://qz.com/59434/remote-jason-frieds-next-book-is-a-refutation-of-everything-marissa-mayer-has-said-about-remote-workers/". Everyone on a team, remote or not, has to be willing to participate in that process, or else someone will miss out on key information and decisions.

"You have to be committed to this digital transformation, and be ready to invest to do this well," says Dell's Mr. Price. "Otherwise you have a lot of morale issues, engagement issues and a bad cultural response."

What Does China's Tencent Want With Silicon Valley? The internet giant is pouring funds into a variety of ventures from electric cars to space tourism

HONG KONG In its quest to expand its global reach, Tencent Holdings Ltd. has quietly become China's top corporate investor in Silicon Valley, pouring money into everything from electric cars to moonshot ventures such as space tourism and asteroid mining.

Tencent's best-known investments "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-league-of-legends-the-chinese-giant-plotting-global-domination-1479636928" including "Clash of Clans" maker Supercell Oy of Finland and "League of Legends" maker Riot Games Inc. But the internet giant hasn't stopped there.

People close to Tencent, China's most valuable listed company with a market capitalization of $328 billion, say the approach reflects the company's desire to remain abreast of even the most far-fetched ideas and products out of Silicon Valley and its fear of missing out on the next big thing.

While several Chinese firms have jumped into hot areas such as artificial intelligence and driverless vehicles, Tencent hopes an active investment arm will offer a window into even more outside-the-box developments in Silicon Valley, people familiar with the company said.

The strategy underscores Tencent's broader ambitions after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-inescapable-tencent-adds-hollywood-movies-to-its-vast-walled-garden-1496312147" with its ubiquitous WeChat app which hasn't gained much traction overseas amid competition from the likes of Facebook Inc. The WeChat social-media platform boasted 938 million monthly active users in the first quarter, 23% more than a year earlier.

"If you want to be a top-10 corporation on a global scale and Tencent is already a top 10-type of corporation I don't think there is any aspect of technology that you should leave behind," said Sinovation Ventures's Chris Evdemon, of Tencent's U.S. approach. Mr. Evdemon is a partner at the venture-capital firm, which has made investments alongside Tencent.

Tencent's top U.S. executive, David Wallerstein, said the active U.S. investing presence is aimed at finding companies tackling big-picture problems. "I deliberately seek to push out on the frontier a little further than the other teams" in Tencent, he said.

Based in the southern Chinese technology hub of Shenzhen, Tencent competes on many fronts with China's two other tech giants, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. Each has ventured overseas as part of their appetite for growth outside China, though none has invested as aggressively in the U.S. as Tencent.

Since 2011, Tencent has invested in 41 tech startups in the U.S., joining fundraising rounds worth $3.5 billion. The figure excludes investments in public companies.

That makes it the second-biggest foreign investor in the sector behind only Korea's Samsung Group and tied for 11th biggest corporate investor overall, up from 18th four years ago, according to research firm CB Insights. Google parent Alphabet Inc. is at the top of the list.

In May Tencent reported a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tencent-posts-58-jump-in-first-quarter-profit-1495013756" and a cash pile of $4 billion.

Mr. Wallerstein, whose official title is "chief exploration officer," is a key figure in the company's overseas push. The California native joined Tencent in 2001 and spent more than a decade shuttling between China and the U.S. before settling full time at the company's U.S. headquarters in a converted church in Palo Alto, Calif.

People close to Tencent said Mr. Wallerstein and his team of roughly half a dozen executives take a hands-off approach after buying a stake, investing just a few million dollars at a time or less, typically alongside other big companies or well-known Silicon Valley investors.

"We get behind the founder and the executive team and help the company become the best company they can become," Mr. Wallerstein said. "We will work with the company to bring their technology to China when they're ready, but we do not push the company."

These investments differ from the handful of big-ticket stakes that Tencent has taken in the U.S. Those deals have been led by the company's China-based deals team, people familiar with the company said, and include its acquisition of Los Angeles-based Riot Games as well as its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tencent-buys-5-stake-in-tesla-1490702095" in Tesla Inc.

"Chinese companies are now wanting to go global more than ever before," said Connie Chan, partner at the Menlo Park, Calif., venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

Among recent investments, Tencent led a $10 million investment round in Academia.edu, a San Francisco-based company that operates a platform for scientists and academics to publish and review papers online.

Richard Price, the company's founder, said he hopes to give researchers an alternative to the longstanding model of publishing papers in physical journals. "Tencent itself as an organization has made its money through gaming," but it's venturing elsewhere, he said of the previously undisclosed investment.

Other smaller stakes include: a $3 million investment disclosed earlier this year in Innovega Inc., a Bellevue, Wash.-based company building an "augmented reality" device into a contact lens. A former Tencent executive now sits on the company's board, and Chief Executive Steve Willey says he plans to first launch the final product in China with Tencent's help.

Some of Tencent's early investments paid off big, like its investment in Snap Inc. in 2013, four years before the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-parent-snap-inc-files-for-ipo-1486071371". But not every investment has taken off.

Since 2014 the company has participated in $25 million worth of fundraising by Kamcord, a San Francisco social-media company. Kamcord has had ambitions to expand in Asia, but last year discontinued its live video-streaming service. Kamcord wasn't available for comment.

In March Tencent participated in a $900 million funding round for Grail Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., firm "https://www.wsj.com/articles/illumina-launches-firm-to-pursue-gene-based-cancer-blood-test-1452463200". Other investors in the round included Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co.

One investment that went further afield for Tencent: In 2015 it joined in a funding round for Planetary Resources Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/space-miners-scale-back-their-mission-1399497240" whose backers include Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, CEO and executive chairman, respectively, of Alphabet.

In an email, Planetary Resources CEO Chris Lewicki said there is "mutual respect for each of our pursuits whether it be mobile gaming or asteroid mining."

FT REPORT - ASIA-PACIFIC INNOVATIVE LAWYERS
Legal teams' technology pioneers

In-house Many company lawyers are already in the grip of fundamental change led by technology, writes Yasmin Lambert

While law firms are planning for their own roles to be transformed by technology, those changes are already taking hold in their clients' legal teams.

"Our customers are changing, and the whole business is changing, so legal also needs to change," says Rebecca Lim, general counsel at Westpac, the Australian banking group.

Some industries are feeling the pressure more acutely than others. The top four in-house teams in this year's Financial Times Asia-Pacific Innovative Lawyers report (see page 18) are drawn from financial services and ecommerce bus-inesses where technology is having a dramatic impact.

Technology is changing faster than the law and regulatory guidance in many cases. Much of the legislation covering banks, for example, was passed before recent technological innovations in the sector were even dreamt of. For instance, many customers now bank exclusively online and they expect the bank to connect the data it holds on them in order to provide a seamless service.

In response, Westpac plans to expand its legal, secretariat and compliance team over the year to around 300 people. In doing so, Ms Lim is bringing in new skills by hiring recruits who have not necessarily followed the traditional law firm career path.

Those who can combine the law and technology are in demand, as are those with experience in new crossover industries such as fintech and now "regtech" - regulation technology - which is designed to help companies' compliance teams. The bank is also improving the technology skills of existing lawyers, including teaching some of them to code.

The Lazada Group, one of the leading tech start-ups in the region, has changed at an even more rapid pace. Started by entrepreneurs in 2012, the Singapore-based ecommerce company has expanded into six countries, employs more than 6,000 staff, and has changed its business model to become a marketplace for third-party sellers. In 2016, Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce group, took a controlling stake in Lazada.

Jinesh Lalwani, who leads Lazada Singapore's legal team, says: "Because of the nature of our business, it doesn't work to have specialists, as every quarter we move into a new business. For example, last year we only sold physical products, whereas this year we have moved into digital goods."

The lawyers' jobs are made even more complex because the company's oper-ations cover Southeast Asia's vastly differing legal systems, governments, and six languages.

Adaptability and use of technology are essential to help the business scale up quickly. An electronic contracting process developed by the Lazada legal team, for example, allows the business to sign up between 200 and 250 new sellers a month in Singapore, which reduces the hours required from the sales team and lawyers.

A computer science intern is helping to develop new tools as well as automating further aspects of the lawyers' work.

Artificial intelligence and automation are becoming an important part of the in-house lawyer's toolkit but, as Westpac's Ms Lim points out, "all those tools come to full use only if you have a team with a culture to embrace change".

Chee Kin Lam, general counsel at DBS Bank in Singapore, is leading a programme to make legal and compliance "joyful" for lawyers and customers alike. Technology is central to this. The legal team is introducing an AI tool to automate negotiations over certain legal documents, which should reduce the time required by 20-50 per cent.

But Mr Lam says that the initiative is "not AI for the sake of AI. All artificial intelligence projects must start with process simplification, and must be about changing customer and client lives."

Cultural change is one of the three pillars in Rein Graat's programme for innovation at ING, the Netherlands-based banking group. Mr Graat moved from Europe to Singapore less than two years ago to take on the role of Asia-Pacific general counsel for the bank. He previously headed strategy and sales divisions within the bank, and so had different expectations of how lawyers can work.

Mr Graat says he is now particularly focused on measuring emotional intelligence. "It's all about how we empower our lawyers and ensuring we are focused and connected to the rest of the organisation."

In the near future, he says, lawyers will need to handle new challenges presented by distributed ledger technologies such as bitcoin, cyber security and data protection.

Mr Graat adds that automation and AI will affect not only the work lawyers do, but also how teams are structured, and how lawyers are trained and motivated. "If lawyers are not prepared for what lies ahead, we will struggle to remain relevant."

While technology is having a more visible effect on in-house legal teams, particularly in technology-driven sectors, law firms still play an important role.

Westpac turned to Gilbert+Tobin to run hackathons with the bank's lawyers and staff to develop technology products. IAG's in-house legal team drew on MinterEllison's expertise to run so-called design-thinking workshops to encourage creative problem-solving, while Link-laters is the creator and supplier of the AI technology Nakhoda, which DBS Bank is now developing for its own use.

The most effective combinations of technology and law require companies, law firms, technology suppliers and alternative legal services companies to collaborate in new ways. However, according to clients, the examples highlighted in this report are still too often the welcome exception rather than the rule.

Three Ways Investors Are Looking to Make Money in Japan; With the Nikkei closing at its highest since 2015, Japan has been a good place for stock investors to make money recently

TOKYO Despite its reputation as a laggard mostly well-deserved over the last quarter-century Japan has been a good place for stock investors to make money recently. The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stocks-in-japan-buzz-past-20000-mark-1496373263" on Friday to close at its highest level since August 2015.

What's driving the move? Here are three themes investors are pursuing.

Automation and aging society

Taizo Ishida is often asked about how Japanese companies came to be included in his Asia growth fund, a portfolio with stocks from countries like India, Malaysia and even Myanmar.

Mr. Ishida, portfolio manager for Matthews Asia, says it is because some companies focused on automation, robotics and health care have potential for growth by leveraging Japan's aging society usually seen as a factor depressing stock prices.

One of his picks is M3 Inc., which operates an online medical portal delivering information on drugs to doctors. The portal has helped pharmaceutical companies replace some human sales representatives. M3, which was 34%-owned by Sony Corp. as of March 31, is now expanding overseas.

"Whatever they produce" in Japan, "it is very applicable to the rest of Asia," says Mr. Ishida.

He says he's focusing on technologies that have sprung from the need to address an aging society and may now have applications outside Japan.

"The interesting stuff is that Japan has been doing this for 20-30 years. No one cared, not even the U.S. market, because they didn't need it," Mr. Ishida says.

Asian consumers

A tourism boom brought "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tourists-flock-to-japan-but-keep-their-wallets-closed-1484646244" last year, most of them Asian. When they go back home, they're helping to spread Japan's already-strong reputation for quality in the region, a trend that benefits some brands.

Aberdeen Asset Management's head of Japanese equities, Kwok Chern-Yeh, likes baby-goods company Pigeon Corp. because of its exposure to China and emerging markets and Asia. Pigeon is leveraging its Japanese research and development to sell everything from feeding bottles to infant nail clippers in Indonesia and Thailand. China is its most important market, accounting for 32% of companywide sales.

"Its profile is not very high among investors with broader mandates, but it's not a secret for those looking at Japan," says Mr. Kwok.

Lindsell Train, a London investment firm whose specialties include Japanese stocks, favors cosmetics company Shiseido Co. because of its "important foothold in China," the firm said in a note. Shiseido last year acquired U.S.-based makeup brand Laura Mercier, which has a growing presence in Asia including South Korea and Thailand.

Semiconductors

A "supercycle" surrounding Japan's semiconductor industry is under way driven by demand for servers and other storage devices, says Takashi Miwa, chief economist at Nomura Securities. "Japanese industry has a sort of advantage in that area," he says, observing that cybersecurity concerns and global use of big data are encouraging investment.

In recent days shares of semiconductor makers have surged. On Friday, Mitsubishi Electric Corp.'s shares climbed 5.5%. On Thursday, Tokyo Electron Ltd., which makes equipment for semiconductor factories, hit a fresh 17-year high. Its midterm plan calls for return on equity to rise to 20% to 25% over the next three years, from 15% to 20% previously.

IntercontinentalExchange on Thursday unveiled plans to scoop up Bank of America Merrill Lynch s fixed income indices in a move that will give the owner of the New York Stock Exchange a deeper foothold in the rapidly-growing indexing business.

The BofA global research platform encompasses more than 5,000 fixed income, currencies and commodities indices and represents the second-most used fixed-income gauges globally by assets under management, ICE said in a statement. After the deal, ICE s combined fixed income index business will benchmark almost $1tn in assets.

The platform will be re-branded as the ICE BofAML indices at the close of the deal.

 As the demand for independent indices rises, we are pleased to monetise this valuable set of benchmarks with a strategic owner,  said Candace Browning, head of global research at BofA Merrill Lynch.

ICE s deal comes just a day after Citigroup said it "https://www.ft.com/content/f527f860-0370-32b4-9b3b-d2385c5e72b3" its global bond analytics business to the London Stock Exchange for $685m. The terms of the BofA-ICE deal were not disclosed.

The rapid growth of the passive investment industry has been a major boon to the indexing business, since exchange-traded products generally track particular indexes. In fact, ETF providers are mulling over "https://www.ft.com/content/e20327d8-3b05-11e7-821a-6027b8a20f23" of creating an industry co-operative to create indices that would compete with traditional providers in a bid to lower costs.

Pace of digital disruption surprises; Technology: Internet trends

Meeker says healthcare is ripe for upheaval, with India on the cusp of an online explosion

A new phase of global competition has broken out between a handful of massively wealthy US and Chinese internet companies - with consumers and businesses the beneficiaries of their services.

That, at least, is the view of Mary Meeker , the former US internet analyst who is still most closely associated with the dotcom boom of the 1990s. Since leaving Wall Street for Silicon Valley seven years ago to join venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, her annual analysis - in more than 200 slides - has become a widely used reference on the global state of the internet.

After what she calls "an epic half-decade" of expansion and stock market appreciation, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have emerged as the world's five most valuable companies. Two Chinese internet companies - Alibaba and Tencent - have also broken into the top 10.

The rise of this handful of internet giants has stirred worries among regulators and other industries that have not yet felt the touch of digital disruption. But, according to Ms Meeker, the concerns fail to take into account the rivalry that has engulfed the internet companies as they move out of their initial markets and on to each other's turf.

"People don't spend enough time looking at how intense the competition is," she says in an interview with the Financial Times. "The bet here is: we can't stop progress. Are we better off or worse off? So far, the data implies we are better off."

The picture of growing global dominance emerges from Ms Meeker's latest slideshow, published yesterday. Referring to how online activity is reshaping markets spanning retail to transport, she says: "The pace and breadth of global change is happening at a pace that is faster than I would have anticipated."

In the US, for instance, growth in online advertising and ecommerce has accelerated again since earlier this decade, with advertising revenues up 22 per cent last year and ecommerce up 15 per cent. Global online ad spending, at nearly $200bn, is forecast to exceed TV advertising for the first time this year.

The disruption is deeper than the numbers suggest. In ecommerce, the adoption of technologies such as geolocation and machine learning are "changing retail at what is probably an accelerating rate". And the collection of data on a mass scale is about to have a profound impact. Ms Meeker's tip for a sector on the cusp of upheaval: healthcare, where regulations and barriers to sharing data have slowed innovation, but which she now says is ripe for change.

Despite Ms Meeker's optimism about competition, however, the picture that emerges from her global snapshot also shows the effects of increasingly heavy concentrations in some digital markets.

Google and Facebook, for instance, accounted for 85 per cent of online advertising in the US last year, up from 76 per cent a year before. In the media world, Ms Meeker estimates that Spotify has already secured 20 per cent of global music revenues, and Netflix 30 per cent of home entertainment revenue in the US. These digital-first companies reflect a trend towards increasingly personalised services, she says: "It speaks to the power of the algorithms and the data. It improves pricing for users and consumer satisfaction."

Future competition between the digital giants is likely to take place on the global stage. The internet markets in China and India have each reached a scale where they are poised to have a strong beneficial impact on their economies, Ms Meeker says. Their mobile payment infrastructures, for instance, put both countries "in an enviable position relative to the rest of the world". And thanks to its national identity scheme, Aadhaar, and the spread of low-cost bandwidth, India is on the brink of an explosion of digital services.

With so much to play for, that has already made India "a global priority" between US and Chinese companies. American companies such as Amazon are approaching new markets such as this more aggressively, she says.

But even if competition becomes increasingly fierce between the digital giants, will it create a new global oligopoly? After more than two decades watching the rise of internet leaders, Ms Meeker says she is "highly confident" new categories of activity will emerge, with new groups set to dominate them - much as Uber and Didi Chuxing have come to dominate ride hailing.

But at least one thing has changed. "What is different this time is these global players," she concedes. "They have CEOs who have the ability to see around corners - and they will continue to make acquisitions."

Hiring at private U.S. employers increased last month at the fastest pace since 2014, another sign the nation's labor market remains strong.

Firms across the country added 253,000 workers to their ranks in May, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected an increase of 180,000.

The April total was revised to 174,000 from 177,000. The ADP report is based on private payroll data in addition to government data.

"The current pace of job growth is nearly three times the rate necessary to absorb growth in the labor force," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "Increasingly, businesses' number one challenge will be a shortage of labor."

ADP's report comes ahead of Friday's employment situation report. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to report an increase of 184,000 in May payrolls, down from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economy-adds-a-robust-211-000-jobs-in-april-1493987658". Unemployment is expected to hold steady at 4.4%.

No Furloughs Envisioned at CFTC

In late 2013, after going without a significant funding increase for several years, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission furloughed staff to help stretch its limited resources. But even as a similar budget crunch looms this year, a senior adviser to J. Christopher Giancarlo, the CFTC's acting chairman, said no furloughs are coming this time.

Despite closed-door chatter among some former CFTC officials about prospects of additional furloughs or even layoffs ("reductions in force," in the parlance of federal appropriations), such moves aren't on the table, according to Michael Gill, Mr. Giancarlo's chief of staff.

"Talk of furloughs is nonsense," Mr. Gill said in an interview, adding the CFTC will "methodically prioritize the agency's responsibilities" to avoid furloughs should Congress keep the commission's funding flat. If Congress does decide to hold the regulator's funding steady for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, it would be the fourth straight year the CFTC's budget totals $250 million.

The comments by Mr. Gill mark a significant change in tone from the Obama administration, when CFTC officials consistently warned that budget constraints would disrupt "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-delays-cases-shelves-probes-in-funding-squeeze-1383249845" and led the commission to furlough staff. In late 2013, all CFTC employees were required to take three or four days of unpaid leave during a narrow window.

To be sure, Mr. Giancarlo is seeking additional resources for the top U.S. regulator of swaps. While the White House has asked for the commission's funding to stay steady, Mr. Giancarlo "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-regulator-requests-modest-budget-increase-1495555200" from Congress that he said is needed for the agency's growing examination responsibilities as well as a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-rolling-out-a-fintech-innovation-office-1495049488", among other priorities. The commission's status as an agency independent of the White House allows it to make a budget request that is different from the Trump administration's.

But Mr. Giancarlo views changes in the commission's staffing levels as part of a long-term rethinking of the agency's mission and priorities, Mr. Gill said. That process, which could eventually lead to buyouts, is driven not by short-term factors such as annual appropriations, but more by the fact that the CFTC's mission should change as it moves from crafting postcrisis regulation to implementing and enforcing such rules.

"An agency staffed to write rules for the swaps market may be different than the skill set to monitor and enforce those rules," Mr. Gill said. "But that is an organic change and a different discussion than furloughs or layoffs."

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

EU Sets Guidelines for Members Luring London Finance Firms After Brexit

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine

BRUSSELS The European Union 's securities watchdog is moving to prevent national governments using differences in regulations across the bloc to lure business forced to relocate from London because of Brexit.

The Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority released Wednesday nonbinding guidelines for national regulators on handling financial firms moving from the U.K. to stay in the EU's single market.

The guidelines address a growing conflict: competition among the remaining 27 EU countries to lure banks, asset managers, and insurers in a bid to bolster local economies and amplify national prestige.

"The EU27 have a shared interest in building a common approach to dealing with relocating firms," said ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor. He said firms moving from the City of London need to be subject to the same standards of supervision across the bloc to avoid regulatory competition among remaining member states.

ESMA set out nine guidelines that national authorities should apply before granting licenses to firms seeking to relocate. Under the conditions, ESMA warned that obtaining authorization takes time and urged companies to start the process "as early as possible."

One concern among EU regulators is that U.K. firms will set up shell or "letterbox" entities on the continent to retain market access. ESMA said so-called delegation arrangements in which firms could keep substantial business in the U.K. had to be strictly supervised.

As such, the watchdog calls for national supervisors to scrutinize the number of staff located in branches and to reject requests where the majority of business would be handled outside of the EU.

ESMA said companies should expect to relocate executives, and that authorities should ensure such senior managers "work there to a degree proportionate to their envisaged role, if not on a full-time basis."

Since March, Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU financial services chief, has expressed concern over divisions and suspicion among the EU27 as they compete to lure business.

The bidding war among countries to host the London-based European Banking Authority , the bloc's top financial regulator, is one example of continental competition for the spoils of Brexit.

EU officials said they have heard criticisms from some EU countries that others were offering lax enforcement of rules to make their jurisdictions more attractive to banks and financial institutions looking to stay in the bloc.

In response, ESMA warned national authorities against handing out licenses "where the activity carried out indicates clearly that the entity has opted for the legal system of a member state for the purpose of evading the stricter standards in force in another member state."

While the guidelines are nonbinding and not enforceable, ESMA said it would undertake peer reviews of national authorities, and initiate investigations of possible breaches. The watchdog also plans to create a forum where national authorities share information on businesses looking to move to the bloc.

The ESMA guidelines are in line with the European Central Bank . ECB executive board member Sabine Lautenschlger said in March that the bank's supervisory arm wouldn't accept empty shell companies.

Federal Reserve Fines Deutsche Bank

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTON The Federal Reserve fined Deutsche Bank AG $41 million for "unsafe and unsound" anti-money-laundering practices on Tuesday, the latest in a series of fines for the lender.

The Fed said that Deutsche Bank 's U.S. banking operations had failed to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money-laundering laws.

"We are committed to implementing every remediation measure referenced in the Fed's order and to meeting their expectations," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said.

Deutsche Bank in April was fined a combined $156.6 million by the Fed for deficiencies in its foreign-exchange trading, as well as failure to maintain a compliance program for the Volcker rule, which puts limits on proprietary trading by banks.

Additionally, Deutsche Bank was fined $425 million by the New York Department of Financial Services in January for money-laundering violations involving its Moscow branch.

Steven Cohen 's Hedge-Fund Comeback Shoots for a Record Target: $20 Billion

By Rob Copeland

Steven A. Cohen was once at risk of being banned for life from the hedge-fund industry. Now he is planning a comeback with ambitions to raise more money than he ever has before.

Mr. Cohen's goal is to amass $20 billion once he gets back in the business as early as next year, he and his representatives have said in conversations with bankers, colleagues and potential investors. That would likely include his family fortune of $11 billion.

The new target would blow past the $16 billion managed at peak by Mr. Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors LP , one of the most profitable hedge-fund firms in the U.S. before it pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading charges in 2013.

The comeback plan is a defiant and even improbable show of resilience for a Wall Street veteran long under a legal cloud. Some potential investors told The Wall Street Journal they would contribute to the new operation.

"This is extraordinary evidence of a new weakness in standards," said John Coffee, a securities-law expert and professor at Columbia Law School. "I'm afraid he'll find a lot of clients. He was very successful."

Government investigators convicted eight of SAC's onetime employees on criminal charges related to insider trading, though two of the convictions were later overturned. Mr. Cohen was investigated extensively, but a criminal probe closed without any charges.

The Securities and Exchange Commission sought to have him barred for life from the securities industry for failing to supervise employees involved in insider trading. A civil settlement he reached with regulators instead restricted him from serving as the supervisor of a registered fund until 2018. He didn't admit or deny wrongdoing as part of the civil settlement.

Mr. Cohen, 60 years old, has been overseeing his family money at Point72 Asset Management LP , a 1,000-employee operation in SAC's former Stamford, Conn., offices where Mr. Cohen's desk sits at the center of the trading floor. While Point72 has made money since becoming a family office, last year its overall investment performance was roughly flat, Mr. Cohen's second-worst ever annual showing, people familiar with the matter said.

The largest U.S. hedge-fund launch in history was $11 billion, according to industry publisher Absolute Return.

To reach the target of $20 billion in a new fund, according to these people, Mr. Cohen is prepared to do what was once unimaginable: lower his once legendary high fees. SAC at one time commanded some of the highest fees in the hedge-fund world as steep as a 3% annual management fee and 50% cut of all trading profits.

But his new firm is likely to launch with a so-called pass-through arrangement, people familiar with the plans said. Under the relatively uncommon structure, recurring expenses are paid directly by investors instead of the fund firm.

The performance fee, or cut of trading profits, is likely to fluctuate. The highest charges would be levied only when the firm has a banner stretch of investment gains, some of the people said. SAC, along with most of its peers, charged the same percentage fees on any positive investment performance.

Discussions around the new operation are ongoing and may change.

Mr. Cohen, who grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., the son of a dress manufacturer and piano teacher, started SAC Capital with $25 million in 1992. He earned a reputation for taking advantage of short-term stock moves, success that made the firm long a target of law-enforcement authorities.

Mr. Cohen is forging ahead during a time of distinct challenges for the hedge-fund industry, which in 2016 suffered its highest amount of withdrawals since the last financial crisis. Investors pulled $70.1 billion, according to industry research firm HFR, the most since 2009.

Over the last year, Mr. Cohen and his representatives have taken steps to prepare for his possible return to the hedge-fund world.

In 2016 Mr. Cohen formed a nearby separate company, Stamford Harbor Capital, run by one of his longtime deputies. Because Mr. Cohen has no direct management role in Stamford Harbor, according to filings, the firm is permitted to make preparations to start a hedge fund that could later be rolled into Point72. The terms of Mr. Cohen's SEC settlement don't allow him to supervise any funds that manage outside money until next year.

Stamford Harbor in recent months has been recruiting investor relations staff to liaise with outside investors, as Mr. Cohen's advisers weigh whether to use the firm to start a fund, people close to him say.

In January, Mr. Cohen appeared at a New York gala to benefit Lincoln Center before a crowd of other industry executives and hedge-fund investors. On the dais Ilana Weinstein, a headhunter and friend of Mr. Cohen, teased him about a lack of interests outside of investing.

"What artistic talents exist?" she asked. He responded, "I'm pretty sure nothing."

Then earlier this month Mr. Cohen, a pair of Point72 internal recruiters and his chief of staff flew on his private jet to Las Vegas for a series of appearances at the hedge-fund conference SALT, according to people familiar with the matter.

He hosted a private dinner for staff and industry executives and attended closed-door events with speakers and sponsors including onetime rivals like hedge-fund manager Daniel Loeb , people familiar with the matter said. He also attracted a small crowd of onlookers on the Bellagio casino floor while gambling at a craps table, these people said.

The last time he attended the confab was 2011, two years before SAC's guilty plea.

A former bond saleswoman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and honest-services wire fraud Tuesday, acknowledging she gave free trips and other perks to a one-time New York state pension fund manager in exchange for steering more trading business to her firm.

Deborah Kelley, a broker and former managing director at Sterne Agee, was charged with securities fraud, honest-services wire fraud, conspiracy to obstruct justice and other crimes. "I recognize that what I did was wrong," Ms. Kelley, 59 years old, said in federal court in Manhattan. "I apologize to the court and my family."

Ms. Kelley, who is set to be sentenced in September, faces up to five years in prison.

Tuesday's hearing hit a roadblock when Judge J. Paul Oetken asked Ms. Kelley if she understood what she had done was illegal. She said she knew she was breaking the rules of her former firm and the state pension fund, but balked at the word illegal.

This led to a brief conference between her lawyer and prosecutors, followed by a longer break as she and her legal team conferred in a nearby jury room. When the hearing resumed, Ms. Kelley responded that she knew her actions were wrong.

The pause highlighted the challenges in defining what Wall Street sales practices are illegal, and what merely violated firms' rules or industry standards. While regulators have cracked down on instances where stock and bond salespeople lavished excessive gifts and entertainment on their clients, there are gray areas.

In December 2016, federal prosecutors accused Navnoor Kang, the state pension fund's former portfolio manager, of steering more than $2 billion in business to the firms of Ms. Kelley and Gregg Schonhorn, another broker, in exchange for bribes. Mr. Schonhorn pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal prosecutors.

"The hard-earned retirement savings of New Yorkers should not be a vehicle for corrupt pension administrators and securities brokers to profit," Joon Kim, the acting Manhattan U.S. attorney, said in a statement Tuesday.

An attorney for Mr. Kang, who has pleaded not guilty, didn't respond to a request for comment Tuesday. After the hearing, Ms. Kelley's lawyer declined to comment.

Prosecutors described the arrangement as a quid-pro-quo bribery scheme in which, from 2014 to 2016, Mr. Kang awarded business to the brokers in exchange for perks such as watches, vacations, strippers and cocaine.

Ms. Kelley paid for a ski trip to Utah, which included cocktails and ski lessons for Mr. Kang and his then-girlfriend, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said the retirement fund's domestic-bond transactions to Ms. Kelley's firm increased from zero in the fiscal year ending in March 2014 to $179 million in the fiscal year ending in March 2016.

Ms. Kelley was fired after she submitted expenses related to benefits Mr. Kang received, and the firm's report to regulators triggered a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.

In the indictment against Ms. Kelley and Mr. Kang, prosecutors alluded to other, unnamed parties who had allegedly bribed the former pension manager.

Stifel Financial Corp ., another securities firm, acquired Sterne Agee in 2015. A Stifel spokesman has said the firm "responded appropriately to the circumstances" surrounding Ms. Kelley, and reported what they knew about her actions to the SEC. Nevertheless, the New York State Common Retirement Fund ceased all trading with Stifel and FTN Financial, where Mr. Schonhorn worked, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year.

The New York State Common Retirement Fund is the third largest pension fund in the country, according to the state comptroller's office, which administers the fund. As of March 31, the fund had $192 billion in assets.

Wells Fargo Reinstates Three Executives at Chicago Wealth Branch

By Michael Wursthorn

Wells Fargo & Co . is reinstating three senior executives in Chicago who were suspended amid allegations they inappropriately steered business toward certain individuals in its private-banking unit, after an internal investigation found no disciplinary action was warranted.

The executives, Chip Flannagan, a senior vice president and regional managing director for the bank's Chicago private-banking operations, and senior vice presidents Scott Landau and J. Scott Voigt will resume their responsibilities on Wednesday, a bank spokeswoman said. Wells Fargo 's private-banking employees in Chicago were informed of the decision Tuesday.

Messrs. Flannagan and Landau didn't immediately return phone calls or emails seeking comment, while Mr. Voigt didn't respond to an email regarding the investigation's conclusion.

The San Francisco bank last month suspended the three executives to investigate complaints raised by employees as to whether they steered Wells Fargo clients toward certain individuals within the private-banking unit and away from other employees, such as brokers who may have been better suited to handle certain clients.

The bank was concerned that sales goals were taking precedence over the needs of clients, people familiar with the matter said. Meeting such goals also allowed certain employees to collect bonuses, those people said.

While the weekslong investigation found no cause for further suspension or dismissal, the bank found that there were misunderstandings internally over how private-banking teams are set up to serve clients, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Wells Fargo 's private bank relies on teams to serve clients who have at least $1 million to invest. A so-called relationship manager acts as the go-between for the client and the rest of the team, which can include a broker from Wells Fargo Advisors , an investment strategist and someone who focuses on insurance, among others.

The bank is focusing on ensuring employees within the private bank understand how those teams are structured, how they are expected to serve clients and how their compensation works, said the person.

Although the allegations weren't related to the bank's sales-practice scandal, the controversy helped fuel Wells Fargo 's Chicago investigation, people familiar with the situation said.

"Wells Fargo takes concerns raised by our team members very seriously," the bank's spokeswoman said. "Our leaders in Chicago are committed to building a strong team culture, and they're focused on the important work of serving our clients every day."

Financial Risks Like "Constantly Mutating Viruses", Says Liikanen

The global financial system has become safer after the financial crisis, but there are risks that new, nastier problems could emerge, said Erkki Liikanen, head of Finland's central bank . Speaking at a conference in Vienna, he said "risks threatening stability are like constantly mutating viruses. They often become more virulent when reacting to medication" developed to fight earlier diseases. Switching to an ice hockey metaphor, he said that the challenge of financial regulation is "to skate in the direction of where the puck will go next, not where it is now."

Bail-Ins and the Real Economy

The collapse of Portuguese lender Banco Esprito Santo SA was one of the first tests of postcrisis efforts to make shareholders and bond investors bear the brunt of the costs of bank failures, rather than taxpayers. "http://voxeu.org/article/bank-bail-effects-credit-supply-and-real-economy", Thorsten Beck, Samuel Da-Rocha-Lopes, and Andre Silva write that the "bail-in" did have some negative consequences for the Portuguese economy, as investment slowed and businesses that had previously been clients of the bank held on to their cash. "While immediate panic and contagion effects were ...avoided, resolution of a failing bank, however well done, may not completely eliminate negative effects on the real economy," they write. "This being the first bail-in event in Portugal and one of the few yet around the world, it remains to be seen whether firms exhibit different behaviour in future occasions. Then again, failures of large banks are not necessarily frequent events, so the reaction to this specific bail-in might very well be representative."

Dodd-Frank Continues to Strain Lending

The regulatory burden from the Dodd-Frank Act continues to hinder banks from lending to consumers and businesses, writes American Bankers Association President "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-nichols-dodd-frank-reforms-banks-20170529-story.html". The compliance burden from Dodd-Frank has forced community banks to approve fewer mortgages or end their mortgage lending businesses altogether, he writes. While banks have posted strong profits of late, Mr. Nichols argues "the topline profit figure doesn't tell the whole story. Increased regulatory compliance costs limit bankers' ability to reach underserved communities." House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling's (R., Texas) Financial Choice Act would alleviate many of these pressures, Mr. Nichols argues.

Supreme Court Should Settle SEC Tribunal Case

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering whether administrative law judges at the Securities and Exchange Commission are unconstitutional, though the case may be better served being settled by the Supreme Court, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bureaucracys-judges-1496186395". The D.C. appellate court looks favorably on government regulatory and prosecutorial power, the editorial board says. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals heard a similar case and ruled that the administrative law judges are unconstitutional. The editorial board agrees with Judge Scott Matheson, who wrote that the Founders would never have tolerated administrative judges. "The Founders limited the appointment power to keep government accountable to voters," the board says. "Even if the full D.C.

LSE to buy Citi's bond indices arm for $685m; Financial services

Exchange seeks to bolster operations after failure of Deutsche Brse tie-up

The London Stock Exchange has snapped up Citigroup's global bond analytics business for $685m in the first significant deal since the collapse of the exchange's proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Brse.

The exchange said it would acquire the US investment bank's fixed-income indices, including the dominant World Government Bond Index, and its "yield book" platforms, which provide data on bond indices. The acquisition is a bet that appetite for passive investment products , which track indices, will continue to grow.

The deal would increase the assets under management of the LSE's FTSE Russell indexing franchise to about $15tn from $12.5tn currently, the company said.

It reflects a broader move by exchanges to diversify from trading services - in LSE's case, towards the higher-margin data and indices business. The exchange is looking to strengthen some of its operations after its failed merger with Deutsche Brse, which collapsed because of EU antitrust concerns about three months ago.

"The acquisition represents a significant step for FTSE Russell to acquire a world-class fixed-income analytics and index business, enhancing our ability to provide customers with broader multi-asset capabilities and a deeper data and analytics offering," said Mark Makepeace , group director of information services and chief executive of FTSE Russell.

For Citi, analysts said the bond analytics business was fairly small and they expected the bank to focus elsewhere.

"Management feel it will matter more to the LSE and ensure they get the attention they need," said Chris Wheeler at Atlantic Equities. "Citi is in investment mode . . . They have their first investor day in years in July and will want to paint the picture of a much more streamlined business now seeking to grow revenue as well as returning excess capital."

The LSE said it expected the acquisition to deliver an additional $30m in revenues in the first three years and cost savings of around $18m over the same period. It expected to complete the deal, which is subject to regulatory clearance, in the second half of the year.

In 2016, the newly acquired businesses generated revenues of $107m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $46m, according to LSE estimates.

The London exchange has been moving into the US capital markets business since it bought Frank Russell Company, an index compiler and asset manager, in 2014 for $2.7bn. In 2016, information services revenues accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the group's total revenues. For capital markets activities, that share was around 24 per cent.

Peter Lenardos, analyst at RBC Europe, said the deal was a "clever transaction" by LSE to move further into the "higher growth, higher margin and higher multiple" indexing business.

Vista Equity Seeks Buyer for Fleet Software Company Omnitracs; Private-equity owner has hired Evercore, Atlas Technology to advise on potential sale

Fleet management software maker Omnitracs LLC has retained investment banks to explore a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company, which is backed by technology-focused private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners Management, expects to generate about $115 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and approximately $400 million of revenue in 2017, the people said. Based on the company's scale and growth trajectory, it could be valued at nearly $2 billion, several people added, though one person said the valuation could be higher.

Investment banks Evercore Partners Inc. and Atlas Technology Group are advising Omnitracs, the people said. Although the sale process is in its early stages, Omnitracs is attracting interest from both financial and strategic buyers, the people added.

Vista Equity Partners acquired the Dallas-based company from chip maker Qualcomm Inc. for about $800 million in November 2013. Under the private-equity firm's ownership, Omnitracs purchased Roadnet Technologies Inc. and XRS Corp. To expand its offerings, Omnitracs also has formed partnerships with other automotive-focused software companies, including Peloton Technology and Drivewyze Inc.

The company, which moved its headquarters to Dallas from San Diego in 2015, last year named Sarah Hagan as its new chief financial officer.

Founded in 1985, Omnitracs provides software that offers fleet management, routing and predictive analytics services for the transportation industry. Its customers include commercial and for-hire vehicle fleets.

The telematics sector in which Omnitracs operates has been an active landscape for private-equity deals as firms seek to consolidate what has traditional been a fragmented industry. Last year, for instance, Chicago-based GTCR purchased video telematics company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0120160218ec2ihx55q", while Abry Partners completed a majority recapitalization of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/main-street-exits-investment-in-sambasafety-1462893950", which operates as SambaSafety.

Austin, Texas-based Vista Equity Partners invests across software, data and technology-enabled businesses. The firm in early May closed its largest-ever buyout fund at nearly $11.1 billion, WSJ Pro Private Equity "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-equity-goes-big-with-11-billion-tech-focused-buyout-fund-1494244800".

Earlier this week, the firm "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-to-buy-software-makers-xactly-and-lithium-1496167674"Lithium Technologies Inc. for an undisclosed sum and Xactly Inc. for about $564 million.

LSE, Citi in Deal for Indexes, Analytics  Services

LONDON -- London Stock Exchange Group PLC agreed Tuesday to buy a portfolio of fixed-income indexes and related analytics services from Citigroup Inc. for $685 million, the U.K. exchange operator's latest bet on the growth of passive investing.

The LSE is under pressure to identify targets as part of its strategy to bolster earnings after European regulators in March blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Borse AG. The European Union was concerned that the proposed $30 billion pan-European exchange tie-up would gain too much influence over the clearing of fixed-income trading.

The Citigroup deal fits with LSE's focus on expanding its operations selling market data and licensing indexes for institutional investors and developers of exchange-traded funds as new competition and computerized trading pressure fees from the more traditional business of operating venues for buying and selling stocks.

For Citigroup, the global bank gains a buyer that is committed to expanding its Citi Fixed Income Indices and Yield Book operations, which it had decided weren't key to its own strategy.

"This transaction is a positive outcome for The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices for both clients and employees," said Okan Pekin, Citigroup's global head of investor services, in a news release.

The LSE's index business is among the exchange operator's fastest-growing operations as the increasing popularity of low-cost funds that mimic benchmarks drives demand for indexes. In the first quarter, LSE's index business reported an 11% jump in organic revenue from the year-earlier period. The acquisition of Citigroup's fixed-income indexes are meant to augment that growth by broadening the exchange's offering of benchmarks to reach a larger customer base.

Citigroup's fixed-income indexes business, which includes the World Government Bond Index, has about 300 clients, including 200 buy-side fixed-income asset managers. The indexes will become part of the LSE's FTSE Russell's existing portfolio of indexes.

Citigroup's yield-book products are used to collect and analyze historical pricing data that are used to build indexes. The tools are applied to an array of fixed-income instruments such as mortgages, government and corporate bonds, and derivatives securities. The business services about 350 financial institutions globally, ranging from hedge funds to central banks.

Last year, Citigroup's yield-book and fixed-income indexes businesses generated $107 million of revenue.

Blackstone Group LP is giving a big boost to a small technology company that helps commercial property owners use energy more efficiently.

The private-equity giant is buying a stake in Entic Inc., a Pembroke Pines, Fla., company that uses cloud-based data analytics to identify areas of energy waste in building heat, ventilation, air conditioning and other systems. Founded in 2011, Entic sells its service to owners of about 65 properties including office buildings and sports venues including Busch Stadium in St. Louis.

Blackstone's investment will enable Entic to "scale this globally," said Carlos Diaz, Entic's co-founder and chief executive. "One of the things that Blackstone said to us in our early discussions was: stop thinking about tens and twenties of buildings" and "start thinking of hundreds and thousands of buildings," Mr. Diaz said.

Mr. Diaz and Blackstone executives declined to disclose how much Blackstone was investing or how much of Entic it was buying. Before the deal with Blackstone, Entic had attracted about $13 million in investments from venture-capital firms, family and friends.

LONDON -- London Stock Exchange Group PLC agreed Tuesday to buy a portfolio of fixed-income indexes and related analytics services from Citigroup Inc. for $685 million, the U.K. exchange operator's latest bet on the growth of passive investing.

The LSE is under pressure to identify targets as part of its strategy to bolster earnings after European regulators in March blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse AG. The European Union was concerned that the proposed $30 billion pan-European exchange tie-up would gain too much influence over the clearing of fixed-income trading.

The Citigroup deal fits with LSE's focus on expanding its operations selling market data and licensing indexes for institutional investors and developers of exchange-traded funds as new competition and computerized trading pressure fees from the more traditional business of operating venues for buying and selling stocks.

For Citigroup, the global bank gains a buyer that is committed to expanding its Citi Fixed Income Indices and Yield Book operations, which it had decided weren't key to its own strategy.

"This transaction is a positive outcome for The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices for both clients and employees," said Okan Pekin, Citigroup's global head of investor services, in a news release.

The LSE's index business is among the exchange operator's fastest-growing operations as the increasing popularity of low-cost funds that mimic benchmarks drives demand for indexes. In the first quarter, LSE's index business reported an 11% jump in organic revenue from the year-earlier period. The acquisition of Citigroup's fixed-income indexes are meant to augment that growth by broadening the exchange's offering of benchmarks to reach a larger customer base.

Citigroup's fixed-income indexes business, which includes the World Government Bond Index, has about 300 clients, including 200 buy-side fixed-income asset managers. The indexes will become part of the LSE's FTSE Russell's existing portfolio of indexes.

Citigroup's yield-book products are used to collect and analyze historical pricing data that are used to build indexes.

China Money Market's Ups and Downs

Funding costs in China's money-market sector "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-push-to-stabilize-financial-system-leaves-markets-in-disarray-1493915497", as efforts by Chinese financial regulators to rein in debt take hold. While banks, which borrow short-term from one another in that market, are suffering, it's been good times for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd .'s money-market fund, Yu'e Bao.

Yu'e Bao, which means "leftover treasure" in Chinese, became the world's largest money-market fund this first quarter, with assets reaching 1.1 trillion yuan ($166.2 billion). It has been able to "http://www.thfund.com.cn/fundinfo/000198" in annualized returns this month, the highest level in two years.

As in the U.S., Chinese money-market funds are required to invest in safe assets. Yu'e Bao keeps most of its money in bank deposits.

The fund has had more bargaining power when negotiating returns from banks due to its size, say analysts. In the current environment, banks are especially in need of cash. The People's Bank of China has raised key interest rates, while the banking regulator is forcing banks to take into account hidden loans. Banks welcome the liquidity from Yu'e Bao even more than usual, say analysts.

But Yu'e Bao's fortunes are likely to ebb and flow.

Chinese authorities have shown signs of backing off from their recent aggressive measures. The central bank "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pboc-injects-net-170-bln-yuan-into-financial-system-tuesday-1494901819" into the country's fragile financial markets on May 16, the largest one-day cash injection in nearly fourth months.

Such moves serve to keep liquidity ample, and are therefore are a check on Yu'e Bao's returns.

The conditions today are similar to 2013, when Alibaba launched Yu'e Bao. Back then, the central bank also tried the squeeze the market where banks lend to one another. Yu'e Bao was able to offer returns of 7%. When "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-chinas-online-money-funds-the-game-changes-1394129962", liquidity returned back to normal and returns from Yu'e Bao fell. At the bottom, the fund offered 2.3%, only slightly higher than what Chinese investors can get from a savings account at the bank.

Chinese authorities tightened rules on money-market funds in 2016, but are still likely to support the industry's expansion. Money-market funds are an alternative to investment products sold by Chinese banks, which expose investors to even riskier assets, including stocks.

While the U.S. strictly limits money-market funds on use of leverage, China allows such funds to leverage up to 20% of their assets. That leaves plenty of room for the industry, which has only reached 3% leverage on average, says Shanghai-based consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.

China's attitude toward Yu'e Bao and its mammoth size is less clear. Tianhong Asset Management Co., the fund company managing Yu'e Bao on Alibaba's behalf, announced Friday that it would cap individual investment to 250,000 yuan (about $36,000).

Analysts say such a move is likely aimed at alleviating risk from potential redemptions should interest rates suddenly drop, and that it could have been the result of window guidance by regulators. A Tianhong spokesman said the cap was self-imposed and that one of the considerations was the recent "market situation." He declined to offer details.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

The $50 Billion Question: What Makes a Bank Big?

By Christina Rexrode and Ryan Tracy

There's a magic line in banking, and it is $50 billion.

That is the boundary that separates the big banks from the small. Firms with assets in excess of that figure face stricter rules on capital, mergers and other business, thanks to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.

Now, as the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress look to overhaul Dodd-Frank, one of the few points of bipartisan agreement is that $50 billion isn't the right number.

Lawmakers can't agree on a better one, though.

Banks over the threshold are getting used to the fact that, despite President Trump's promises to deregulate the banking industry, even an unpopular provision is hard to overturn in the current polarized political environment.

To many banks and industry analysts, change seems commonsensical. The Dodd-Frank rule was implemented to help prevent another financial crisis. But as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently told the Senate Banking Committee, banks with $50 billion in assets don't pose "the same risk as a bank that has $750 billion or $2 trillion."

Even many officials known for sparring with banks, including Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve's former top banking regulator, support raising the limit. So does Barney Frank, the former Democratic congressman who with former Democratic Senator Chris Dodd was the driving force behind Dodd-Frank.

"All numbers are arbitrary, and in the rush, $50 billion seemed like a much bigger number," Mr. Frank said in a recent interview.

Widespread support means Congress theoretically could act to change at least this part of Dodd-Frank. At the recent banking committee hearing, Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) made a point of calling the $50 billion threshold "one area I would like this committee to address." Mr. Mnuchin said Treasury would provide recommendations to the president in early June.

The trick will be reaching a compromise on what should come next.

Republicans tend to favor either setting a threshold of between $250 billion and $500 billion, or basing the designation on a bank's riskiness rather than on its size. That new range would leave around a dozen or as few as a half-dozen banks facing stricter regulation.

Currently, 37 firms are above the $50 billion mark and face tougher Dodd-Frank rules, such as stress tests. This year's stress test will apply to only 34 banks, because some firms have more time before they undergo the exams.

Democrats generally want a stricter threshold, perhaps $100 billion to $150 billion leaving about 20 or 30 firms above the threshold.

The current boundary applies regardless of a bank's complexity or the nature of its business. As a result, Zions Bancorp in Salt Lake City, with $65 billion in assets, is subject to many of the same rules as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., which has $2.5 trillion in assets.

That makes no sense, said Bob Wilmers, chief executive of M&T Bank Corp., in Buffalo, N.Y. "They've got trillions of dollars of derivatives, they make markets world-wide, they finance the buyout funds [and] hedge funds," Mr. Wilmers said of the biggest U.S. banks. Of regional banks, he added, "regulators could liquidate us all in a nanosecond."

Mr. Wilmers, whose bank has $123 billion in assets, would like to see the limit lifted to at least $250 billion.

How Congress arrived at the $50 billion number in the first place is a bit murky.

Some officials involved in the drafting of Dodd-Frank thought setting the bar at $250 billion or $500 billion would send the unwanted message that any bank above the line could be bailed out. Some wanted to index the number to growth or another measure of the economy.

Supporters of a low threshold say small firms have caused banking crises, too. Their view is that it's in the public interest to err on the side of sweeping up more banks while giving regulators the freedom to ease up on firms they don't view as risky.

"We didn't want to have a system where we only had heightened supervision of a handful of firms at the top," said Michael Barr, who worked on Dodd-Frank in the Obama administration's Treasury Department and now is a professor at the University of Michigan.

Andrew Olmem, a Republican Senate staffer back when Dodd-Frank was being drafted, in 2014 wrote a legislative history of the $50 billion provision. He concluded Congress intended the stricter rules to be applied to banks based on considerations including risks and lines of business, not just size.

Now a special assistant to White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn , Mr. Olmem argued that nuance became less clear as the bill was reworked in 2010.

Under Dodd-Frank, regulators can, and have, tailored the fine print about how capital, liquidity and other rules apply to different banks above the $50 billion line. Other tinkering has included reducing requirements in annual stress tests that banks with less than $250 billion in assets have to meet.

But regulators can't exempt banks entirely. For that, Congress needs to act. Bipartisan support will likely be necessary to move the measure through the Senate.

"On the surface, changing the threshold has bipartisan support," says Brian Gardner, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. But, he added, "I don't see Democrats in the mood for helping Republicans, especially when it will help what some people perceive as big banks."

Parochial concerns complicate matters further. For instance, setting the threshold at $100 billion wouldn't help Regions Financial Corp ., of Birmingham, Ala., which has about $125 billion in assets and is based in the home state of influential Republican Sen. Richard Shelby. Setting the line at $250 billion wouldn't help PNC Financial Services Group Inc . or Capital One Financial Corp ., whose home-state senators in Pennsylvania and Virginia, respectively, also sit on the Senate Banking Committee.

Even if lawmakers compromised, legislation changing Dodd-Frank could be derailed by other controversial issues, such as whether to alter the Volcker rule's ban on proprietary trading.

For now, firms like New York Community Bancorp Inc ., based in Westbury on Long Island with nearly $49 billion in assets, have to keep preparing for the day when they cross the line. This includes bulking up compliance staff and preparing for the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests.

New York Community Bank CEO Joseph Ficalora said at an industry conference in May that "people that are directly involved" understand that $50 billion was a mistake. But "it hasn't changed yet," he added.

SEC Chairman Plans to Hire Ex-Colleague to Run Enforcement Division

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton will hire a former prosecutor and veteran litigator from his former law firm to run enforcement at the markets regulator, according to people familiar with the matter.

Steven Peikin, who has worked for years at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP where Mr. Clayton was a partner before entering government, will become co-director of the enforcement division, the people said. Stephanie Avakian, who has served as the SEC's acting enforcement director, is likely to remain at the commission as co-director.

The decision to hire two top managers for the SEC's enforcement division would ease some of the issues created by Mr. Peikin's past work for Wall Street. Mr. Peikin has done high-profile defense work for Barclays PLC and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., including a stint where he helped represent Goldman during a U.S. Senate investigation of its trading and warehousing of key manufacturing commodities such as aluminum. Under SEC ethics rules, he would be barred for one year from supervising any cases that affect Goldman or other clients of Sullivan & Cromwell .

Mr. Peikin, a graduate of Harvard Law School, leads the criminal defense and investigations group at Sullivan & Cromwell . His work as both a government lawyer and defender of big banks could spark criticism from Democrats who mistrust the SEC's revolving door. Former colleagues say his background as a prosecutor should ease any concerns that he would take it easy on companies and financial executives.

From 1996 to 2004 he was an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, where he oversaw the Southern District of New York's securities and commodities task force. During that era, Mr. Peikin earned headlines for his prosecution of star technology banker Frank Quattrone, who was convicted of obstructing a government investigation and witness tampering, although an appeals court later threw out the judgment.

Mr. Peikin's experience as a prosecutor spanned the period when the government pursued several major executives for accounting fraud. Mr. Peikin participated in the prosecution of WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers, who was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, according to a disclosure in a 2005 New York Law Journal article that he wrote.

"He has a lot of experience and encyclopedic knowledge of the securities laws, and I think he's going to be aggressive and tough without being unhinged," said Aitan Goelman, a former enforcement director for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who worked with Mr. Peikin when both were federal prosecutors.

More recently, Mr. Peikin was part of the defense team for futures trader Michael Coscia, who became the first U.S. trader criminally convicted of spoofing, a fraudulent trading strategy. Spoofing, which became illegal under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, involves placing orders that one doesn't intend to fulfill, in an effort to trick other traders into altering their prices in a direction that benefits the spoofer. Mr. Coscia's case is now pending before a federal appeals court.

Former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White , who stepped down in January, also recruited co-directors of enforcement when she took over leadership of the regulator. The move made it easier for her choice as enforcement director, Andrew Ceresney, to join the agency because he, too, faced the need to recuse himself from working on cases that involved clients of his former law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP . Ms. White also worked at Debevoise & Plimpton before taking over the SEC, which she ran from 2013 to early 2017.

Ms. Avakian joined the SEC in 2014 as deputy director of enforcement under Mr. Ceresney. She became acting director after Mr. Ceresney returned to Debevoise as co-chairman of its litigation department.

While it is unusual for a new SEC chairman to retain a director hired by a predecessor, Ms. Avakian is viewed by SEC staff attorneys as a strong manager who would provide continuity and understanding of SEC procedures that Mr. Peikin lacks, since he has never worked at the agency.

It isn't clear how soon Mr. Clayton plans to announce the decision. He has already hired other SEC directors who historically have a lower profile than the director of enforcement.

One question facing Mr. Peikin and Ms. Avakian will be how they leverage the SEC's powers to extract big financial penalties from corporations that settle claims of wrongdoing. Speaking to the Senate Banking Committee in March, Mr. Clayton suggested that regulators could achieve more by suing individuals rather than fining companies.

Singapore Fines Credit Suisse and Local Bank in 1MDB Inquiry

By Jake Maxwell Watts and P.R. Venkat

SINGAPORE Singapore's financial regulator imposed fines on two large banks including Credit Suisse AG CS 1.05% as it concluded a two-year investigation into widespread antimoney-laundering failures throughout its financial system related to alleged misappropriations from Malaysian state fund 1MDB.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore said Tuesday it had fined the Swiss bank 700,000 Singapore dollars (US$504,613) and Singapore's United Overseas Bank Ltd . UOVEY 0.09% S$900,000 after it found several breaches of regulations and inadequate scrutiny of customers' transactions and activities.

The fines were imposed after two years of investigations into the role of Singapore's financial institutions and their interactions with 1MDB, or 1Malaysia Development Bhd .

The MAS's review of Singapore's financial sector has exposed dozens of failures within banks large and small, sullying the city-state's reputation as a trusted financial center in a sensitive case involving large alleged misappropriations from a neighboring country.

During its extensive review, MAS shut two foreign private banks and fined six others in addition to UOB and Credit Suisse for various breaches of antimoney-laundering regulations. It has fined banks operating in Singapore a combined S$29.1 million for their roles in handling 1MDB-related fund flows.

Since its investigations began two years ago, MAS has issued prohibition notices against four former or current employees of financial institutions and said it intended to issue notices against three more, including the new ones mentioned Tuesday. In its statement Tuesday, MAS said it had made three new bans and served notices on three more.

Its managing director, Ravi Menon, said in a statement Tuesday that the regulator's extensive review "holds key lessons" for both the MAS and financial institutions in Singapore. He said the country's financial system "is in a better position today" than when 1MDB-related abuses took place.

Singapore is one of several countries around the world, including the U.S., probing 1MDB's activities. Swiss investigators said last year they believe US$4 billion may have disappeared from the fund, while the U.S. Justice Department has said it believes that some US$1 billion originating with 1MDB was plowed into hotels, luxury real estate, fine art, a private jet, and the 2013 film "The Wolf of Wall Street."

1MDB has denied wrongdoing and hasn't been charged with any crimes.

While the MAS didn't find pervasive control weaknesses at Credit Suisse and UOB, it said the two banks had breached regulations several times.

Credit Suisse said that it acknowledges the outcome of the review and regrets that it has fallen short of MAS and the bank's own high standards.

Switzerland's financial regulator, which had already concluded its own investigation of Credit Suisse , said later Tuesday it hadn't found any systematic breaches of supervisory law, but had sent the bank a written reprimand for antimoney-laundering shortcomings.

UOB said that it accepts the findings by the MAS and that it has instituted measures to address the areas of concern, including enhancing its training program to raise risk-and-control awareness among staff.

While the MAS review into financial institutions has concluded, criminal investigations conducted by Singapore's police force continue. At least five individuals have been sentenced for various crimes including fraud and failing to report suspicious transactions, while one of those awaits trial on additional charges. Singapore investigators said last year a combined S$240 million in assets had been seized or restricted as part of their probe.

Former BSI Bank Ltd. employee Yak Yew Chee and former Falcon Bank branch manager Jens Sturzenegger, both banned for life from operating in Singapore's financial sector, were among the bankers individually sanctioned by MAS on Tuesday. Mr. Yak's subordinate at BSI, Seah Mei Ying, formerly known as Yvonne Seah Yew Foong, is banned for 15 years. All three have been convicted of financial crimes related to their handling of 1MDB relationships.

MAS said it had also served notice of its intention to serve shorter prohibitions on Kelvin Ang Keng Wee, a former broker in Singapore and two employees of research firm NRA Capital Pte. Ltd. in Singapore, for the firm's alleged role in preparing an improper 1MDB-related asset valuation. Mr. Ang declined to comment via his lawyer. NRA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Credit Scores Hit Record High as Recession Wounds Heal

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Credit scores for U.S. consumers reached a record high this spring while the share of Americans deemed to be some of the riskiest borrowers hit a record low a potential boon for lending and economic activity.

Consumers' improving fortunes reflect falling unemployment and continued, if lackluster, economic growth. An added benefit: The passage of time since the recession and housing meltdown is helping household balance sheets.

In ever-growing numbers, the worst personal financial setbacks, namely foreclosures and bankruptcies, are falling off Americans' credit reports. More than six million U.S. adults will have personal bankruptcies disappear over the next five years, according to a recent Barclays BCS -2.09% PLC report.

Wiping away such negative events also helps boost consumers' credit scores. Lenders rely on both the reports and scores when determining whether to approve consumers for loans and at what interest rates.

"Higher scores lead to more available credit," said Cris deRitis, senior director in the economics group at Moody's Analytics. "We'd see more activity in terms of loan approvals and credit-card approvals, more spending and that would have a ripple effect across the economy, increasing aggregate demand for goods and services."

The average credit score nationwide hit 700 in April, up one point from last fall, according to new data from Fair Isaac Corp . That is the highest since at least 2005. That was the year Fair Isaac, the creator of widely used FICO credit scores that range from 300 to 850, began tracking the data.

Meanwhile, the share of consumers deemed to be riskiest, with a score below 600, hit a new low of roughly 40 million, or 20% of U.S. adults who have FICO scores, according to Fair Isaac. That is down from 20.5% in October and a peak of 25.5% in 2010.

As credit scores rise, banks and other lenders are likely to make credit more widely available to consumers, and at cheaper cost.

"The domino effect for lenders would be more consumers they can market to [and] more consumers who may be credit-eligible who weren't in last year's models," said Nidhi Verma, senior director of research and consulting at credit-reporting firm TransUnion.

In the wake of the downturn, financing didn't disappear completely for consumers with bankruptcies or foreclosures on their credit reports. But it became harder for them to get, as many lenders were lending only to consumers with pristine credit histories.

With many lenders, that risk aversion extended to credit cards and auto loans. As a result, some consumers with black marks on their reports turned to cash for most expenses and held back on big-ticket purchases.

Laura Paolinelli of Round Hill, Va., filed for bankruptcy in 2012 after she stopped paying her mortgage, she says. When she applied for an Amazon.com Inc . credit card late last year, Ms. Paolinelli, an auditor at a research firm, says she was rejected.

In February, the defaulted mortgage and bankruptcy were again an issue when she applied for an auto loan: A loan officer told her she would have a better shot at getting a lower interest rate if her husband also signed as a borrower, she says.

"I'm looking forward to that not to show up anymore," Ms. Paolinelli said. The foreclosure and bankruptcy occurred after she failed to sell her home, which had fallen by more than $200,000 in value, she said. "It's a little embarrassing when they run your credit and you know they're going to see that because it always comes up. &It was once in my life."

Mortgage foreclosures stay on credit reports for up to seven years dating back to the missed payment that resulted in the foreclosure. Foreclosure starts, the first stage in the process, peaked in 2009 at 2.1 million, according to Attom Data Solutions. They totaled nearly 1.8 million in 2010 and remained above one million during each of the next two years.

Personal bankruptcies are more complicated and can stay on credit reports for seven to 10 years.

Consumers who filed in 2007 for Chapter 7 protection the most common type of bankruptcy, in which certain debts are discharged and creditors can get paid back from sales of consumers' assets are now starting to see those events fall off their reports.

Some 500,000 Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases were filed in 2007, a figure that swelled to nearly 1.1 million in 2010, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.

Chapter 13 bankruptcies, in which consumers enter a payment plan with creditors, usually stay on reports for at least seven years. Those filings reached a recent peak of nearly 435,000 in 2010 and are set to start falling off reports this year.

Fresh starts for credit reports are likely to help boost originations of large-dollar loans for cars and homes. Consumers have a greater chance of getting approved for financing if they apply for loans after negative events fall off their reports, in particular from large banks that have stuck to strict underwriting criteria, says Morgan Whitacre, who oversees consumer-loan underwriting at Bank of America Corp .

Credit-card lending, already on the rise, could increase further as a result of fresh starts. Consumers who have one type of bankruptcy filing removed from their credit reports on average experience a roughly $1,500 increase in spending limits and rack up $800 more in credit-card debt within three years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .

Geoffrey Page, of Rockford, Ill., is a potential beneficiary. The 59-year-old has nine months to go until his financial knocks from the downturn are wiped away.

Mr. Page filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after his house went into foreclosure. He has lived off cash since then, and says he has been rejected for a student loan for his son and for a car loan.

Already, though, he has a taste of what things could be like after the bankruptcy is cleared. Mr. Page, a quality coordinator at a hospital, says after the mortgage default fell off his credit reports, he began receiving more credit-card and personal-loan solicitations.

Mr. Page has been renting since he filed for bankruptcy. When that falls off his credit reports as expected next year, he says he will likely look to buy a house.

Why Banks Haven't Been Burned by Retail's Meltdown

By Lillian Rizzo and Rachel Louise Ensign

When oil prices tumbled to multiyear lows in 2016, the pressure quickly spread to banks that lent to energy companies.

This year, a far different story is playing out for banks as the U.S. retailing industry endures a major shake-up that has led to a spike in bankruptcy filings.

Changing shopper habits and the increasing dominance of Amazon.com Inc . have led retail bankruptcies to hit their fastest pace since the financial crisis 21 this year through Tuesday, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. In recent months, retailers Payless ShoeSource Inc ., BCBG Max Azria Group LLC and Limited Stores Co. have all filed for bankruptcy.

While many of these companies are saddled with a variety of debt, the "asset-based loans" popular with banks are among the safest. That is because the loans are typically backed by stores' inventories or accounts-receivable.

Banks have made asset-based loans to 15 of the 21 retailers that filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2017, according to a Wall Street Journal review of court filings and the S&P data. But those loans are all repaid or expected to be repaid, according to bankruptcy documents.

That has led bank executives and other industry observers to shrug off the risks these distressed retailers pose. The industry's troubles are "bad for retail, but not so bad for banks," said Glenn Schorr, a bank analyst at Evercore ISI.

On a conference call last month, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon played down the risks of retailers to the nation's largest bank. "There'll be something there, but it's nothing that will be dramatic when it's happening," he said, adding that J.P. Morgan has scrutinized its exposure to retailers, as well as property occupied by them and vendors who sell to them.

Still, the troubled industry has the potential to cause other headaches, particularly for smaller banks that do a lot of commercial real-estate lending.

"This issue clearly isn't going away," Christopher E. McGratty, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., said recently. He expects smaller banks, some with 20% of their commercial real-estate exposure focused on retailers, will start to give more disclosure soon on different types of borrowers they serve, from strip malls to big-box stores.

Overall, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimates that banks have $270 billion of retail-related commercial real-estate loans.

Banks have taken on some of their most direct exposure to retailers through asset-based loans, which typically get paid back before those to other lenders. Asset-based "lenders historically have recovered 100% of their exposure" in retail bankruptcies, said David M. Hillman , a restructuring partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP .

Commercial loans to retailers are larger than energy exposure at many banks. Retailers represent Bank of America Corp .'s BAC -0.04% third-biggest industry exposure in its commercial-lending book, for instance, and the bank extended $41.6 billion to the sector at the end of 2016. By contrast, the bank lent $19.7 billion to the energy industry.

Bank of America or Wells Fargo & Co . were lenders in nine of the 21 recent retail bankruptcies. The two banks have also lent money to troubled retailers that haven't filed for bankruptcy protection, like Sears Corp. and BonTon Stores Inc.

Banks generally take reserves against potential losses when they see borrowers that might be at risk. In the case of retailers, the amounts generally haven't been big enough to show up in broader reserve levels at big banks, Mr. Schorr said. That is a contrast to last year, when energy lending led banks to post large increases in reserves broadly.

One reason for the difference: In energy, the commodity-price declines were felt widely across the industry. Loans to troubled retailers, on the other hand, are balanced out by online stores and other chains that are performing better.

Another distinction is that the value of the retailers' collateral underlying the loans has held up better than in energy. "The inventory and accounts receivable value doesn't fluctuate as much as commodities' prices do," Mr. Hillman said.

This month's bankruptcy filing of rue21 Inc ., a teen retailer, exemplified how banks' loans can be safe even when other lenders face losses. The retailer, which sells everything from prom dresses to candles for different astrological signs, had a $72 million loan led by Bank of America .

That loan is expected to be paid back in full from the proceeds of liquidation sales of about 400 of its nearly 1,200 stores in coming months, according to the proposed restructuring agreement.

Unlike many other retailers, rue21 's debt goes beyond what is owed to banks, landlords and vendors. The Pennsylvania retailer owes $521 million on a so-called term loan owned largely by hedge funds. Instead of getting paid back relatively quickly, those lenders plan to swap their debt for equity in a reorganized company. There is also $250 million worth of rue21 's unsecured bonds, whose holders are slated to get a 4% equity stake, as well as the right to pursue certain legal actions, if they vote "yes" to the proposed reorganization.

 Clean Shares' Get a Boost From Fiduciary Rule

By Daisy Maxey

With the fiduciary rule set to take effect June 9, a new type of mutual-fund share stands to gain traction.

These "clean shares" charge only the fee to manage and operate a mutual fund, and don't include payments to distributors, such as the broker-dealers and retirement-plan platforms that sell the funds. Stripped from clean shares are fees to compensate brokers for providing advice and 12b-1 fees, which pay for marketing, printing and prospectuses and other shareholder services.

As it is today, investors who buy class A shares of a mutual fund through a broker, for example, typically pay a sales charge that may range from 2.25% to 5.75%, according to Morningstar Inc . It's easy for investors to overlook that payment to the broker because it's bundled in with cost of the fund's management, and the fund company passes it onto the distributor.

With clean shares, investors will likely pay 60% to 70% less to buy a fund, says Paul Ellenbogen, head of global regulatory solutions at Morningstar. If they want a broker's advice, however, they would have to pay for that separately.

Such lower-cost shares are being launched by fund companies in part to help advisers and brokers comply with a new rule aimed at curbing conflicted advice on retirement accounts. The so-called fiduciary rule would require that financial advisers who make recommendations on assets in individual retirement accounts receive compensation that doesn't offer them an incentive to choose one product over another for a client.

Clean shares could help firms comply with the fiduciary rule in two ways, according to Morningstar. Advisory firms that wish to qualify as "level-fee" fiduciaries a model in which their compensation comes only from a level charge on clients' assets need to strip out third-party payments of any kind, which clean shares do. Firms that wish to continue to receive sales fees, or commissions, could sell clean shares, then set their own commissions that are the same across products.

Broker-dealers and other distributors will have to charge directly for their services, which will make it clear to investors how much they're paying to whom and for what. That could eventually spur more competition in the pricing and quality of various fund-related services.

"Unfortunately, the average investor with a brokerage account doesn't know the fees he's paying and whether the money is going to the brokerage firm or to the mutual-fund company or someone else," says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at financial data and analysis provider CFRA. With clean shares, he says, "there will be an onus on the brokerage firm to provide such information."

Some fund companies are creating new clean share classes while others are expanding the creation of "class R shares." Those shares were previously available only through employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, and are usually a fund company's lowest-priced share class.

Fee pressures from exchange-traded funds are also encouraging the adoption of clean shares. Adoption of the shares will put mutual-fund pricing "on a much closer footing" with ETF pricing, says Russ Kinnel, director of manager research at Morningstar. Investors in open-end mutual funds, money-market accounts and variable annuity subaccounts pay more than $15 billion per year in 12b-1 fees alone, Morningstar estimates.

Because the shares enable clarity and therefore greater competition on price they likely represent a win for active management, Mr. Kinnel says.

Mr. Rosenbluth agrees that clean shares could help keep active mutual funds relevant in an environment in which advisers are increasingly shifting away from selling active products on commission and moving toward charging an asset-based fee and offering lower-cost products.

"I don't think the shares are going to help mutual fund companies win back assets that they've lost necessarily, but I do think they'll help them retain more of the business," he says.

American Funds, a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Capital Group, and Jersey City, N.J.-based Lord Abbett & Co . both began this year offering F3 shares, which charge management fees, but no fees to pay distributors. Janus Capital Group of Denver filed in January to offer Z shares, which are also free of any fees to distributors; the company, which is in the process of merging with U.K. asset manager Henderson Group, had no update on the progress of its shares.

Matthew O'Connor, head of Capital Group's North American distribution, said the company is pleased to see some early adoption of its clean shares, but expects that it will take time to build assets. The advisory business has been a driver of the trend toward externalized fees and full transparency, a trend that's also been seen in the retirement-plan market over the last decade, he says.

"We do expect the adoption to be gradual, but the direction is clear," Mr. O'Connor says.

MFS Investment Management expanded the availability of its retirement share class which makes no payment to intermediaries--to advisory platforms in December after several broker-dealers requested it, says Jim Jessee, the asset manager's co-head of global distribution. A couple of large broker-dealers are offering the clean shares now, Mr. Jessee says. MFS will continue to make various share classes available, and broker-dealers can choose which they feel are more appropriate, he says.

Federated Investors Inc . has 56 funds that fit the definition of clean shares, which include 26 funds with retirement share classes, Chief Executive Christopher Donahue said in an earnings call at the end of April. The company currently has no further update on the shares, a spokesman said.

Franklin Templeton Investments says it's evaluating a clean-share class as several of its clients have requested them.

With various clean share iterations popping up, Morningstar hopes to begin certifying those that are truly clean that is those that offer no payment to a fund's distributor and make clear disclosures, says Mr. Ellenbogen. Some distributors are asking for clean shares to include small payments to keep their offices open or for a fund to be offered on their platform, for example, he says. "Clean is clean; it isn't a little bit dirty," says Mr. Ellenbogen.

Morningstar expects to see many more fund companies launch clean shares classes. If they are the share classes of the future, fund companies may no longer need to create share classes for each advisory model, says Mr. Ellenbogen.

"We see this as disruptive. Everyone is going to have to sort things out--asset managers, retirement-plan providers, broker-dealers and other distributors," says Mr. Ellenbogen. "Is the A share dead? That's pretty likely."

WSJ Pro: China Tightening Rules on Selling by Major Shareholders

By Chao Deng

China's securities regulator is tightening rules on selling by major shareholders, an effort to discourage activity that might disrupt the stability of the stock market in a politically sensitive year.

Major shareholders won't be able to reduce their holdings by routing block trades through a third party, said the regulator in a statement published on its website Saturday.

The move, along with other measures, was to address "new problems" that authorities had observed this year, including the dodging of selling limitations that were already in place. There is a need to prevent "concentrated, substantial and disorderly reductions" that "damage investor confidence," said the statement.

The Chinese government has a track record of trying to curb bearish bets on its financial markets, from stocks to the currency. During the 2015 stock market crash, it temporarily put selling limitations on major shareholders, or investors holding 5% or more of shares in a listed company. Earlier this month, it gave window guidance for brokerages and funds not to process large sell orders, ahead of an official gathering on the One Belt, One Road, a key foreign policy and economic initiative by President Xi Jinping.

A Beijing-led crackdown on banks, securities firms and insurers this year is giving the China Securities Regulatory Commission fresh reason to intervene. The Shanghai Composite Index is down 5% since its recent peak on April 11, as investors worry about the impact of financial tightening. China's leadership is prioritizing stability across financial markets ahead of a power shuffle later this year.

The securities regulator said it planned to revise rules to curb selling by major shareholders in a statement Friday. That announcement came after the central bank said it was tweaking the mechanism for setting the yuan's daily fix, an effort to keep the currency steady against the U.S. dollar. That same day, analysts said state funds propped up stocks, sending financial blue chips sharply higher.

The statement by the securities regulator Saturday suggested it might use discretion depending on the circumstance. Among the measures, it said it would guide shareholders to reduce holdings in an "rational and orderly" manner after the expiration of lockup periods.

CFA Exam to Add Fintech Questions

By Lisa Beilfuss

For wealth managers looking to add to their credentials, the future is now.

The CFA Institute , which confers the chartered financial analyst designation and has 142,000 members world-wide, is adding to its admittance exam questions on robo advisers, artificial intelligence and data analysis. Study guides set to go to print covers so-called fintech, and the new questions will show up on tests administered in 2019.

"Investment management generalists need to know about these things," said Stephen Horan, managing director of credentialing at CFA Institute. Artificial intelligence and data analytics offer opportunities for advisers to provide more sophisticated and holistic financial advice, he says.

Automation and artificial intelligence will change what wealth-management professionals do over the next five to 10 years, Mr. Horan said, "but it's not going to replace our members." Rather, he said, fintech tools will add to advisers' value.

The CFA Institute 's move to test on fintech may help change the perception among some advisers about how technology fits into their job. A study conducted by the group last year found that respondents in the Americas are much less likely than those in other regions to think automated financial-advice tools will positively affect consumers in the areas of access to advice, product choice and quality of service.

Robos and other technological tools "will take off the table the more mundane things and free up time and space for more robust conversations" with clients, he said, likening fintech to the effect tax software has had on the tax-preparation business. "Everyone uses tax software, but we still have tax accountants," he said.

The CFA exam, a three-part, 18-hour test offered annually, currently covers 10 main topic areas ranging from economics to quantitative methods and derivatives. The soon-to-be added fintech questions will be part of a standalone section as well as woven in throughout the exam.

Behind Bitcoin's Wild Ride: the Japan Factor

By Paul Vigna and Chieko Tsuneoka

Bitcoin fever has hit Japan, and it's helping the virtual currency go parabolic.

Despite a volatile week in which the virtual currency fell $400 in a few hours Thursday but still rose on the day, bitcoin has kept streaking to fresh highs. It was up 15% for the week and is up 110% since the end of March. Friday afternoon, it traded at $2,268, down from its all-time peak of $2,792 set Thursday.

One of the leading causes: new regulatory policies for bitcoin in Japan is giving businesses and investors a fresh push to use the digital currency. The move is partially the result of the nation's experience with the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox , a trading site where 850,000 bitcoin went missing after a cyberattack.

"People gained a lot of confidence in bitcoin as a legal currency," said Yuzo Kano, the founder and chief executive officer of BitFlyer Inc., a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange backed by big Japanese banks. "We see new joiners on top of existing buyers."

The new Japanese rules enacted by the Financial Services Agency went into effect April 1, establishing bitcoin as a legitimate payment method by putting rules on businesses in the industry. They include minimum capital requirements, segregating customer accounts, and monitoring potential criminal activity.

Trading of bitcoin in Japanese yen has surged to 31% of overall trading, according to data from research site CryptoCompare. That is roughly equal to bitcoin trading in dollars and ahead of bitcoin trading in Chinese yuan, which used to be the biggest market, and South Korean won, an expanding market.

Bitcoin, an alternative to paper money in which trades match up over computers without the involvement of banks or governments, is a natural fit for the Japanese, said Mike Kayamori, the CEO of digital-currency exchange Quoine, the nation's third largest by volume.

The foreign-exchange market and yen trade is central to the Japanese, he said.

Japan is the world's third-largest economy, and the yen is one of the world's most-traded currencies. Technology and foreign exchange are two major businesses in Japan, and bitcoin allows investors to combine both in one product.

When Quoine launched 2 years ago, Mr. Kayamori said, the startup had trouble even getting bank accounts. Once regulators at Japan's Financial Services Agency began their regulatory push, he noticed a change. "The potential is there," he said. "Japan will be the biggest bitcoin market globally."

The flood of new money in Japan is resulting in price quotes on Japanese exchanges that are in some cases hundreds of dollars higher than on other exchanges. That gap is resulting in arbitrage opportunities buying cheap on one exchange, selling at a profit on another and helping to push the price up.

Japan's experience contrasts with a loss of trading volumes in China. For several years, bitcoin trading in China was unregulated. Without any rules, or even trading fees, Chinese bitcoin exchanges were completely unrestrained. At its zenith, more than 90% of all bitcoin trading was occurring in China. That changed over the past year, as the People's Bank of China forced the three biggest exchanges to adhere to anti-money-laundering rules and implement trading fees. The bank then forced the exchanges to halt bitcoin withdrawals.

Much of the trading has since moved to Japan, where some Japanese businesses are now starting to accept bitcoin. A discount airline, Peach, said it would begin accepting bitcoin. Others include utility Nippon Gas Co . and electronics retailer Bic Camera Inc .

Individual investors in Japan who like bitcoin's anonymity and profit potential are also looking to buy.

"These days, you hardly get any interest even if you put money in the bank," said Hiroshi Matsuzaki, a 50-year-old who sells housing fixtures. "So I decided to put money bit by bit into virtual currency." He's looking to buy more, but is hesitant given the volatility.

Chizuru Suzuki is coming into bitcoin for the second time. The 51-year-old web-content creator first invested in the currency in 2013, but became dubious after losing track of her bitcoin. Now, she is again buying small amounts on price dips and taking profits when it rises. "I expect the price will fall at some point and that's when I will buy it again," she said.

Some argue that bitcoin prices have rallied too fast. "The party will end as Asian [prices] come back into line with Western markets," said Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare.

Japan already had one moment in the bitcoin sun, and it ended poorly. When bitcoin was first stretching past a small enclave of tinkerers and coders, the first major exchange, Mt. Gox , was based in Tokyo. At its height, Mt. Gox was handling more than 70% of all bitcoin trading around the world. But the exchange collapsed in 2014, and creditors are still trying to recover funds.

With the new oversight from the FSA, though, this go-round could be different. "The bitcoin casino days are gone," Mr. Kayamori said, "and everybody says that's a good thing."

Analysis: Japan's Banks Could Benefit From Riskier Lending

By Anjani Trivedi

Japan's megabanks are finally feeling the winds of change. The likes of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group , Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group have long struggled with anemic loan demand and deteriorating net interest margins. Now there are signs they are changing their strategies to offset those problems. Investors should hope the pressure keeps rising.

One little-noticed recent shift is the banks' greater issuance of subordinated loans riskier debt that puts lenders lower down the ranks of those who get repaid when a company goes bust. Japanese banks doled out $14 billion in such loans last year, according to Moody's Investors Service , almost equivalent to the combined total over the preceding four years. The trend has continued, with the top three banks behind all Japanese subordinated-loan issuance this year.

Because of the higher risk involved in subordinated debt, which is typically uncollateralized, banks can charge higher interest rates. If that means keeping some "zombie" companies on life support, at least the banks are getting better rewarded for their pains.

That isn't the only benefit. Big Japanese banks still often own large stakes in companies they lend to. In swapping old, collateralized loans for subordinated loans to companies, the banks are taking the opportunity to talk companies into letting them sell down these piles of legacy cross-shareholdings, which have long been an obstacle to reform in Japan. Companies can use the proceeds of the subordinated loans to buy back their shares from the banks, Moody's says.

If this trend continues at the current rate, banks could cull their holdings in companies by 3.7 trillion ($33.2 billion) over the next five years, Moody's reckons. That would help Japan's banks unleash trapped regulatory capital, improving their Tier 1 capital ratios by an estimated net 0.8 percentage point.

Previous bank strategies like ramping up overseas lending and buying assets with dollar deposits to fund such lending haven't brought much bang for the buck: Japan's lenders currently trade at 0.6 times their book value. The banks' latest shift, though, could raise their income while simultaneously helping reform Japan Inc. This could be more than just a strong gust; investors should keep an eye on the wind speed.

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

LendingClub Loses Motion to Dismiss Lawsuit

A federal judge in California denied late Thursday parts of a motion from LendingClub (LC) and two of its former executives to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit that accused them of misrepresenting the state of the company's internal controls in its IPO prospectus. Judge cited events LendingClub disclosed after it ousted CEO Renaud Laplanche last year, including Laplanche's taking out loans for himself and family members and valuation anomalies at LendingClub 's fund-management subsidiary, in denying the company's motion to dismiss. Laplanche "had engaged in self-dealing to inflate loan-origination numbers and he had inflated the assets of subsidiaries of LendingClub before the IPO -- both issues involving financial reporting. No competing inference is more reasonable than concluding that CEO Laplanche knew that some material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting persisted," the judge wrote. Compass Point analyst Michael Tarkan expects litigation expenses at LendingClub to be elevated in the near-term. LC falls 2.8%. (peter.rudegeair@wsj.com; @rudegeair)

Regulatory Tightening Won't Hurt Insurers' VNB

A recent ban on "fast-return" products and universal riders will have limited impact on Chinese insurers' value of new business, says Credit Suisse , given the low margins on those products.

The investment bank prefers Ping An (2318.HK) for its quality and China Life (2628.HK) for its attractive yield. (john.wu@wsj.com)

Citi Still Optimistic US Tax Reform Will Pass This Year

Recent US political developments are a distraction from the various presidential and Congressional policy agendas and are likely to lead to delays and complications in various areas, says Citi. But for now, Citi says it remains somewhat optimistic, and still expect significant tax reform, equivalent to a fiscal impulse of 1.0-1.5 percentage points of GDP in 2018-21, to be passed over the next 12 months. In Citi's view, tax reform may be relatively less vulnerable to the latest White House-related political developments than other policies that depend on the ability of the White House to achieve the necessary Congressional majorities, such as a significant boost to infrastructure spending, cuts in non-defense and security-related discretionary expenditures or health care reform. However, "it remains far from certain that tax reform efforts will succeed," it adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

Internal Models and the Effects of Risk Weights

European banks have for many years used internal models to generate lower risk-weighted assets in order to achieve capital savings. Recently, the Basel Committee and the European Union have tried to minimize undue variability in risk-weighted assets to "ensure greater homogeneity in validation and calibration procedures," "http://voxeu.org/article/risk-based-capital-requirements-and-corporate-lending" by Brunella Bruno, Giacomo Nocera and Andrea Resti for VoxEU. They find that between 2008 and 2014, the use of banks' internal models for regulatory purposes led to reductions in corporate loan portfolios because banks became more risk-sensitive. The challenge, the authors write, is to deal with internal ratings' effects on loan supply while preserving risk-sensitivity.

The London Stock Exchange Group could rebrand itself as International Data Inc.

In a decade, the company has gone from a local equities market to global information and services business.

A deal to buy Citi s bond index and analytics platform represents another bite of the cherry.

Amid the seemingly unstoppable popularity of data-driven investment, the $685m (530m) cash deal makes sense.

Unlike LSE s failed merger with Deutsche Brse, the purchase is unlikely to draw political heat. Overseas ownership of national exchanges is a difficult sell. Patriots are less protective of data companies.

With an enterprise value 14.9 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, the purchase price is steeper than the 12.4 times multiple that RBC Capital estimates LSE paid for the Frank Russell index business. But that was three years ago   valuations have increased across the board since then.

Previous acquisitions, including Russell, have been a success. Consolidation has left a handful of indexproviders whose fees are drawn from the trillions of dollars benchmarked against their products.

Russell has helped make the information division LSE s largest source of revenue, responsible for two-fifths of the 1.5bn total last year. It is growing fast, too, up 24 per cent in the first three months of 2017 against the same period of 2016. The traditional capital markets business registered a lacklustre 1 per cent.

What could knock the index business from its perch? A revolt by fund managers against high index fees, perhaps. That has been mooted within the powerful $4tn exchange traded fund industry. But history suggests that such rebels are too divided to succeed.

Flagging growth is a more realistic concern. LSEG, whose shares trade at a steep 23 times forward earnings, has bulked up through acquisition. Buying Citi s business is an astute move, but it also leaves one data gem less to absorb.

Lex welcomes views from readers. Does the indices business really have the attractive characteristics we believe? Or will pressure on fund managers to cut costs push down fees paid to index groups too? Please let us know what you think in the comments section below.

The London Stock Exchange snapped up Citigroup s global bond analytics business for $685m in the first significant deal since the collapse of the exchange s proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Brse.

The exchange said it would acquire the US investment bank s fixed income indices, including the dominant World Government Bond Index, and its  yield book  platforms, which provide data on bond indices. The acquisition is a bet that appetite for passive investment products, which track indices, will continue to grow.

The acquisition would increase the assets under management of the LSE s FTSE Russell indexing franchise to around $15tn from $12.5tn currently, the company said.

The deal reflects a broader move by exchanges to diversify from trading services   in LSE s case, towards the higher-margin data and indices business.

The exchange is looking to strengthen some of its operations after its failed merger with Deutsche Brse, which collapsed because of EU antitrust concerns around three months ago.

 The acquisition represents a significant step for FTSE Russell to acquire a world-class fixed income analytics and index business, enhancing our ability to provide customers with broader multi-asset capabilities and a deeper data and analytics offering,  said Mark Makepeace, group director of information services and chief executive of FTSE Russell.

For Citi, analysts said the bond analytics business was fairly small and expected the US bank to focus elsewhere.

 Management feel it will matter more to the LSE and ensure they get the attention they need,  said Chris Wheeler at Atlantic Equities.  Citi is in investment mode, specifically in US cards, Mexico and equities 	. 	. 	. 	They have their first investor day in years in July and will want to paint the picture of a much more streamlined business now seeking to grow revenue as well as returning excess capital. 

The LSE said it expected the acquisition to deliver an additional $30m in revenues in the first three years after completion and cost savings of around $18m over the same period. It expected to complete the deal, which is subject to regulatory clearance, in the second half of the year.

In 2016, the newly-acquired businesses generated revenues of $107m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $46m, according to LSE estimates.

The London exchange has been moving into the US capital markets business after it bought Frank Russell Company, an index compiler and asset manager, in 2014 for $2.7bn. In 2016, information services revenues accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the group s total revenues. For capital markets activities, that share was around 24 per cent.

Peter Lenardos, analyst at RBC Europe, said the deal was a  clever transaction  by LSE to move further into the  higher growth, higher margin and higher multiple  indexing business, which is dominated by groups such as MSCI and, in the US, S&P and Dow Jones. Their estimated synergies  seemed conservative , he added.

The Yield Book platform is used by 350 institutional clients such as banks, central banks, and hedge funds.

Credit Picture Brightens, Paving Way for Growth

Credit scores for U.S. consumers reached a record high this spring while the share of Americans deemed to be some of the riskiest borrowers hit a record low -- a potential boon for lending and economic activity.

Consumers' improving fortunes reflect falling unemployment and continued, if lackluster, economic growth. An added benefit: The passage of time since the recession and housing meltdown are helping household balance sheets.

In ever-growing numbers, the worst personal financial setbacks, namely foreclosures and bankruptcies, are falling off Americans' credit reports. More than six million U.S. adults will have personal bankruptcies disappear over the next five years, according to a recent Barclays PLC report.

Wiping away such negative events also helps boost consumers' credit scores. Lenders rely on both the reports and scores when determining whether to approve consumers for loans and at what interest rates.

"Higher scores lead to more available credit," said Cris deRitis, senior director in the economics group at Moody's Analytics. "We'd see more activity in terms of loan approvals and credit-card approvals, more spending and that would have a ripple effect across the economy, increasing aggregate demand for goods and services."

The average credit score nationwide hit 700 in April, up one point from last fall, according to new data from Fair Isaac Corp. That is the highest since at least 2005. That was the year Fair Isaac, the creator of widely used FICO credit scores that range from 300 to 850, began tracking the data.

Meanwhile, the share of consumers deemed to be riskiest, with a score below 600, hit a new low of roughly 40 million, or 20% of U.S. adults who have FICO scores, according to Fair Isaac. That is down from 20.5% in October and a peak of 25.5% in 2010.

As credit scores rise, banks and other lenders are likely to make credit more widely available to consumers, and at cheaper cost.

"The domino effect for lenders would be more consumers they can market to [and] more consumers who may be credit-eligible who weren't in last year's models," said Nidhi Verma, senior director of research and consulting at credit-reporting firm TransUnion.

In the wake of the downturn, financing didn't disappear completely for consumers with bankruptcies or foreclosures on their credit reports. But it became harder for them to get, as many lenders were lending only to consumers with pristine credit histories.

With many lenders, that risk aversion extended to credit cards and auto loans. As a result, some consumers with black marks on their reports turned to cash for most expenses and held back on big-ticket purchases.

Laura Paolinelli of Round Hill, Va., filed for bankruptcy in 2012 after she stopped paying her mortgage, she says. When she applied for an Amazon.com Inc. credit card late last year, Ms. Paolinelli, an auditor at a research firm, says she was rejected.

In February, the defaulted mortgage and bankruptcy were again an issue when she applied for an auto loan: A loan officer told her she would have a better shot at getting a lower interest rate if her husband also signed as a borrower, she says.

"I'm looking forward to that not to show up anymore," Ms. Paolinelli said. The foreclosure and bankruptcyoccurred after she failed to sell her home, which had fallen by more than $200,000 in value, she said. "It's a little embarrassing when they run your credit and you know they're going to see that because it always comes up. . . . It was once in my life."

Mortgage foreclosures stay on credit reports for up to seven years dating back to the missed payment that resulted in the foreclosure. Foreclosure starts, the first stage in the process, peaked in 2009 at 2.1 million, according to Attom Data Solutions. They totaled nearly 1.8 million in 2010 and remained above one million during each of the next two years.

Personal bankruptcies are more complicated and can stay on credit reports for seven to 10 years.

Consumers who filed in 2007 for Chapter 7 protection -- the most common type of bankruptcy, in which certain debts are discharged and creditors can get paid back from sales of consumers' assets -- are now starting to see those events fall off their reports.

Some 500,000 Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases were filed in 2007, a figure that swelled to nearly 1.1 million in 2010, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.

Chapter 13 bankruptcies, in which consumers enter a payment plan with creditors, usually stay on reports for at least seven years. Those filings reached a recent peak of nearly 435,000 in 2010 and are set to start falling off reports this year.

Fresh starts for credit reports are likely to help boost originations of large-dollar loans for cars and homes. Consumers have a greater chance of getting approved for financing if they apply for loans after negative events fall off their reports, in particular from large banks that have stuck to strict underwriting criteria, says Morgan Whitacre, who oversees consumer-loan underwriting at Bank of America Corp.

Credit-card lending, already on the rise, could increase further as a result of fresh starts. Consumers who have one type of bankruptcy filing removed from their credit reports on average experience a roughly $1,500 increase in spending limits and rack up $800 more in credit-card debt within three years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Geoffrey Page, of Rockford, Ill., is a potential beneficiary. The 59-year-old has nine months to go until his financial knocks from the downturn are wiped away.

Mr. Page filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after his house went into foreclosure. He has lived off cash since then, and says he has been rejected for a student loan for his son and for a car loan.

Already, though, he has a taste of what things could be like after the bankruptcy is cleared. Mr. Page, a quality coordinator at a hospital, says after the mortgage default fell off his credit reports, he began receiving more credit-card and personal-loan solicitations.

Mr. Page has been renting since he filed for bankruptcy.When that falls off his credit reports as expected next year, he says he will likely look to buy a house.

Finance & Markets: Analysis -- The Quants: The Machines Still Can't Match the Insights of Humans

[Machines and their masters are the undisputed new kings of Wall Street]

Man vs. machine. It is an old, well-trodden debate. There is little question that technological advances have forever changed and improved our lives in ways big and small. But now, some are predicting that machines and their algorithms will supplant humans in the investment firm of the future.

I will be the first to admit that technology helps me do my job better. I still remember my days of skimming through S&P tear sheets to find new ideas. Now a phone in my pocket can provide everything from tick-by-tick stock quotes to pages upon pages of corporate filings.

But here is the thing: data alone isn't enough. As Albert Einstein once supposedly said, "Information is not knowledge." Those promoting artificial intelligence would lead one to believe it is all about replicating human judgment in a superior manner. The data part may be easy for machines but the human part isn't. This is where computers meet their limits and our brains can triumph. Much of the investment world is captivated by using quantitative models to solve math problems when so much of investment success involves untangling behavioral problems through slow, hard, qualitative analysis.

In the world of entertainment, computers can reproduce a realistic image of a person but only actors can capture all of our complex paranoias, eccentricities and distinct imperfections. Computers simply cannot mimic these idiosyncrasies. The same could be said of investing. Successful long-term investors exploit inefficiencies caused by human error and frailty.

Herein lies the difference between information and insight. The "art" part of investing is the insight. Great investors don't require great quantities of information. Not to mention, purely quantitative models can also be guilty of instilling a false illusion of precision. Many have been mistakenly led to believe that a valuation based upon a 20-page spreadsheet is automatically more accurate than a short, intuitive estimate of intrinsic value calculated on the back of an envelope. Just ask Warren Buffett, who certainly doesn't need reams of financial data to produce his remarkably simple and yet astute valuations.

The bottom line is that algorithms have their limits.

During the crash of 1987, computers couldn't handle the emotional irrationality exhibited by the market activity and ultimately exacerbated it. Meanwhile, some human investors saw the absurdity of the selloff and reacted intuitively without revising models and adjusting algorithms. Our strong results in 1988 were driven by the fact that we called our clients on Black Monday and asked for more money.

Sure, machines can be cheaper and maybe even easier to deal with than people. Computers are often right, but they also can fail spectacularly when things reach extremes or new patterns arise.

Investor predicts machine learning will dominate lucrative Big Data future

Machine learning poses a threat to equity hedge funds within the next decade as the technique becomes powerful enough to forecast market moves better than humans, one of the earliest investors in the industry has predicted.

Jeff Tarrant , the founder of Protg Partners, said that the model of hedge funds charging "2 and 20" - a 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent performance fee - for investing in large-cap stocks rising and falling "doesn't work" and is ripe for disruption.

He pointed to the overhaul of other industries in the past decade at the hands of engineers and scientists.

"Jeff Bezos picked off the bookstore business. Apple picked off the music business and Netflix totally changed television. Now [machine learning] is going to pick off the hedge funds," he said.

Mr Tarrant is launching a business to back up that theory that will invest solely in start-up investment funds that employ artificial intelligence. Protg's new business, dubbed Mov37, will invest in as many as 10 managers through either seeding them or investing directly, and is targeting total investments of up to $1bn.

While many of the biggest systematic hedge funds, which use computer algorithms to make trading decisions, have already started employing machine-learning techniques, Mr Tarrant believes it is the young emerging managers who will succeed in disruption.

The excitement over the potential for AI to unlock lucrative patterns in the swelling sea of "Big Data" comes as money floods into computer-driven hedge funds, while the rest of the industry struggles with middling performance and outflows.

Mr Tarrant has worked in the hedge fund industry for more than 30 years. He worked for funds including Berkeley Asset Management, co-managing one of the earliest fund of hedge funds.

So-called "quantitative" hedge funds notched up their eighth straight year of client inflows in 2016, doubling assets from 2009 to $918bn, according to Hedge Fund Research, a data provider.

AI is an important, even necessary tool to parse through the reams of digital data the world now produces. IDC estimates that the amount of digital data will reach 44 zettabytes (trillions of gigabytes) by 2020, an amount so big that if it was loaded on iPad Air tablets, the stack would reach from earth to the moon more than six times over.

Eric Schmidt , executive chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company, told hedge fund managers last week that he believes that in 50 years, no trading will be done without computers dissecting data and market signals.

"I'm looking forward to the start-ups that are formed to do machine learning against trading, to see if the kind of pattern recognition I'm describing can do better than the traditional linear regression algorithms of the quants," he added.

"Many people in my industry think that's amenable to a new form of trading," said Mr Schmidt.

Quants' Best Strategy Is From the 17th Century

Among the biggest stories in asset management over the past decade or two has been the rise of so-called quantitative investing. I say "so-called" because the label can be misleading. Catchwords like "quantitative" and "systematic" are becoming more common but these terms are nebulous. People use them to mean all kinds of things.

What matters more is firms' philosophical approach to the discipline of investment management. The most effective way to address hard problems like forecasting asset prices or optimizing portfolios is, in my view, the same as for any other extraordinarily complex challenge: Use the scientific method. Doing so not only brings greater rigor and integrity to the investment process, but it also helps us combat a wide range of harmful but common cognitive and emotional biases. The availability of massive amounts of data and cutting-edge technology only magnifies the power of a scientific approach.

The Information Age certainly is revolutionizing investment management, just as it has done in so many other industries. The amount of data created in the world has been growing exponentially for years, and continues to do so. It is a torrent of structured and unstructured information that comes from an incredible variety of sources exchanges, sensors, satellites, web traffic, shipping traffic and the list keeps getting longer. The availability of so much data means that a once-unimaginable amount of information exists today to make decisions.

Handling all that data is a herculean task. Finding, ingesting, storing, parsing, normalizing, and delivering it would be utterly impossible to do manually. Automating these processes clearly requires significant investment and innovation in engineering. And the challenges don't stop there. Making efficient use of the output likewise requires significant research and expertise in data science, modeling, and related analytical techniques increasingly including applications of artificial intelligence.

It may be tempting to take for granted our ability to do each of these well, but don't be fooled. Using the power of advanced algorithms and huge data sets to uncover valuable economic, behavioral, or market insights takes a classically scientific mind-set. That means basing the entire endeavor from data collection to trade execution and beyond on the formulation of carefully crafted hypotheses, followed by a recurring process of measurement, learning, and adjustment.

Culture matters and doesn't change overnight. Instilling a scientific mind-set at an organizational level is more complex than it might seem, especially when an asset manager seeks to hire trained scientists to work alongside traditional industry professionals (as opposed to the reverse). The cultural challenges become evident even when the goal is machine-assisted human trading, but they become glaring when the goal is machine-driven trading with human assistance.

It is worth bearing in mind that not all quantitative strategies are scientific. For example, a manager might use algorithms to compute moving averages as part of a trading strategy. Without continually iterating through the steps of hypothesis formulation and testing, however, the exercise becomes something less than empirical and the results may be disappointing.

Ultimately, the greatest beneficiaries of a more scientific approach to investing are asset owners, be they individual retirees or large institutions. While the scientific method has been central to the advancement of human inquiry since the 17th century, investment managers have been a little slow on the uptake. The shifts we are seeing in the industry today represent a welcome, if overdue, move in that direction.

The bottom line is that algorithms have their limits. Facebook Inc. just announced it is hiring 3,000 "humans" to police its site for violent and inappropriate content. In keeping with that old saying about pornography that "you know it when you see it," machines have a hard time judging disturbing material. For now, you can screen for words but not ethical content there is no comprehensive algorithmic solution.

Another such algorithmic failure occurred during the crash of 1987 when computers couldn't handle the emotional irrationality exhibited by the market activity and ultimately exacerbated it. Meanwhile, some human investors saw the absurdity of the sell off and reacted intuitively and quickly without revising models and adjusting algorithms. Our strong results in 1988 were driven by the fact that we actually called our clients on Black Monday and asked for more money.

Sure, machines can be cheaper and maybe even easier to deal with than people. Computers are often right, but they also can fail spectacularly when things reach extremes or new patterns arise.

Humans don't need to be right all of the time; only when it really matters. True creative genius of the Beethoven, John Lennon/Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder kind is quirky and impossible to replicate.
