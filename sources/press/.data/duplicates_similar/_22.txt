Markets
Fed Scrutinizes Capital One-ING Deal

The Federal Reserve asked Capital One Financial Corp. to respond to questions that appear aimed at determining whether the proposed acquisition of ING Groep NV's U.S. online-banking business would create a bank so large and complex that its failure would pose a risk to the financial system.

Capital One, the ninth-largest bank in the U.S. by deposits, was pressed by the Fed in an Aug. 29 letter for details about "the nature and dollar volume" of financial activities in which both companies are involved. The two-page letter also listed various financial markets that were troubled during the financial crisis, such as commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, lending to foreign institutions through foreign-exchange swaps and derivatives trading.

Fed officials asked Capital One to describe any markets where the McLean, Va., bank and ING Direct USA are market makers and to report information about exposure to counterparties.

Several banking-industry experts said they couldn't recall any previous proposed acquisitions where the Fed asked some of the questions sent to Capital One.

Following last year's Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, the Fed now must consider whether specific mergers and acquisitions would increase overall risk to the financial system.

"It's almost like it's a test case," said Phil Swagel, a former assistant secretary at the Treasury Department who now is a professor at the University of Maryland. "Whatever the Fed decides in the end, they're going to have to explain it very carefully." The Fed declined to comment.

Capital One is set to pay $9 billion for ING Direct USA. The bank has also announced plans to buy the U.S. credit-card business of HSBC Holdings PLC for about $2.6 billion.

If regulators approve the ING deal, Capital One would become the fifth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, and its assets would swell to about $300 billion. If the deal with HSBC goes through as well, Capital One would become the seventh-biggest in the country by assets, according to SNL Financial. Bank of America Corp. is the largest U.S. bank in assets, with nearly $2.3 trillion.

Capital One said it responded to the Fed's letter on Friday and that its answers show that "we are not engaged in the kind or level of activities that raise the systemic risk issues that the Dodd-Frank Act sought to address." Capital One said it will remain a "traditional bank" and hold just 1.5% of total U.S. deposits.

Some consumer groups and critics of large banks claim the Capital One-ING Direct deal would create the same type of sprawling, intertwined, excessively risky megabank discouraged by the Dodd-Frank law. U.S. banking regulators haven't made it clear exactly how they will determine if a financial institution is systemically risky, though bank-holding companies with at least $50 billion in assets are subject to stricter capital, leverage and other regulatory requirements.

Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.), who co-wrote Dodd-Frank, prodded the Fed to expand its review of the proposed takeover by Capital One. As a result, regulators will hold public meetings to collect more information on the deal, starting Sept. 20. The last such meetings occurred in 2008 as part of Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial Corp.

"In the past, there was this carte blanche adherence to the notion that bigger is better," said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.

He added that because of the year-old financial-overhaul law, regulators are toughening their oversight to make sure they don't allow creation of "a riskier financial institution that the taxpayer could be on the hook for."

Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a consulting firm, said she was surprised by the level of regulatory scrutiny in the Capital One-ING deal because "it didn't put Capital One into a new business line or do anything that rang bells."

Rep. Spencer Bachus (R., Ala.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the Fed's move to expand its inquiry. "With the banking industry dominated by much larger institutions, claims that a bank with 1% of total U.S. banking liabilities would be 'too-big-to-fail' seem unreasonable," Mr. Bachus said in an Aug. 31 letter to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.

Google's Search Leads to Motorola's Search Leads to

Google is hoping to secure the long-term future of its business -- by turning that business on its head.

With its proposed $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, Google is jumping into the cut-throat, low-margin business of hardware. Even for a company with as varied ambitions as Google, this is a risky deal.

Google's willingness to buy Mobility highlights how much it needs to protect its Android mobile operating system, now caught up in a raging patent fight. Along with other Android-powered handset makers such as Samsung and HTC, Mobility has been sued for patent infringement by Apple and Microsoft.

Google, until now largely on the sidelines of that fight, has good reason to get directly involved. As an increasing portion of people's Web surfing happens on mobile devices, Android gives Google a position in mobile advertising. Having snared 47.7% of global smartphone shipments by operating system in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics, it is clear why Android threatens rivals like Apple and Microsoft.

Google's deep cash resources should strengthen Android's legal defenses. Moreover, Google will inherit Mobility's portfolio of 17,000 patents, a critical weapon at a time when intellectual property is becoming crucial in mobile.

The risks are big. Google's ownership of Mobility could undermine what has been Android's big advantage: namely, its support by multiple handset makers. While Google said it would continue to keep the platform open to device makers and operate Mobility as a separate business, Mobility immediately becomes first among equals with a privileged view of the Android development pipeline.

Mobility is one of the smaller Android handset makers, holding just 4% of the smartphone market in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics, compared with Samsung's 17.5% and HTC's 11%. If either of those companies hedged their bets by making phones running other operating systems -- perhaps Windows -- Android could suffer.

At first glance, the price Google is paying seems reasonable, at least in light of Nortel Networks' recent $4.5 billion sale of its 6,000 patents. After excluding the value of cash, deferred tax assets and Mobility's cable-set top box business, Google is paying less than $6 billion for Mobility's patent portfolio, Sanford C. Bernstein estimates.

Longer-term returns are the issue. With its revenue growing annually at around 10%, Mobility is sure to dilute Google's revenue growth, which only in the past couple of quarters had accelerated to around 30% after a long slowdown. And the purchase of a hardware manufacturing business will likely hurt Google's margins.

Offense may be the best form of defense. But this may be one deal that Google is defending for a long time to come.

Euro Zone Counts the Cost of Survival

The latest bill to save the euro zone from immediate collapse has arrived: 22 billion euros and counting.

That is how much the European Central Bank spent in the week ending Aug. 9 buying euro-zone government bonds.

The ECB succeeded in its primary aim of calming the market.

But the bigger question is whether and when the ECB can stop buying.

The ECB so far has got plenty of bang for its buck.

Italian and Spanish 10-year government bond yields are now around 5%, below the danger zone north of 6% that sparked panic in early August.

But the stakes are higher than before. Previous purchases targeted the relatively small markets of Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

The ECB has to splash more cash to move the Spanish and Italian government bond markets, which stand at roughly 2 trillion euros combined.

As a result, its holdings of bonds have risen 29% to 96 billion euros after just two days of buying Spanish and Italian debt.

It is not clear how much more the ECB will need to spend. Worst-case estimates from some analysts run to hundreds of billions of euros. In thin summer markets, with the immediate panic past, the ECB may be able to ease off.

But the real test could come when Spain and Italy resume debt sales in late August and early September. Even though the ECB is looking to hand over purchases to the European Financial Stability Facility later in the year, it may yet be forced to support the market for a longer time and with larger amounts than it might prefer.

After all, the EFSF comes with a cap on purchases built in, given its 440 billion euro size.

In the meantime, the clamor for common euro-bond issuance as a way to end the crisis is building. Germany has slapped down the idea again as a non-starter without greater centralized budget control. But the ECB's rescue operation demonstrates the need for a permanent solution.

A rising mountain of bonds at the ECB and EFSF will only show that investors continue to lack confidence in the euro zone's finances.

Nokia Should

Not Pop Cork

on Rivals' Deal

Two of your competitors getting together is usually cause for concern rather than celebration. But shares in Nokia rose 9% Monday on news Google is to buy rival handset manufacturer Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. The Google-Mobility tie-up may be good news for Nokia's own partnership with Microsoft. But there is no certainty it is more than a short-term game-changer for Nokia's shares.

Google's deal may imply a value of just under $6 billion for Mobility's patent portfolio, estimates Sanford C. Bernstein. That would translate into $353,000 apiece for its 17,000 patents. Last month, a portfolio of Nortel's patents was acquired by a consortium including Apple and Microsoft for around $750,000 apiece. Based on those prices, Nokia's 42,000 patents could be worth between $15 billion-$32 billion, the latter well above its $22 billion market capitalization.

Still, it isn't clear how many of those are just pending applications, or who the buyer might be now that Google has signed a big deal. The existing partnership with Microsoft means the software giant already benefits from Nokia's intellectual property.

Another hope for Nokia bulls is that the Google-Mobility tie-up will disadvantage rivals such as Samsung running phones based on Google's Android operating system. But Google says the Android system will remain open and Mobility will receive no special treatment. For now at least, Android's strength, and part of the reason it dominates the smartphone market, is Google's success in keeping multiple vendors happy.

Nokia says many are keen to see a third operating system to rival Android and Apple. But with no idea what the new Nokia Windows phones will look like, it is hard to get too excited about their prospects. The same could be said for Nokia's shares.

Overheard: Scooped

"Fracking" has a new victim: ice-cream. Hydraulic fracturing, the controversial oil- and gas-drilling method, is causing tremors in a corner of the food industry.

Guar gum, produced mostly in India, helps thicken foods ranging from ketchup to ice-cream. Problem is, it also is useful in fracking fluid. With the surge in fracking, guar demand has rocketed.

Having often languished at under 50 cents a pound, guar gum has recently changed hands at over $3, according to IMR International's Dennis Seisun, publisher of the catchy "Quarterly Review of Food Hydrocolloids".

Food manufacturers will have to scramble for guar supplies or seek alternatives. For oil majors, guar is a relatively small expense. The added bonus for them is that, given fracking's many environmental critics, it is nice to be able to use something so harmless you can eat it.

Shifting Reserve Focus

Will the U.S. debt hurricane land Asian sovereign investors in the land of Oz? The recent struggle to come up with a coherent plan to tame the U.S. deficit, coupled with stubbornly low economic growth, are both reasons for Asian countries to seek a home for part of their reserves in other triple-A-rated countries like Australia.

Even a small shift in portfolio allocation by major investors like China away from Treasurys could mean big movements in smaller sovereign-debt markets. '

For example, there is only A$195 billion (US$213.93 billion) of Australian sovereign debt, versus more than $9 trillion of Treasurys outstanding.

For the likes of China, actually selling down Treasurys would risk undermining the value of its existing $1.2 trillion investment. But when it comes to new flows into reserves there is more room for maneuver. And the numbers are still big.

Foreign reserves in China rose $350 billion in the first half of the year.

The search for alternatives has already begun. Korea's central bank said Tuesday that it had purchased 25 metric tons of gold in July, at a cost of $1.2 billion. And the U.S. Treasury's own data show Korea actually selling down its holdings of Treasury securities by $3.7 billion in the first five months of the year.

Data on China's pattern of foreign-exchange purchases is less reliable. But here, too, the evidence points to a shift away from dollar debt.

Research by Standard Chartered suggests that U.S. Treasury purchases by China in the first four months of the year were equal to just 23% of the increase in reserves, compared with an average of 64% in the same period from 2007 to 2010.

Gold is not the only alternative investment being explored. Bankers say Asian countries are already moving into sovereign debt in Australia and Canada. Both are resource-based economies with stable growth prospects, and debt to gross-domestic-product ratios considerably lower than in the U.S. Their sovereign bonds are triple-A rated and yields in Australia at least are considerably higher than in the U.S.

These markets are too small to house more than a fraction of Asia's reserves, lack the liquidity of the U.S. and have currency risk given the highly valued Australian dollar.

But by the same logic, even allocation of a fraction of flows would be enough to move markets.

The U.S. remains under the cloud of a possible downgrade. As Asian sovereigns make their slow decisions on whether, and how to diversify, more nimble investors still have a chance to get there before them.

HSBC's Gulliver Faces

Long March to His Target

Stuart Gulliver hasn't wasted time stamping his mark on HSBC Holdings. In five months, the U.K. bank boss has closed businesses in Poland and Russia, put 195 U.S. branches up for sale, announced 30,000 job cuts and set ambitious financial targets.

For such a conservative institution, this is a revolution. But Mr. Gulliver can't afford to let up on the radicalism if HSBC is to hit his return-on-equity target of 12% to 15% on a Basel III basis by 2013.

True, some things are already going Mr. Gulliver's way. First-half earnings were better than expected, up 34% from the same half of last year, largely due to double-digit revenue growth across many emerging markets; an 11% rise in Asian customer loans is encouraging evidence that HSBC is finding ways to deploy its vast deposit surplus.

HSBC also benefited from rising interest rates in much of Asia, where the lion's share of its deposit surplus is based, helping to boost its deposit margins. And impairments fell further than expected, down 30% in the first half of 2011 to $5.3 billion. The improved commercial- and retail-banking performance helped offset a 12% decline in investment-banking profits, reflecting weaker capital-market activity amid the sovereign-debt crisis.

But Mr. Gulliver's immediate headache is HSBC's cost base. Although the cost-income ratio in the second quarter at 54.4% was the best since the same quarter in the previous year, it is still some way above the 2013 target of 48%-52%. That partly reflects the lag effect as HSBC runs down its U.S. consumer business, but worryingly also reflects rising staff costs amid a bidding war for talent in emerging markets.

The planned job cuts -- equivalent to 10% of the work force -- should go a long way to achieving his target of as much as $3.5 billion of savings by 2013. But that alone won't be enough to lift the shares from a current multiple of 1.3 times forecast 2012 tangible book value.

The real prize is cultural: If Mr. Gulliver can instill greater dynamism into a traditionally complacent organization without sacrificing risk management, that really would be a revolution.

Macarthur, Peabody

Playing War Games

Even as tensions cool in Washington, things are turning hostile in St. Louis. Peabody Energy, headquartered there, is going directly to shareholders of Australia's Macarthur Coal after its takeover offer was rejected.

It isn't clear why Peabody and Macarthur couldn't reach a deal. Macarthur indicated Monday it would recommend an offer of 16 Australian dollars (US$17.55) a share -- about 3% above Peabody's current offer and a level Peabody was ready to pay if Macarthur stopped shopping itself around. Macarthur, however, wants more flexibility and some extra requirements, such as boosting the price to A$18 if Peabody secured more than 90% of the shares. Even so, hostilities seem premature.

Rationalizing brinkmanship is arguably oxymoronic. But one key factor is that China's Citic and South Korea's Posco own about 31% of Macarthur and likely are holdouts. This may explain the additional A$2 a share that Macarthur seeks for a full takeover.

Macarthur's board might also be at pains to demonstrate rigor on pricing to deter any litigious shareholders. Merger-objection suits in the U.S. have mushroomed from 21 in 2001 to 353 in 2010, according to analytics firm Advisen Ltd.

Still, Peabody has co-opted steelmaker ArcelorMittal, which owns 16% of Macarthur; so only another 34% of shareholders need to accept the offer for Peabody to gain majority ownership. What is more, currency moves and Peabody's agreement to fund a dividend of as much as 16 Australian cents a share for Macarthur's shareholders mean that, as of Monday, the already punchy bid had climbed 4% in U.S. dollar terms since it was first announced. Peabody also knows that Macarthur's stock fell sharply after an earlier bid last year petered out, providing some incentive to deal.

Hostilities having commenced, Macarthur's stock price now hovers just above Peabody's offer. But given the limited gap between the two sides, those banking on a true bidding war may be displaying a bit too much aggression themselves.

The Property Report: Australian Cities Climb List of Costliest to Live In

SYDNEY -- A stronger Australian dollar and surging demand spurred by a mining boom has made Australian cities among the least affordable in the world for skilled expatriates, according to a survey by consulting firm Mercer.

Sydney, Australia's largest city, is the 14th most expensive city in the world, up from 24th a year ago, according to Mercer, while the mining capital of Western Australia, Perth, rallied 30 places to 30th place. Melbourne rose 12 places to rank 21st. Brisbane rose 24 places to 31st.

After a near 30% rise in the value of Australian dollar in the past year and a mining boom described as a "once in a century" opportunity, Australia now has four of the 31 most expensive cities in the world. Thanks to seven interest rate increases by Australia's central bank and rising demand for iron ore and coal in China, the country's currency has leapfrogged in the past year to levels not seen in three decades. The findings of the Mercer survey will add to fears that Australia's competitiveness could be hit by the rising cost of living.

"We need foreign labor to meet our skills shortages and this makes it a lot harder because it erodes foreigners' savings pretty quickly," said Matthew Robinson, senior economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

Mercer's annual cost-of-living survey covers 214 cities across five continents and measures the comparative cost of more than 200 items in each location, including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. Luanda, the capital of Angola, ranked as the world's most expensive city for expatriates for the second year in a row, the result of a boom from the development of the African nation's oil industry.

Singapore moved into eighth place from 11th, ahead of Hong Kong, which fell one spot to ninth.

"Since the [Hong Kong] dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the devaluation of the U.S. dollar had no impact on the ranking," said Connie Leung, Mercer's Hong Kong business leader for information products.

Like Angola, the ability to attract skilled workers remains one of the few risks to Australia's mining boom. Economists worry about what rising living costs could mean for tempting expatriates to its shores. Last week, the training and work force development minister of Western Australia state, Peter Collier, set off on a 10-day recruiting trip to the U.K. and Ireland, noting that 109 billion Australian dollars (US$116.2 billion) of projects under way in the state need workers.

Rising inflation, as in many booming economies in Asia, poses the most immediate risk to economic growth in the Pacific nation and is expected to force the Reserve Bank of Australia to increase rates again this year to keep inflation below its 3% target.

To be sure, from a housing standpoint Australia historically has been more expensive than many other regions thanks to the country's coastal cities and quality of life -- two things that should continue to attract foreign workers.

"Despite a rise in the cost of living, the Australian lifestyle is still very appealing and our relatively strong economy and business growth opportunities mean employers are likely to absorb any short-term increases associated with relocating staff," said Georgina Harley, head of Mercer's information product solutions business in Australia and New Zealand.

THE OUTLOOK
The U.S. Economy
Falling Dollar Boosts Exports, Brings Risks

U.S. exports of such things as soybeans, semiconductors and mining machinery generally have enjoyed the descent of the dollar over the past decade.

Since hitting a peak in February 2002, the dollar is down about 28%, according to an inflation-adjusted index from the Federal Reserve based on the values of a wide variety of other currencies. That has helped boost U.S. exports -- the latest international trade figures, for May, are due out Tuesday -- and raised the dollar value of U.S. corporations' overseas earnings.

So should Americans hope the dollar keeps sinking? Not necessarily. Aside from making U.S. products cheaper for foreigners, a weaker dollar raises the cost of imported items Americans want or need. Worse, if the dollar falls too far or too fast, foreign investors and creditors will lose confidence in the U.S. economy.

"We shouldn't think that driving the dollar to the bottom of the sea is the answer to all our problems," said Robert Dye, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc.

So far, the U.S. has mostly seen the upside of a down dollar. U.S. exports of goods last year were $1.3 trillion, up from $697 billion in 2002, when the dollar's slide began.

Much of that $600 billion rise in annual U.S. exports was due to growing demand for food and manufactured goods in fast-growing economies such as China, India and Brazil. But roughly a quarter of that increase likely stemmed from the weaker dollar, which made those goods cheaper in foreign-currency terms, said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sAnalytics, estimated that the lower dollar accounted for a third of the export growth.

In a what-if scenario run for The Wall Street Journal, IHS Global Insight examined the likely effects of a further sharp drop in the dollar.

The firm's current forecast assumes the value of the dollar will be roughly flat over the next several years. If, however, the dollar fell by an additional 20% over the next eight quarters, the IHS model shows that exports in 2015 would be 12% higher than otherwise predicted. Unemployment would be 5.3%, compared with 6.7% under the steady-dollar assumption. Consumer-price inflation would be 3.3% in 2015, compared with 2%.

The rise in the inflation rate predicted by the model might sound like a reasonable trade for the projected drop in unemployment. But, of course, models aren't perfect, and there is no assurance that a 20% drop in the dollar would produce such results.

Even a modest increase in inflation might make bond investors jumpy. If so, they would demand higher yields on bonds to compensate for greater risks that inflation will shrink their returns. Big foreign investors in U.S. government debt also might recoil if the dollar fell too far, forcing the U.S. to pay higher rates. Higher borrowing costs probably would slow the economy and increase unemployment.

Any drop of more than about 5% a year in the dollar "would be more of a problem for the economy than a plus," Mr. Zandi said. "A decline of that magnitude would suggest that global investors are pulling away from U.S. stocks, bonds and other assets."

What's more, if the dollar started sliding, it might be hard to stop. A falling currency can engender panic that causes it to drop far below what many economists would consider a reasonable value.

Even so, some U.S. manufacturers want the dollar to fall sharply against the Chinese yuan -- a vital exchange rate because China is America's second-largest trading partner after Canada. The yuan exchange rate is closely controlled by the Chinese government. Daniel DiMicco, chief executive of Nucor Corp., a Charlotte, N.C.-based steelmaker, said China was "massively" subsidizing its exports by holding down the value of the yuan. Chinese officials reply to such charges by saying they already are allowing more "flexibility" in the exchange rate.

Mr. DiMicco backs long-stalled legislation in Congress that would give the Commerce Department a way to retaliate through higher import tariffs on goods from countries deemed to be deliberately suppressing the value of their currencies.

Such legislation tends to get support from companies like Nucor that do most of their manufacturing in the U.S. and face pressure from Chinese imports. U.S. companies with global manufacturing operations generally are more wary of any crackdown on Beijing.

"It's a diversion from the real problem, which is U.S. competitiveness," said William Lane, director of the Washington office of Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining machinery that makes nearly 70% of its sales outside the U.S. Rather than tangling with China over currency issues, he said, the U.S. should focus on such matters as reducing corporate taxes and regulation; improving roads, ports and other infrastructure, and pursuing free-trade agreements. It's best to address the currency issue through multilateral organizations and quiet diplomacy, "not by threatening a trade war," Mr. Lane said.

Members of the National Association of Manufacturers are so divided over the currency legislation that the trade group has decided not to take a position on it. For now, Caterpillar and the other proponents of quiet diplomacy seem to have the upper hand. Global manufacturers aren't tying their fate to any one currency.

Business
LSE and TMX Gain Backing for Proposed Merger

By Vladimir Guevarra

LONDON London Stock Exchange Group PLC on Monday gained the support of a group of senior Canadian businessmen for its bid to merge with Canada's TMX Group Inc., even as a rival bidder for TMX said it expects the LSE to fail in its effort.

The support from the unnamed group of businessmen, which includes the chairman of CI Financial Corp., TMX's second-biggest investor, comes after LSE Chief Executive Xavier Rolet said he is seeing "good momentum" in talks with shareholders of both LSE and TMX, ahead of Thursday's vote on their proposed merger.

A consortium of Canadian banks and financial firms, calling itself Maple Group Acquisition Corp., is pursuing a rival bid for TMX, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The war of words, with LSE and TMX on one side and Maple on the other, has heightened in recent days.

The shareholders' meetings of LSE in London and TMX in Toronto will be done at the same time, at around 2 p.m. GMT, and the result of their vote will be crucial in deciding if the LSE-TMX deal will proceed or whether TMX would have to consider the rival bid from Maple.

TMX has been rejecting the Maple bid, saying the financial terms of the bid are insufficient and that the deal would saddle TMX with too much debt.

LSE needs a simple majority vote from its shareholders to approve the deal, while TMX needs 67% of votes for approval.

Analysts have said that if the LSE-TMX deal proceeds, the combined company would become global a powerhouse in attracting listings from commodities and natural-resource companies. But if it fails, LSE could become a takeover target and Mr. Rolet's role may be put into question.

Mr. Rolet said Monday that "out of the five shareholder advisory firms that have spoken about this deal &all five have come out in favor of our deal," he said.

"This is relevant because publicly listed companies, mutual funds and other shareholders also have fiduciary obligations and getting endorsement from these advisory firms which are by the way independent is very important as far as shareholders are concerned," he said.

Maple spokesman Peter Block said via email, "After meeting with a number of investors over the last several weeks, Maple is confident that TMX shareholders will vote against the LSE takeover."

Later Monday, a group of Canadian business leaders threw their support to the LSE-TMX deal, saying the Maple bid is a threat to competition in the country.

"After careful review, it is clear to us that the proposed TMX-LSEG merger protects Canadian regulatory sovereignty, champions Canadian executive management, and maintains competition and a level playing field," the group said. "In contrast, the Maple Consortium has proposed the creation of a national monopoly in which our Canadian exchanges would be owned and managed by many of their most powerful participants, and thus would be burdened by significant conflicts."

The statement was signed by William Holland, chairman of CI Financial Corp., and 10 other senior executives, including John Albright, founder and managing partner of JLA Ventures & Blackberry Partners Fund; Paul Allison, chairman and CEO of Raymond James Ltd; Robert Blanchard, president of Haywood Securities; Eric Bushell, chief investment officer of Signature Global Advisors; and Thomas Caldwell, chairman and CEO of Caldwell Securities.

Data from Thomson Analytics show that CI Financial owns 5.76% of TMX through its subsidiary CI Investments, making it the second-biggest shareholder in TMX after Royce & Associates, which has 7.76%.

Personal Finance
Hungry for Information; Research firms battle to be the place to go for investors looking to learn more about ETFs

Exchange-traded funds have been one of the fastest-growing corners of the fund business, with assets under management in the European market alone growing by 31.5%, to $307.5 billion ( ¬210.3 billion), between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of this year. But it's not just fund companies that are sniffing opportunity.

Media and research firms from Standard & Poor's to IndexUniverse are competing to be the chief supplier of information to ETF investors, much the way Chicago-based Morningstar won over mutual-fund investors a generation ago. Amid the scramble, competitors including Morningstar itself have launched a slew of online tools, many of them free, such as rankings and search engines that help compare the hundreds of ETFs available.

The rivals have their work cut out for them. ETFs' complex mechanics   the funds typically resemble index mutual funds, yet trade throughout the day like stocks   make analyzing and ranking the investments tricky. Some aspects of ETFs' performance are unique, like how consistently their trading prices match the prices of their underlying holdings throughout the day.

ETF providers including BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard Group have joined the fray, loading their websites with far more sophisticated analysis and tools than most conventional fund companies offer.

Brokerage firms want to be seen and heard, too. Analysts at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Wells Fargo Advisors , for example, issue regular ETF market reports.

Morningstar, meanwhile, isn't resting on its laurels. It has made a number of improvements in the way it covers ETFs in recent years. The company now has 16 analysts who research ETFs, up from two just four years ago. It also has upgraded its website, adding up-to-the-minute price quotes and detailed information about bid-asked spreads.

In February, the company began calculating what it calls "total cost analysis". It starts with fund expenses, but also looks at whether a fund makes money by lending its underlying shares to short sellers   a frequent ETF practice   and what the fund does with that money. Another focus is liquidity: To what degree the share price will suffer when large blocks are sold.

While the new Morningstar tools are geared toward institutional traders and aren't available on the company's free website, morningstar.com, the company expects to incorporate findings from using those tools into its retail research.

Scott Burns, the head of Morningstar's ETF research team, says the company isn't done, either. The next step is to integrate the research of Morningstar's stock analysts. The aim, says Mr. Burns, is not just to gauge which technology or growth-focused ETF is best, for example, but also to discern whether a focus on technology or growth stocks is a good strategy in the first place. "You have to be able to answer both types of questions," he says.

Newer Entry

The most recent challenger to Morningstar is in many ways an unlikely one. Until ETFs hit the mainstream, Index Publications was a tiny trade publisher. Its flagship title, the Journal of Indexes (which it purchased in 1999 from Dow Jones & Co ., publisher of The Wall Street Journal), runs quirky articles on topics like how to define "midcap" stocks.

With ETFs putting a brighter spotlight on index investing, the company   often known by its Web moniker, IndexUniverse   has worked hard to win a larger audience. It has hired additional reporters and started a blog that focuses on more mainstream investing issues.

One of IndexUniverse's biggest efforts is a free website feature, introduced in March, that helps investors search for ETFs and related exchange-traded notes, or ETNs, in ways that aren't always possible on Morningstar's basic site.

One example: The tool allows investors to directly compare 11 products that target India, such as the Market Vectors Indian Rupee/USD ETN and the WisdomTree India Earnings ETF. Morningstar classifies the rupee fund in a currency category and the WisdomTree ETF in an Asia/Pacific stock category that also includes funds focused on Australia and South Korea. "It's a different perspective," says Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics for IndexUniverse.com.

Name recognition generally isn't a problem for Standard & Poor's . But the company, which started marketing its ETF research in 2009, wasn't necessarily known for fund research.

The result: a focus on ETFs' underlying stocks, rather than the funds themselves. S&P grades ETFs based on a blend of 10 criteria, including a tally of its equity analysts' opinions about each of an ETF's stock holdings; a separate tally of its credit analysts' opinions about those companies' financial health; and computer-driven measures such as scores tied to earnings and dividend growth. S&P accounts for some fund-oriented factors such as investment fees and trading costs as well. But it largely ignores three-, five- and 10-year returns.

A few caveats to keep in mind: S&P doesn't rank bond ETFs, because its methodology is so closely tied to its stock research. The company also makes comparatively little information available to small investors free of charge. The research is largely geared toward financial advisers, but some individual investors may have access to it through discount-brokerage accounts, an S&P spokesman says.

Tough Market

Winning a big following among investors for ETF research can be tough. New York-based Marco Polo XTF. launched its own ETF research website, xtf.com, in 2007. Among the site's innovations was one of the first attempts to help investors quantify the trading costs known as bid-asked spreads. Since then, XTF has hit some bumps, shutting down other business projects and changing ownership.

Chief Executive Mel Herman declines to specify how many subscribers pay for the company's "premium membership" but highlights successes such as a deal to make some of the company's research available through Fidelity Investments ' retail brokerage. "We're out there," he says. "We have a small marketing budget. We're not a household name, but we will be."

New York Hotels Fetch Luxury Price

By Kris Hudson

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust is purchasing a 49% share in six Manhattan boutique hotels for $152 million in the latest sign of the rising heat of New York's hotel market.

In the deal set to be announced Wednesday, Pebblebrook -- formed in 2009 by industry veteran Jon Bortz to buy hotels -- gained stakes in five Affinia properties and the Benjamin hotel, all in Midtown.

Pebblebrook will assume roughly $294 million of the hotels' debt.

Denihan Hospitality Group, the 49-year-old New York hotel concern led by siblings Patrick Denihan and Brooke Denihan Barrett, is retaining a 51% stake in the six hotels as well as management of the properties. The Denihans intend to use proceeds from the sale to expand their hotel brands -- the art-focused James and boutique Affinia -- beyond New York, Chicago, Washington and Miami.

"Our plan is to add two hotels per year, either owned or managed," Patrick Denihan said in an interview. Denihan Hospitality owns nine hotels and manages another four.

It and Pebblebrook will have equal say in operating the six hotels in their deal.

The deal's hefty price -- valuing the six hotels at $910 million, or roughly $526,000 a room -- highlights the confidence that investors have shown in the recovery of the U.S. hotel market, specifically in New York. The average per-room price for hotel deals in Manhattan stands at $447,487 in this year's second quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics.

One reason for the lofty price in the Denihan deal: Affinia and Benjamin rooms are much larger than typical hotel rooms, at 350 square feet to 750 square feet, many including kitchenettes. Manhattan rooms typically average 250 to 275 square feet, according to PKF Consulting USA.

What's more, the six hotels tend to command higher-than-average rates, even for Manhattan, ranging from $230 to more than $300 a night, according to Pebblebrook's Mr. Bortz.

That compares with an overall average rate of $239.58 for Manhattan hotels in the first five months of this year, according to Smith Travel Research.

Yet there are concerns for Manhattan hotels. The market's occupancy rates have receded lately after a sharp rise from 2009 to 2010, much due to the many new hotels opened in Manhattan this year and last.

From the first five months of 2009 to the same period in 2010, Manhattan occupancy rose by 7.1 percentage points, according to Smith Travel.

But since early 2010, occupancy has declined by two percentage points. Even so, rates continue to rise.

Mr. Bortz said he took into account the new hotel openings in the deal with Denihan. "This portfolio is located in and around Midtown," he said. "Most of the [new] supply is south" of there.

For Pebblebrook, based in Bethesda, Md., the deal brings its stable of U.S. hotels to 20. The real-estate investment trust has spent nearly $1.6 billion since its 2009 inception purchasing hotels such as the InterContinental Buckhead in Atlanta, the Viceroy in Miami and the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco.

So far, Pebblebrook has outpaced in its acquisitions and capital raising the two other so-called blind-pool hotel REITs, or those set up to buy properties, formed since 2009.

To be sure, Pebblebrook has its challenges. The REIT's second sale of stock in 2010 came at $17 a share in July 2010, below the $20 price in its 2009 initial public offering. Its third sale, last April, came at $21.60 a share. Rarely has the stock climbed well above that $20 IPO price, closing Tuesday up 71 cents, or 3.6%, at $20.37 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Since founding Pebblebrook, Mr. Bortz, 54 years old, said he and his team have spent an average of three days a week on the road examining hotels on the market and managing those they own. "We feel like we've been running a marathon," he said, "at a sprint pace."

Distressed Buyer Is Rewarded

---

San Francisco Firm Sees

Nice Return on the Sale

Of Buildings Bought Low

Some gutsy investors who paid rock-bottom prices at the market's low point are beginning to cash out.

Take the case of private-equity firm Tribeca Cos. This month it completed the last of a series of sales of a total of 12 San Francisco Bay-area apartment buildings in transactions valued at more than $40 million, according to Tribeca.

The San Francisco firm took control of the properties after buying their nonperforming mortgages from the buildings' lender, Swiss bank UBS AG, for about $31 million in late 2009. The apartments were formerly owned by the Lembi Group, which had been one of San Francisco's largest landlords.

Tribeca says it bought the properties at a price that yielded an overall annual return in the 6%-7% range and sold them in deals that yielded an overall return in the 4%-5% range.

"The reality is Tribeca took some risk by buying the note and were compensated," says Dan Safier, president of the privately held Prado Group of San Francisco, which last week bought nine of the properties containing about 155 apartment units.

Rent an Apartment

And Share a Car

Equity Residential, the country's largest residential real-estate investment trust, hopes its latest perk for its apartment tenants will drive traffic to its doors.

The company struck a deal with Zipcar Inc. to add car-rental services to more of its apartment communities in New York, Boston, Washington and Seattle.

By the end of the summer, more than 100 Zipcars are slated to be parked in Equity Residential communities, giving more than 17,000 residents access to the vehicles, the company says. A small number of the company's properties already had arrangements with Zipcar, but the program is being expanded and formalized.

Tenants receive discounts on Zipcar's membership fees and on hourly rates.

"It definitely is an amenity," says Tom Lebling, an Equity Residential senior vice president. Plus, having residents who don't have cars "frees up parking for other folks."

-- Dawn Wotapka

Still Spending

The most active investors during the boom years are back to buying property again, according to a new study by Real Capital Analytics.

Real Capital looked at the 100 most active buyers in 2006 and 2007 and found that 81 have made at least one acquisition since Jan. 2010. More than three quarters of the 81 defaulted on at least one mortgage during the current cycle.

Office Owners Seek to Cash In --- Big-Name Buildings Go on Block as Prices Boom; 'Who Knows What Market Will Be Like' in a Year?

By Eliot Brown

Owners of big-name office buildings in some U.S. cities are racing to put them up for sale to exploit surging prices before it is too late.

In recent weeks, owners of the Willis Tower in Chicago, Constitution Center in Washington, the Seagram Building in New York and numerous other large properties have put all or portions of them on the block. They are hoping to cash in on the near-boom-era prices being paid by yield-hungry investors discouraged by the volatility of stocks and low interest rates in the bond market.

The surge comes as the U.S. economy shows new signs of weakness, raising questions about the direction of office rents and vacancy rates.

"Who knows what the market will be like in a year or so?" says Tim Jaroch, one of the general partners who own the 1.4 million-square-foot Constitution Center.

In April, the total value of new sales listings of U.S. office buildings was $8.7 billion, according to real-estate research firm Real Capital Analytics. That was the highest level since 2008. Preliminary data for May show $10 billion in new listings, which would be the highest monthly total since late 2007.

Until recently, post-recession sales activity in the office market has been slow. Lenders have held onto distressed assets rather than sell them, frustrating many investors who hoped to take advantage of the pain of others. Even as values rise, many owners continue to resist selling because they don't like their options for investing the proceeds.

The sharp rise in values has come over the past year, a relatively short time frame in the real-estate market. Recent deals include the sale of 750 Seventh Ave. in New York's Times Square by Hines Interests for a surprisingly high $485 million and Beacon Capital Partners' sale of Market Square in Washington for a record $905 a square foot.

"We're making decisions to sell because we're achieving very fair values," said Fred Seigel, Beacon's president.

Last week, real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors reported that its index of Midtown Manhattan office-building values is up 88% since its mid-2009 nadir, back to within 15% of their 2007 peak. The index is tilted toward better quality buildings.

Beacon also is considering bringing to market 1211 Ave. of the Americas in coming weeks, for which the company would look to retrieve well above the $1.5 billion that it paid in 2006, according to people familiar with the matter. The 45-story property houses the headquarters of News Corp., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.

The strong appetite for office property is limited mostly to major cities. Suburban office markets, getting harder hit by the economic downturn, are suffering from weak vacancy and rent rates, putting a damper on investor demand and values.

Building owners in some office markets contrast sharply with the residential market, where home prices have declined for months. Last week, the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index reported home prices were down 4.2% in the first quarter of 2011.

Investors are more bullish on commercial property partly because there was relatively little overbuilding during the boom. Rents have been climbing in cities like New York and Washington, although they remain heavily dependent on job growth.

"There is still a lack of quality product for sale, and investors want to be in these markets," said Douglas Harmon, a broker at Eastdil Secured who is marketing the Willis Tower along with real-estate firm Newmark Knight Frank.

The financing market and interest-rate environment also is fueling the surge. Buyers are finding it easier and less expensive to borrow and, with interest rates at historic lows, even a relatively low yield on office property becomes attractive.

Indeed, the rise in value is being fueled more by trends in the capital markets than by improving rents. For example, in Midtown Manhattan, rents are still 35% below their peak, according to Cushman & Wakefield and growing less quickly than values.

To be sure, the sales numbers are still leagues below their 2007 peak, when buyers were able to borrow nearly the entire price of buildings. That year saw a peak $209 billion in office-building sales in the U.S., according to Real Capital. For 2011, real-estate advisory firm Jones Lang LaSalle projects $73 billion in office sales, up from $43 billion in 2010.

While new buyers are betting on a strong future in the market, the high prices -- back so rapidly from the market's trough -- have given some investors pause. Large New York City developers, including Douglas Durst, have said prices have risen too high to justify acquisitions.

Some owners are hedging their bets by selling stakes in buildings but retaining an interest to benefit if values keep rising. In Chicago, Hines recently began marketing a stake in the 1.4 million-square-foot One North Wacker Drive, a Hines spokeswoman confirmed. The owners of the Seagram Building also are looking for an investor to buy a piece of the property.

"You get to hold onto the real estate and you get to cash a big check," notes Darcy Stacom, vice chairman of CB Richard Ellis.

Bidders Eye Mall Portfolio

Seventeen U.S. shopping malls put on the block by Australian mall owner Westfield Group have attracted multiple early bidders in a closely watched sales process that will shed light on the value of mediocre malls amid the slow economic recovery.

While values of some property types like apartment buildings and office buildings in top markets are beginning to approach peak levels, investor appetite for retail property has been more subdued. The growing influence of online sales and the fallout from decades of overbuilding has made many retailers cautious about expansion in the U.S.

The sale of the Westfield portfolio will provide an important window into where values of the hundreds of malls throughout the country have reset. If the number of bidders is any indication, the news looks good for the seller.

Among those who have made nonbinding, preliminary bids is a partnership of mall owner CBL & Associates Properties Inc. and a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fund. Others include Australian investor Queensland Investment Corp.; a partnership of Starwood Capital Group and Madison Marquette; and mall owner General Growth Properties Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

Still others are studying parts of the 17-mall pool, including the Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, which is looking at Westfield's four Ohio malls, and O'Connor Capital Partners, which is studying a few of its East Coast properties, these people say. The identities of additional bidders considering the property, including two Canadian investors, couldn't be determined.

In total, the values that Westfield lists on its books for each of the malls exceeds $2.5 billion. Included in the Westfield malls for sale are Belden Village in Canton, Ohio; Connecticut Post mall in Milford, Conn.; Westland mall in Hialeah, Fla.; and Downtown Plaza in Sacramento, people familiar with the matter say. Binding offers are due at the end of this month.

Most of the bidders declined to comment on their offers. The broker handling the process for Westfield, Marty Cicco of Evercore Partners, didn't return calls seeking comment.

"We're looking at this as we would any other mall-acquisition opportunity," said Stephen Lebovitz, president and chief executive of mall owner CBL. "But it's at a very early stage of analysis at this point."

Sydney-based Westfield, which owns 55 U.S. malls, put the 17 properties on the market in April as it aims to refocus itself on its most lucrative U.S. properties. The 17 on the block mostly are considered B-grade malls, with annual sales of $300 to $380 a square foot. The industry average for enclosed malls is $351, according to Green Street Advisors Inc., a research firm that tracks real-estate investment trusts.

The values of such properties are particularly uncertain, given that the U.S. retail sector looks unlikely to return to its boom-time peaks for many years. To be sure, some locations continue to soar in value. Earlier this year, Inditex Group of Spain paid $324 million for a 40,000-square-foot store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.

But the overall vacancy rate at U.S. malls in the top 80 markets was 9.1% in the first quarter, according to Reis Inc., the highest since at least 2000. Retailers that are closing stores are doing so at middling and struggling properties, so buying a mediocre mall is a bet the economy and the consumer will come back stronger than skeptics expect.

"There's certainly a lot of interest from the investment community in figuring out what a B or C mall really is worth," says Benjamin Yang, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "They're looking for transactions to provide some indication of that."

The average sales price over the past 18 months for average to slightly upscale malls is $202 a square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Westfield isn't the only mall REIT looking to shed B- and C-grade properties. Simon Property Group Inc. has listed four struggling malls for sale. And General Growth, which ended a 19-month bankruptcy stint last November, has considered listing for sale 19 of its weakest malls. However, it also is pondering spinning off three dozen lower-quality malls as a stand-alone company.

Analysts say General Growth is considering buying and selling at the same time because the Westfield malls generally are of higher quality than those that General Growth is looking to unload. A General Growth representative declined to comment.

Meanwhile, it might be that the eventual buyer of the Westfield malls is a player from abroad. "There are so many B and C malls on the market that it's an opportunity for someone to step into an oligarchic industry and be that niche, B and C operator in U.S. malls," Mr. Yang says. "That might be attractive for someone who doesn't currently have a presence in U.S. malls."

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Why It's Time to Buy --- The Clouds Haven't Quite Parted, But the Long-Term Case for Home Ownership Is Looking Stronger

Corrections & Amplifications

Douglas C. Yearley Jr. is the chief executive of luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc. His last name was misspelled as Yearly in Saturday's Weekend Investor article on housing.

(WSJ June 9, 2011)

(END)

Back in June 2006, when the housing market peaked, the prospect of a five-year national housing bust seemed unimaginable to most people. And yet here we are, with the latest Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller index showing that prices hit new bear-market lows, falling back to 2002 levels nationally and to 1990s levels in some battered regions.

Despite all the gloom, however, there are growing indications that it is a good time to buy. Mortgage rates, which fell to 4.55% for the week ending June 2, according to Freddie Mac, are near 50-year lows. Homes have become more affordable than they have been in years: According to Moody'sAnalytics, the ratio of home prices to income is now 20.9% lower than the 15-year average through 2010, and 12.5% lower than the 1989-2004 average. A historic glut of homes, meanwhile, has created a buyer's market: There were about 15 million vacant homes in the U.S. last year, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. -- some 3.1 million more than normal.

Such conditions might not last long. Moody'sAnalytics predicts that the number of distressed sales will begin to fall in 2013, and that prices will begin to edge upward then. Home building is at a virtual standstill, so the supply overhang isn't likely to get much worse. Meanwhile, demographic indicators such as "household formation" -- the number of new households each year -- are on the rise, and promise to take a bite out of the glut in coming years.

The upshot: "While we might not see rapid growth in the next couple of years, there are a tremendous number of positive signs that could lead to a rebound," says Anthony Sanders, a real-estate finance professor at George Mason University.

The short-term outlook isn't encouraging. Job growth remains weak, foreclosure sales are making up more of the market, and economists are predicting that home prices will fall more in the coming months.

But the long-term benefits of homeownership remain very much intact. For now, at least, you can deduct the mortgage interest on your taxes -- a big perk for people in higher tax brackets. You get to paint your walls any color you wish, without having to clear it with a landlord. And assuming you can buy a home for about the same price as you can rent one, buying will give you the ability one day to live rent-free. Come retirement time, a paid-off mortgage means your monthly expenses are significantly reduced, and you have a chunk of equity to play with.

So what might the next five years look like? Once the foreclosure mess begins to clear up, say housing economists, the traditional drivers of the housing market -- demographics, affordability, loan availability, employment and psychology -- should take over.

Here is a glimmer of what the future may hold: While overall home prices fell by 7.5% in April over the same period a year earlier, according to CoreLogic, a Santa Ana, Calif., provider of real-estate data and analytics, if you exclude distressed sales, prices were off just 0.5%. So if you are in a market that isn't battered by foreclosures, you may be close to a bottom already.

"The regular marketplace is hanging tough," says CoreLogic chief economist Mark Fleming.

Here is a look at five key factors that will govern local markets over the next several years:

Demographics

Household formation fell during the economic downturn as a weak economy led some people to stay in school, double up with roommates or move in with family members. According to Moody'sAnalytics, the number of new households renting or owning a home dropped to 578,000 in 2008 from nearly 2 million in 2005, just before the peak of the housing boom.

But household formation increased to nearly 950,000 last year, says Moody's, and should average 1.2 million over the next decade.

That, combined with increased obsolescence and higher demand for second homes, should begin sopping up excess inventory in much of the country over the next two years, Moody's says.

"Whatever the excess supply of housing is, it is shrinking pretty fast," says Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist.

Some of the uptick in household formation is likely to come from the leading edge of the echo baby boomers, who have been waiting for the economy to recover before striking out on their own, says William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. That is likely to fuel an increase in demand for both rental apartments and starter homes.

The portion of people moving across the country has fallen to the lowest level since World War II, he adds. That is a sign that many people have put their lives on hold because of the weak economy.

"When things do pick up, there will be this pent-up demand for everything involved with starting a household," Mr. Frey says.

Of course, when prices in healthier regions begin to rise, many would-be sellers who have sat on the sidelines could begin putting homes on the market, muting the price gains at first, says Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Even so, she expects home prices to stabilize and begin to strengthen over the next two or three years.

There also are some powerful demographic cross-currents worth considering. The first baby boomers turned 65 in January, an age when demand for new homes falls and many begin to think about downsizing. "The baby-boom generation pushed prices up as they got older," says Dowell Myers, a professor of urban planning and demography at the University of Southern California. But in the coming years, "boomers will start flooding the market on the supply side" with larger homes, while fueling new demand for smaller properties with more services and amenities.

Affordability

Rising home prices made renting cheaper than buying in many parts of the country. But that dynamic has begun to change: Housing affordability, as measured by the ratio of median home prices to median household incomes, has fallen below pre-housing bubble levels in just over two-thirds of the country, according to an analysis of more than 380 metro areas by Moody'sAnalytics.

Renting is still cheaper than buying in most markets, but rising rents and falling house prices mean that, in some areas, this won't be the case for long. Buying a home is already cheaper than renting in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Orlando, Fla., according to Moody'sAnalytics. In other markets, including Dallas, Las Vegas and Sacramento, Cailf., the equation is likely to soon turn in favor of homeownership if current trends persist, the firm says.

In Ann Arbor, Mich., where home prices fell 11.2% between 2007 and 2010, according to Fiserv Case-Shiller, housing affordability has risen well above historical levels, according to Moody'sAnalytics.

That is good news for home buyers such as Steven Upton, a 42-year-old photographer, who in June will close on four-bedroom brick house on 10 acres in an upscale community in Ann Arbor. Mr. Upton paid $400,000 for the home, which previously listed for $600,000. "It's a tremendous deal," he says.

Before buying a house, it is wise to compare rental prices for similar properties. To be ultraconservative, wait until the monthly outlays, including taxes and insurance, are equal. You also could factor in the tax savings of owning, which would make buying more attractive even if the gross monthly outlay is slightly higher.

Employment

The strength of the housing market depends largely on the economy. Rising incomes and increased employment tend to give more would-be buyers confidence and buying power. For now, job growth remains sluggish: On Friday the Labor Department reported that just 54,000 jobs were created in May, far below expectations.

But signs of how a stronger job market could fuel housing demand are evident in the Dallas metro area, which added 83,100 new jobs in the 12 months ending in April -- the largest gain in the nation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Dallas never had a big housing boom or bust and has benefited from trade with Mexico, a strong telecommunications sector and a central location.

The opportunities for a job with more responsibility drew Duane and Linda Elmer to Dallas from Des Moines, Iowa, where Mr. Elmer was a banker for nine years. The couple has agreed to pay $415,000 for a four-bedroom, four-bath house with a Jacuzzi and pool. Their Des Moines home, purchased nine years ago for $410,000, is on the market for $390,000. "We are willing to take the loss for the opportunity to live in a more diverse community and to take a job with greater breadth of responsibilities," Mr. Elmer says.

Borrowers like the Elmers who are relocating for job opportunities are a big driver of home sales in nearby Plano, Texas, says Harry Ridge, a real-estate agent. He says such sales accounted for 20% of his business last year.

A similar influx of job seekers is fueling housing demand in the Washington area, where 25,700 new jobs were added in the 12 months since April 2010. Washington was the only one of the 20 cities tracked by Standard & Poor's and Case-Shiller that saw home prices rise both on a month-to-month and year-over-year basis.

Credit

Mortgage financing remains plentiful for borrowers with good credit scores and solid employment histories. But for borrowers who don't fit traditional lending standards, getting a loan can still be nearly impossible. In the first quarter, about 10% of banks tightened standards for nontraditional loans, according to the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, higher down-payment standards are locking some would-be buyers out of the market. Just 35% of renters have the minimum 3.5% down payment needed for an FHA loan on the median-priced home in their market, according to a recent survey by Zelman Associates.

Credit is likely to remain tight for at least the next six months, says Clifford Rossi, a former Citigroup Inc. consumer-lending executive who teaches at the University of Maryland.

But conditions should improve over time, he says: "There's no question that it will gradually get easier."

That will be welcome news to borrowers like Greg Silver. The 50-year-old real-estate developer would like to buy a second home, but hasn't been able to secure a jumbo mortgage because his income consists of capital gains from sales of the properties he develops. Mr. Silver closed three sales in the past 12 months, netting him a total of more than $25 million, but didn't record any capital gains in 2008 and 2009. Sure, he could use some of that cash to buy a home outright, but he would prefer to mortgage it, get the tax deduction and keep his cash free for business purposes.

"It's a little devastating," says Mr. Silver, who is living in Greenwich, Conn.

Psychology

The long-term case for buying over renting remains in force. Yet nowadays, "People are simply scared," says Aaron Galvin, chief executive of Luxury Living Chicago, which finds rental apartments for wealthy clients.

Mr. Galvin says he has seen a 30% increase in business in the last year, driven by would-be home buyers who can afford to purchase a property but are choosing not to do so.

The portion of Americans who believe homeownership is a safe investment dropped to 66% in the first quarter from 83% in 2006, according to Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage company.

But it isn't clear whether the fear will result in a prolonged change in attitudes, as during the Great Depression, or have little long-term impact, as was the case for the housing bust that shook California and the Northeast in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eighty-seven percent of people surveyed by Fannie Mae said they preferred owning to renting, though access to schools, control over one's environment and other quality-of-life issues now are seen as the key benefits of homeownership, with building wealth and other financial factors viewed as less important. In addition, 67% of renters surveyed by Zelman Associates said they planned to buy a home in the next five years.

Jeffrey Connor may be a bellwether for the future of the housing market. The 40-year-old finance director at a corporate law firm says he thought briefly about buying a house when he moved to Chicago from Washington in October. But he opted instead to rent a luxury two-story apartment in downtown Chicago for $3,559 a month. Mr. Connor says it will take substantial job growth and a sharp drop in foreclosures to convince him to buy.

"The market is clearly soft," he says, "especially when we consider it good news that the unemployment rate is hovering around 9% instead of 10%." Mr. Connor says he isn't worried about missing out on today's low interest rates and will consider buying once unemployment falls to 6%.

Other buyers are showing less willingness to wait for the absolute perfect time to buy. Doug Yearly, chief executive of luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc., told investors in May that "some of our clients, after waiting so long, are starting to move off the fence and into the market, motivated by attractive pricing, low interest rates and, most important, the desire to take the next step in their lives. The family with elementary-school kids and a puppy when the housing debacle began five years ago now has middle-school kids and the dog weighs 80 pounds."

Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Portfolio Strategy: Funds With Maximum Flexibility --- Some managers have done well mixing and matching disparate holdings; But it's not a sure thing

An increasing number of investors have been pouring money into so-called go-anywhere funds that give their managers wide latitude in their investments.

But some analysts caution that these funds vary just as widely in their approaches and performance. And that makes it difficult for investors to know how to fit them into their overall portfolio.

Since the end of March 2009, $146 billion has flooded into go-anywhere funds, bringing the total in assets to $415 billion, according to Strategic Insight. The allure: Broad flexibility gives managers the opportunity to look for the best investments instead of pigeon-holing them in a part of the market with limited prospects.

IVA Worldwide, a fund launched after the financial crisis, sits with $10 billion in assets. Its managers Charles de Vaulx and Chuck de Lardemelle decided to close the fund to new investors in February so they could stay nimble enough to move in and out of some smaller stocks and less liquid assets like high-yield bonds.

Having that kind of flexibility gives go-anywhere funds the ability to "cover a lot of ground that I can't," says veteran financial planner Vern Hayden, who says he doesn't have the resources to stay on top of so many markets and regions. Mr. Hayden allocates as much as 50% of his clients' assets at Hayden Wealth Management to these types of funds.

But the problem for investors is that if anything goes, there's no way to know beforehand where the money will go, which means such a fund may not complement other investments. In addition, it's difficult for investors to compare the myriad offerings that fall under the broad go-anywhere umbrella.

Some funds, for example, stick mostly with stocks, while others will shift among stocks, bonds and cash. Still others invest in just about anything -- from various private transactions and commodities to real estate and emerging markets, not to mention derivatives. Some funds tend to stick with holdings for a while, but others are much more tactical and prone to trading.

To complicate matters further, these kinds of funds don't fit neatly into the categories used by research firms Morningstar Inc. and Lipper since their mixes can change drastically.

"It's difficult to know exactly what is in those funds at any one time, and it messes up our asset allocation," says Gordon Tudor, a principal at San Diego-based financial advisory firm Wealth Analytics, which oversees $90 million in assets.

Mr. Tudor says he prefers instead to pick fund managers concentrating on certain areas of the market he wants, like international stocks or bonds.

To be sure, many of the managers who have run flexible funds understand the hesitation and work hard to boost comfort levels. Ivy Asset Strategy and IVA Worldwide managers issue monthly rather than quarterly updates, and some managers offer incredibly detailed communications on their market view as well as positions.

More than 70 go-anywhere funds have been introduced since the end of 2008, bringing the total to 254 at the end of April, according to fund researcher Strategic Insight. With so many new funds in play, analysts recommend sticking with managers who have gone through a bull and a bear market, and allocating primarily longer-term money to these funds. The reason: With their strong focus on curtailing risk, a lot of them also lag behind in go-go markets.

The popularity of these funds also means that many of them are much larger than they were a few years ago, which can make outperformance more difficult.

"These funds are not a panacea," says Ryan Leggio, a fund analyst at Morningstar. "Just because they go anywhere doesn't mean they can't have a terrible year."

Here are four funds that have been time-tested and that get high marks from advisers and analysts.

Launched in 1989, BlackRock Global Allocation is considered the grandfather of go-anywhere funds, investing assets throughout the world in stocks, bonds or cash. The $55 billion fund is managed very loosely around a benchmark of 60% stock and 40% fixed income. It regularly deviates from that allocation when it sees new opportunities.

Lately, that has meant boosting the fund's exposure to globally minded companies based in the U.S. to 37% from 26% at the end of 2007.

"Today, to the greatest extent at any time in my career, it is the biggest companies that are the most reasonably priced," says Dennis Stattman, senior portfolio manager of the fund. Like others, Mr. Stattman is cautious about government bonds and wary about inflation, putting just 26% of assets in fixed income. Over the past year, the fund has lagged behind peers as the market has favored riskier assets, but it ranks in the top third of Morningstar's world-allocation category over the past 15 years.

Run by noted contrarian Steven Romick, FPA Crescent can invest in private transactions such as farmland and building loans, as well as the usual stocks and bonds. Mr. Romick says the fund's allocations to exotic and illiquid assets always total less than 15%, in keeping with limits set by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He says the fund's exposure to farmland is small these days, in part because it is "getting too much attention."

The $6.4 billion fund has recently been focusing on inexpensive stocks of large companies with significant international exposure, and is paring back on its corporate-bond exposure. The fund has a 1.5% position in Japanese stocks, and Mr. Romick could add more.

He sees little of interest in Europe, he says. "Just because we go anywhere doesn't mean you have to go everywhere," Mr. Romick says.

The $28 billion Ivy Asset Strategy is also run by veteran go-anywhere managers. It can take its stock exposure anywhere from zero to 100%; ditto for bonds and cash. It can also invest 25% of assets in precious metals, but has typically stuck with gold bullion. The fund uses derivatives, but mostly as protection against the fund's stock holdings rather than doubling down on a bet.

Lately, 88% of the fund's assets were in stocks and 11% in gold bullion. About half of the stock exposure is in the U.S. and a quarter is in Europe. The European investments are emerging-market-oriented plays like luxury-brand companies or auto makers that stand to benefit from a burgeoning middle class in countries like China. The rest of the stock exposure is directly in emerging markets.

"We will look at the last 30 years as relatively easy for money management, but the next 30 years is going to be tougher," says co-manager Michael Avery, who sees a period of higher interest rates, limited growth prospects for developed markets and issues for the dollar ahead.

The $22.5 billion Pimco All Asset can invest in just about any asset class to achieve its goal of returning 5% plus inflation. Pimco All Asset is run as a fund of other Pimco funds. Manager Robert Arnott uses a quantitative model to tactically allocate assets into investments ranging from Treasury inflation-protected securities and commodities to real estate and emerging-markets stocks.

As of April 30, it held about a third of assets in alternative bond strategies such as emerging-markets debt and unhedged foreign bonds, 19% in alternative equity strategies that provide exposure to stocks while using derivatives to dampen volatility, and 18% in inflation-related strategies including commodities and real estate.

In a note to investors, the fund's manager said he planned to reduce risk by taking a more diversified and defensive approach. Equities make up just 10% of assets, with the bulk of that in emerging markets. The fund is in the bottom 20% of Morningstar's world-allocation category over the past year, but it ranks in the top 5% for the past three years.

Foreclosure Activity Tumbled in April

By Nick Timiraos

Banks initiated fewer foreclosures in April than in any month since late 2008, even though the number of loans in foreclosure remains near records, offering the latest evidence that banks are struggling to repair hobbled foreclosure processes.

Mortgage companies started foreclosures on 187,400 properties last month, a 31% decline from March and a 15% decrease from one year ago, according to LPS Applied Analytics, a data firm.

The decline came in a month in which 14 banks signed consent orders with federal banking regulators to revamp their foreclosure processes. The orders were prompted by last fall's document-handling problems that had led major banks to suspend some foreclosures.

Foreclosure time lines are likely to stretch out as banks slow the pace of foreclosures. The average loan that went through foreclosure in April had been delinquent for 567 days, up from 548 days in March and 523 days in January.

The delays in the foreclosure process threaten to raise expenses for banks. They also cause considerable uncertainty for the housing market, which remains a big drag on the economy.

In the short run, delays could limit the flow of foreclosures onto fragile markets, putting less pressure on prices. But they also could lengthen any housing-market recovery by extending the time it takes to clear out the inventory of bank-owned properties.

"You don't have to sell every foreclosed property before prices stabilize, but I would venture to guess we've got to sell a third of them," said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co., at a housing conference this past week.

State attorneys general, federal officials and representatives of the nation's largest banks are in talks to settle alleged foreclosure abuses, which analysts hope will help repair the broken foreclosure process.

"Until there's an agreement, we're not going to clear the excess inventory of foreclosed homes," Mr. Vitner said.

Foreclosures accelerated last summer, but they have fallen in all but one month since last September, when the "robo-signing" scandal, where bank employees were improperly signing high volumes of foreclosure filings, erupted.

Nationally, bank repossessions are down by 32% since last September. But the LPS data show that many states that have tougher scrutiny of banks' paper work, including those where banks must seek a judge's approval to foreclose, have had even larger declines.

Foreclosure activity is down by 91% in the District of Columbia, by 79% in New York and Maryland, and by 77% in New Jersey. In these places, foreclosures need judicial approval and courts have some of the most stringent oversight of the foreclosure process.

Foreclosure sales in April dropped most sharply among loans held on bank balance sheets and on loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those loans are most likely to be serviced by banks that fell under last month's consent orders, a sign that the decline was driven largely by the orders. Foreclosure sales rose on loans that are in private-label mortgage-backed securities, which aren't guaranteed by government entities and which are serviced by nonbank companies that weren't subject to the consent orders.

Property: Deal Set For Palace

Manhattan's famed Palace hotel is under contract to be purchased by Northwood Investors, a real-estate investment advisory firm founded by John Z. Kukral, the former chief executive of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors.

The price is said to be about $400 million. The sale should close in mid-July, said Leslie Lefkowitz, the luxury hotel's director of communications. The seller, an affiliate of the Brunei Investment Agency, purchased the Madison Avenue site in 1993.

Mr. Kukral said in a statement, "We are investing in the Palace brand and property both to grow the business and to further enhance its stature as a world-renowned luxury hotel."

The sale is part of a flurry of deals of late in Manhattan as the city's hotels ride a sharp rebound in occupancy and rates in the economic recovery. The Palace's reported selling price of roughly $445,000 a room isn't far from the median per-room price for New York City hotel sales in the 12 months ended in March of $435,000, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"There's no question that there's a lot of demand for buying New York City hotels," said John Fox, senior vice president of PKF Consulting in Manhattan. "The New York hotel market has rebounded better than any market in the county."

Among the prominent Manhattan hotels to change hands of late is Midtown's 712-room Radisson Lexington Hotel, which DiamondRock Hospitality Co. confirmed Monday that it is buying for $335 million. Earlier this year, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. paid $313.5 million for the New York Helmsley hotel.

Felcor Lodging Trust is buying Midtown's Royalton and Morgans hotels for a combined $140 million. And in December, RLJ Lodging Trust paid $335 million for the 755-room Doubletree Metropolitan hotel.

The 899-room Palace opened in 1980 as the Helmsley Palace. Rates start around $400 a night; four triplex suites command $20,000, Ms. Lefkowitz said.

The Property Report
Deal of the Week: Hartz Takes a New Route

By Maura Webber Sadovi

For the latest evidence of high heat in the apartment-building sales market, consider these two recent deals by Hartz Mountain Industries.

The closely held company, run by the Stern family, which initially made its fortune in the pet-supply business, last month sold twin Jersey City, N.J., office buildings for $310 million. Then, just weeks later, Hartz bought One Superior Place, a 52-story luxury rental-apartment building in Chicago for more than $300 million.

In the world of buying low and selling high, one would expect that the capitalization rate, or yield, on the 809-unit One Superior Place would be higher than the yield on the office buildings sold by Hartz.

But the opposite was true. Two people familiar with the sale of the Jersey City property at 70 and 90 Hudson St. said the buyer, CB Richard Ellis Realty Trust, will be getting a yield in the 7% range. The yield on One Superior Place will be about 5%, one of the people said.

Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz, confirmed in an interview that the cap rate of the Jersey City property was higher, but he declined to go into specifics.

"I am giving away cap rate because over the years I expect [apartment buildings] to do better," Mr. Stern said.

So do a lot of other investors. In the last 12 months, about $39 billion in apartment deals valued at $2.5 million or more got done in the U.S., up from $33 billion in 2010 and just $14.8 billion in 2009, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Buyers have been focusing on rising rents, falling vacancies and increased demand resulting from the stagnation in the home-sales market. Of course, they also have been helped by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, government-controlled companies that provide low-cost financing.

"Apartment properties are less risky, and you get super-cheap debt for acquisitions, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer," said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital Analytics.

For Hartz Mountain, which got a loan from a life-insurance company to help finance the transaction, the deal also is about diversification. The company's portfolio includes roughly 38 million square feet of industrial, office and retail space, as well as such hotels as the Soho Grand Hotel and the Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York. Much of the property is within 10 miles of the company's Secaucus, N.J., headquarters.

The company began buying apartments last year. With the Chicago purchase, it now has about 1,600 units. Hartz also plans to build hundreds of new apartments on New Jersey land that it already owns.

"It's a new road," said Mr. Stern, 48 years old. "We're morphing into a fully diversified real-estate operator and developer by finally getting into the residential business in a substantial way."

The Stern family always has been on the lookout for new lines of business. It traces its beginning back to the 1920s, when Mr. Stern's grandfather, the late Max Stern, built a pet-supply empire after discovering that New Yorkers would pay premium prices for singing canaries that he shipped from his native Germany. The company soon branched out into birdseed and, later, cat and dog supplies. The family sold its signature business about 11 years ago.

In the late 1960s, Max Stern's son Leonard, now 73, started the company's real-estate division, focusing initially on industrial properties. He also purchased the Village Voice newspaper, which Hartz owned for about 15 years before selling it in 2000.

Hartz mostly avoided the pain of the downturn by avoiding buying at the peak. But the same couldn't be said of One Superior Place, which was part of a deal that ended badly for a previous owner. In 2007, Stellar Management of New York bought it from Archstone-Smith as part of a seven-building portfolio. About $218 million of the price was allocated to One Superior Place.

But that deal had too much debt. In 2009, a fund managed by Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which had a $70 million mezzanine loan, took over the portfolio in a foreclosure.

Hartz Mountain bought the building from Brookfield. It also purchased the land underneath the building, which had been separated in an earlier deal, from New York investor Lloyd Goldman.

The prices of the two deals combined came to more than $300 million, making it the largest U.S. apartment-building transaction of the year, according to Real Capital.

Location Data Emerging As Big Treasure for Business

Cellphones that collect people's locations are only the tip of the iceberg: Auto makers, insurance companies and even shopping malls are experimenting with new ways to use this kind of data.

Location information is emerging as one of the hottest commodities in the tracking industry -- the field of companies that are building businesses based on people's data.

Some companies are using the data to build better maps or analyze traffic patterns. Others send users advertisements for services near where they are located. Some insurers hope to use the data to provide discounts to better drivers.

On Tuesday in Washington, D.C., a Senate Judiciary subcommittee plans a hearing to consider whether a federal law is required to protect consumer privacy on mobile devices. The hearing was spurred by the public outcry over recent findings that Apple Inc. and Google Inc. gather location-related data from iPhones and Android phones. Both companies are set to testify.

In March, researchers found Apple's iPhones were keeping a database of nearby Wi-Fi networks and cellular towers, stretching back months. The Wall Street Journal reported that iPhones and Apple were collecting such data even when users had turned off location services and that Android phones were transmitting similar information to Google several times an hour, even when location apps weren't in use.

Currently, there is no comprehensive federal law that protects personal data -- including location -- from being shared or sold to commercial partners. Last December, the Journal's "What They Know" series found that 47 of the 101 most popular smartphone apps sent location information to other companies.

The use of this trove of sensitive data is proving controversial. Last month, TomTom NV, maker of in-car navigation devices, apologized for selling aggregated data from its devices to the Dutch government, which was using it to set speed traps.

"We did not foresee this type of usage," said Harold Goddijn, TomTom's chief executive. He said the company "fully understands some of [our] customers do not like this," and is taking steps to "stop this type of usage in near future."

Insurance companies are starting to tap location and other data when drivers agree. Italy's Octo Telematics SpA makes technology that has been installed in more than 1.2 million cars in Europe that can send back aggregated data about a car's location, acceleration and other driving characteristics, said Nino Tarantino, Octo's chief in North America.

Some insurers provide discounts to drivers who agree to install the Octo system. Other drivers may use the technology for roadside assistance or to locate a car if it is stolen. Mr. Tarantino says location is tracked in real time only in the case of theft or an emergency. In other cases, it is provided as an average, indicating that a car is driven most on a certain highway, for example.

This month, Octo entered the U.S. market, signing Seattle-based Safeco Insurance, a member of Liberty Mutual Group, as its first customer.

Even shopping malls and retailers are getting into the location game.

U.K.-based Path Intelligence Ltd. intercepts a unique identifier that is part of the regular communications between shoppers' cellphones and wireless carriers and uses the information to monitor the routes people take through stores and malls. The company started in 2007 and has since expanded to the U.S.

Path says it doesn't identify individual users but pools information to give stores statistics on the number of people shopping in different sections. Path tracks them by collecting an anonymous number that is transmitted openly whenever the network pings the phone to ensure a connection is available.

"Our tagline is 'Googleanalytics for the offline world,'" said Sharon Biggar, Path's co-founder.

Apple has released a software update that limits how much location data its devices store, and Google says it collects such data only after users agree when setting up the phone. Apple and Google say the data aren't tied to a specific user.

Other companies are collecting location data for similar purposes. Sprint Nextel Corp. and Verizon Wireless, for example, send location data to a company called AirSage Inc., which provides traffic information. Sprint's data are used in AirSage's products, but offerings that use Verizon's data have not yet been released, the companies said. The companies said the information is anonymous and aggregated.

Auto maker BMW AG is considering collecting location data from the navigation systems installed in its cars to provide real-time traffic reports.

BlackRock's 'Geeky Guys' Business

Inside a bland midtown Manhattan office building, Rob Goldstein spends his days trying to assign values to some of the world's most exotic portfolios.

Mr. Goldstein is head of BlackRock Solutions, the risk-management division of giant asset manager BlackRock Inc.

BlackRock Solutions has emerged as a key adviser in helping the government unwind the troubled assets it accumulated during the financial crisis. On Wednesday, BlackRock helped the Federal Reserve auction off a slug of subprime-mortgage securities bought from insurance giant American International Group Inc. during the financial crisis in 2008.

All told, BlackRock Solutions has helped the Fed sell securities with a face value of more than $5.38 billion, making it by far its highest-profile assignment to date. Yet with the recent success has come some unwelcome attention over how it handles that business -- as well as more competition in risk management.

With more than $3.6 trillion under management, BlackRock is best known for its bond portfolios, including some that hold the same kinds of securities that BlackRock Solutions is helping the government value and sell.

BlackRock has gone to considerable lengths over the years to keep its Solutions business separate from its core money-management operation. Solutions' employees are housed on separate floors of the firm's headquarters and are accessible by different elevators than other parts of the firm that could profit from its knowledge. All of their data and computer systems are separate from those of the main company.

Still, some analysts are raising concerns that the firm's government dealings give BlackRock too much access to market-sensitive information -- and too many temptations to use that information to boost its main business.

"They've combined asset-management and advisory businesses, and it raises some issues of conflicts," says Christopher Whalen, co-founder of risk-management consultant Institutional Risk Analytics. He said he isn't suggesting that there have been problems.

Mr. Goldstein says BlackRock Solutions has been sensitive to such perceptions. "The information-security procedures that we have are not something we created six months ago, or a year ago, or six years ago," Mr. Goldstein says. "They're something created over a decade ago and are embedded within the firm."

BlackRock Solutions' origins go back to the early 1990s; it became a separate unit at the firm in 2000. It offers big institutional clients, such as pension funds, governments, insurers and university endowments, risk management tools and advisory services, helping them analyze their bond and other fixed-income positions in real time. It also offers asset-allocation and other advice.

Yet BlackRock Solutions is only a tiny part of BlackRock. With $460 million in revenue during 2010 and a staff of 1,850, the unit generates just 5% of the firm's $8.6 billion in total revenue. Most of BlackRock's profit comes from managing money, including the $7.8 billion it booked last year from bond portfolios. It also owns iShares, the largest provider of exchange-traded funds, with more than $624 billion under management.

The Solutions group has found a new market since the financial crisis. Not only are many mortgage-related bonds difficult to value these days, but some investors have lost faith in the big bond-rating firms' credit-scoring capabilities, say analysts. Last year, BlackRock Solutions took on 62 new assignments, up from 48 in 2009.

During an April 21 conference call with investors, BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink singled out Solutions as a high performer, saying it did "an exceptional job" in helping the Central Bank of Ireland understand the market dynamics affecting its banking system. The central bank rescued many of the country's banks after the country's real-estate bubble burst, leaving lenders saddled with souring loans.

The unit's other clients have included the Federal Reserve, California Public Employees' Retirement System, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, New York Life Insurance Co. and UBS, according to people familiar with the firm. A BlackRock Solutions report on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was cited in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report in January.

The firm's secretive valuation process also has raised questions. Since the government owns so many subprime assets, critics contend, taxpayers have a right to know how those assets are being valued. BlackRock doesn't discuss its methods publicly, and the Fed offers only broad disclosures about how values are reached.

"It should all be open," says Allan H. Meltzer, a professor at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon. "They may be doing things honestly and above board, but we won't see that unless we see how they got the numbers."

BlackRock referred all questions about the assets to the Fed, which declined to comment on the calculations of the portfolios.

"We spend a very significant amount of time teaching clients what the limitations of the risk models are," BlackRock Solutions' Mr. Goldstein says.

Other asset managers are beefing up their risk-management operations. Pimco Solutions, part of Newport Beach, Calif.-based Pacific Investment Management Co., a unit of Allianz SE, is looking to expand. Last July, Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc. poached Pimco veteran Powell Thurston to head a new risk management and advisory business.

BlackRock likes to play up its status as a first mover. On the wall of Mr. Goldstein's office hangs a black floppy disk from one of BlackRock's earliest risk-management assignments, 17 years ago: evaluating some $10 billion in mortgage-backed securities for General Electric Co. after it acquired Kidder Peabody.

"We're sort of geeky guys with a geeky business," he says.

Lloyds's grim legacy -- and reality

Antonio Horta-Osorio has been chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group for just two months, but he already has sprung his first major surprise: a thumping GBP 2.44 billion first-quarter loss.

A typical kitchen-sink exercise by the incoming boss as he tries to reset expectations while he can still blame losses on his predecessor? Unfortunately not.

The reality is that the market has been too bullish about Lloyds' prospects.

True, the lion's share of the losses arose from a GBP 3.2 billion provision against possible claims over the improper selling of consumer-credit insurance. That followed a defeat for the U.K. banking industry in the High Court last month.

Lloyds has decided to abandon the legal process and settle with its customers. Even so, the money set aside is nearly double what the market anticipated, contributing to a fall in the core Tier 1 ratio to 10%.

More worrying is the operating performance.

An extra GBP 1.1 billion of provisions against the Irish real-estate portfolio is hardly a surprise, given the deterioration in that market and previous concerns that provisioning was inadequate. Yet even after the latest write-downs, reflecting expectations of a further 10% drop in prices, provisions still only cover 56% of nonperforming loans, suggesting further large losses may lie ahead.

Meanwhile, underlying revenue was down 6% year-to-year, Barclays Capital estimates, raising doubts over forecasts for a 4% fall in the whole of 2011. And while Lloyds has made admirable progress toward reducing its reliance on central-bank funding, down by GBP 20.6 billion to GBP 70 billion, this has inevitably taken its toll on margins, which at 2.07% are already below the bank's guidance earlier this year.

Even bigger challenges lie ahead. The Independent Commission on Banking's demand that Lloyds dispose of further branches to satisfy competition concerns and its half-baked proposal that U.K. banks ring-fence their retail operations mean considerable regulatory uncertainty remains.

Doubts remain about Lloyds' ability to unwind its vast portfolio of U.K. commercial real estate, particularly now that the Irish National Asset Management Agency plans to accelerate disposals of its GBP 15 billion portfolio.

Worse, the U.K. economic environment is deteriorating as fiscal austerity and high inflation take their toll on growth. That could yet have ramifications for Lloyds, both on the asset side, should households struggle with their debts, and the liability side, if a loss of confidence in U.K. government bonds affects bank funding costs.

Lloyds shares already were among the worst performers in the sector this year, falling 10% since February.

They fell a further 8% on Thursday, evidence perhaps that market expectations are finally becoming more realistic.

No kitchen sink required.

-- Simon Nixon

A realistic bailout buys Portugal time

In the bailout business, there is nothing like learning by doing. On an initial read, the euro zone and International Monetary Fund are cutting Portugal slack in terms of the fiscal tightening they require in return for its 78 billion euros ($116 billion) bailout; the deficit-reduction targets are looser than those Lisbon had been aiming for. That may seem odd, but it is realistic: Portugal's real challenge -- to boost its competitiveness -- will depend as much on structural change as austerity.

Under the new plan, Portugal must reduce its budget deficit to 3% of gross domestic product by 2013; that is one percentage point looser than the current plan. But that is still a tough target, since the starting position has worsened: Portugal's 2010 deficit limped in at 9.1% of GDP, far above the 7.3% target. A fresh recession will likely slow deficit reduction and lead to debt climbing above 100% of GDP. But the size of the bailout, including some 12 billion euros for bank recapitalization, also seems to build in a buffer. Barclays Capital estimates a 60 billion euro package might have been enough to cover government financing to the end of 2013, with 8 billion euros needed for the banks.

This realism on the fiscal front should provide breathing space for Portugal. Markets welcomed the bailout. But euro-zone leaders still must approve the package. And the long haul toward repairing Portugal's finances is only just starting.

Can RIM cut

the rot out

on BlackBerry?

It might not be reassuring but it is the reality for any company in a downward spiral: As bad as things are, they can always get worse.

Take Research In Motion. A month after disappointing Wall Street with uninspiring first-quarter guidance, it revised that forecast downward last Friday. Then on Monday it unveiled two new BlackBerry models seen as offering few meaningful advances. The other big news out of this week's BlackBerry World conference, its switch to Microsoft's Bing as its preferred search engine, is good news for Microsoft but isn't likely to do much for BlackBerry's competitiveness.

With RIM stock now trading at a sobering 7.4 times expected fiscal 2012 earnings, contrarians might see an opportunity. After all, RIM's sales continue to expand, albeit at a slower rate than the overall market.

One problem is that RIM's strength is increasingly overseas, at the lower-end of the market. In fiscal 2011, customers outside of North America made up 54.6% of BlackBerry users, RIM said, up from about a third in August 2009. Strategy Analytics estimates RIM's U.S. handset market share fell to 7.5% in the first quarter from 12% two years earlier, even as its global share rose.

Admittedly, profit growth expectations have waned among investors. Consensus earnings for this fiscal year, which ends in February, are $6.52 a share, only 2.8% higher than fiscal 2011 despite expectations of revenue growing roughly 20%. Fiscal 2013 earnings consensus is $7.05 a share, however. There is a clear risk earnings may stagnate or even fall in coming years.

As with BlackBerry's phones, when it comes to the stock cheap doesn't necessarily mean attractive.

Deal of the Week: D.C. Outlook Downsized

By Maura Webber Sadovi

A family-owned company has put one of the largest buildings in Washington on the block, hoping to fetch as much as $900 million for the property in what has been one of the hottest office markets in the country.

But the timing of the offer by David Nassif Associates may not turn out to be as good as it looks. Until now, the Washington market has outperformed those in most other cities, thanks to strong demand from government agencies and contractors.

But, with pressure building to lower the national deficit, the government is moving into a contraction mode and real estate has become one of the targets of the budget ax. Last year, President Barack Obama directed federal agencies to accelerate efforts to eliminate unneeded properties, setting a goal of saving $3 billion by the end of 2012.

Now, a congressional subcommittee headed by Rep. Jeff Denham (R., Calif.) is reviewing leasing practices by the General Services Administration, the agency that handles many of the government-owned or -leased buildings. Citing the need for more information from the GSA, Rep. Denham has frozen the approval of many large leases.

Constitution Center, the 1.4 million-square-foot building that David Nassif has put up for sale, is among the properties in the subcommittee's cross hairs. One of the leases it is reviewing is for 342,000 square feet that the Securities and Exchange Commission just signed at the property. It is slated to run through 2021.

Looking on the bright side, even if the SEC doesn't occupy that space, the government would still be on the hook to pay the rent and find another tenant to sublet it. Indeed, the Constitution Center's owners note that the building, located just south of the Mall near L'Enfant Plaza, is fully leased.

But all the leases are with government agencies, and they begin expiring in 10 years. Some brokers say growing uncertainty about the budget crisis and a possible long-term slowdown in leasing could weigh on the prices investors are willing to pay for Washington buildings.

"If a landlord in D.C. has an office building oriented toward federal occupancy, the lack of federal leasing could create a problem," says Darian LeBlanc, senior managing director with Cassidy Turley.

Until now, investors in Washington property have largely ignored the possibility of a government contraction. Recent sales of prime property have fetched as much as $905 a square foot, according to Dan Fasulo, a managing director with the real-estate-research firm Real Capital Analytics.

If investor appetite for Washington property stays strong, Mr. Fasulo says, the Constitution Center could fetch as much as $640 a square foot, for a total of about $900 million, a record price. "There's very few properties this size in Washington," Mr. Fasulo says. "I expect some heavy action."

The building was built in the 1960s by the father and grandfather of David W. Nassif and served as the Department of Transportation headquarters until the agency moved out in 2007. At the height of the market, the owners spent about $300 million to redevelop the building without a tenant in hand. But the building has remained empty since it was completed at the end of 2009.

Last summer, the owners got a break when they leased about 900,000 square feet to the SEC, only to have the SEC come back in October to say that budget cuts meant they needed only about one-third of the space they had leased.

Although the SEC had contracted for the space, David Nassif opted to help the SEC lease a total of about 1.1 million square feet to other government agencies.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The New Basics: A Bull Market in Rental Housing

Corrections & Amplifications

Fees for companies that manage multifamily properties "generally run about 5% to 6% of total annual rents," according to Jim Scofield of multifamily brokerage and advisory firm Apartment REP. A Weekend Investor article Saturday on rental housing incorrectly attributed the quotation to Tony Drost of the National Association of Residential Property Managers.

(WSJ May 6, 2011)

(END)

Five years into the real-estate bust, the market for single-family homes seems weaker than ever. According to the most recent S&P/Case-Shiller housing data, prices fell 3.3% nationwide in February from a year earlier.

The ongoing malaise, paradoxically, is only boosting the opportunities for investors in multiunit rental properties.

The days of buying and flipping a property for quick profit are long gone. But investors who purchase apartment buildings, perhaps as part of a retirement portfolio or estate plan, are seeing better deals now than at any time in the past decade, says Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real Capital Analytics, a real-estate research-and-consulting firm. On the cost side, housing prices are low and falling in many areas, while mortgage rates are near historic lows. On the income side, apartment rents are near all-time highs.

"As an asset class, it looks awfully attractive," Mr. Fasulo says.

Nationwide, rents now average $991, compared with $930 in 2006, and are expected to rise to about $1,025 by 2012, according to Reis Inc., which tracks rental-performance data. In part, that is because there are fewer units: The national vacancy rate for apartments dropped to 6.2% during the first quarter of 2011, from 8% a year ago.

Rental demand should remain strong for several years, experts say. The housing-market crash and shaky job market have made more would-be homeowners gun-shy about buying, says Paula Poskon, a senior research analyst at R.W. Baird, a wealth-management company.

Demographic trends also are favorable. Roughly 3 million young adults had been living with family during the past five years, according to data from the Census and real-estate investment brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap, and housing experts estimate that they now generate about one-third of rental demand.

Still other renters have no alternative. Some 2.8 million homes were foreclosed on since 2008, with another 5 million expected to enter foreclosure or be repossessed by the banks by the end of 2012, according to RealtyTrac.com. Many of those former homeowners will have to rent until their credit score recovers, which typically takes seven years.

Such factors have sparked a bull market: Sales of multifamily units priced at $500,000 or above surged by 28% in the first quarter of 2011 from a year earlier, according to Marcus & Millichap. The dollar volume surged 44% to $11.2 billion.

The key for investors, of course, is to find a property that generates enough rent to cover the operating costs. Annual expenses, including property taxes, insurance, water, heat, maintenance and occasional repairs, shouldn't eat up more than 40% of a property's annual rental income, says Jim Scofield, senior investment adviser at Apartment REP, a multifamily brokerage and advisory firm in Raleigh, N.C.

Factoring in maintenance costs and other variables, an investment property should produce at least a 6% return on the initial cash investment in the first year after it is purchased, Mr. Scofield says. For example, an investor who puts down $250,000 in cash on a $750,000 property would need to clear at least $15,000 in the first year.

There are, to be sure, drawbacks to this kind of investing, from repairs to delinquent tenants. Laws vary by state, but typically tenants could end up staying for up to four months without paying rent before the eviction process is completed, says Hessam Nadji, managing director of research and advisory services at Marcus & Millichap.

Investors who don't want to fix a broken toilet on a Saturday night can pay a property-management company to handle everything from leasing apartments to making repairs. Fees, which generally run about 5% to 6% of total annual rents, often decrease as the number of units increases, says Tony Drost, president of the National Association of Residential Property Managers.

The big payoff from property investing comes when the mortgage is paid off. For a conservative investor, assuming a 15-year mortgage, the influx of extra income could arrive just in time to subsidize retirement, rising health-care costs or children's college tuition.

That has been William King's strategy for some time now. The 43-year-old owner of an audiovisual production company in Morrisville, N.C., has used real-estate investments to save for college tuition for his two children, ages 9 and 13, accumulating more than 20 properties.

In March, Mr. King dipped into his savings to buy a $550,000 multi-unit dwelling nearby, this time with an eye on retirement. The property generates about $50,000 a year after expenses and financing, and Mr. King plans to own it outright before he is 60. At that point, he says, it will probably yield about $80,000 at today's rate.

For investors who want exposure to income-producing properties without getting their hands dirty, there are alternatives. Real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, pass along at least 90% of their taxable income, typically rent from tenants, to shareholders in the form of dividends. They perform better when the rental market picks up -- in 2010, the average REIT returned 27.5% -- and during inflationary periods, since rents tend to increases with inflation.

Investors also can pool their money -- the minimum investment required is typically $250,000 -- into private-equity groups that in turn buy large properties, many of which are distressed, and hold them for five to 10 years with the aim of selling at a profit, says Jack McCabe, a housing analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla., and consultant to private-equity groups.

But these options don't offer leverage. An investor can buy a property outright with a mortgage and a down payment of around 25% to 30% in cash. Any capital appreciation magnifies the returns on that investment.

"You can't beat the real-estate angle right now," Mr. King says. "I'm more excited about it than I've ever been."

Global Finance: Moody's Profit Tops Forecasts, Shares Rally

NEW YORK -- Moody's Corp.'s first-quarter profit rose 37% as corporate debt issuance continues to surge world-wide and structured-finance activity begins to improve.

The results, boosted by a lower share count and favorable tax rate, beat analysts' expectations. Moody's raised its full-year per-share earnings forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $2.22 to $2.32 a share. The company expects revenue to improve by low double digits on a percentage basis, compared with its prior forecast of high-single-digit growth.

While the company expects "generally favorable" market conditions for the remainder of the year, Chief Financial Officer Linda Huber said revenue could be "U-shaped" as some debt issuance may have pushed forward into the first quarter. The fourth quarter is traditionally the company's strongest.

Moody's shares rose $2.42, or 6.7%, to $38.33 in 4 p.m. composite trading Wednesday after hitting a multiyear-high of $39.65 during the trading day.

Moody's, which has a large ratings business and which also offers data and analytics services, continues to post strong earnings as a result of a flurry of new bonds coming to market. Chairman and Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel said in an interview that the company was surprised by the extent to which corporate-bond revenue increased.

Companies are rushing to refinance debt and fund new growth at low interest rates, and Moody's said it is now seeing structured finance issuance rebound as well.

On Tuesday, McGraw-Hill Cos. said profit at its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services edged up 0.8% as revenue increased 10%. While that company has been kept busy by increased corporate-bond issuance, Moody's growth in recent quarters has outpaced that of its rival, particularly overseas.

Moody's posted a profit of $155.5 million, or 67 cents a share, up from $113.4 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 21% to $577.1 million.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast a profit of 54 cents a share on $521 million in revenue.

Moody's expenses rose 17% to $327 million as it continued to increase head count and boost incentive compensation to reflect the stronger full-year forecast.

Still, the company's operating margin widened to 43.3% from 41.3% in the prior year. The full-year operating margin is expected to be between 38% and 40%.

Ratings business Moody's Investors Service, the company's biggest top-line contributor, had a 23% rise in revenue to $412.6 million. Corporate debt revenue surged 44%, and structured finance revenue rose 25% in the latest quarter as demand for ratings of government-sponsored facilities in Europe and commercial real-estate issues offset declines in asset-backed securities.

Revenue at Moody'sAnalytics increased 17% to $164.5 million as some software projects were completed ahead of schedule.

Moody's derived 48% of its revenue from outside the U.S.

Meanwhile, Moody's raised its quarterly dividend 22% to 14 cents a share. The company repurchased 4.3 million shares for $128 million and had 227.8 million shares at quarter-end. Moody's has $1.1 billion remaining under its existing buyback program.

Moody's also said it won't hold an investor day this year, instead moving to a biannual meeting. Mr. McDaniel said the company's investors, many of whom are long-term holders, don't need such frequent updates. ---

Silicon Valley Office Market Booms

When San Francisco developer Jay Paul left town for a Pacific Ocean yacht voyage about 10 weeks ago, his shiny new office complex in Sunnyvale, Calif., had been sitting mostly empty since it was completed in late 2008.

But by the time Mr. Paul returned last week, most of the Moffett Towers project's 1.6 million square feet of space had been accounted for.

Hewlett-Packard Co. and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. snapped up more than 600,000 square feet of space, while Microsoft Corp. was close to signing a lease for as much as 300,000 square feet, say people familiar with the matter. Brokers in the area now expect Mr. Paul to break ground on a 230,000-square-foot third phase of the Moffett project by next year, even if he doesn't sign a tenant ahead of time.

Technology firms, from tiny start-ups to giants like Google Inc., are again racing to expand, sparking a turnaround in the Silicon Valley office market that seemed far off just a few months ago. The amount of occupied office space in the area is on pace to increase by three million square feet this year, which would be the biggest one-year jump since 1999, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. Rents for the best space in the most highly desired market, downtown Palo Alto, are up 25% from a year ago, while the vacancy rate has fallen to about 7%, the brokerage firm says.

"We knew that once the dam broke, that it would break pretty quickly," says Janette Sammartino, Mr. Paul's chief operating officer.

The surge of demand has transformed the Silicon Valley office market into one of the few showing signs of prosperity as the economy slowly recovers. As in New York and Washington, developers in Silicon Valley are dusting off plans for new projects, and the prices paid for office properties there are closing in on boom-era levels.

A downtown Palo Alto office building, once home to engineers developing the AltaVista search engine and the Java programming language, was sold this month to RREEF, Deutsche Bank's real-estate investment division, for $65 million, or more than $900 a square foot. That deal is in a tie with a sale in downtown Washington as this year's most expensive sale of a U.S. office building over 15,000 square feet, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Silicon Valley, of course, is wary of booms, and this one has been slow to lift the region's outlying areas. After the tech bubble burst in 2000, the office-vacancy rate for high-end space jumped from about 2% to 23% within two years, according to CoStar Group Inc. While the carnage following the bursting of the bubble wasn't as bad as many expected, the office market still hasn't quite recovered.

But the aggressive growth plans of Google, Facebook and others, driven in part by intense interest in social media and mobile computing, have shaken the Silicon Valley market in recent months. Google alone is close to leasing more than half-a-million square feet of office space near its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters and is looking for more, brokers and others say.

"They're flipping the switch on growth mode, which has greatly affected everyone around them," Michael Saign, a broker for Cornish & Carey Commercial/NKF, said of Google.

Google added 1,916 employees during the first quarter, bringing its total work force to 26,316. The company earlier this year said it would add more than 6,000 employees in 2011, an overall increase of 25%, as it continues to expand beyond its core Web-search business.

Facebook, meanwhile, is relocating to the one-million-square-foot campus built for Sun Microsystems in the 1990s.

Companies that are still looking for office space in Silicon Valley include communications company Polycom Inc., software maker Synopsys Inc., social-networking firm LinkedIn Corp. and bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc.'s Nook e-reader division, according to people familiar with the market.

In response to the new demand, Sobrato Organization, one of the largest office-building owners in Silicon Valley, decided recently to restart a 300,000 square-foot speculative office project in Santa Clara that had been on hold since 2008, says the company's head of real estate, Michael Field.

Some landlords who cater to start-ups and other smaller technology companies are benefiting from more venture-capital investment, which increased in 2010 for the first time in three years, according to the National Venture Capital Association. An office building in downtown Mountain View, at 444 Castro St., is now nearly 100% leased, thanks to a flurry of small deals in the last year with companies like start-up incubator 500 Startups and the nonprofit Creative Commons.

The evaporation of office space has taken some tenants by surprise. "We certainly didn't expect to see the run-up on that type of product that quickly," says Robert Teed, vice president of workplace solutions for Polycom, which is seeking a new Silicon Valley headquarters and has watched its list of options dwindle in recent months.

But the surge in demand has provided relief for some landlords dealing with the fallout from investing at the top of the market.

The future looked shaky for Moffett Towers last year. In November, two years after the buildings were completed, Los Angeles private-equity firm Mesa West Capital bought at a discount a $130 million loan on three buildings in the complex from Morgan Stanley. At the time, the buildings were just 13% occupied.

Now, those buildings are close to 80% leased, according to the project's leasing broker, Phil Mahoney of Cornish & Carey.

"We thought it would happen in 12 to 24 months," says Jeff Friedman, co-chief executive of Mesa West. "In fact, they've done it in six months."

Mall giants Westfield Group, Simon Property Group and General Growth Properties are marketing 40 malls across the country, an unusually large number for any one time. The sellers are hoping to take advantage of the slowly improving economy and commercial-real-estate market.

But the deals also might pose challenges. Most of the properties on the block are among the lower-quality properties owned by the sellers, and companies are hoping to sell them at a time that the retail sector is facing changes due to an oversupply of product and competition from Internet shopping.

Malls were among the most battered sectors during the commercial-real-estate crisis. Vacancy rates for malls in the top 80 U.S. markets rose to 9.1% in the first quarter, the highest rate that research company Reis Inc. has tallied since it began tracking mall figures in 2000.

What is more, mall executives and analysts alike anticipate a prince-and-pauper recovery for the industry, with high-quality malls that generate lofty sales bouncing back more rapidly than their trailing peers. Struggling malls in deteriorating markets are expected to sustain the brunt of store closures, lingering vacancies and changing consumer demand.

The mall companies that are selling clearly recognize this. Westfield, based in Sydney, is marketing 17 malls in seven states and plans to use the sale proceeds to finance $2 billion of redevelopment and renovation of its stronger U.S. properties, people familiar with the matter say. They note that their better malls generate an average sales per square foot of $400 or more.

Most of the Westfield malls for sale are considered to be of average or slightly above-average quality, known in industry terms as B-grade properties.They generally generate annual sales per square foot between $300 to $380. The industry average is $352, according to Green Street Advisors, a real-estate-investment-trust research firm in Newport Beach, Calif.

Similarly, General Growth, which owns 169 U.S. malls, intends to jettison many of its laggard malls. The REIT emerged from a 19-month bankruptcy stint in November with new management, new investors and a new balance sheet. Chief Executive Sandeep Mathrani wants GGP to focus on its top 150 malls by selling 19 less lucrative malls. He would then use the proceeds, estimated at more than $2 billion, to pay debts.

"We actually believe the winds are behind our back" in selling malls, Mr. Mathrani said during GGP's fourth-quarter earnings call on March 1. "If the market stays with us, we would like to execute that this year."

Sales of malls have been picking up. According to Real Capital Analytics, 57 mall deals totaling $2.6 billion closed nationwide in 2010, compared with 20 deals valued at $710 million in 2009.

Activity is picking up partly because real-estate financing is becoming more available, thanks to the slow resurgence of the commercial-mortgage-backed securities market.

"CMBS lenders have been more . . . comfortable going lower on the quality spectrum of retail properties," says Cedrik Lachance, an analyst at Green Street. "That's creating financing for B-quality malls and an emerging pool of financing for even lower quality assets."

But prices for malls haven't been robust lately. During the boom years, demand was so high for mall properties that buyers were accepting initial yields of a low 6.4%, according to Real Capital. That yield in 2010 was 8.8%, just slightly improved from 9.0% in 2009.

Also, most often, big REITs sell such declining malls to local investors who redevelop them into different uses such as big-box, discount centers. Finding even that type of buyer might require a steep discount, given that the outlook for mediocre malls isn't great.

Consider the four malls being put up for sale by Simon Property, the largest U.S. mall owner with 363 properties. Their average age is 27 years, and it has been an average of 13 years since the last major renovation, according to a report by Benjamin Yang of Keefe Bruyette & Woods. The decision to sell "could suggest reinvestment in these properties may not be justified, given their dimmer futures," the report states.

But that raises the question of how much an investor would be willing to pay for them. A discount might be necessary partly because the properties "may need reimagining in some fashion," the report states.

Simon has hired brokerage firm Holliday Fenoglio Fowler LP to market the properties, people familiar with the matter say. The four -- Boynton Beach Mall and Gulf View Square in Florida, and Knoxville Center and Oak Court Mall in Tennessee -- average annual sales of $285 to $330 a square foot, according to Green Street. Their occupancies range from 80% at Knoxville Center to 95% at Oak Court Mall.

Evercore Partners is handling the sales for Westfield, which owns 55 malls in the U.S, 56 in Australia and New Zealand and eight in the U.K. Among the malls that Westfield has put on the block are Downtown Plaza in Sacramento, Calif.; Solano mall in Fairfield, Calif.; Belden Village in Canton, Ohio; Connecticut Post mall in Milford, Conn., and Westland mall in Hialeah, Fla. Those slated for upgrades include Century City in Los Angeles, Valley Fair mall in San Jose, Calif., and Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J.

"The problem is that all of these are hitting at once, so you have a lot of product out there and not a lot of buyers," says Steve Sakwa, an analyst with International Strategy & Investment in New York. "If you're the buyer," he said, "you can pick through and get better pricing."

Exchange-Traded Funds (A Special Report) --- Information, Please: Research firms battle to be the place to go for investors looking to learn more about ETFs

The race is on to become the Morningstar of ETFs.

Exchange-traded funds have been one of the fastest-growing corners of the fund business, grabbing roughly $1 for every $2 that flowed into conventional long-term mutual funds in 2010. But it's not just fund companies that are sniffing opportunity.

Media and research firms from Standard & Poor's to IndexUniverse are competing to be the chief supplier of information to ETF investors, much the way Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. won over mutual-fund investors a generation ago. Amid the scramble, competitors including Morningstar itself have launched a slew of online tools, many of them free, such as rankings and search engines that help compare the hundreds of ETFs available.

The rivals have their work cut out for them. ETFs' complex mechanics -- the funds typically resemble index mutual funds, yet trade throughout the day like stocks -- make analyzing and ranking the investments tricky. Some aspects of ETFs' performance are unique, like how consistently their trading prices match the prices of their underlying holdings throughout the day.

ETF providers including BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group have joined the fray, loading their websites with far more sophisticated analysis and tools than most conventional fund companies offer. Brokerage firms want to be seen and heard, too. Analysts at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Wells Fargo Advisors, for example, issue regular ETF market reports.

Morningstar, meanwhile, isn't resting on its laurels. It has made a number of improvements in the way it covers ETFs in recent years. The company now has 16 analysts who research ETFs, up from two just four years ago. It also has upgraded its website, adding up-to-the-minute price quotes and detailed information about bid-asked spreads.

In February, the company began calculating what it calls "total cost analysis." It starts with fund expenses, but also looks at whether a fund makes money by lending its underlying shares to short sellers -- a frequent ETF practice -- and what the fund does with that money. Another focus is liquidity: to what degree the share price will suffer when large blocks are sold.

While the new Morningstar tools are geared toward institutional traders and aren't available on the company's free website, morningstar.com, the company expects to incorporate findings from using those tools into its retail research.

Scott Burns, the head of Morningstar's ETF research team, says the company isn't done, either. The next step is to integrate the research of Morningstar's stock analysts. The aim, says Mr. Burns, is not just to gauge which technology- or growth-focused ETF is best, for example, but also on whether a focus on technology or growth stocks is a good strategy in the first place.

"You have to be able to answer both types of questions," he says.

The most recent challenger to Morningstar is in many ways an unlikely one. Until ETFs hit the mainstream, Index Publications LLC was a tiny trade publisher. Its flagship title, the Journal of Indexes (which it purchased in 1999 from Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal), runs wonky articles on topics like how to define "midcap" stocks.

With ETFs putting a brighter spotlight on index investing, the company -- often known by its Web moniker, IndexUniverse -- has worked hard to win a larger audience. It has hired additional reporters and started a blog that focuses on more mainstream investing issues.

One of IndexUniverse's biggest efforts is a free website feature, introduced in March, that helps investors search for ETFs and related exchange-traded notes, or ETNs, in ways that aren't always possible on Morningstar's basic site.

One example: The tool allows investors to directly compare 11 products that target India, such as the Market Vectors Indian Rupee/USD ETN and the WisdomTree India Earnings ETF. Morningstar classifies the rupee fund in a currency category and the WisdomTree ETF in an Asia/Pacific stock category that also includes funds focused on Australia and South Korea.

"It's a different perspective," says Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics for IndexUniverse.com.

Name recognition generally isn't a problem for Standard & Poor's, the McGraw-Hill Cos. brand famous for publishing the S&P 500 stock index and rating thousands of bonds. But the company, which started marketing its ETF research in 2009, wasn't necessarily known for fund research.

The result: a focus on ETFs' underlying stocks, rather than the funds themselves. S&P grades ETFs based on a blend of 10 criteria, including a tally of its equity analysts' opinions about each of an ETF's stock holdings; a separate tally of its credit analysts' opinions about those companies' financial health; and computer-driven measures such as scores tied to earnings and dividend growth. S&P accounts for some fund-oriented factors such as investment fees and trading costs as well. But it largely ignores three-, five- and 10-year returns.

A few caveats to keep in mind: S&P doesn't rank bond ETFs, because its methodology is so closely tied to its stock research. The company also makes comparatively little information available to small investors free of charge. The research is largely geared toward financial advisers, but some individual investors may have access to it through discount-brokerage accounts, an S&P spokesman says.

Winning a big following among investors for ETF research can be tough. New York-based Marco Polo XTF Inc. launched its own ETF research website, xtf.com, in 2007. Among the site's innovations was one of the first attempts to help investors quantify the trading costs known as bid-asked spreads. Since then, XTF has hit some bumps, shutting down other business projects and changing ownership.

Chief Executive Mel Herman declines to specify how many subscribers pay for the company's "premium membership" but highlights successes such as a deal to make some of the company's research available through Fidelity Investments' retail brokerage.

"We're out there," he says. "We have a small marketing budget. We're not a household name, but we will be."

Exchange-Traded Funds (A Special Report) --- Active, but Not Getting Very Far: ETFs that are actively managed haven't gained much traction yet

By Larry Light

A year ago, actively managed exchange-traded funds -- which move in and out of investments in a bid to beat the market -- were being portrayed by some as the next great thing. So far, they haven't lived up to the billing.

While the roster of active ETFs and their total assets has expanded -- to 33 funds and $4.2 billion as of March 31, from 14 funds and $93 million in early 2010, according to IndexUniverse -- the concept hasn't found much traction. Traditional ETFs, which track indexes such as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, number around 900, with about $1 trillion in assets.

Only a few active ETFs have scored the outsize returns that gain attention and lead to larger asset accumulations. Just nine list more than $100 million in assets, and all but one (Cambria Global Tactical) are from large fund houses: Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, a unit of Allianz SE; BlackRock Inc.; and WisdomTree Investments Inc.

Not one of the nine focuses on equities, even though the standard ETF market is dominated by stock portfolios. "Those specializing in bonds and currencies have met the most success so far," says Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments, a registered investment adviser and ETF data tracker based in Irvine, Calif.

The largest is Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Strategy, with $1.2 billion in assets. The fund focuses on short-term debt instruments, as befits its fixed-income-centered fund family. The second-biggest, WisdomTree Emerging Markets Local Debt, with about $729 million in assets, was launched just last August.

Larger fund houses such as Pimco, which have the staying power that smaller firms don't, see active ETFs as an experimental move into something that may eventually turn out to be popular.

One struggling active ETF manager, Grail Advisors LLC, put itself up for sale in January and said it might disband its five funds if it can't find a buyer. Last year, Grail liquidated two of its active ETFs, which covered financial and technology stocks.

Why the slow start for active ETFs? Public acceptance of something new takes a while, says Rodney Johnson, manager of Dent Tactical, an active ETF with just $21 million in assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first active ETF in early 2008. Actives are "still plodding up the learning curve," says Mr. Johnson, whose stock-centric ETF invests in index ETFs, mainly in the energy and industrial-materials sectors. He says regular mutual funds took decades to gain public acceptance.

Another possible reason: The actively managed precept goes against the grain of what ETFs are often used for -- as chess pieces for professional investors. The pros enlist ETFs for risky plays involving macro bets on big economic trends, such as trouble in the euro zone, or as hedges for some other complicated maneuver, perhaps involving commodities. Both those strategies call for index vehicles, which represent broad swaths of a market.

A third obstacle, says Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics for IndexUniverse.com, is that active ETFs don't get the marketing push that actively managed mutual funds do. ETFs, like individual stocks, trade throughout the day on exchanges, pretty much on their own perceived merits. Mutual funds, by contrast, often are peddled by their sponsoring firms, which pay brokers to flog them. In the mutual-fund world, active funds far outnumber index ones. "Active mutual funds are sold, not bought," he says.

Finally, from the perspective of fund managers, active ETFs have a possible weakness that mutual funds don't -- end-of-day transparency, which carries the risk that unscrupulous traders will take advantage. Mutual funds are required to disclose their holdings at least once every quarter. ETFs must tell the world what is in their portfolios after the close of every trading day. For index ETFs, that isn't much of a concern, since the content of indexes is well-known and doesn't change often. But active ETFs are vulnerable to "front-running," where clued-in traders scarf up the securities that fund managers are buying, thus inflating their acquisition costs.

Of course, this threat is theoretical at the moment, since active ETFs are still too small to affect stock prices and entice the shark-like attention of front-runners. "With a large fund, it makes a difference," says Morty Schaja, head of RiverPark Capital LLC, which manages the Grail funds, the largest of which has about $11.5 million in assets. "With us, who cares?"

Still, worry that front-running may one day be a valid concern prompted Gary Gastineau, a former managing director at Nuveen Investments LLC, to concoct a new active ETF structure designed to avoid the day-end disclosure requirement. Under his concept, investors would buy ETF shares based on end-of-day net-asset-value prices, instead of the current system, which uses market prices during the trading day. The SEC is reviewing his proposal, and Eaton Vance Investment Managers, a unit of Eaton Vance Corp., has bought his firm, ETF Consultants.

Active ETFs, like their index counterparts, are relatively thrifty. Only five charge more than 1.23% of assets yearly in fees, the average for actively managed mutual funds. And sponsors say their structure -- in which ordinary investors unload ETF shares by selling them to other investors on exchanges rather than asking the fund to redeem shares -- reduces capital-gains distributions. That's because ETFs don't have to sell securities to meet redemptions.

Several large fund companies, including T. Rowe Price Group Inc., have filed with the SEC for permission to launch active ETFs, though some say that if they get the go-ahead, they may not jump in right away. Eaton Vance just received SEC approval to start five active ETFs. BlackRock also recently gained the SEC's clearance to expand its active offerings beyond its single entry in the field, iShares Diversified Alternatives, which is technically a trust.

Eaton Vance sees active ETFs as "a means of providing better performance at lower cost," says Chief Executive Tom Faust.

To date, performance in the active ETF category has been lackluster. Of the three biggest active ETFs by assets that have been in operation for more than a year, only one has beaten its benchmark, data from their sponsors show. Of the eight active ETFs specializing in stocks and more than a year old, only two had a total return (price performance plus interest or dividend income) for the period exceeding the 15.6% showing of the S&P 500, according to IndexUniverse.

In Depth: Political overlords shackle China's monetary mandarins

Beijing -- China's premier, Wen Jiabao, warned last month that inflation is like a tiger -- once unleashed, it is "very hard to cage again."

Yet Beijing has been slow to pounce, even though food prices are rising at a nearly 12% annual clip and overall inflation hit 5.4% in March, according to numbers released Friday, more than twice the pace of a year ago. The steps it has taken thus far, including the 0.25% interest-rate increase earlier this month, have been modest. On Sunday, however, China's central bank said it will raise banks' reserve requirement ratio by 0.50 percentage point, effective from Thursday, the fourth such increase this year and a fresh step in its battle against inflation.

If it had been solely up to the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, the inflation-busting would have begun sooner, according to people involved in the matter. But the process of fighting inflation here is Byzantine, much like the Chinese government itself.

Monetary policy in the world's second-largest economy involves dueling bureaucracies, secretive committees and a Communist Party whose influence is hidden but pervasive, these people say. No single official is in charge, making it nearly impossible for other leading nations to coordinate economic policy with China.

"Who is China's Bernanke?" asks Beijing economist Yu Yongding, a former central bank adviser, referring to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. "There isn't one. Important decisions are made collectively. You can miss the best timing [to fight inflation] because decisions must be approved at a more senior level, and sometimes a go-ahead is given only after a long delay."

China's economic policies have transformed the world's most populous country by delivering annual growth averaging 10% over the past decade. But now China is facing its biggest inflation threat since the 1990s. China's leaders call the spike in prices their top economic concern for 2011.

If China presses too hard on the brakes, it could throttle its heady growth -- a potential blow to a global economy already threatened by devastation in Japan and turmoil in the Middle East. If China allows inflation to get out of hand, it could batter Chinese consumers and put pressure on exporters and banks.

On Thursday, the central bank reported that lending by financial institutions had expanded more rapidly in March than in February, and much faster than analysts anticipated -- another sign that inflation may be accelerating. Forty-four percent of 3,000 bankers surveyed by the central bank in March said the economy is overheating.

In most countries, controlling inflation falls to a central bank. China has the People's Bank of China, or PBOC, with a 63-year-old reformer, Zhou Xiaochuan, at the helm. But unlike the heads of the Fed, the European Central Bank and other major central banks, which are independent from politicians so they can take unpopular measures to thwart inflation, Mr. Zhou answers to China's political leaders.

The PBOC, indeed, often doesn't know about monetary decisions until it is informed by higher-ups, Chinese officials say. It is just one of a dozen ministries that lobby top decision makers in the Chinese government and Communist Party about whether or not to raise interest rates or boost the value of the currency to fight inflation. The central bank often loses such battles to ministries that represent go-go exporters and free-spending local governments, say economists who track the process.

The laborious, politically charged process can delay decisions for months. China's central bank began pushing for tighter monetary policy around last June. But China didn't start its anti-inflation campaign in earnest until November, after inflation had hit a two-year high.

Some foreign treasuries and central banks privately express frustration that they can't coordinate policies with China. That is because the heads of China's central bank and finance ministry can't make binding decisions, and more influential officials aren't accessible -- or may not even be known to foreign finance officials.

In October 2008, for instance, with the global financial system in extreme distress, the Fed, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank together agreed to cut interest rates. Chinese officials, who took no part in the consultations, cut rates soon thereafter, surprising Fed officials.

"It's inherent in the logic of an authoritarian country that you don't have a fully independent central bank," says former Obama White House economic chief Lawrence Summers.

In an effort to better understand Chinese policy-making, the Fed recently sent a senior researcher to Beijing for a month and invited a Chinese economist to spend time at the Fed.

Some Chinese officials say their system for managing the economy works fine. Li Daokui, a Tsinghua University economist and member of the central bank's monetary advisory committee, says the system is "necessary at this stage of economic development" because it helps build consensus for action among competing ministries that can use different tools to fight inflation. The planning ministry, for example, says it will pump up agricultural production and build low-income housing to fight food and housing inflation.

"The benefits of coordinating policy outweigh the cost of pursuing reckless monetary policy," which might happen if the PBOC were independent and made a mistaken call, Mr. Li argues.

Mr. Zhou, the PBOC's governor, has long sought to revamp China's economy so that it relies more on market forces. That has made him a favorite in the West, where he is viewed as something of an economic ambassador for China.

Mr. Summers, the former Obama adviser, says he felt comfortable enough with Mr. Zhou that when the two played a doubles tennis match in Beijing last September, they jokingly bet that the winner would set the U.S.-Chinese foreign-exchange rate. Mr. Summers lost and asked for a rematch.

At home, though, Mr. Zhou's U.S. friends may be a political liability. Rumors race around Chinese websites that he is about to be fired or even to defect to the U.S. The PBOC has denied that. He declined to be interviewed for this article.

Mr. Zhou's power is limited when it comes to key decisions about monetary policy. Under the current system, interest rates or bank-reserve requirements must be approved by China's State Council, a group of 10 headed by Premier Wen.

More fundamental questions of monetary and exchange-rate policy are decided by the Communist Party's nine-member Politburo Standing Committee, headed by China's president and party chief, Hu Jintao. There is some overlap. Two members of the State Council sit on the top Politburo committee.

Mr. Zhou isn't a member of either board, but he lobbies both in small meetings, say individuals involved in the decision-making. The central bank also writes the discussion papers that set some meeting agendas; pushes its position through monthly analyses of data and recommendations for action; and recruits outside academics to write op-eds in Chinese newspapers to build support, these people say.

Other agencies do the same as they angle to influence policy. On interest-rate decisions, the PBOC sometimes squares off against local governments and China's most powerful economic agency, National Development and Reform Commission -- the old State Planning Commission -- which wants to keep interest rates low so it can finance new projects. On exchange-rate decisions, the central bank is often opposed by the Commerce Department, which wants to keep the yuan undervalued so exporters have an edge in foreign trade.

When confronted with conflicting recommendations, Premier Wen generally delays decisions until the ministries reach agreement, say people involved in the process. Because other ministries objected, it took the PBOC several years to win State Council approval to increase from one to three the number of academics on its monetary-advisory committee, which has no decision-making power, according to Chinese economists.

At times the central bank's views are brushed aside, as they were in the fall of 2008, when the PBOC warned that China's vast stimulus plan was bound to produce a flurry of bad loans and ultimately feed inflation, say economic officials.

The stimulus spending and lending turbocharged China's economy, which grew the following year at around 9% while much of the world plunged into recession. But it also produced a potentially dangerous credit surge, as state-owned banks lent to state-owned companies, which invested in urban residential land, says Yongheng Deng, an economist at the National University of Singapore. Urban housing prices have jumped by 50% over the past two years.

At the Bank of Japan, before the earthquake and tsunami, officials warily passed around charts comparing Japan's soaring property indexes of 30 years ago with China's of today, wondering whether China's economy is a bubble about to burst.

China's central bank had to lobby intensively to persuade the central government and Communist Party to make inflation-fighting a top priority, according to people involved in the economic debate. In mid-2010, the State Council and Politburo, which each have their own research groups, worried more about sustaining growth than controlling inflation. They feared that the global economy would again fall into recession.

The State Council then started to reverse course somewhat. It boosted bank-reserve requirements in June to where they were before the crisis, reducing the amount of money banks have available to lend. But the PBOC argued that more should be done, suggesting a change in monetary stance from "moderately loose" to something tighter.

Inside the Communist Party, the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs, a Politburo advisory group headed by Premier Wen, also debated the economic situation. Although the central-bank chief met with the group, his ability to influence the outcome was limited because he isn't a member, according to several people familiar with the group.

The inflation rate hit 4.4% in October -- the biggest increase in two years -- and moved higher the following month. At around that time, the U.S. and other Group of 20 nations were arguing that Beijing should fight inflation by letting its exchange rate rise faster, which would make imports less expensive.

The central bank's inflation arguments finally began to gain traction in Communist Party debates. Sometime during the fall, the Politburo decided that China would shift its monetary stance to "prudent," from "moderately loose." (The decision wasn't announced until Dec. 3.) That bolstered the central bank's case for raising interest rates -- a decision that rests with the State Council.

On Oct. 19, China raised interest rates for the first time in nearly two years. Since Nov. 10, as the Politburo debate on monetary issues has intensified, China has boosted rates another three times, and bank-reserve rates five times.

Still, the one-year benchmark interest rate now stands at 6.31%, a full percentage point below where it was when China launched its stimulus plan, and a level that Moody'sAnalytics economist Alastair Chan calls "very low."

By comparison, Brazil, which is growing much more slowly than China, has set its benchmark overnight rate at 11.75%, about twice as high as China's one-year rate. Central bankers generally consider a tough anti-inflation stance to be short-term rates 3% or 4% higher than inflation. In China's case, that would be about 8% to 9%.

The Communist Party's latest policy statement suggests that China won't push as hard as it could on inflation for fear of a possible downturn. The Politburo announced in February that macroeconomic policy should be aimed at "preventing large fluctuations in economic growth," Politburo-speak for stressing growth.

"The Politburo is effectively the highest decision-making body" on macroeconomic issues, says Qing Wang, Morgan's Stanley's chief economist for China. "Compared to that, the PBOC is relatively limited."

Some people familiar with the inner workings of the Chinese government cite another factor constraining the central bank: a decline in thepolitical clout of its chief, Mr. Zhou, due to the retirement or deaths of his powerful early allies.

Mr. Zhou is part of the first generation of technocrats to come to power after the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. Trained as an engineer, as are many of China's top leaders, he attracted attention in the early 1980s, when he was a Ph.D student at Tsinghua University, by building computer models to simulate the effects of lifting price controls.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Zhou was a protege of China's two top politicians. Communist Party chief and President Jiang Zemin, who served from 1989 to 2002, became a friend of the Zhou family as a young man after Mr. Zhou's father hired him for a factory job. China's No. 2 official at the time, Premier Zhu Rongji, made Mr. Zhou part of his inner circle.

Mr. Zhou sought to remake China's banking and securities sectors. From 2000 to 2002, as head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, he tried to crack down on market manipulation. Starting around 1998 -- first as president of China Construction Bank, then as the central-bank head -- he played a major role in overhauling China's big state-owned banks. Eventually, the banks sold minority stakes to foreign firms, prompting grumbling in China that Mr. Zhou was selling out to foreigners.

After his patrons, Messrs. Jiang and Zhu, retired by 2003, Mr. Zhou turned to another political godfather, senior Politburo member Huang Ju, say Chinese economists. When Mr. Huang died of cancer in 2007, Mr. Zhou was weakened politically, say several of Mr. Zhou's colleagues.

Although Mr. Zhou was reappointed as PBOC governor in 2007, he has had a tougher time winning bureaucratic battles, these people say, and his political ascent appears to have stalled. His relationship with the current premier, Mr. Wen, is distant, say some people who know both men. Mr. Zhou now essentially reports to a one-time peer, Wang Qishan, a Politburo member who also has worked on banking and finance issues.

Mr. Zhou's "reformist measures and his global-mindedness may have undercut the advancement of his career," says Fred Hu, head of a Beijing investment company and a longtime Zhou adviser.

Exchange-Traded Funds (A Special Report) --- Bonding With ETFs: Fixed-income exchange-traded funds offer investors an increasing number of choices

Given the trauma of the most recent bear market and the rapidly expanding cohort of retiring baby boomers, it's little wonder that interest in fixed-income securities has been strong. While much of that demand has focused on mutual funds, newer exchange-traded funds have enjoyed a growth spurt, too.

There are now 131 bond ETFs in the U.S., with assets totaling more than $135 billion, up more than fivefold since the end of 2006, according to Morningstar Inc. That's about 3.6 times the growth rate of U.S.-equity ETFs and 3.7 times the growth rate of bond mutual funds over the same period, according to Morningstar, though bond ETFs remain much smaller overall, partly because they've only been around since 2002.

The first bond ETFs were designed as core fixed-income holdings -- focusing on investment-grade government and corporate issues. Since 2007, however, ETFs have offered everything from emerging-market and municipal debt to low-rated, high-yielding "junk" debt issued by U.S. companies, all of it in a wide range of maturities and risk profiles.

While Morningstar says that about half of all bond-ETF assets in the U.S. are in just five funds, the expansion of choice is helping to address some of the concerns of fixed-income investing in the current economic environment.

Perhaps the biggest risk for bond investors right now is interest-rate risk. A resurgent economy and soaring commodity prices suggest the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, and rising rates generally mean falling bond prices.

The simplest defense is to shorten a portfolio's maturity, which lowers its sensitivity to rate changes. ETFs that serve this approach include iShares Barclays 1-3 Year Treasury Bond, SPDR Barclays Capital 1-3 Month T-Bill and Vanguard Short-Term Government Bond Index. According to Morningstar, net inflows into ETFs focused on short-term government debt surged almost tenfold in 2010 to $2.7 billion -- proportionally the biggest increase of any Morningstar bond-ETF category -- for total assets of $12.4 billion.

The risk with this strategy is that if rates don't go up, investors will have forfeited the yield they could have earned in longer maturities.

For higher yields within a short-term framework, some relatively new ETFs invest in corporate issues: Vanguard Short Term Corporate Bond, which holds investment-grade bonds with maturities of less than five years; PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio, which holds floating-rate loans, typically to companies with below-investment-grade ratings; and SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond, for low-rated bonds. According to Morningstar, assets in this category of ETFs rose 70% last year to $14.9 billion.

These funds entail more credit risk than government debt. But if interest rates are rising, then the economy and credit quality probably are, too, says Timothy Strauts, an ETF analyst for Morningstar. If that is the case, "corporates are going to be a safe bet," he says.

A common complaint about bond funds of all kinds is that they don't have a maturity date, as an individual bond does, so investors can't lock in a fixed income stream or be certain of getting their investment back in full at a particular date. As bonds mature, funds roll over the money into new issues at new interest rates. If rates are rising, the proceeds go to work at higher yields (though investors could still suffer a capital loss). Falling rates can reduce overall return, a problem for those investing over a long period to meet a certain financial goal, (though the potential for a capital gain exists, as well).

At least two ETF sponsors are addressing these concerns by offering funds with bonds that mature in a specified year. BlackRock Inc.'s iShares unit offers six targeted-maturity ETFs that reference Standard & Poor's municipal-bond indexes. Starting with the iShares 2012 S&P AMT-Free Municipal Series, their maturities run until 2017. Guggenheim Partners LLC offers 11 such funds (three of them investing in high-yield debt), starting with its Guggenheim BulletShares 2011 Corporate Bond.

These funds typically have fewer than 100 issues, compared with hundreds for most other bond funds, so they involve a greater concentration of credit risk. And while targeting can reduce uncertainty about returns, it can't eliminate it. That's because as holdings expire at different dates through the target year, these funds reinvest the proceeds in cash-like securities until the rest of the portfolio matures. Cash rates fluctuate.

"It's still better than what you get from a traditional mutual fund," in which constantly changing maturity compositions make it even harder to predict your ultimate return, says Matthew Patterson, head of investment strategy for Accretive Asset Management LLC of Naperville, Ill., which developed the BulletShares fixed-income index methodology.

Most ETFs, in bonds and other asset classes, are index funds. Since 2008, however, several sponsors have launched actively managed bond ETFs that in many cases aim to beat, rather than mimic, the return of a certain index or market.

Examples include PowerShares Active Low Duration, a three-year-old Invesco Ltd. fund that references the Barclays Capital U.S. 1-3 Year Treasury Bond Index. Pacific Investment Management Co.'s 18-month-old Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Strategy, a mix of corporate, government and mortgage-related debt that references the Citigroup 3-Month Treasury Bill Index, last month became the first active ETF of any type to surpass $1 billion in assets.

"The thesis is that the money-market universe is limited in terms of what you can buy, and if you take just one or two small steps outside of the money-market constraints, then there are attractive opportunities that have a meaningful additional yield," says Don Suskind, head of ETF product management for Pacific Investment Management, or Pimco, one of the world's largest fixed-income managers.

The Pimco fund is up about 1.85% over the past 12 months, compared with an average 2.92% return for funds in its short-term bond category, according to Morningstar. The average taxable money-market fund returned just 0.04% over the past year, according to iMoneyNet.

One advantage that ETFs have over mutual funds is generally lower expense ratios -- 0.28% on average for bond ETFs, compared with 1.02% for fixed-income mutual funds, according to Morningstar. Actively managed bond ETFs tend to cost more than passive ones, however, with an average expense ratio of 0.49%, says Morningstar.

Bond ETFs have some drawbacks. Perhaps the most vexing is the sometimes wide discrepancy between an ETF's share price and the net asset value of its constituent bonds -- a gap accounted for mainly by the high cost of trading bonds, which outside of Treasurys are a very illiquid asset.

Some people believe ETFs "are the only liquid market for non-Treasurys," says Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics for IndexUniverse.com. He says that while there is some truth to that, ETFs in a stressed market are prone to swings based on demand for the ETF share as opposed to demand for the underlying bonds. "We certainly saw that during the [recent] flash crash and the muni crisis."

Global Finance: Big Banks Get Foreclosure Orders --- Regulators Detail Steps Lenders Must Take to Revamp Processes; Fines Are Still to Come

By Victoria McGrane, Alan Zibel and Robin Sidel

U.S. regulators hit the nation's largest banks with a first round of sweeping penalties for improper home-foreclosure practices, issuing detailed orders to revamp the way they deal with troubled borrowers.

The orders issued on Wednesday to 14 financial institutions didn't include fines. Officials said they are coming.

"There will be civil money penalties; the question is timing and amount. But we're not letting that clock run forever," Acting Comptroller of the Currency John Walsh told reporters. The orders were issued by his office, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision.

The bank regulators' action came as Obama administration officials and representatives of state attorneys general met with the bank representatives in an ongoing effort to reach a broader deal over alleged mortgage-servicing abuses, which brought foreclosures to a near halt last fall. All sides want a settlement that can resolve the issue so foreclosures can proceed again, which could help the sickly housing market.

Some attorneys general and administration officials have pushed for banks to pay more than $20 billion in civil fines or to devote a comparable amount to modifying mortgages held by distressed borrowers.

Several officials said the regulators' action wouldn't undermine the broader settlement talks. "This doesn't change what we are doing," said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller in an interview. Mr. Miller, who is spearheading the 50-state investigation, said, "We are moving ahead full speed."

Outside observers said the orders could make it harder for state attorneys general to extract greater concessions from the banks.

"The biggest stick in this fight just settled, so there's going to be a lot less pressure on the banks to agree to a radical resolution to resolve the state complaints," said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst in Washington with MF Global.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics, said the agreement appears to require only "modest changes" to banks' foreclosure process and is unlikely to have a big impact on the housing market or broader economy. Still, Mr. Zandi added, "the foreclosure process will remain bogged down and a true bottom in the housing market elusive" until the banks reach a complete settlement with the state attorneys general.

Bank executives said the changes ordered would be anything but modest. "It's very demanding and there is a lot that we have to do," said one bank official. "It will be fairly expensive and a big resource drain."

The regulators issued the orders to the nation's four largest banks -- Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Also receiving orders were Ally Financial Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC, MetLife Inc., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., SunTrust Banks Inc., U.S. Bancorp, Aurora Bank, EverBank, OneWest Bank and Sovereign Bank.

Under the orders, banks have 60 days to establish plans to clean up their mortgage-servicing processes to prevent documentation errors.

The orders also direct banks to take steps to ensure they have enough staff to handle the flood of foreclosures, that foreclosures don't happen when a borrower is receiving a loan modification and that borrowers have a single point of contact throughout the loan-modification and foreclosure process.

Banks must hire an independent consultant to conduct a "look back" of all foreclosure proceedings from 2009 and 2010 to evaluate whether they improperly foreclosed on any homeowners and require each company to establish its own process to consider whether to compensate borrowers who have been harmed.

Critics, including other regulators, believe this process and other aspects of the orders leave too much discretion to banks.

J.P. Morgan, in a statement, acknowledged that the consent orders "are targeted directly at weaknesses in our processes and controls." The New York bank took a charge of $1.1 billion in the first quarter to reflect higher mortgage-servicing costs that resulted from a string of new regulations enacted after the financial crisis.

Other banks said many of the required changes already are under way. "This is an unprecedented measure and a tough message to take, but it will make mortgage servicing practices better across the board," Wells Fargo said. The San Francisco bank said it already has taken numerous actions to address the issues, including hiring 10,000 employees since 2009 to deal with foreclosure issues.

PNC Financial Services sought to distance itself from the industry's mess, saying that it represents just 1.5% of the mortgage-servicing business. A spokesman for the Pittsburgh bank said that its internal review had determined that the bank didn't foreclose on customers without a "valid reason or appropriate documents."

Even before the orders became public, critics charged that the bank regulators were letting servicers off too easy and were undercutting the broader talks.

The OCC, which has been the target of most criticism, defended the enforcement orders. "They require substantial corrective actions," Mr. Walsh said. "The banks are going to have to do substantial work, bear substantial expense to fix the problems that we identified" as well as to identify and compensate homeowners that suffered financial harm.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in a statement called the orders "only a first step" and declared its full support for the broader talks. "The enforcement orders announced [Wednesday] complement, rather than pre-empt or impede, this ongoing collaboration," it said.

Setting a Record

In New Jersey

---

At $375 a Square Foot,

Deal for 2 Office Buildings

'Raises the Bar' for State

The high investor demand that has been seen for top-quality office buildings in Manhattan is beginning to cross the Hudson River to the New Jersey waterfront.

Hartz Mountain Industries Inc. this week sold twin 12-story office buildings in Jersey City's Colgate Center in a deal that values them at about $310 million.

That translates into a record $375 a square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics, a real-estate research firm.

The buyer, CB Richard Ellis Realty Trust, a nontraded REIT, is paying about $70 million and assuming $240 million in debt for the buildings at 70 and 90 Hudson St., which offer unobstructed views of Manhattan and are 100% leased.

"This raises the bar for New Jersey office buildings," says Andrew Merin, of Cushman & Wakefield, which represented Hartz Mountain.

But even the best New Jersey properties remain a bargain compared with those in Manhattan.

The price is expected to yield a return in the high 7% range; bullish buyers in the Big Apple are accepting returns of 5% and below for prime buildings.

Vacancies Persist

At Mall Trade Show

Big defections from the shopping-center industry's biggest trade show are increasing rather than abating.

At the International Council of Shopping Centers' annual RECon conference in Las Vegas next month, mall giants Simon Property Group Inc., Westfield Group and Macerich Co. won't set up their large leasing offices in the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Rather, the three will set up shop at Caesars Palace, several blocks away.

This is the third consecutive year that Simon has gone to Caesars instead, the second for Westfield and the first for Macerich.

All three say their primary motivation is to avoid the high costs of setting up and operating their offices at the convention center.

It is a change of tack for Simon, which indicated last year that it would return to the convention center this year.

None of the three would detail the costs they expect to save with their move to Caesars.

In past years, Simon said it spent $2 million to $3 million to operate at the convention center, and that Caesars cost less than half that amount.

Westfield pegged its costs at $1.5 million for operating on the convention-center exhibit floor.

ICSC spokesman Malachy Kavanagh said that ICSC offered the three various smaller spaces at the convention center at lower cost, to no avail.

Brokerage Gets Into

Fuel-Cell Business

Real-estate brokerage Newmark Knight Frank says it is getting into the fuel-cell business, in a sign of the growing interest in alternative-energy sources in the commercial-property industry.

Newmark, in partnership with fuel-cell maker UTC Power Corp. and renewable-energy investor Austin Energy Partners LLC, will market the technology to its clients and other owners of data centers, office buildings, hotels and other commercial buildings.

The new business, dubbed Newmark Energy Solutions LLC, also will design, finance, and construct the fuel cells, which create electricity through chemical reactions rather than by burning something.

For now, fuel cells aren't used on a broad scale in commercial buildings because they are more complicated and often more expensive than drawing electricity from the grid. But they have been growing in popularity, thanks to design improvements, heightened interest in alternative energy and government incentives.

Last year, the developers who are rebuilding New York's World Trade Center installed six fuel cells that will provide about 30% of the power for two of the site's new office towers.

It's no time to be complacent in Europe

When Greece applied for a euro-zone bailout last May, the markets went into a tailspin for months, and when Ireland hit the buffers in December, the fallout lasted for weeks.

Yet Portugal's decision to throw in the towel Wednesday has barely troubled investors: The euro rose, Italian and Spanish bond yields remained close to 12-month lows and bank stocks rose. Not only was Portugal's bailout long expected, but the market has reached a settled view that Spain has decoupled from Europe's crisis-stricken periphery.

That may be the correct assessment. It certainly seems to be the view of the euro-zone authorities.

The European Central Bank pushed ahead nonchalantly with a well-forecast interest-rate increase Thursday, and it has effectively suspended its government bond-buying program, crucial in averting post-Greek and Irish bailout contagion. European leaders clearly felt sufficiently relaxed last month about the risks of the crisis spreading to Spain that they shelved difficult decisions over expanding proposals to increase the powers of Europe's bailout mechanisms, previously considered essential to draw a line under the crisis.

Still, the turnaround in perceptions toward Spain has been swift. Just four months ago, bond yields hit 5.45% -- not far from the 6% level at which a bailout starts to look plausible. Today, those yields are down to 5.06%. That reflects optimism that Spain has taken convincing steps to address its fiscal crisis: introducing tough austerity-budget measures, restructuring its troubled savings-bank sector and implementing structural reforms.

Spain is fortunate it started the crisis with a low ratio of government debt to GDP. Even if Spanish banks turn out to need a government equity injection of 120 billion euros ($172 billion), the country's debt would still likely peak at 87% of GDP, estimates Evolution Securities.

Even so, the risks that previously worried investors haven't gone away. Unemployment is stuck at 20%, which is likely to continue to put downward pressure on consumer spending and the housing market, and the stock of unsold homes stands at more than one million units, which on a per-capita basis means the unsold inventory is three times that of the U.S., notes research group Gavekal.

In addition, doubts persist over Madrid's ability to rein in borrowing by Spain's regional authorities, and the combined funding needs of Spain's public and private sectors -- with total debt equivalent to 354% of GDP, far above Greece and Portugal -- will test markets.

Will the ECB's rate increase alter the outlook? Perhaps not. Much depends on what further tightening the market prices in and over what period. Spain's recovery prospects depend in particular on banks being able to borrow at low rates. But market sentiment can turn quickly, and political risks across Europe are rising. This is no time for complacency.

Moto Mobility must weigh more scale

Sanjay Jha has accomplished what seemed nearly impossible -- a nascent turnaround at Motorola Mobility. But a more sustainable recovery may require more drastic action.

The CEO's two main businesses, cellphones and TV set-top boxes, confront daunting challenges. In cellphones, Mobility faces much bigger rivals like Samsung and Nokia. In set-top boxes, about one-third of total company revenue, the market is likely to stagnate in coming years.

Consolidation might benefit both businesses. In cellphones, for instance, Mobility's market share was 2.8% in the fourth quarter, says Strategy Analytics, seventh globally. Strong in North and Latin America, it has less than 1% of the European market. Scale can, for instance, decrease component costs.

The handset business delivered its first operating profit since 2006 in the fourth quarter. However, the company expects it to post another loss in the first quarter, due to the rollout of Apple's iPhone by Verizon, Mobility's top distributor.

For long-term profitability, Mobility needs a higher share of high-margin smartphones. Rival HTC has a 16% operating margin, compared with Mobility's 2% in handsets. While part of the difference is due to HTC's emphasis on cheaper Taiwanese labor, says Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu, it also reflects the fact HTC has 8% of the smartphone market against Mobility's 4.6%.

One solution could be to merge with another Android phone maker, Sony Ericsson, Mr. Ferragu suggests. Its overall market share is 2.8%, and its smartphone share is 3.6%. Putting the two together would provide cost-cutting opportunities, plus, they complement each other geographically.

The trouble could be convincing Sony and Ericsson to exit from the business, to allow for a single, unified management. And using all its cash on a deal would leave Mobility little flexibility to spend on merging the businesses and having a buffer against further losses.

Trying to out-innovate bigger and better-financed rivals in handsets looks tough. Mobility needs to get out or get bigger.

Actelion dents

a fund's plans

to steer board

For Actelion, attack could prove the best form of defense. The Swiss biotech group is under siege from activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors after a series of drug-development failures. Elliott wants control of Actelion's board to force a strategy change. It urges votes for six new independent directors at a meeting on May 5. But Actelion has proposed its own nominees: former GlaxoSmithKline Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Garnier and Robert Bertoloni, former Schering-Plough finance head. That could dent Elliott's ambitions.

Mr. Garnier's nomination strengthens Actelion's defense. As the respected leader of a European pharmaceutical giant for seven years, he brings credibility and experience that Elliott's nominees can't match. Mr. Garnier praises management's track record. Despite recent setbacks, Actelion's shares have doubled in value in the past five years. If elected, he will take over as chairman once incumbent Robert Cawthorn steps down in 2012.

But Actelion's nominations suggest it is rattled by Elliott's campaign. The company says they are part of normal succession planning, but their announcement came as a surprise. Elliott wants Actelion to cut costs, narrow its focus and consider putting itself up for sale, a move Elliott believes could value its shares at 70 Swiss francs ($76.18), from 52.45 francs currently. Actelion believes a sale now risks undervaluing the company, since it will take time for the value of its pipeline of new drugs to become clear.

The question is whether Actelion has done enough to convince investors it can address recent share-price underperformance. That seems, on balance, likely. But even if May's outcome isn't all that Elliott hopes, it needn't be a fatal blow. Both Mr. Garnier and Mr. Bertolini have considerable takeover experience. The debate over Actelion's future is unlikely to be settled, whoever wins seats on its board.

-- Hester Plumridge

Overheard

For whom the bell tolls. Nokia still might be the biggest cellphone maker in shipments, but it is fast sliding down the market-cap rankings. Long smaller than diversified giants like Apple and Samsung, in recent days Nokia has fallen behind handset up-and-comer HTC. Nokia's market value fell to $33.2 billion Thursday, against HTC's $33.8 billion, according to FactSet. A year ago, Nokia was worth $57.9 billion, and HTC, just $9.6 billion.

What is extraordinary is how much bigger Nokia remains in market share. HTC shipped little more then 24 million handsets last year, almost all of which were smartphones, according to Strategy Analytics. Nokia shipped 453 million, of which about 100 million were smartphones. But investors pay for growth. And Sanford C. Bernstein expects HTC's shipments to soar to 43.3 million this year, while Nokia's number will decline slightly.

The Property Report: Quake threatens to stall recovery

Real-estate investors in Japan spent recent months getting in position for what looked like a nascent recovery. They have spent recent days assessing damage and grappling with the long-term consequences of the destruction and a possible nuclear disaster.

The area of northern Japan hardest hit by the earthquake and tsunami has little foreign and institutional ownership of real-estate, compared with places such as Tokyo and Osaka, investors say. International private-equity funds and companies that invest in Japanese real estate have reported mainly cosmetic damage -- such as displaced ceiling tiles, cracked parking lots, and broken sprinkler pipes -- to their assets, most of which were built to withstand earthquakes.

But property values throughout the country could tumble, if economic repercussions result in lower demand for office space, stores and hotel rooms. The biggest worry on many minds on Tuesday was the extent of the damage to reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plant about 150 miles north of Tokyo, a situation that remained fluid as night fell in Japan.

"Absent the nuclear uncertainty, I don't believe there would be any long-term negative impact to the Tokyo real-estate market," said Jon-Paul Toppino, president of Secured Capital Japan. The firm notified clients in recent days that its employees were safe and that its $8.5 billion Japanese real-estate portfolio, which includes an office building in the harder-hit city of Sendai, was largely undamaged.

But Japan's publicly traded landlords have lost as much as 20% of their value since the quake struck, as fear rose Tuesday about the economic consequences of the disaster. Shares of Mori Hills REIT Investment Corp. have fallen about 20% since Friday, Nippon Building Fund Inc. has dropped 13%, Japan Real Estate Investment Corp. is down 12% and Global One Real Estate Investment Corp. is off 10%. Japan Logistics Fund Inc. dropped 17%.

Even Japanese construction companies such as Kajima Corp., Shimizu Corp., and Taisei Corp., which saw their shares jump on Monday on hope they would profit from rebuilding efforts, were hit by the broad selloff in Tokyo on Tuesday, where the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 11%.

The earthquake hit at a time when Japan's real-estate market was showing signs of recovery, especially in Tokyo and a handful other cities popular with foreign investors. Japanese real-estate investment trusts have enjoyed more access to capital, especially since the Bank of Japan last fall started buying a range of financial assets, including J-REITs and exchange-traded funds. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's REIT Index climbed sharply, touching 1,107.70 last month, a 22% rise from a year ago.

"We've gone through the major assets -- the [earthquake] damage appears to be cosmetic, not structural," said Scott Kelley, chief executive of private-equity firm Aetos Capital Asia, which has a $5 billion real-estate portfolio in Japan. "The big question is, 'Where does the economy go?' "

Many U.S.-based investment firms will be watching closely. Morgan Stanley's real-estate unit bought three office buildings in Japan in August, according to Real Capital Analytics. Hedge-fund giant Fortress Investment Group last summer made a $250 million investment in daVinci Holdings K.K. and said it had finished fund raising for an $800 million private-equity fund targeting real-estate debt in Japan. Morgan Stanley and Fortress didn't have immediate comment Tuesday morning in New York.

For hotel companies, the disaster comes at a time of resurgence in global travel. Major operators, including Starwood Hotels & Resorts and Marriott International, haven't reported major structural damage in Japan or interruptions to business operations, but they could be hurt if tourism and business travel drops.

Japanese real estate, long attractive to U.S. investors, has lately drawn capital from other Asian countries as well. Investors from Hong Kong, Singapore, and other neighbors snapped up property last year, believing that real estate in Japanese cities was still attractive and undervalued. Land prices have plummeted for more than a decade.

Singapore-based Global Logistic Properties Ltd., one of Asia's largest warehouse owners, estimated about $58 million in losses to its $6.3 billion portfolio in Japan. The company's shares on the Singapore stock exchange are off about 7% since Friday morning.

Small Business
Firms Weigh Recovery Act --- Some Owners Say Provisions in the Law Have Fallen Short of Expectations

By Emily Maltby

In the two years since President Barack Obama signed the $787 billion Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law, some small-business owners attribute their companies' survival to the stimulus package -- yet many say the provisions in the law have fallen short of their expectations.

Some 83% of small, closely held companies say that publicly traded companies got the bulk of stimulus benefits, according to Pepperdine University's Private Capital Markets 2011 Economic Forecast Report, released in January. That's in line with a survey conducted in February 2010 by Discover Financial Services, in which 70% of owners said that the stimulus had no impact on their business.

For many business owners, the stimulus package -- which green-lighted credit-access programs, introduced new tax breaks and opened up contracting opportunities -- was too unwieldy to understand.

"When small businesses are faced with a complex menu of options, they don't have the resources to investigate all the opportunities," says John K. Paglia, a senior researcher for the Pepperdine report.

Others say that the programs weren't immediate enough. "For all of the talk of shovel-ready projects -- that never really materialized," says Chad Moutray, president of the economic advisory firm Pinchfield Consulting and Analytics LLC, and former chief economist at the Office of Advocacy, the Small Business Administration's research and oversight division.

As of early this month, some 92% of the stimulus funds, excluding tax benefits, have been made available, according to the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. Obama administrators who have tracked those funds have noticed a positive effect on the small-business community.

"Tens of thousands of small businesses benefit directly from billions of dollars in Recovery Act loans and federal contracts, as well as from targeted tax breaks," says Karen Mills, head of the SBA.

Here, a look at three major stimulus initiatives, and how business owners are faring.

Access to Credit

The stimulus allowed the SBA to eliminate fees on government-backed loans, while raising the guarantee level to 90% from 75% to entice lenders. Between February 2009 and August 2010, the SBA approved $22 billion in small-business stimulus loans.

Thanks to the stimulus, Andrew Schuman says he secured an SBA-backed loan from AmFirst Bank for $2.1 million last March, used to hire workers and expand his company, Hammond's Candies LLC, in Denver.

Getting the loan was a huge relief -- during the recession, Mr. Schuman, Hammond's president and chief executive, saw his credit lines cut and his lending fees soar. Today, he is paying 6% interest on the loan each month -- less than half of what he was paying previously.

The SBA has touted the program as a success. While banks' conventional lending continued to fall, SBA loans bounced back to pre-recession levels.

Pinchfield's Mr. Moutray says that the program was successful, but that it was too small to have any significant impact in the overall credit environment.

"A very small percentage of businesses take advantage of SBA lending," he says. "There are access-to-credit issues that resonate today."

Indeed, overall credit to small business dropped 6.2% from 2009 to 2010, according to a study released earlier this month by the SBA's Office of Advocacy.

Tax Breaks

The stimulus created several tax breaks for business owners, such as a carry-back provision that allows companies to apply current losses to the taxes they had paid on profits as far back as five years ago, potentially giving them a refund.

But a common complaint among small businesses is that tax breaks, particularly those that applied to purchases and hiring in 2009, didn't offer immediate relief. Owners had to wait until they filed their returns -- more than a year after the Recovery Act passed -- in order to get many of the benefits.

"The president's stimulus package did nothing for us because [the provisions] only helped when you went to pay your taxes," says Patricia Orzano, who owns a 7-Eleven franchise in Massapequa, N.Y., with her husband, Richard Orzano.

Ms. Mills, of the SBA, has a different take. She says that the Recovery Act tax breaks not only helped "countless small businesses keep their doors open, but also put them in a position to drive local economic activity and, in turn, save and create jobs all across the country."

Government Contracts

About 32% of stimulus contracts, or $35 billion as of earlier this month, have gone to small companies, based on data available from the Federal Procurement Data System, exceeding a mandate that 23% of government contracts go to small businesses.

Two stimulus contracts totaling $278,873 went to Rosene Ruschman, owner of Rosene Creative Services LLC, a Jasper, Ga.-based company that designs exhibits and signage for parks and nature centers.

"Before the stimulus money, there were projects out there, but you had to hunt," says Ms. Ruschman, who saw her sales double in 2009 with the influx of Recovery Act work, and remain steady since.

For Ms. Ruschman, the Recovery Act contracts allowed her business to survive. "If the stimulus didn't pass, I'd really be in trouble right now," she says.

Running a Business
Small Businesses Weigh Recovery Act

In the two years since President Barack Obama signed the $787 billion Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law, some small-business owners attribute their companies' survival to the stimulus package yet many say the provisions in the 1,100-page law have fallen short of their expectations.

Some 83% of small, closely held companies say that publicly traded companies got the bulk of stimulus benefits, according to Pepperdine University's Private Capital Markets 2011 Economic Forecast Report, released in January. That's in line with a survey conducted in February 2010 by Discover Financial Services, in which 70% of owners said that the stimulus had no impact on their business.

For many business owners, the stimulus package which green-lighted credit-access programs, introduced new tax breaks and opened up contracting opportunities was too unwieldy to understand.

"When small businesses are faced with a complex menu of options, they don't have the resources to investigate all the opportunities," says John K. Paglia, a senior researcher for the Pepperdine report. "Any distraction away from [running a business] puts the business at an increased probability of failure."

Others say that the programs weren't immediate enough. "For all of the talk of shovel-ready projects that never really materialized," says Chad Moutray, president of the economic advisory firm Pinchfield Consulting and Analytics LLC, and former chief economist at the Office of Advocacy, the Small Business Administration's research and oversight division. "When you look at overall government spending, there was a trickle effect. What the economy needed was a jolt."

As of early this month, some 92% of the stimulus funds, excluding tax benefits, have been made available, according to the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. Obama administrators who have tracked those funds have noticed a positive effect on the small-business community.

"Tens of thousands of small businesses benefit directly from billions of dollars in Recovery Act loans and federal contracts, as well as from targeted tax breaks," says Karen Mills, head of the SBA.

To be sure, the Recovery Act's impact is hard to quantify. It is unknown what would have happened to the economy without it, the Congressional Budget Office notes in a November 2010 report. And complicating matters is the longevity issue the stimulus was intended to give the economy a boost over several years and many initiatives that expired or ran out of Recovery Act funding have been renewed in subsequent legislation.

At least four stimulus tax provisions targeting small companies have been extended under new laws and one popular lending program was revived five times. Government contracts under the stimulus were issued through the end of September. But many of those projects will roll out in years to come and then spur the need for follow-up projects.

Here, a look at three major stimulus initiatives, and how business owners are faring.

Access to Credit

The stimulus allowed the SBA to eliminate fees on government-backed loans, while raising the guarantee level to 90% from 75% to entice lenders. Between February 2009 and August 2010, the SBA approved $22 billion in small-business stimulus loans.

Thanks to the stimulus, Andrew Schuman says he secured an SBA-backed loan from AmFirst Bank for $2.1 million last March, which he used to hire workers and expand his company, Hammond's Candies LLC, in Denver.

Getting the loan was a huge relief during the recession, Mr. Schuman, Hammond's president and chief executive, saw his credit lines cut and his lending fees soar. Today, he is paying 6% interest on the loan each month less than half of what he was paying previously.

The SBA has touted the program as a success. While banks' conventional lending continued to fall, SBA loans bounced back to pre-recession levels.

Pinchfield's Mr. Moutray says that the program was successful, but that it was too small to have any significant impact in the overall credit environment.

"A very small percentage of businesses take advantage of SBA lending," he says. "There are access-to-credit issues that resonate today."

Indeed, overall credit to small business dropped 6.2% from 2009 to 2010, according to a study released earlier this month by the SBA's Office of Advocacy.

As for Mr. Schuman, he says that Hammond's was lucky to get an SBA loan because the process wasn't easy. The lending provision that helped him save $40,000 in processing fees, he says, was attached to burdensome paperwork and he had to seek assistance from a business development center that specializes in packaging SBA loans.

"I really do feel that it was a well-intended program that just didn't make it because the execution for an average business owner was too hard," he says. "It wasn't easy, even working with people who knew how to do it."

Tax Breaks

The stimulus created several tax breaks for business owners, such as a carry-back provision that allows companies to apply current losses to the taxes they had paid on profits as far back as five years ago, potentially giving them a refund.

The stimulus also increased an equipment expensing deduction and gave a tax credit for hiring unemployed military veterans and high-school dropouts.

But a common complaint among small businesses is that tax breaks, particularly those that applied to purchases and hiring in 2009, didn't offer immediate relief. Owners had to wait until they filed their returns more than a year after the Recovery Act passed in order to get many of the benefits.

"The president's stimulus package did nothing for us because [the provisions] only helped when you went to pay your taxes," says Patricia Orzano, who owns a 7-Eleven franchise in Massapequa, N.Y., with her husband, Richard Orzano. "You don't see that till the following year. What good is that?"

Ms. Orzano says her business's finances haven't improved since the stimulus was enacted. Due to weak sales, she hasn't been able to hire anyone in three years and can't afford to upgrade her business equipment, making her ineligible for key tax breaks.

The National Federation of Independent Business, of which Ms. Orzano is a member, had lobbied for the stimulus to create a payroll-tax holiday for owners and employees, and believes it would have been more effective than the stimulus programs that passed.

"That would have put a big increase in everyone's take-home pay right away," says Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB's chief economist. "Consumers weren't going to borrow more money to spend but they would have spent it in their take-home pay."

Ms. Mills, of the SBA, has a different take. She says that the Recovery Act tax breaks not only helped "countless small businesses keep their doors open, but also put them in a position to drive local economic activity and, in turn, save and create jobs all across the country."

Government Contracts

About 32% of stimulus contracts, or $35 billion as of earlier this month, have gone to small companies, based on data available from the Federal Procurement Data System, exceeding a mandate that 23% of government contracts go to small businesses.

One reason for the popularity boost is that "the mix of what is being procured lent itself to small businesses," says Joe Jordan, associate administrator of government contracting and business development at the SBA. "There were no large weapons systems or vaccines or things where small businesses have a hard time being a prime contractor."

Two stimulus contracts totaling $278,873 went to Rosene Ruschman, owner of Rosene Creative Services LLC, a Jasper, Ga.-based company that designs exhibits and signage for parks and nature centers.

"Before the stimulus money, there were projects out there, but you had to hunt," says Ms. Ruschman, who saw her sales double in 2009 with the influx of Recovery Act work, and remain steady since. "They were available enough to keep you going, but you couldn't really grow."

Ms. Ruschman who has done government work for 12 years, was ready to apply for contracts when the stimulus rolled out. Many owners, however, weren't in the same position. The average business owner has found that it takes nearly two years of trying to get government contracts, according to a 2010 American Express survey. Some who entered the procurement system in 2009 are just getting the required certifications today.

For Ms. Ruschman, who plans to hire two employees, the Recovery Act contracts allowed her business to survive. "If the stimulus didn't pass, I'd really be in trouble right now," she says.

Australia's weak spot

A ratings warning on Australia's four major banks may be late, but it could be just the beginning.

Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service sent a warning shot against the country's big four banks -- Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac and National Australia Bank -- by putting them on review for a possible credit downgrade. Analysts largely called the move six months to two years too late, noting that the wholesale-funding concerns that prompted it were at their worst a few years ago. Since then, all four banks have made strides to improve their sources of deposits and other funding.

Even so, Moody's doesn't believe the banks have done enough, and market participants now expect a ratings cut come May to Aa2 or possibly Aa3. A move to Aa2 would bring the ratings firm's view on all four banks in line with the ratings of Standard & Poor's, which itself could be cutting further. About a month ago, S&P put its global banking criteria on review, noting that "if the [proposed] criteria is implemented in its current form, there is potential for ratings action."

That four of the world's top 20 banks could be subject to ratings downgrades while the country is in the midst of a mining boom and they are experiencing surging profits shows just how susceptible the system remains to further shocks.

In the meantime, those four Australian banks won't see their funding sources diversify much more anytime soon. Australia's fixed-income market simply isn't robust enough to support all the banks' needs, and funds from capital markets account for almost half of the lenders' liabilities, Moody's says.

The overall cost to a major Australian bank to issue a three-year bond recently has been about 1.20 percentage points over the government-bond yield, compared with about 0.50 percentage point before the financial crisis. Expect that to widen in the near term as the market begins to come to grips with the vulnerable side of the Australian financial sector.

China's statistics

are private property

China's National Bureau of Statistics doesn't get it.

First, with global markets focused on inflation, the NBS changes the method for calculating the consumer-price index but keeps key details of the approach under wraps.

Now, with domestic and international attention focused on the bubbly real-estate sector, it plans to cease publication of the main national measure of property prices.

China's property-price data don't have a great record for accuracy. Data collected by private research agencies show prices more than doubling from 2004 to 2010. The NBS index registers only a 50% increase over the period. In 2009, an announcement by the NBS of an increase in prices of 1.5% for the year, at odds with the public perception, sparked a firestorm of criticism.

In some respects, the overhauls announced by the NBS Wednesday are a step forward. For 35 of China's biggest cities, the stats bureau has shifted away from surveys conducted by sometimes unreliable local officials and toward a complete record of all transactions, reported over the Internet.

But instead of using this better data to publish a national average, the NBS has stopped publication.

Not publishing the data might remove a rallying point for popular discontent over unaffordable housing. But it won't do anything to solve the underlying problem. And it just got harder for investors tracking real estate as a factor driving domestic growth, and international demand for iron ore and copper.

China has overtaken Japan to be the second-largest economy in the world, but in terms of the transparency of its economic data, it remains some way further down the list.

Apple risks an app-lash

from publishers on iPad

By playing hardball with media companies on App Store subscriptions, Apple risks a painful rebound.

Few media outlets can afford to not have their mobile applications available through Apple's App Store. With the iPad, Apple has an early lead in tablets, with a 75.3% share of global tablet shipments in the fourth quarter, Strategy Analytics estimates. And while its share of smartphone shipments was only 16.1%, the iPhone is the phone of choice for many affluent consumers.

But that hardly justifies Apple's terms for subscriptions sold within its App Store. The company will keep 30% of the revenues and won't automatically give publishers information about their subscribers. While publishers can avoid these strictures by signing up people on their website, that is hardly ideal.

Publishers are likely to be receptive to alternatives. And, unlike with the iPod, Apple may not dominate the tablet market for long. Devices running Google's Android mobile operating system already are flooding the market. They had 21.6% of global tablet shipments in the fourth quarter, up from 2.3% in the third quarter. Android could arguably have as much impact in tablets as it has had in smartphones, where it had a 32.5% share in the fourth quarter.

Google isn't wasting time trying to exploit this opportunity, unveiling a more publisher-friendly payment system Wednesday, a day after Apple announced its plans.

Google lets publishers keep about 90% of the subscription revenue. More important, it would give publishers the names and addresses of their subscribers, unlike Apple, which would only give consumers the option of providing that data to the publisher. This is a crucial issue for publishers that need detailed information about their customers to more effectively sell advertising and to market other products. Google imposes some limits: It would let consumers opt out of receiving marketing materials.

By potentially alienating content providers, Apple could undermine its longstanding advantage in apps, particularly if it continues to lose share to Android in the tablet market. Use of media is a major reason people buy tablets. A Forrester Research survey last month found 49% of tablet owners used them to read newspapers and magazines. If publishers decided to more aggressively promote Android tablets, Apple sales could be affected.

Talking up India telecom

India's mobile-telecommunication industry has long been credited with championing the low-cost wireless revolution. Its next challenge is to persuade Indian consumers to start paying up.

Nine of India's 15 telecom companies are rolling out third-generation services. One, Tata Teleservices, is already running television advertisements boasting of the merits of the new technology, including faster Internet access and video calling.

Tata and the other eight paid $15 billion to buy the 3G airwaves from New Delhi. The trick now will be to charge enough to make that investment profitable.

Consider that the telecom industry's approach to India has been to offer dirt-cheap services to capture as many subscribers as possible. Call rates in India are as low as two U.S. cents a minute. True, some companies are still quite profitable, despite the low charges. For example, Bharti Airtel generated a 35% margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the quarter that ended in September, though this was five percentage points lower than a year earlier.

But growth lately has come thanks to rapid expansion in rural India. Rural subscribers accounted for a third of total users at the end of September, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

Rural consumers, though, can't be expected to snap up expensive 3G services. Nor can most of India's urban consumers, in fact. Three-quarters of India's urban households earn less than $550 a month, says Indicus Analytics, a market-research firm. For this crowd, many of the 3G offerings -- and the smartphones that optimize them -- will be too expensive.

Moreover, language diversity in India means the pool of customers will be fragmented. Right now, most applications offered by Tata are in English. But even those developed in Hindi will mean large groups of users will be excluded.

Ultimately, competition could make 3G unprofitable for many companies. Starting Thursday, India's mobile users get the chance to switch service providers without changing phone numbers, which will only intensify competition.

"Even with such low call rates, it's possible for six or seven companies to make money, but not 12 or 13. Some of them will have to merge," says Romal Shetty at KPMG. He predicts the industry will start consolidating within 18 months.

Talk is cheap. India's mobile operators need to change that.

Shifting the view

of emerging markets

The invention of the BRIC concept by Goldman Sachs's Jim O'Neill in 2001 was a helpful building block for investors; these economies, led by China, have transformed themselves in the last decade. Now, Mr. O'Neill argues that for these countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- and some others, the term emerging markets is inappropriate: "Growth markets" is the new name. The scale of that growth will require big adjustments by investors.

Chinese officials said last weekend that growth in 2010 was about 10%, with the economy reaching $6 trillion in size. That means the Chinese economy is adding the equivalent of about half of the Spanish economy a year. But beyond the BRICs, Mexico, South Korea, Turkey and Indonesia, identified by Mr. O'Neill as a key group of growth markets, now account for more than 1% of world gross domestic product each, and all are within the 20 biggest economies in the world.

Investors will have to change how they see the world. Dedicated investors have long complained that allocations to emerging markets are far below even what would be implied by market capitalization, let alone by GDP weighting. Meanwhile, Mr. O'Neill argues that what happens in China this year will be more important for European investors than what happens in the euro-zone sovereign-debt crisis. As long as Europe ultimately solves the crisis, as many expect, that seems likely to be true.

Another adjustment could come in capital flows. With a lack of assets available for investment, imbalances conceivably could worsen, with cash inflows placing appreciation pressure on currencies. But if growth markets can respond by deepening their financial markets, then over time, "hot" money flows should become less-flighty and more-permanent allocations. That, too, should support growth, although capital controls seem unavoidable in the near term.

The end result of these adjustments will be a changed world. Markets face a challenge in keeping up with that growth.

-- Richard Barley

Investors are learning

to look past the crisis

Time to move on? The hot topics of 2010 mostly fell by the wayside at a Goldman Sachs investor conference in London Monday. There was little discussion of quantitative easing, mentions of fiscal deficits were few, and the euro-zone debt crisis largely retreated into the background. Instead there was a call to leave 2008 behind and focus on a global economy that is in better shape than many think.

There is growing evidence that investors are, perhaps despite themselves, swinging around to this way of thinking. Despite the resurgence of the sovereign-crisis late last year, stock indexes like the S&P 500 and DAX gained more than 10% in the fourth quarter even as bond yields rose. In credit markets, default-swap prices for high-yield companies have fallen steadily since June. Investor confidence is solid; the German ZEW economic expectations index rose sharply in January, even after Germany's best year of growth since reunification.

And growth is the key. If bond yields are rising because economies are growing, this is bullish for risk assets, and equities in particular. It is only when real bond yields rise above 4% that equities tend to fall, HSBC notes; currently they are below 2% in major markets. Consensus forecasts for world economic growth in 2011 have started to rise, J.P. Morgan Chase notes. Goldman's own bullishness is based around its above-consensus forecast for U.S. growth of 3.4% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012.

This isn't to say there won't be nervous periods. In the U.S., the decision on raising the federal debt ceiling could be a drama. In Europe, despite optimistic sounds, euro-zone politicians have yet to set out a comprehensive response to the crisis, and in Asia, investors will continue to fret that central banks are behind the curve on inflation.

The crisis of 2008 left investors more inclined to view tail risks -- extreme events with a low probability of occurring -- as likely to materialize. Thus the debt crisis in Greece, which accounts for just 2.5% of euro-zone GDP, led to fears about the collapse of the euro. But the policy response, while flawed, is determined to remove that risk. Continued macroeconomic stability and growth might encourage more investors to move on.

The Fed's Loans: Absent Help, More Funds Might Have Broken Buck

Just one money-market fund blew up during the financial crisis. Without help from the U.S. government, the number might have been much higher, data released by the Federal Reserve show.

Nine of the 10 largest money-market fund companies at the time, with two-thirds of all money-market-fund assets under management, turned to a financial first-aid program called the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money-Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. The funds, facing an illiquidity squeeze, sold billions of dollars of commercial paper to major banks, which in turn used money borrowed from the Fed to make the purchases.

Those companies are Fidelity Investments, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., BlackRock Inc., Federated Investors Inc., Dreyfus Corp., Charles Schwab Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Columbia Management and Morgan Stanley. Among the 10 largest money-fund firms, only Vanguard Group didn't use the program.

The data released by the Fed on Wednesday underscore how susceptible money-market funds still are to runs, some industry experts said. During the crisis, the Reserve Primary Fund was unable to keep its shares at the $1 level, stunning the market by "breaking the buck."

"This was an unprecedented market environment and we believed it to be in the best interest of our shareholders to take advantage of this liquidity outlet established by the Fed," a spokeswoman for Dreyfus said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for BlackRock said, "We thought the program was very successful and achieved its stated purpose, which is it helped prevent a run on money funds."

"Fidelity carefully reviewed the Federal Reserves liquidity facility and determined it was in the best interest of our money-market fund shareholders to participate in the program," a Fidelity representative said.

A representative for Schwab said in an email, "Although we had no liquidity issues, we did take advantage of one specific facility because it was the best option for selling positions and reinvesting the funds at the time."

Representatives for Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Representatives for Federated and Columbia couldn't be reached for comment.

Recent regulatory changes to money-market funds, including a requirement to keep more assets in short-term paper, have made funds safer. But they don't address the fact that it is essentially impossible to maintain the $1-a-share benchmark while also guaranteeing immediate liquidity.

"If the Fed hadn't been standing there, the funds would have broken the buck," said Christopher Whalen, who runs research firm Institutional Risk Analytics. "I'm wondering if funds aren't going to have to say to investors that net-asset value will have to trade every day, and it may be below par."

Just because a fund company used the facility doesn't necessarily mean it needed a lifeline. Some companies tapped the program to ensure they had enough cash on hand to meet redemptions if they occurred.

The program was created after the Reserve Primary Fund failed in September 2008.

The funds returned to normal functioning quickly after the program was introduced. The program grew in size, but then wound down on schedule and is no longer in existence, and the government suffered no losses in administrating the program."

"Fidelity carefully reviewed the Federal Reserves liquidity facility and determined it was in the best interest of our money-market fund shareholders to participate in the program. We have been proactive in keeping our money-market funds safe and in protecting the $1 net asset value, which has always been our No. 1 objective in managing these funds," a Fidelity representative said.

The program was created after the Reserve Primary Fund failed in September 2008. The program helped money-market funds meet redemptions by extending credit to banks and bank-holding companies to buy asset-backed commercial paper from the funds.

The SEC recently issued rules eliminating the riskiest assets from money-market funds and requiring them to keep at least 30% of their assets in securities maturing in seven days or less. It also required them to disclose their holdings on a monthly basis.

"The new SEC requirements will go a long way toward having more liquidity," said Karrie McMillan, general counsel at the Investment Company Institute, a fund-industry trade group. "If there were to be a lot of redemptions, the liquidity would help."

G-20 officials face an unenviable task

The heat is on. As G-20 finance ministers and central bankers gather in South Korea this week ahead of November's full-blown summit, Bank of England governor Mervyn King says the world needs a "grand bargain" to avoid sliding toward protectionism. No one expects any swift results in Seoul, but policy makers need to focus on four key areas.

The biggest issue is exchange rates. This goes well beyond U.S. criticisms of China's yuan policy. Broadly, emerging-market currencies are undervalued by an average of 31% based on the IMF's purchasing-power parity measure, J.P. Morgan points out. There also are tensions between trading competitors such as Japan and Korea, which has intervened to hold down the won even after a 40% fall against the dollar. A multilateral approach to currency overhaul is needed. But how is this to be achieved without triggering destabilizing capital inflows?

Second, emerging countries need to do more to generate domestic demand, allowing developed countries to expand exports, crucial to reducing trade imbalances. Higher exchange rates are clearly part of the solution, but Western policy makers also would like to see emerging countries take steps to change their savings cultures, including the construction of social safety nets in Asia to reduce the desire to save. Emerging countries also would need to increase access for foreign goods and services to their domestic markets.

Third, the world needs to reduce its reliance on the dollar. Official flows into Treasury debt remain high, meaning there is no pressure on the U.S. to reduce its fiscal deficit, a potential future source of imbalance. But this is fraught with difficulty, and not only for the U.S. Emerging countries have a vested interest in maintaining the vast dollar reserves that have been an essential bulwark of their credit-worthiness during the crisis.

Finally, some policy makers would like to see new global rules targeting current-account surpluses and deficits as a way of reducing imbalances. But as the euro-zone crisis has shown, unless such mechanisms have teeth, they may prove of little use. How does one define what level of deficit or surplus is distortional? And how does one force countries to change policy when they are enjoying the short-term benefits of faster growth?

There are no easy answers to any of these questions. Worse, the spirit that motivated the G-20 to respond as one in the face of the downturn in 2008-09 already may have passed; that was a case where domestic and international interests aligned. Diverging national interests now make an agreement far harder to achieve. But without progress, Mr. King is surely right in warning that protectionism will follow. The stakes couldn't be higher.

A capital challenge for Credit Suisse

Is this the shape of things to come? Credit Suisse Group's third quarter wasn't quite as bleak as the headline 62% drop in earnings from the previous quarter suggests, nor was it unexpected. But the decline in underlying returns on equity to 11% in the quarter and 15% year to date is something investors may have to get used to as Credit Suisse, like other major investment banks, grapples with tough new capital rules.

Stripping out losses on the value of its own debt, underlying net income of one billion Swiss francs ($1.04 billion) for the quarter was more or less as expected. The main disappointment was a 35% decline in equities revenue, although in volume terms, Credit Suisse continued to improve its market share. With market activity back to normal levels since September, fixed-income revenue holding up well and a bigger advisory pipeline now than at the start of the year, the investment bank's weak third quarter is likely a blip.

Meanwhile, there was good news elsewhere in the bank. The private banking division's 12.4 billion francs of net new money inflows takes the total for the first nine months above that for the whole of 2009. Encouragingly, margins on new onshore accounts aren't far off those on the traditional offshore Swiss private banking accounts -- and should improve further as customer trading activity recovers. The asset-management division also posted an unexpected 135 million franc profit.

But improving returns at a time of rising capital requirements will be a challenge. Credit Suisse is confident it can easily meet new capital rules. Even assuming a stress scenario in which net income is half current market forecasts, the bank expects its core Tier 1 ratio in 2013 under Basel III to be above 10%, the proposed new Swiss regulatory minimum. It also believes Contingent Convertibles will prove a cost-effective way to meet Swiss requirements for a further loss-absorbing buffer.

Even so, a longer-term return to 25%-plus returns on equity looks unlikely. Despite Credit Suisse's strong market positions, giving it vital economies of scale, Barclays Capital reckons longer-term returns in the midteens are more likely. Even with the shares now trading at 1.7 times tangible book value, that doesn't offer obvious upside.

Optimism

about Nokia?

It's a tough call

The honeymoon for Nokia's new chief executive, Stephen Elop, could be brief. The Finnish mobile group's shares rose 6.3% Thursday after it swung to a 321 million euro ($448 million) pretax profit, almost a third higher than market expectations. Five weeks into the job, Mr. Elop has taken steps to cut costs and shake up product development. But Nokia's market share continues to decline, highlighting continuing problems in smartphones.

The main cause for optimism in Nokia's third-quarter results was its higher average sales price per mobile phone, halting successive quarters of declines. That helped revenue increase 5%. But that was partly because of weak sales of cheap phones in places like Africa and Asia. Nokia's Achilles' heel is its sales of smartphones, whose share of global cellphone sales is rising fast. The 61% volume growth Nokia registered in smartphones was behind global smartphone volume growth of 78%, according to Strategy Analytics.

Mr. Elop's plans to simplify Nokia's product development, so new applications can work equally well on phones running old or new operating systems, is encouraging. Smartphone development needs a shake-up: Nokia's latest N8 device struggles to compete with other high-end models. His moves to cut costs and rationalize excessive research-and-development spending were overdue. Even the planned loss of as many as 1,800 jobs might not be sufficient.

Next year could be tougher for Nokia. The handset market should expand 5% in 2011, versus 13% volume growth in 2010, according to Sanford C. Bernstein. Meanwhile, Nokia expects its volume share in mobile handsets to fall this year, reversing earlier guidance of maintaining its position. Given poor visibility on future earnings, a forward multiple of some 14 times for shares looks high. Mr. Elop's trials are just beginning.

Overheard: Moves in Myanmar

War for talent?

Even bankers in Myanmar's highly dysfunctional banking system are taking advantage of new job offers.

Earlier this year, the military regime doled out private-banking licenses to four well-connected tycoons.

That was the first time new banks had been allowed to form in years.

Naturally, these new banks started hiring staff from the old banks, with sweeter compensation packages.

Forty people left one bank en masse for one of the new ventures, according to a Yangon banker. A dozen left another bank.

Should Wall Streeters start heading for Myanmar? That probably isn't a good idea, as the new banks' owners are targeted personally by strict sanctions from the U.S.

A Decade of Innovation (A Special Report) --- Money From Nothing: Hatching a good idea for a business is the easy bit; Negotiating the legal and funding maze to bring it to life is the real challenge

By Nick Clayton

Governments and businesses are grappling with the problem of creating fertile breeding grounds for good ideas and inventions, while ensuring that investment and resources are adequately channelled to foster growth. The budding entrepreneur of today has to negotiate a series of hurdles before he or she can convert a good idea into a profitable business. External financing is increasingly hard to come by and the legal complications that inevitably surround intellectual property and patents can kill off a good idea before it has even had a chance to hatch. However, the sheer number of new start-ups is proof if it were needed that where there is an innovative will, there is an innovative way.

Patent legislation, in particular, has not had a good press of late. In the hands of what is often depicted as an unholy alliance of powerful corporations and shyster lawyers it's frequently perceived not as a means to reward innovation, but to stifle it. However, the world cannot live without it and many are calling for its reform in the light of perceived abuses.

Large companies are accused of amassing sheaves of patents to be used as bargaining counters in legal battles with competitors. Equally unpopular are the 'patent trolls', companies that buy and accumulate intellectual property solely in order to collect license fees.

At the same time the patenting process is seen by some as too slow to keep up with the speed of technological development. Indeed, there are those within the open software movement who at their most extreme believe that intellectual property is theft.

Examples of every element of the patent maze can be found within the smartphone arena, an area which probably represents the greatest current focus of technological innovation. On one level, the biggest international players including Apple, Nokia, Motorola, BlackBerry maker Research in Motion and Taiwan's HTC are involved in a complex legal merry-go-round as they sue and counter-sue each other.

Underlying at least one of these legal battles is the suggestion that the action has been mounted to punish a company for using Google's Android operating system to run its smartphones. Android is open source, which means no license fee has to be paid for its use. However, at least some of the resulting competitive advantage may be lost if there are possible financial penalties hanging over the manufacturers who use it.

The expectation, however, is that these cases involving major manufacturers will be resolved through cross-licensing agreements and the creation of standards. But the stakes can be high for both companies and consumers. A patent infringement in 2006, for instance, almost led to the shutting down of the BlackBerry service on which so many businesses rely. The network survived, but only because RIM agreed to pay $612 million to patent holding company NTP to license its wireless email service.

Before this case few had heard of NTP, a business which exists almost entirely to exploit the patented inventions of the now-deceased inventor Thomas J Campana Jr. It is a holding company, often disparagingly describes as a 'patent troll', because it doesn't make use of the patents except to pursue possible infringers for license fees.

Although U.S. law is now seen to be less favorable to non-practicing entities than it was a few years ago, it didn't stop NTP filing another slew of lawsuits this July against Apple, Google, Microsoft, Motorola, HTC and LG Electronics. And NTP is certainly far from alone in using patent legislation to make money without actually practicing.

At the beginning of September, The Wall Street Journal highlighted the growing number of lawsuits being launched against companies for the erroneous use of patent numbers. Often these had expired but were left on, for example, molded cases where it was expensive to replace the dies or simply nobody in the company had thought to check the validity of now expired numbers.

Until late last year an offender would only have been liable for a fine of $500. Then in December a court ruled that it should be $500 per offence. It has sent shivers down the spines of even large companies.

Unsurprisingly, against this background, some companies have decided to forgo patenting altogether. Edward Charvet is co-founder of Trovus, a relatively new company that turns data on visitors to business-to-business websites into market intelligence using a combination of process and software.

"When we first started we spoke to a lawyer and started to look at which parts of our business could be patented," he says. "It soon became clear it was going to take a vast amount of time and effort, which would be a huge distraction. It would also mean publishing information about the way we work, which could be used by competitors because in our line of business there's always a variety of ways to solve a problem."

It's a common difficulty according to Quentin Tannock, chairman of Cambridge IP, which specializes in providing intellectual property services to technology companies. He says: "Many innovative small and medium sized companies struggle to balance the costs and risks associated with applying for and holding patents against the business benefits of holding registered intellectual property. The difficulties appear more acute in some technology sectors than in others.

"Technology maturity and readiness levels, technology development costs and technology development cycles differ markedly between and even within technology sectors. Yet current intellectual property policy and regulation tends to be of the one-size-fits-all variety. My view is that governments need to develop 'smart' intellectual property policies and regulations that take into account technology sector diversity."

Alexander Carter-Silk, partner and head of intellectual property, technology and commercial at City of London law firm Speechly Bircham, also recognizes that patent and copyright law doesn't always keep up with changes in business models. "The increase in regulation around patents and copyrights adds a layer of complexity to the issue. Conflict between intellectual property rights and competition law, as well as inconsistent competition rules, can create an impression that the law in this area is becoming irrelevant. It's not perfect, often gives advantages where none were intended and does not provide protection where it is deserved. Continual changes to the law create uncertainty. However, evolution of the laws is essential to protect businesses." An additional problem is the sheer volume of intellectual property being created, according to Alan Wiltshire, contracts director for Cambridge Consultants. "There are so many inventions out there now that one problem for any inventor is it's virtually impossible to guarantee a freedom to operate," he says. "The wealth of world intellectual property is so voluminous and so complex that you can do a search yourself or you can go to an intellectual property professional, but the chances are that they or you may well miss something."

Mr. Wiltshire believes, however, that the patenting process itself has done nothing to stifle innovation. But others point out that patents are not the only form of intellectual property. For instance, entertainment and digital media lawyer Clive Rich sees a mismatch between some types of intellectual property protection and the nature of the digital revolution.

"Intellectual property law exists to prevent unauthorized copying," he says. "The essence of digital technology is that it permits perfect copying at the touch of a button." He suggests it may be time to re-evaluate the law for these types of soft intellectual property to reward owners for the usage of their works rather than giving them the hard-to-enforce right to prevent copying. He says: "Turning intellectual property into a modern usage right rather than an old fashioned copying right would still reward inventors and creators without preventing the kind of copying that digital technology exists to facilitate. It would ensure that the cost and expense of obtaining intellectual property protection was not wasted, but it would be a way of recognizing that the genie cannot be put back into the bottle; copying is here to stay."

Despite the imperfections of intellectual property law, nobody seems to be recommending its abolition. Indeed the demand for intellectual property protection is a key indicator of economic health.

Patents are just one part of the complex maze that new businesses need to negotiate before they can truly establish themselves. Finding the money to fund growth is perhaps even more critical, and seemingly less available now than ever before.

As more phoenixes emerge from the flames of the global economic downturn, so the hunt for financing is becoming increasingly competitive. Growing companies complain that it's virtually impossible to raise vital capital through borrowing or investment. At the same time reduced spending in every sector makes self-funded growth extremely difficult. Yet new businesses keep appearing.

"The really profound change in recent years is the cost of starting, particularly web based, companies has dropped and dropped," says Doug Richard, the Californian-born entrepreneur, former member of television's Dragon's Den and founder of the School for Start-Ups.

Where he sees the problem is not so much at the inception stage of a new business, but at the next level where a company is looking for venture capital. And he says the difficulty is particularly acute in Europe. "What's missing is not the amount of money, it's that there aren't enough venture capitalists," he says.

It is this lack of competition for deals that he believes makes it difficult for businesses. He thinks the main reason for the shortage is that venture capital funds in Europe are rather newer than they are in the U.S. They only really got started on this side of the Atlantic in the 1990s before being hit hard by the dotcom bust of 2000 and then, just as they were beginning to pick up again, they got caught in the fallout from the credit crunch.

"U.S. funds have a momentum that keeps them going even now," Mr. Richard says. "And that hasn't had time to develop in Europe."

His perception in many ways fits the views of Peter Cochrane, the former chief technology officer for BT, who has, for the last decade, acted as an advisor and angel investor in a large number of start-ups. His conclusions, however, are rather different.

"I don't believe we have venture capitalists any more," he says. "They're increasingly 'vulture capitalists'. One of the first questions they ask a start-up company is how much profit they're making. They do not want to take any risks. They do not want to invest in anything that isn't already up and running," says Mr. Cochrane. He believes this is stifling innovative new companies.

"Actually going out there and getting money is extremely difficult. Despite what the government will tell you, it's more difficult to get money for new ventures than ever before. Also getting a new venture to go seems to be increasingly risky. What used to take us three or four years from a standing start to an initial public offering is now taking seven to 10 years. It really is a hell of a shakeout."

He now advises start-ups to support their ideas as far as possible with their own time and money. If they need capital, he says, they should try to find high-net-worth individuals, including business angels, to get their product to the point where it's starting to make money.

"My most recent start-up has been booted up with all of us working for nothing and putting up minimal amounts of money for things like hardware. The primary development is being done by another start-up company that is making money. They have worked for shares in this new one," he says.

This is a familiar path both in times of investment feast and famine. But there still comes a point at which investment is necessary and there are still new companies attracting cash.

One such is Brightpearl, which provides an integrated online suite of business services including accounting, customer relationship management, stock control and web management within a single system. The company was started by Chris Tanner who was already a successful entrepreneur with a skateboard firm that he'd begun as a student.

It was while running this specialist retailer that he became frustrated with the fragmented nature of business process software. Initially he used his own programming skills to enable the various elements to work together. Eventually it became more important to him than the skateboard business, which he then sold so he could concentrate on Brightpearl.

"We managed to build a strong product and customer base despite the tough economic climate," says Mr. Tanner. "We realized that if we wanted to scale the business significantly and quickly capitalise on our opportunity in what was becoming a busier market space, we needed to secure investment. We were experiencing challenges with our cashflow, as is often the case with many young businesses, and we needed additional expertise on our fast growth strategy for Europe and globally."

In June, Brightpearl secured $1.5 million in funding from Notion Capital and Eden Ventures. This was just one of six investments made so far this year by Eden Ventures, which is creating something of a name for itself working with "super angels" in relatively early stage, frequently pre-revenue, companies.

Eden Ventures partner Ben Tompkins doesn't think the problem for start-ups is at the seed stage where his fund is investing. "There is a shortage of mid-tier funds with GBP 2 million to GBP 5 million ($3 million to $8 million) to put into C and D rounds," he says. "And that is a little worrying."

One important source for early-stage funding in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in the UK are the technology entrepreneurs who have successfully created then exited from companies and become business angels. They have cash to invest and the expertise to recognize opportunities.

Not every country has such a group to call on, says Serguei Beloussov, founder and chairman of virtualization software company Parallels and computer security specialist Acronis. He says that the concentration of business angels in the U.S. tends to be self-perpetuating because it is the country with the largest number of successful technology entrepreneurs and, even if they come from another country, they tend to continue to live and invest in the U.S.

Even before turning to angels, he says, Russian technology start-ups have problems that arise from capitalism being such a recent arrival in the country. In more mature capitalist economies funding a business internally and using informal investment is a common option. "It's not easy to find money in the friends and family circle because money is relatively new," he says. It's no easier to attract investment from outside. "A lot of global venture capital funds are run by finance people, not entrepreneurs," he says. "For finance people it's relatively difficult to invest at an early stage. When there's only expenditure, there's no revenue so it's hard to figure out a valuation."

Of course, these challenges also create opportunities. In August, Mr. Beloussov launched Runa Capital to offer $30 million in seed financing to start-ups in rapid growth technology sectors, including cloud computing, machine learning, virtualization, mobile and internet applications.

Intel Capital, with a huge portfolio of investments offers another form of expertise. As part of the world's largest microprocessor business most of its investments will have somebody in the relevant business unit overseeing it even when the company has come in at pre-revenue stage. "What we're looking for are companies that will have some sort of game-changing business model in their vertical segment," says Marcos Battisti, Western Europe and Israel managing director for Intel Capital. "If we think they could have some chance of success we might invest.

"We have multiple examples, such as Mirics, which we came into two or three years ago. What they have is a solution for broadcast television on PCs using software which is unique. We looked at this and thought maybe it won't work but if it does work this will be big. It's proved to be right because they're winning account on top of account."

Intel, says Mr. Battisti, is "stage agnostic" and has investments at all stages of maturity. "I think a lot of the venture capitalists have retrenched into late-stage-only investments and that's worrying. Early stage investment is very different from late stage. Angel syndicates do add value, but they can't replace institutional venture capital investors."

His seems to be the common view. Partly perhaps because the cost of starting a technology business can be so low, there is sufficient money for many start-ups. The bottleneck is at a company's next stage of development when substantial investment is required but success is far from assured.

Banks Face Fight Over Mortgage-Loan Buybacks; Fannie and Freddie Work to Push Bad Loans to Originators; a Search for Applicants' Lies

While mortgage delinquencies are easing, banks are facing a new round of losses from loans made just before the financial crisis, and the fight to keep them off their balance sheets is intensifying.

Leading the charge to make originators repurchase their loans are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two government-owned finance agencies that guaranteed the mortgages. The firms are sorting through delinquent loans for signs of any violations of the representations and warranties, known as "reps and warranties." In essence, they are looking for lies made by borrowers or lenders in loan applications.

Freddie last week said it would begin taking tougher action against banks that drag their feet on buybacks as it renegotiates its contracts to renew loan-sales agreements from those banks. Freddie said it had received $2.7 billion from lenders on repurchases during the first half of the year, up from $1.7 billion in the year-earlier period. The number of repurchase requests that haven't yet been satisfied jumped to $5.6 billion at the end of June, up from $3.8 billion six months earlier.

While the company isn't likely to cut off its partners, it could use those renegotiations to force banks to settle up on repurchases.

Banks are pushing back. "It's a loan-by-loan fight," Bank of America Corp . Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told investors in March. "This will be a war that will go on for a while." On Aug. 6, Bank of America said it faces $11.1 billion in unresolved repurchase demands, up 46% in just six months.

The bounced loans are mounting fast as investors try to deflect losses back to their sources and put an end to the lingering aftereffects of the financial meltdown. When banks receive repurchase requests, they often try to force other banks that originated the loans to repurchase them.

Given the hundreds of billions in nonperforming mortgages at stake, "these battles could just go on for years," says Christopher Whalen, managing director for Institutional Risk Analytics. "We have at least two more years of misery."

Big banks may be getting close to facing the worst of their repurchase losses, since original buyers are currently scouring the worst years of underwriting, notably 2006 and 2007, says Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets .

"As the industry works these loans off," he said, "they're not being replaced with loans underwritten as badly."

The banks are marshaling lawyers and auditors to challenge loan put-backs and issue repurchase requests of their own.

They are also resolving disputes with mortgage insurers, which could help limit repurchase exposure. Mortgage insurers can rescind insurance coverage on loans, which typically prompts Fannie and Freddie to kick back loans. But some banks have begun paying insurers lump sums to avoid dealing with rescissions and triggering repurchase requests. Fannie warned it could face higher losses if insurers aren't rescinding loans, because that might yield fewer buyback opportunities for Fannie.

Banks also are complaining that Fannie and Freddie are kicking back loans that performed for two to three years if they can provide any pretext, such as undisclosed debt, faulty appraisals or bogus income, employment data or credit ratings.

A representative for Bank of America said the bank has "an established history of working with the [government-sponsored enterprises] on repurchase requests and has generally established a mutual understanding of what represents a valid defect."

A representative for Wells Fargo & Co . said the bank "continues to have an open and productive relationship with the agencies, including Freddie Mac , as we work together to mutually resolve repurchase requests as quickly as possible." A spokesman for Citigroup Inc . said, "We believe we are appropriately positioned for repurchases with our current $727 million of reserves for that purpose." J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . declined to comment beyond the company's regulatory filing.

Efforts to claw back loan losses took a more aggressive turn last month, when the agency that regulates Fannie and Freddie, the Federal Housing Finance Agency , threw its weight behind a wider effort to collect repayment on defective loans within the so-called private-label securities issued during the bubble without agency backing by Wall Street firms.

The FHFA sent out subpoenas to 64 issuers of mortgage-backed securities and other parties to probe for potential loan repurchases.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York hinted earlier in August that it, too, could make some repurchase claims after reviewing investments it inherited through its 2008 rescues of Bear Stearns Cos . and American International Group Inc .

So far, repurchase demands have hit hardest at banks that acquired the bubble's leading subprime-mortgage lenders as they tottered and fell. For example, analyst Chris Gamaitoni of Compass Point Research & Trading LLC predicts the biggest agency-related pretax loss of as much as $21.8 billion at Bank of America , which acquired Countrywide Financial Corp . in 2008. He projects pretax losses of as much $6.9 billion at Wells Fargo , $6.6 billion at J.P. Morgan and $4 billion at Citigroup .

Still, the rising level of repurchase activity hasn't cooled all analysts' enthusiasm. Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley , in a note published after BOFA's most recent repurchase announcement, says her estimates for its earnings already include $17 billion of "reps and warranty expenses" through 2014.

While large banks should weather the storm, their efforts to push repurchases down the chain could squeeze smaller, nonbank mortgage lenders, which don't have deposits or other ready sources of cash.

"It's become an epidemic," says David Lykken, a partner at Mortgage Banking Solutions, an Austin, Texas, consulting firm. "The choices are to negotiate, stand up and fight or go out of business."

Adobe to Launch $240 Million Tender Offer for Day Software to Launch $240 Million Tender Offer for

SAN FRANCISCO Adobe Systems Inc. said Wednesday it has signed a definitive agreement to launch a public tender offer to acquire all of Day Software Holding AG's shares for about $240 million, a move that highlights the expansion of its portfolio of Web content-management offerings.

Adobe will acquire the shares at 139 Swiss francs (approximately US$131.44) each in cash, said Rob Tarkoff, who runs Adobe's Digital Enterprise Solutions group, in an interview from Day Software's headquarters in Basel, Switzerland. The deal is subject to a minimum acceptance threshold and is expected to close sometime in Adobe's fiscal fourth quarter, which ends on Nov. 30.

San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe said the deal is unlikely to have a material impact on its earnings for its fiscal 2010, but expects Day Software to add to earnings in the following fiscal year.

The acquisition is part of Adobe's continuing strategy to become a comprehensive provider of software for creating and managing creative content online, an expansion of its traditional niche as a maker of tools for graphic artists. Last year, for example, Adobe bought Omniture, a Web analytics company that helps companies monitor customer activity online.

Day Software's products help companies manage the unstructured content including files containing animation, video, photos or text that are used to power company websites.

The software also helps with social media by managing content gathered from external sources, such as customer reviews or blog postings. For example, companies can use the software to trigger a business response to content gathered from Twitter or Facebook.

Day Software counts General Motors Co., McDonald's Corp. and Intercontinental Hotels Group as its clients. Within the last quarter, Day Software signed a host of new clients, including BMW AG and Hyatt Hotels Corp., said Day Software Chief Executive Erik Hansen in the interview. The company, which has seen licensing revenue grow at least 70% in each of the past four quarters, has doubled its sales and marketing presence in the U.S. over the past nine months, Hansen added.

On Wednesday, Hansen's firm announced that revenue in the first half of the year increased 47% over the same period last year to 25.1 million Swiss Francs.

In a research note, Morgan Stanley analysts said the acquisition will further strengthen the value of Adobe's flagship CS5 suite for customers. "We think the Day acquisition makes strategic sense, while the small size of the target minimizes integration risk," the note said. "This acquisition will strengthen [Adobe's] growth story and the potential for upside to estimates."

Most recently, Adobe has been involved in a public feud with Apple Inc. over its Flash technology, which is widely used to power video on the Internet. The clash was highlighted in April when Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs posted a long explanation of his company's decision not to use Flash on its popular iPhone and iPad products.

Concerning Flash, Tarkoff said Day Software, which has been an Adobe partner for about a year, is capable of managing digital assets in any format.

In mid-afternoon trading, Adobe shares are down 1.5% at $28.79.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The New Basics: Oops: 'Socially Responsible' Funds Hold Big Stakes of BP

By Eleanor Laise

The oil that spewed into the Gulf of Mexico has stained some "socially responsible" mutual funds.

These portfolios aim to invest based on environmental, human rights, corporate governance and other criteria. Yet a number of major socially responsible funds and indexes included BP PLC on April 20, when the spill turned the energy giant into a pariah among environmentalist-types.

The BP case shows just how different socially responsible portfolios can be. While BP had clear safety issues that alienated some of these funds even before the Gulf spill, others favored the company because of its stance on climate change and alternative energy.

The upshot on socially responsible investing: "Investors need to do more legwork than they might have originally thought when choosing an SRI fund," says Kathryn Young, mutual fund analyst at investment-research firm Morningstar Inc.

Though still a small corner of the mutual-fund industry, socially responsible funds have attracted steady investor interest in recent years. Shareholders added about $1.4 billion to these funds in the first six months of this year, bringing total assets to more than $50 billion, according to Morningstar.

While the term socially responsible implies major investing restrictions, funds employ a wide range of strategies both to pick stocks and to decide when to sell. Domini Social Investments, which runs Domini Social Equity and other funds, has avoided BP completely. Pax World Funds had flagged BP over safety concerns last year but still held the stock on April 20; it sold a few days later. MMA Praxis Mutual Funds held BP in its International Fund as of June 30, and in a review last month decided not to exclude the stock from its investment universe. (It isn't clear how many socially responsible funds held BP as of April 20, since mutual funds are required to disclose holdings only on a quarterly basis.)

In the past, many funds followed a fairly simple methodology, screening out companies focused on areas like alcohol, tobacco or weapons. But in recent years, partly to achieve better diversification, some have taken a more nuanced approach. Instead of ruling out entire industries, they may select companies in each sector that have demonstrated some commitment to social principles. Many are even trying to distance themselves from the "SRI" moniker, which some associate with the negative screening approach, in favor of terms like "sustainable" and "environmental, social and governance," or ESG, investing.

Pax World, for example, a few years ago dropped strict screens that had ruled out gambling and alcohol-related stocks. Now, "we take a best-in-class approach," rather than focusing on what not to invest in, says Joe Keefe, Pax World president and chief executive. One of the benefits of that approach, he says, is that "you can get broad diversification and exposure to all industries."

Similarly, Calvert Asset Management Co. in late 2008 launched a new category of funds that use limited screening but focus more on engaging with company management to push for changes. And that is how it wound up holding BP. While the oil giant didn't pass the screens employed by Calvert's traditional socially responsible funds, it was held in the engagement-focused Calvert Large Cap Value Fund. That fund liquidated its BP holdings in late June, says Bennett Freeman, senior vice president for sustainability research and policy. "Engagement often takes a long time to demonstrate tangible results," Mr. Freeman says.

Why soften the investing parameters? To track the broader market more closely. In the 10 years ending June 30, the average socially responsible fund gained an average of 0.1% annually, versus a 1.59% annualized loss for the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index. In the first six months of this year, socially responsible funds fell 6.2%, versus a 6.7% decline for the S&P 500.

But the BP incident highlights big differences in how socially responsible funds prioritize various causes. Some of these managers considered BP's stance on climate change a strong positive. "BP was the first to break the logjam on climate change policy" and had been a leader on alternative energy, says Mark Regier, director of stewardship investing for MMA Praxis.

Other managers focused on safety and already were backing away from the stock before the spill. Pax World, which put BP on a watch list in October 2009 due to safety concerns, launched a full review of the company earlier this year. BP failed, though Pax World still held the stock at the time of the spill. Even so, "our process was working," Pax World's Mr. Keefe says.

Even broad socially responsible indexes disagree on how to handle BP. The stock was removed from two KLD Research &Analytics indexes, now owned by MSCI, in 2007 and 2008. The Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes dropped BP after the spill, on May 31. Yet another index lineup, FTSE4Good, still includes BP. Index components are reviewed on a semiannual basis, and the next review will be in September, says Jill Mathers, a spokeswoman for FTSE Group.

Investors with deeply held convictions about a particular social or environmental issue would be wise to delve deeply into a fund's holdings before taking the plunge. Says Adam Kanzer, managing director and general counsel at Domini: "No two are exactly alike."

Letting machines make the picks --- New wave of investment firms embrace ' artificial intelligence ' for trading decisions; 'no human could do this'

Wall Street is notorious for not learning from its mistakes. Maybe machines can do better.

That is the hope of an increasing number of investors who are turning to the science of artificial intelligence to make investment decisions.

With artificial intelligence, programmers don't just set up computers to make decisions in response to certain inputs. They enable the systems to learn from decisions, and adapt. Most investors trying the approach are using "machine learning," a branch of artificial intelligence in which a computer program analyzes huge chunks of data and makes predictions about the future. It is used by tech companies such as Google Inc. to match Web searches with results and NetFlix Inc. to predict which movies users are likely to rent.

One upstart in the AI race on Wall Street is Rebellion Research, a tiny New York hedge fund with about $7 million in capital that has been using a machine-learning program it developed to invest in stocks. Run by a small team of twentysomething math and computer whizzes, Rebellion has a solid track record, topping the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index by an average of 10% a year, after fees, since its 2007 launch through June, according to people familiar with the fund. Like many hedge funds, its goal is to beat the broader market year after year.

"It's pretty clear that human beings aren't improving," said Spencer Greenberg, 27 years old and the brains behind Rebellion's AI system. "But computers and algorithms are only getting faster and more robust."

Some sophisticated hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies LLC, based in East Setauket, N.Y., are said to have deployed AI to invest. But for years, these firms were the exception. Some firms that have dabbled in AI are skeptical it is anywhere close to working.

Rebellion is part of a new wave of firms using machine learning to trade. Cerebellum Capital, a San Francisco hedge fund with $10 million in assets, started using machine learning to invest in 2009. A number of high-frequency trading firms, such as RGM Advisors LLC in Austin, Texas, and Getco LLC in Chicago, are using machine learning to help their computer systems trade in and out of stocks efficiently, according to people familiar with the firms.

The programs are effective, advocates say, because they can crunch huge amounts of data in short periods, "learn" what works, and adjust their strategies on the fly. In contrast, the typical quantitative approach may employ a single strategy or even a combination of strategies at once, but may not move between them or modify them based on what the program determines works best.

"No human could do this," said Michael Kearns, a computer-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has used AI to invest at firms such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. "Your head would blow off."

Rebellion has struggled to raise money, in part because investors since the credit crisis are dubious of opaque math-based strategies.

The firm has attracted at least one long-time "quant" skeptic: famed value investor Jean-Marie Eveillard, who recently invested several hundred thousand dollars of his own money into Rebellion. "My cup of tea is not quantitative investing," he said. "But I think they are serious investors, and I'm impressed by the fact that they don't have a high turnover. . .and don't use leverage."

Rebellion's Mr. Greenberg is no stranger to the investing world. His father, Glenn Greenberg, is an iconoclastic value investor and manager of Brave Warrior Advisors, who recently split from his partners at Chieftain Capital Management Inc. His grandfather, legendary baseball slugger "Hammerin' Hank" Greenberg, played for the Detroit Tigers in the 1930s and '40s.

Past success doesn't mean Rebellion will continue to beat the market. As with many quant strategies, its system could stop working if market fundamentals change in ways that trip up its computer program, known as "Star."

What makes Star intelligent, says Mr. Greenberg, is its ability to adjust its strategy based on shifting dynamics in the market and broader economy. The program isn't wed to any single investing approach. Under certain conditions, the fund will buy cheap stocks, in others it will favor stocks with swiftly rising prices -- or both at the same time.

Unlike the high-frequency funds that use artificial intelligence to aid rapid trading, Rebellion tends to hold stocks for long periods -- on average four months but in some instances more than two years. It also doesn't short stocks or use leverage, or borrowed money, which can amplify returns but also boost risks.

The program monitors about 30 factors that can affect a stock's performance, such as price-to-earnings ratios or interest rates.

The program regularly crunches more than a decade of historical market data and the latest market action to size up whether to buy or sell a stock. When certain strategies stop working, the program automatically incorporates that information, "learns," and adjusts the portfolio.

For instance, it may detect data indicating stocks with low price-to-earning ratios are likely to rise and load up on those stocks.

Then, if the program later finds that the strategy is likely to lose steam, based on shifts in the factors it tracks, it will dump those stocks and buy stocks it deems more favorable.

Every morning, Star recommends a list of stocks to buy or sell -- often it offers no changes at all. A human trader implements the moves. The firm says it never overrules the computer program, which is largely the same system they started with in 2007, with a few nips and tucks. Rebellion typically holds about 60 to 70 stocks at any time.

Mr. Greenberg started designing Star in mid-2005, soon after he graduated from Columbia University with an engineering degree. He was joined by Alexander Fleiss, a high-school friend with a background in finance and math, as well as Jonathan Sturges, who has a master's degree in music composition, and Jeremy Newton, a mathematician who helped design the AI program.

In January 2007, with $2 million in capital, the program started picking stocks. That spring, it started moving into defensive positions such as utilities. Rebellion gained 17% in 2007, compared with the 6.4% gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to people familiar with the fund.

It stayed defensive throughout most of 2008, holding gold, oil and utility stocks. Still, it lost money like most investors, sliding 26% but topping the 34% decline by the Dow industrials.

In early 2009, Star started to buy beaten-down stocks such as banks and insurers, which would benefit from a recovery. "He just loaded up on value stocks," said Mr. Fleiss, referring to the AI program. The fund gained 41% in 2009, more than doubling the Dow's 19% gain.

The firm's current portfolio is largely defensive. One of its biggest positions is in gold stocks, according to people familiar with the fund.

The defensive move at first worried Mr. Fleiss, who had grown bullish. But it has proven a smart move so far. "I've learned not to question the AI," he said.

HP propels Palm into mobile big league

Palm, which helped define the market for pocket computing first with its Palm Pilot PDAs and then with its Treo smartphones, has lost its battle to survive as an independent company.

But in the market for mobile computing gadgets of all shapes and sizes, the result is likely to increase, rather than reduce, competition. Hewlett-Packard, long only a bit player, has stepped up to claim a share of one of the world s fastest growing tech businesses.

Founded in 1992 by Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, Palm never fully recovered from a decision by former owner 3Com to split its operating system and hardware businesses into separate companies. Buy-out firm Elevation Partners recently championed an effort to rebuild it around a new smartphone operating system, called Web OS. But while that brought the company back to the cutting edge of mobile technology, it failed to generate the handset sales needed.

HP, which agreed to purchase Palm on Wednesday in a deal it valued at $1.2bn, says it plans to put Web OS at the centre of its own mobile device plans, challenging Apple and Microsoft.

HP will ramp up spending on research and development and marketing for Palm products to achieve the level of sales that the company could not do on its own, promised Todd Bradley, head of HP s personal systems group and a former Palm chief executive.

HP also believes it can succeed where Palm failed most visibly: in persuading some of the world s top telecoms companies to sell its devices. With its scale and reach, HP is better placed to win over industry giants, its executives said.

Mr Bradley also hinted that HP would use Web OS to support other devices, including tablet computers. Touch-screen devices such as these, of all sizes, look set to become a big and important category for both consumers and business customers, Mr Bradley said. That makes it an important new market for HP, the world s biggest maker of personal computers, which has so far failed to latch on to the newest trends in personal computing devices.

The deal is an admission of defeat for Palm s senior management.

According to Strategy Analytics, a market research firm, Palm s share of the US smartphone market fell to 4.2 per cent in 2009 from 6.5 per cent in 2008, well behind RIM, whose BlackBerry holds 47.8 per cent of the market and Apple, whose iPhone accounted for about a quarter of US smartphone sales.

US regulator revamps enforcement role

The self-examination by the US Securities and Exchange Commission triggered by its failure to detect Bernard Madoff s fraudulent operation has resulted in a total revamp of the 75-year-old enforcement unit, the agency s public face.

Now, a slew of activity is emerging, not least the complaint launched this month against Goldman Sachs. And insiders say this is only the beginning.

Under Robert Khuzami, a former federal prosecutor who last month completed his maiden year as head of enforcement, the SEC is aggressively working to regain investors  trust. The pace of actions has risen, with 496 orders for formal investigations initiated during 2009, versus 233 a year earlier, while the tally of emergency temporary restraining orders rose by 82 per cent to 71.

Mr Khuzami has also restructured his unit into five specialised areas   asset management, foreign corrupt practices, market abuse and municipal securities/public pensions.

Fund management activities mainly fall within the ambit of Bruce Karpati and Robert Kaplan s asset management unit.  We ll bring complicated cases as efficiently as possible,  says Mr Kaplan.  Our goal is not only to bring cases based on complaints and referrals but also those that are driven by risk analytics where we proactively identify misconduct. 

In a change from the previous approach of hiring mostly attorneys or generalists, these units will also include industry insiders with hands-on knowledge of how things actually work. The SEC is also retraining its existing staffers on both market intelligence and investigative fronts.

The goal is to educate staff about the business processes and practices of asset managers, enabling them to easily identify and prosecute offenders, according to Walter Zebrowski, chairman of the Regulatory Compliance Association.

The agency has also created an office of market intelligence to collect, screen and process all incoming complaints and tips. It is applying technology and analytics to mine this information, and also trading activity, with the aim of spotting errant patterns before they blow up.

The thinking is this would prevent another Madoff from slipping through the cracks; since 1992, various SEC outposts looked at the New York financier at least six times, each time failing to connect the dots.

However, the centralised databank receives a daunting amount of information. In 2009 alone there were 700,000 tips on improper disclosures, fund-liquidation problems, and the like.

George Mazin, a partner at Dechert, says:  How it will identify what is real and worth following amid the large volume of information it receives is mind-boggling. 

Another initiative is to cut through red tape and flatten the top-heavy management structure. Notably, the division has given its senior managers the power to issue subpoenas, changing a complicated legacy system.

This will cut down its response time, helping line officials to potentially bring and move cases faster. And finally, it is making it more attractive for witnesses and whistleblowers to co-operate with it.

These initiatives seek to rectify the weaknesses exposed by Mr Madoff and similar cases.  Whatever the merits of the Goldman case, the SEC has put the industry on notice,  says John Brunjes, a partner at Bracewell & Giuliani.

 It s a warning shot across the bows intended to send a message to Wall Street and the hedge fund community to stay on the right course.  Still, its ultimate grading will come from its ability to get in front of situations before they explode. The fund industry has mostly welcomed these changes.  In theory, a smarter SEC is better. The changes suggest things will happen faster,  says Mr Mazin. But there is also a view that cases are likely to become more nuanced, time-consuming and costly to defend.

As for the impact a  renewed  SEC will have on the day-to-day working of asset managers, Meryl Wiener, a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman, says:  The sense in the industry is that these specialised units will bring added scrutiny, which will make managers more mindful of their compliance obligations.

 With respect to the heightened scrutiny of inside information, expect managers to be more cautious with the marching orders   explicit or otherwise   they give to their analysts and other staff.

World News: S&P warns of rising bad debts in China --- Indirect borrowing by local governments is core of the problem as lending doubles to $1.4 trillion

BEIJING -- A potential spike in bad debts as a result of a government-backed lending surge is likely to be the biggest challenge for China's banks in the next few years, but lenders should be able to keep the problem at a "manageable level," Standard &Poor's Ratings Services said Thursday.

The report is the latest analysis to raise the prospect of a significant rise in nonperforming loans. China's banks -- almost entirely state-controlled -- lent a net total of $1.4 trillion in 2009, about double the volume in 2008. Fitch Ratings warned throughout 2009 that the spike in new loans could result in declining asset quality at banks. In February, it lowered its ratings on two mid-sized Chinese lenders, in part because of their loan growth in 2009.

Much of the concern centers on indirect borrowing by local governments. Barred from borrowing directly from banks, cities, counties and provinces set up investment vehicles which the banks lent to instead. These loans helped finance a wave of public construction last year, keeping China's economy buoyant during the financial crisis.

But the finances of many local governments were already weak prior to the downturn. Analysts say the indirect borrowing raises the specter of rising bad debt if the governments can't find the cash to repay their loans. Central government regulators in recent months have tightened supervision of such indirect borrowing.

Estimates vary about of the amount of debt accumulated by local government investment vehicles. Victor Shih, a professor at Northwestern University who has researched the issue, estimates it could be as large as 11 trillion yuan, or about $1.6 trillion. Chinese media reports have cited an estimate of about six trillion yuan.

S&P said in its report that it expects the ratio of nonperforming and other "problem" loans in China's banking system to stay below 10% at least until 2012. China's banks had a total nonperforming-loan ratio of 1.58% at the end of 2009.

Ryan Tsang, China banking analyst with the ratings company, said that if bad debts rose that high, many of China's city and rural commercial banks might need to turn to the government for assistance. The big, publicly traded banks, however, should be able to weather high levels of bad debts without having their ratings downgraded because they have improved risk management in recent years, he said.

"The earnings of Chinese banks may deteriorate and capitalization levels could moderate over the next two to three years as a significant rise in credit losses stemming from new loans starts to emerge," said the S&P report, which Mr. Tsang co-authored. "But we don't expect the banks' financial metrics to weaken enough to change our ratings"

Mr. Tsang said there would be cause for concern if the problem loan ratio rises significantly above 10%. "Approaching 15%, we estimate there would be an urgent need for the government to step in and strengthen the financial system," he said.

The S&P report comes as China's major banks are scheduled next week to start releasing their annual financial reports for 2009.

Analysts broadly expect that Bank of China Ltd., the country's third-largest listed lender by assets, will say Wednesday that net profit rose more than 22% last year, according to data from Thomson One Analytics. It will be the first to report. Analysts expect China's two largest banks, Industrial &Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. will each post an increase in net profit of about 17%.

The strong figures are largely the result of lower default rates from borrowers who, given the huge increase in new loans last year, could more readily access credit than in previous years.

Andrew Levine knew he wouldn't find a job in investment banking when he graduated with an M.B.A. from the University of Miami in 2008. Wall Street was in the midst of a financial collapse. So instead the 24-year-old focused his efforts on launching a start-up. "I figured that starting my own company was the best use of my time while I waited for the market to thaw," says Mr. Levine.

Faced with an unemployment rate of 16% for 20- to 24-year-olds, a growing number of recent college and grad-school graduates are launching their own companies, according to anecdotal evidence from colleges, universities and entrepreneurship programs around the U.S.

For his part, Mr. Levine built upon a business plan for a niche social-networking company he had created for an entrepreneurship class the prior year. He showed the plan to the father of a college friend who was an angel investor and got $40,000 in seed money in exchange for an equity stake in the business.

Armed with start-up cash, Mr. Levine created audimated.com, an online social-networking site for musicians and their followers. It serves as a forum for the independent music community both fans and musicians to discover and promote new music. The site is in beta testing now with a launch expected in January.

This push toward entrepreneurship among young people is likely to continue as employers plan to hire 7% fewer graduates from the class of 2010 than they hired from the class of 2009, which saw a nearly 22% drop in hiring from the class before, according to a recent report from National Association of Colleges and Employers. The annual average percentage of all job seekers starting their own businesses increased to 9% through the third quarter of 2009, according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas, a global outplacement consultancy. That's compared with 5% at the end of 2008.

"Given the state of the economy, and the state of the job market, many young people are getting the push they needed to become entrepreneurs," says Bo Fishback, vice president of entrepreneurship at the Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes entrepreneurs. "It's a lot easier to decide to launch your own company when there aren't a lot of jobs out there."

School career-service officials say it makes sense for new grads to go the start-up route. Young adults are often well-suited to put up with the long hours start-ups demand. They don't have the responsibilities and financial obligations that burden older adults. What's more, these graduates grew up on the latest technology and easily adapt to technological improvements.

Of course, young entrepreneurs also are likely to face their own hurdles. "Having the skill set to become an entrepreneur is different than any thing you learn in school," says Susan Amat, the executive director of the Launch Pad at the University of Miami, an entrepreneurship-support program based out of the campus career center.

To that end, it's important for young entrepreneurs to seek the necessary help to get started. For current students or recent graduates, it might be easiest to reach out for assistance on campus. Many schools have campus incubators or offer start-up competitions, like Babson College's annual Entrepreneurship Forum, which offers cash, consulting, legal and Web services to winning business plans. Other schools have business incubators that help students and sometimes outsiders hone business ideas and, in some cases, support them financially or with other resources.

Mr. Levine turned to the Launch Pad before he sought out an investor to him sharpen his business plan and investor presentation for Audimated.com. The program also gave him guidance for creating a revenue strategy and trademarking the site's logo.

A boot-camp training program or organized group for aspiring business owners also can help. The Kauffman Foundation's FastTrac, a 10-week boot camp offered throughout the country, trains aspiring entrepreneurs. And Y Combinator of Mountain View, Calif., and TechStars in Boulder, Colo., offer cash and mentoring to young founders.

Many of these programs provide advice for newbie businesspeople from whether an idea can support a business, to how to write a business plan, to understanding your market. They also provide an opportunity to meet other entrepreneurs who are further along in the start-up process.

The biggest challenge, though, might be convincing investors and customers that a young 20-something has the experience needed to deliver on a plan. One way to clear that hurdle is with strong advisers. "Recruit the right advisers who will vouch for you, who are experts in your field, will let you use their name and are beyond refute," says Mr. Fishback.

Experts in the business, entrepreneurs with a number of successful ventures under their belts, and well-respected professionals can help open doors for fledgling start-ups and lend an air of legitimacy and trust.

Brooks Morgan, a 2009 graduate of University of Kansas, did just that. Mr. Morgan wanted to work in venture capital, but jobs were scarce, so he found work on the other side at a start-up. As vice president of business development for Infegy, a start-up enterprise social-media analytics company, Mr. Morgan's first order of business was to attract advisers. His last two years in college, he had worked part-time with Richard Caruso, a venture capitalist and 2007 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award winner. Mr. Morgan tapped Mr. Caruso, who introduced the three Infegy principals to people who could help them land deals with corporations. Mr. Morgan also searched online and found another adviser who became Infegy's chief financial officer.

"Because we were passionate about what we were doing, [our advisers] were excited to be with and help the younger generation," says Mr. Morgan. Infegy was launched earlier this year and has 20 employees and several Fortune 500 clients.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Hedge funds alarmed at regulatory probes

Insider trading

An empowered SEC is making waves in the alternatives space, says Suchita Nayar

In October, newspapers around the world carried photographs of Raj Rajaratnam, founder of Galleon Group, the hedge fund manager, in handcuffs.

His arrest was in connection with the US authorities' most ambitious insider trading case ever, one that has ensnared some 20 individuals for allegedly clearing some $53m (32m,  ¬35m) of illegal trades since 2006.

The case set alarm bells ringing across hedge funds. "I can't remember wiretaps ever being used over extended periods of time for an insider trading case," says Donald Chase, a partner at Morrison Cohen, a law firm. "You only heard of such tactics in relation to criminal gangs and drug busts."

All of this has raised fears in the industry about who might be next, says Marcelo Cruz, a risk specialist and adjunct professor at New York University.

At the heart of the matter is pursuit of information, the holy grail for fund managers of all stripes. Due to the competitive nature of the industry, analysts and traders always seek information their competitors lack through channels that at times may be suspect. This proverbial "edge" can be the key ingredient of performance and hefty payouts for managers.

"For the edge, a manager digs deeper, using proprietary tools, specialist consultants, channel checks and the like," says Bradley Alford, founder of Atlanta-based family office Alpha Capital Management.

There is nothing illegal about seeking an edge. A retail sector analyst could form an opinion about a company's quarter by speaking with a shopkeeper selling its goods; or a manager may form an impression about a company's overall growth by meeting its executives at a conference; another may acquire cutting-edge research via specialist boutiques.

For David Lerner, another partner at Morrison Cohen, all managers seek a proprietary edge. For most, that comes from detailed homework.

"For example, a manager could use analytics to generate alpha by finding trends or reaching conclusions that its competitors haven't bothered to figure out. Someone may even crunch data differently than his peers."

Still, it is no secret that some traders and analysts spend a lot of time exchanging information with colleagues and reaching out to insiders of industries in the hope of gaining the edge, says Mr Cruz. "Rumours, gossip and loose talk are their bread and butter. Most of what's discussed in these conversations is fair game, but traders must know when not to cross the line."

However, this line between information that is public and non-public, material and non-material can be fuzzy, according to Mr Chase. "Intelligence can come from any number of quarters and can be filtered through a lot of different people," he says. "Absent wiretaps, it can be difficult to show that an individual knew what they were doing was illegal."

An investigation earlier this year into possible insider trading at Pequot Capital Management prompted founder Arthur Samberg, who denies any wrongdoing, to close the firm. Galleon is also closing down following the indictment of its founder, who also denies wrongdoing.

"There is no bigger game-changer for a hedge fund than fraud. Firms that took years to build, have been wiped out in days," says Ellen Schubert, chief adviser to Deloitte's asset management services group.

In the wake of the Galleon investigation, analysts and traders are on notice; they are careful about what they say to colleagues and friends; their employers are dusting off their compliance manuals to go over basics; they are raising "what if" scenarios with their legal counsels and compliance chiefs.

Morrison Cohen, for instance, is asking its investment advisory clients to go through their compliance manuals with a "fine toothcomb." It is asking them to publicise policies that set forth what employees, including new recruits, can and cannot do.

Separately, Deloitte is working closely with managers to put in place anti-fraud policies and procedures, says Ms Schubert. "Given recent events and upcoming legislative changes, it's very likely managers are going to face audits, due diligence questions and investigations, which will directly look for fraudulent or corrupt activities," she adds.

Educating staff about compliance is key, says Walter Zebrowski of Hedgemony Partners who also heads the Regulatory Compliance Association. He says only about 10 per cent of hedge funds closely monitor and allocate meaningful resources to compliance; 75 per cent are nowhere near as proactive as the top group; and a few have zero regard for compliance.

Thanks to the recent market and political changes and an empowered SEC, a "regulatory renaissance" is underway, he says. Against this backdrop, managers should meaningfully commit their management fees toward compliance. "It's about properly educating your operations and compliance staff to design, develop and maintain processes that will protect investors," Mr Zebrowski says.

One more thing is clear: instead of relying on managers or regulators to catch suspect trading, investors must work from the principle of caveat emptor , or buyer beware.

For starters, a shift away from due diligence questionnaires and checklists to a deeper look into management firms for red flags is essential, says Mr Lerner. If someone is getting above average returns, question how they are doing it and whether that makes logical sense.

"The game has changed . . . I don't think SEC enforcement has ever tackled insider trading as it's doing now," says Mr Lerner.

Morgan Stanley Fund Asks Relief

A real-estate fund managed by Morgan Stanley is trying to restructure a $1 billion securitized mortgage on five resorts it bought in 2007 in the latest example of a bad commercial-property bet made by the firm.

Morgan Stanley's $1.75 billion MSREF V U.S. fund bought eight resorts at the top of the market from CNL Hotels &Resorts Inc. It put $1.52 billion of debt on five of the properties, including a $1 billion first mortgage and a $525 million mezzanine loan. The first mortgage was carved up and sold to investors as commercial mortgage-backed securities, a popular form of financing during the boom.

But the five resorts have been hammered along with the rest of the luxury-hotel market by the economic downturn, making it difficult for them to pay debt service and possibly even operating costs.

The resorts' combined cash flow declined to $84 million in this year's first half from $150 million during the last six months of 2007, according to debt-rating company Realpoint LLC. Their average occupancy fell to 62.5% from 72% in that same span.

Morgan Stanley was among the most aggressive buyers of real estate during the boom of earlier this decade. Its real-estate investing group bought at least $53 billion of property and sold only $14 billion between 2005 and 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Now, those deals made at the top of the market are dogging Morgan Stanley as property values plummet, rents decline and refinancing options remain scant. Most of that real estate was purchased by its Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds unit, known in the industry as MSREF.

The five resorts include the 780-room Grand Wailea Resort Hotel &Spa in Maui; the 796-room La Quinta Resort &Club and PGA West in La Quinta, Calif.; the 739-room Arizona Biltmore Resort &Spa in Phoenix; the 693-room Doral Golf Resort &Spa in Miami; and the 279-room Claremont Resort &Spa in Berkeley, Calif.

The servicer overseeing the mortgage last month transferred it to its special servicing team tasked with handling complex negotiations with borrowers, according to Realpoint. A recent monthly report issued by the servicer, PNC Financial Services Group Inc's Midland Loan Services, noted that the loan was transferred "due to servicer determination of imminent default." The report also said the borrower was "requesting extension options."

The mortgage comes due in February 2011.

The Property Report: The allure of Dubai World's trophies --- Sale of prime properties could hold key to reviving commercial real-estate market; quenching thirsty investors

A move by Dubai's flagship conglomerate to sell some trophy properties could help turn the gears of a commercial real-estate market that's been stalled for more than a year.

Dubai World hasn't said specifically that it plans to unload real estate in order to raise cash to pay its debts. But in a statement detailing debt-restructuring plans early Tuesday, Dubai World said the restructuring process would include "assessment of delevering options, including asset sales."

A Dubai World spokesman declined to comment on possible property sales. Dubai World owns high-profile properties around the world, including office buildings in New York and London and luxury hotels across the U.S.

Dubai's problems are coming to light as property investors navigate uncharted waters. Banks and troubled borrowers haven't flooded the market with cheap properties, even though rent and occupancy are still declining around the world, financing remains scarce and defaults are soaring. Lenders, hoping to avoid markdowns on their balance sheets, have largely shied away from foreclosing on overleveraged building owners. That has left investors thirsting for deals.

"Perversely, increased availability of good quality assets to buy would improve liquidity in the market as there is strong demand at present for limited stock," says Peter Damesick, head of U.K. research at commercial real-estate services firm CB Richard Ellis Group Inc.

In the U.S., the total value of all commercial real-estate deals of $5 million or more will reach just $49 billion in 2009, research firm Real Capital Analytics projects. That is less than one-tenth of the $497 billion in deals done in 2007, and even less than the $79 billion in deals done in 2001. Meanwhile, real-estate private-equity firms around the world are sitting on $172 billion in commitments from investors, according to research firm Preqin.

"There is no product out there, there is nothing to buy, and there's a lot of money out there that would love to buy," said Sam Zell, the real-estate "grave dancer" who made a fortune from earlier downturns.

That could be one of the few bits of good news for landlords who need to raise cash by selling buildings. Bidding has been especially heavy when prime properties---such as fully leased, trophy office buildings in major cities---have gone on the block.

Buyers have been most aggressive outside the U.S.. In Hong Kong, a wealthy investor in September purchased a 23-story office building for $465 million at a 4.3% yield---recalling values at the height of the bubble. In London, the average yield that buyers have been willing to accept fell one percentage point over the past six months, signaling an uptick in valuations, according to Real Capital Analytics research director Dan Fasulo.

International investors have also been looking for deals in the U.S., in some cases driving up values. German property-fund manager Deka stunned American real-estate investors when it agreed to buy a 12-story office building in Washington for $208 million. And in recent months, the Manhattan headquarters of HSBC Holdings PLC drew 43 bids, according to Steve Collins of commercial brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., which worked on the deal. The top four second-round bidders were all international groups willing to pay all cash, Mr. Collins said. The building ended up going in October to Israeli investment company IDB Group for $330 million in cash.

Dubai World's New York office buildings include Six Times Square, purchased for $300 million in 2007, and the 40-floor 450 Lexington Ave., acquired for $600 million in 2006, according to Real Capital. In London, Dubai World owns several postcard buildings, including the Metropole Building, 10 Whitehall Place, Grand Buildings on Trafalgar Square and the Adelphi office building on the Strand.

Dubai World borrowed heavily to ramp up its real-estate holdings. The company's investment arm Istithmar in the past few years borrowed about $1.1 billion to acquire five properties in the U.S., including four hotels and an office building, according to an analysis of public records by Trepp, a New York firm that tracks the commercial real-estate market. About $816 million of that debt was bundled into commercial-mortgage-backed securities, Trepp's study shows.

But top-of-the-market deals done with a lot of borrowed money may have little equity left to save, complicating any strategy to raise money by selling assets. For example, the $115 million mortgage used by Istithmar to buy the W Hotel in New York's Union Square was transferred in late September to a "special servicer" because of concerns over imminent default stemming from the hotel's dwindling cash flow, according to Trepp.

U.S. News: Some Borrowers Find Little Relief

By Ruth Simon

The Treasury Department announced plans Monday to beef up its foreclosure-prevention effort by pressuring mortgage companies to complete more loan modifications.

But the new initiatives don't address significant shortcomings of the program, which often provides little relief to borrowers who have lost their jobs or who owe far more than their homes are worth.

The program provides financial incentives for mortgage companies and investors to reduce loan payments to affordable levels for financially troubled borrowers. The Treasury said Monday that it would send "SWAT teams" to the largest mortgage servicing companies and talk twice a day with mortgage executives to boost their success rates.

More than 650,000 borrowers have begun making trial payments under the program, but few homeowners have received permanent fixes. Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Barr said the Obama administration has called executives from top mortgage companies to Washington next week to explain. Mortgage companies that perform poorly in the modification program could face monetary penalties and sanctions, though the administration declined to provide specifics. "Servicers need to do better," he said.

To qualify for a reduced mortgage, borrowers must first make three reduced payments under a trial program. To receive a permanent fix, borrowers must also provide a hardship affidavit and other documents.

But many borrowers complain that it is difficult to get a permanent loan modification even after making required trial payments.

The administration continues to look at ways to expand the program, Mr. Barr said, including help to unemployed homeowners. But the campaign to increase the number of permanent fixes is "the top priority," he added.

Roughly 375,000 borrowers are on track to receive a permanent modification by year's end, provided they meet program requirements, the administration said.

But only one-third of applicants have submitted all their required documents. "Borrowers need to take responsibility," Mr. Barr said. Administration officials said they also are working with more than 300 state and local groups to assist borrowers with the paperwork.

The latest announcement comes amid concerns that rising delinquencies and foreclosures could threaten the housing recovery. Some 1.56 million mortgages current in March were at least 60 days past due in October, according to LPS Applied Analytics.

Many financially troubled borrowers can't even qualify for a trial modification under the Obama plan. For instance, borrowers who are unemployed can receive a loan modification provided they show eligibility for at least nine months of unemployment benefits. But as a practical matter, most borrowers getting unemployment benefits aren't likely to qualify.

Dolores Ross lost her job as a paralegal in December 2008 and has been struggling ever since. Last month, CCO Mortgage, a unit of Citizens Financial Group, turned her down for a modification. "I assume I'll get a job again," said Ms. Ross, who is still current on her mortgage payments. "But I still have to file for bankruptcy because I cannot make the mortgage and my utilities and pay the credit cards."

Martin Reavis, a housing counselor with Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, is working with Ms. Ross. He said she is receiving a little more than $1,400 a month in unemployment benefits, which is less than her $1,632 loan payment. Ms. Ross doesn't have "an excessive lifestyle," he said. "Unemployment won't support a modified payment."

A spokesman for Citizens Financial, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland, declined to comment, citing customer privacy.

Falling home values present another challenge. Borrowers who are current on their modification can receive up to $5,000 to reduce their loan balance. But the program's primary focus is reducing interest rates, not principal, despite studies that show borrowers receiving principal reductions are less likely to redefault.

Carl Fischer, who lives in Fort Meyers, Fla., was offered a loan modification that would have dropped his $1,100 monthly payment to less than $400. But Mr. Fischer turned down the deal. He feared it would ruin his credit and leave him still owing more than his house was worth.

"There is no way the value of the house will come back," Mr. Fischer said. He paid $170,000 three years ago for a property he believes is now worth less than $40,000. Mr. Fischer is considering his options, including a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure -- handing over title to the property without completing the foreclosure process.

"We are doing principal reduction for certain loans in the company's portfolio or where the investor allows it," said a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, Mr. Fischer's mortgage-servicing company.

Move to see climate issue go main line

Railpen is quizzing its advisers on their approach to climate change, writes Pauline Skypala

One of the UK's biggest pension funds will today seek to make climate change a key issue for its advisers and the 40 investment managers mandated to run money for the fund.

Railpen, the 17bn ( ¬18.7bn, $29bn) fund for railway employees, will be sending out detailed questionnaires to probe the extent to which managers take climate change seriously, how it affects their investment process, and what they see as their fiduciary duty.

Devised in collaboration with HSBC and Linklaters, the 77 questions will be freely available to any other asset owner that wants to quiz its advisers and managers.

Frank Curtiss, head of corporate governance at Railpen Investments, said the initiative was not the first in this area but was "the most sophisticated", particularly on the legal issues. "We have to be comfortable our advisers and managers are taking on these risks so we need to open up a dialogue."

He said there had been a strong focus on short-term returns and a view that researching environmental, social and governance issues was a niche area.

Gordon Morrison, global head of equity trading analytics at HSBC, said the real point of the effort was to ensure returns for asset owners do not disappear. "We need to make a huge transition to a low carbon economy in a short time. We have a big pool of existing assets that is not necessarily structured for a low carbon economy."

Mr Morrison pointed to regulatory moves elsewhere, notably in the US, where insurers will be required to submit annual climate risk reports from May 2010. There is no parallel in Europe. This may change if asset owners signal they see this sort of reporting as a starting point to deal with the issue.

There are a number of industry-led initiatives. Insurers have set up ClimateWise, an international group that commits to action on climate change against six principles. Launched by Prince Charles in 2007, the group last week published its second independent review.

European asset managers and owners can join the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which encourages a proactive approach to climate change among its members and disclosure by companies. Railpen is not a member because it felt the 5,000 annual fee was too much of its members' money to commit.

With the latest initiative, which involved a time commitment rather than cash, Railpen hopes to act as a catalyst. "The investment community needs to become substantially more sophisticated and more engaged. Tools like this will help," said Mr Curtiss.

One area where he hopes to move the debate forward is the legal issue of fiduciary duty. "People hide behind fiduciary duty as an excuse to do nothing," he said.

The legal requirement on asset owners to act prudently and in the best interests of beneficiaries is narrowly interpreted by some as a duty to maximise return. "Duties have been understood in a particular way by the investment industry," said Vanessa Havard-Williams, partner at Linklaters.

She said the legal obligation had to be considered in the overall regulatory and scientific context. "It does not exist in isolation."

Regulation could fill some of the gap, but was not yet in place, she added. "The science is there but the regulation is not. So you have an exposure but it is not signalled to you."

Q&A: ING Lease UK

ING Lease UK is part of the ING Group - one of the largest financial companies in the world. In 2004, the company acquired three businesses from Abbey National Group.

With 300 employees and 100,000 customers, the company has to ensure its reporting and market perception is as accurate as it can be.

Dan Ilett, for Digital Business, questioned Chris Stamper, chief executive of ING Lease UK, about how it creates useful intelligence from its information.

Digital Business: What did you do to improve internal reporting?

Chris Stamper: We turned conventional wisdom on its head. We found a tool that allowed the business to assemble all information from disparate data sources into one platform. This allowed us to make decisions in real time.

We ignored the "start small and learn" approach and took the "start big and understand" approach by focusing on the most fundamental question we needed answering which was "where do we make our profit and why?".

DB: How much did it cost you?

CS: It cost less than 50k in external investment, including the price of a small server. Internally, 0.6 FTE [full-time equivalent] of IT resource for six months, and 1.0 FTE of finance resource saw the solution through to live status."

DB: What has been your return?

CS: As an example, analysis of secondary-income opportunity has driven 600,000 of additional annual income. It has also removed high-riskintroducers, assets and products having an immediate effect on very early debt. It has also allowed future losses to be accurately predicted."

DB: How has using '"nternal" business intelligence helped your business?

CS: First, it has given us the ability to make decisions based on fact rather than intuition or perception and has provided complete transparency when understanding profit and loss levers.

We have now moved to a "nowhere to hide from the facts" culture, the IT department has been removed from the critical path to information and everyone in the organisation has access to answers. This encourages collaboration and end-to-end thinking.

At a departmental level it has assisted the sales relationship management strategy, removing unprofitable relationships to be replaced by the profitable. The sales and operations functions work together in tandem, complimenting one another as the cost of sales and servicing is understood end-to-end rather than in isolation.

DB: Where did analytics tools help you?

We've been able to understand profitability against more than 100 dimensions including customer, product, channel, asset, deal size and risk profile.

In essence, it's dispelled perceived wisdom of what was important to thebusiness. This has freed the knowledge workers to concentrate on performing the right analyses and providing the correct decisions rather than massaging data.

DB: Which tools did you use?

CS: QlikView from QlikTech

DB: What did it do?

CS: QlikView removed the "Excel anarchy" and the resulting arguments over whose data is correct. Ultimately it provides "one version of the truth" allowing quick proof of concept against real information. It also provides a support and licensing model for rapid deployment and expansion without a long procurement cycle.

DB: What lessons did you learn from this? What would you tell others to do?

CS: That perception-based decision making is acharacteristic of sales-led organisations. That culture can be very quickly moved with the right tools and environment.

We now have a strong focus on real data quality, freeing the business from having to understand the data and underlying systems, only concerning themselves with the answers.

The partnership between knowledge workers and IT resources is also much more responsive now with IT becoming the custodian of the data on behalf of the business owners. Most importantly it has empowered end users to do the work.

U.S. News: Fear of Double Dip in Housing --- Home Starts Tumble and Mortgage Delinquencies Rise, Casting Cloud Over Recovery

The U.S. housing market is sputtering again, adding to doubts about the vigor of the economic recovery.

Just a few months after housing showed signs of leveling off, bad weather and uncertainty over the extension of a home-buyer tax credit sent new-home starts in October tumbling 10.6% from the previous month. They fell to the lowest level since April, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Starts of single-family houses fell 6.8%.

Earlier this month, Congress expanded the tax credit and extended it through April, so building should improve. Still, the latest data portend poorly for the economy overall, and for fourth-quarter growth.

On Wednesday Pulte Homes Inc., the nation's largest home builder, warned investors of a grim outlook. "As we look out to 2010, we are expecting difficult conditions to continue," said chief executive Richard Dugas.

Meanwhile, more Americans who bought homes during the boom are falling into mortgage limbo. About 3.4% of U.S. households -- or about 1.9 million homeowners -- are 120 days or more overdue on their payments, but not yet in foreclosure, according to LPS Applied Analytics, a research firm in Denver. That is up from 1.5% a year earlier.

Many of these people are likely to lose their homes over the next few years. That means more bank-owned homes will hit a market already suffering from oversupply.

The housing-supply picture is tricky to read. The number of homes listed for sale was 3.63 million in September, down 15% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is enough to last about eight months at the current rate of sales. Anything above about six months is considered a buyer's market, in which prices may come under downward pressure.

But those numbers don't reflect the millions of homes expected to go through foreclosure over the next few years, adding to supply. Amherst Securities Group in September estimated seven million homes are headed for foreclosure in the next few years -- more than a year's home sales at the current rate.

"Housing faces important problems, including continuing high foreclosure rates," Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech Monday. "But residential investment should become a small positive for growth next year rather than a significant drag, as has been the case for the past several years."

For borrowers with strong credit records, 30-year home mortgages are available for fixed rates of just under 5%, near the lowest levels in 50 years. That is helping demand, but many people can't get such loans because they have too much debt or are unemployed.

One measure of the role of housing in the economy earlier this decade: During the boom, residential investment peaked to make up 6.3% of gross domestic product. That number fell to 2.5% in the third quarter, according to Macroeconomic Advisers.

The average U.S. home price nearly doubled between January 2000 and April 2006, according to the First American LoanPerformance index. Since then, the average has dropped about 30%. In most parts of the U.S., prices are still down from year-ago levels, but prices in some markets, including San Diego and Orange County, Calif., have leveled off, at least temporarily.

Wednesday's data prompted some economists to revise their fourth-quarter forecasts down slightly. Macroeconomic Advisers moved its GDP estimate down to 3% from 3.2% and Nomura Securities is predicting 3.4% growth, down from 3.6%. The data adds to the suggestion "that the recovery is a little bit rickety," said Zach Pandl, a Nomura economist.

Eventually, the steep drop in construction of new homes should help reduce the number of unsold vacant homes to the point where builders need to step up production.

With the home-buyer tax credit set to expire in April and the Fed scheduled to wind down its purchases of mortgage-backed securities by the end of March, housing faces a test of its ability to sustain a recovery without as much government aid.

Potential homebuyers are frustrated by the complications of a market dominated by distressed sellers. Tim Kolstad, a financial consultant renting in Scottsdale, Ariz., has been trying to buy a home for more than a year. But the homes he likes are all either foreclosed or being offered for less than the loan balance due -- which means any offer from a potential buyer must be cleared by the lender, and lenders often are slow to respond.

"The offers just sit out there forever," Mr. Kolstad said.

Credit standards are "definitely tighter than they were" in previous years, said Bryan Mitchell, an agent Re/Max Associates in Las Vegas. At least two years of job history, low debt and a good credit score are essential to securing a loan. "You have to have all three, you can't be missing one," he said.

But some economists see signs of better demand ahead. "I think that there's been a lot of doubling up in this recession," said Patrick Newport, an IHS Global Insight economist. "People lose their jobs so they move in with relatives. Your kid graduates from college, he can't get a job, so he stays at home. That's going to start going the other way."

Single family home-building is still 10.9% below year-ago levels. New homebuilding fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 units, the lowest since April. And apartment-complex construction fell as high vacancy rates, declining rents and borrowing difficulties have deterred builders. Building permits, a sign of future construction, also decreased 4%.

The number of people awaiting foreclosure action has ballooned partly because the government has prodded lenders to consider reducing payments for many distressed borrowers in an effort to avert foreclosures. At the same time, loan-servicing companies, the firms that collect mortgage payments and handle foreclosures, are overwhelmed by the millions of distressed borrowers. "There is only so much volume that can be processed by the servicers each month," said Herb Blecher, a vice president at LPS.

U.S. News: Hiring Boom in Mortgage Restructuring

Mortgage restructuring for strapped homeowners has emerged as a rare growth area in the economy as companies in the field keep hiring.

Four of the largest mortgages servicers -- Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Wells Fargo &Co. -- have collectively hired almost 17,000 people this year, mostly to work with financially ailing homeowners. With the number of defaults rising, many are planning to keep adding staff.

"We've hired folks, we've transferred folks within the company and everyone is working overtime. All hands on deck is really the right analogy," said J.P. Morgan Chase spokesman Thomas Kelly.

In October, about 12.4% of the 56 million U.S. households with mortgages -- or about 6.9 million households -- were 30 days or more overdue, or in the foreclosure process, according to LPS Applied Analytics, a research firm in Denver.

Wells Fargo, which services one in six U.S. mortgages, has almost doubled its staff working on restructurings, adding close to 7,000 employees this year. Citigroup has boosted its staff by about 54%, adding 1,400 positions. In Arizona, one of the states hit hardest by the subprime disaster, Citigroup opened a new service center staffed by 800 mortgage negotiators.

Loan-servicing companies report that people with a wide variety of backgrounds are applying for the jobs, from rental-car service representatives to former chief executives of small mortgage brokerages that went under.

One of J.P. Morgan Chase's best loan modifiers is a former police officer from Jacksonville, Fla., said Mr. Kelly, the spokesman. "She's terrific on the phone with customers because she knows how to calm people down," Mr. Kelly said.

New companies formed in response to the home-mortgage crisis also have been hiring. For example, Private National Mortgage Acceptance Co., dubbed PennyMac, was founded in 2008 by former executives of Countrywide Financial Corp. and now employs about 120 people.

Nate Cadena, who used to sell loans for AmeriCash Mortgage Bankers, is one of PennyMac's loan modifiers. He said his job today isn't all that different: He gets on the phone with customers and tries to figure out how much they can afford to pay each month.

Mr. Cadena, 32 years old, said he used to earn "very lucrative pay" as a loan salesman. But he said that since the economy tanked, he was forced to take a job as a door-to-door salesman, an experience that readjusted his goals and perspective. "It used to be that I wanted to make as much money as I could," he said. "Now it's about a career path and stability."

Executives at mortgage servicers say most workers dealing with borrowers earn between $30,000 and $60,000 a year plus bonuses, and spend their days talking to delinquent or financially strapped mortgage borrowers. The modifiers present a number of options, with the aim of lowering the monthly payment to roughly one-third of household income.

The Property Report
Deal of the Week: A Foreclosure Spat in Chicago

While many banks are taking pains to work out troubled commercial-property loans rather than foreclosing, Bank of America Corp. has lost its patience with a developer who took on a notoriously stubborn slice of downtown Chicago.

The Charlotte, N.C., bank, as lead bank for a group of lenders, has filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court alleging that affiliates of Joseph Freed &Associates LLC of Chicago have defaulted on a $205 million construction loan to build an urban mall on the site known as Block 37. The bank is seeking to foreclose on the project just as Joseph Freed is planning to open the property's first stores.

Many lenders are dragging their feet to avoid taking title to distressed commercial property. The Chicago project shows the forces at work pressuring banks to foreclose even though they are reluctant to do so.

About $88.2 billion, or 17.9%, of the estimated total of $494 billion in loans for land and residential and commercial construction held by U.S. banks and thrifts in the third quarter were considered delinquent, according to Foresight Analytics LLC, an Oakland, Calif., research firm. In the same period, lenders held only $14.5 billion or so of that type of real estate on their books that they obtained through foreclosures, according to Matthew Anderson, a partner at Foresight.

To be sure, Freed affiliates allege in court documents that their lenders want to step in and capitalize on the developer's work "now that it is on the verge of opening." A spokeswoman for Freed says the default status was of a nonmonetary and technical nature. A Bank of America spokeswoman said the bank disagrees with Freed's assertion.

Freed, a Chicago developer, took over the downtown project from Mills Corp. in 2007. Larry Freed, president of the Freed company, says he was surprised by the bank's action and is battling to maintain control of the property and open some stores by Thanksgiving. "Our hope is to get through this and reach a settlement," he says. Mr. Freed says about 55% of the 275,000 square feet of retail space is leased while about 72% is expected to be leased by year's end.

The Chicago parcel has seen several previous development efforts run afoul. But until recently, it appeared that progress on the site was being made. Separately, Golub &Co. last year completed an office building on part of the block and its tenants include Morningstar Inc. Nearby, the glass and stainless-steel exterior of Freed's project has taken shape. Signs for such stores as the women's clothier Anthropologie and shoe retailer Steven Madden Ltd. are visible from the street.

But court documents suggest trouble has been brewing for some time. As far back as March 2008, construction costs were over budget, according to court documents filed by the bank. Shirley Norton, a Bank of America spokeswoman, says the borrower has been in default since at least March of 2008.

"The lenders do not have confidence in the current developer," said Gary J. Katunas, senior vice president of Bank of America, according to an affidavit filed with the court dated Oct. 28 in support of a request to appoint CB Richard Ellis as receiver. "The lenders consider the prompt appointment of a receiver essential to the completion, opening and success of the project," the affidavit said. A judge is expected to consider this week whether to appoint a receiver to take over.

Bank of America didn't play hardball right off the bat. Ms. Norton wrote in an email that the bank recognizes this is a difficult time for many developers.

"This is not a typical situation," writes Ms. Norton, noting that the borrower currently owes about $135 million. "We have been working with the developer for over a year to help them resolve their financial issues and keep the project alive. . . . It subsequently became clear that the borrower does not have the capital to resolve the budget imbalance and complete the project."

The Property Report: Banks look to reclassify troubled commercial mortgages

Banks are moving quickly to restructure commercial mortgages under new U.S. guidelines that are more forgiving of battered property values and can help banks avoid bigger losses.

Citigroup Inc., regional bank Whitney Holding Corp. and other lenders around the country are planning to review loans now considered nonperforming to determine if they can be reclassified under the guidelines announced Oct. 30 by bank, thrift and credit-union regulators, according to bank executives and people familiar with the matter. The moves could help the banks absorb fewer losses on troubled real-estate loans and preserve capital.

"It's a positive all the way around," said James Smith, chief credit officer for National Bank of South Carolina, a unit of Synovus Financial Corp.

Matthew Anderson, partner at research firm Foresight Analytics, estimates that about two-thirds of the $800 billion in commercial real-estate loans held by banks that will mature between now and 2014 are underwater, meaning the loan amount exceeds the value of the property. The flexibility extended by regulators will apply to $110 billion to $130 billion of these loans, he said.

The guidelines are controversial, with critics accusing the U.S. government of prolonging the financial crisis by not forcing borrowers and lenders to confront inevitable problems.

Regulators respond that they are being prudent, adding that a crackdown will occur at any banks misinterpreting last month's announcement as an opportunity for leniency.

"We will push banks to be realistic [about losses] and will drag them out of denial if that's what we need to do," Tim Long, senior deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in an interview Tuesday.

Regional and small banks are the most likely financial institutions to benefit from the guidelines because of their exposure to commercial real estate. More than 2,600 banks and thrifts have commercial real-estate-loan portfolios that exceed 300% of total risk-based capital, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by The Wall Street Journal. Nearly all of those institutions have less than $5 billion in assets.

Regulators consider the 300% threshold a red flag, though it doesn't necessarily mean the banks are in danger of failing. Risk-based capital is a cushion that banks use to cover losses. Commercial real-estate woes contributed to 100 of the 120 bank failures this year, according to Foresight Analytics.

Supporters of the guidelines note that commercial properties still can generate enough cash to pay debt service on mortgages even if they are underwater. In such cases, banks shouldn't be required to classify the loan as delinquent and reserve capital against it.

"If you're going to take a hit, make sure you're taking a hit for a legitimate reason, not because an examiner is making an immediate judgment on the loan," said Tom Flexner, Citigroup's global head of real estate.

Regulators also suggested ways for banks and borrowers to restructure loans and avoid foreclosure even if the properties can't pay debt service. Banks can carve troubled loans into one performing part and one nonperforming part. That would allow the bank to incur losses on only the nonperforming part, not the entire loan.

In an interview, Joe Exnicios, chief risk officer of Whitney's Whitney National Bank unit, of New Orleans, cited a hypothetical example in which a developer borrows money to develop a small retail center and gets a drugstore chain to sign a lease for one store. If the developer can't sell the other sites, he would be unable to repay the loan. Under the new guidelines, the bank could create a healthy, performing loan supported by the drugstore lease and a nonperforming loan from the rest of the loan. "It may make a difference on whether you need to have additional capital and take additional reserves," he said.

Critics agree that regulatory flexibility might help some banks avoid failure. But the troubled loans remaining on their books will discourage them from lending, reminiscent of Japan's "lost decade" in the 1990s.

A better solution, critics said, would be similar to the approach regulators took during the commercial real-estate crash of the early 1990s.

"Back then, regulators moved aggressively to force banks to take write-offs and sell off their troubled loans, and the market recovered faster," said Mark Edelstein, head of the real-estate group at law firm Morrison &Foerster LLP.

Some observers also worry that the guidance could lead to fewer real-estate transactions.

"The question becomes: Are you going to invest in new properties knowing that there is this overhang [of troubled loans] that could hit you?" said Michael Straneva, global head of Ernst &Young's transaction real-estate practice.

Bankers respond that some critics would prefer that regulators pressure banks to sell assets so they can scoop them up at steep discounts.

"The people who are complaining the loudest are the people who want to buy the real estate," said Pat Goldstein, head of real estate for Emigrant Savings Bank in New York City.

Fund Track
Tougher Standards On Fund Fees Near?

The Supreme Court may soon issue a ruling that puts more pressure on mutual funds to justify their fees.

That is the feeling of some observers after the court heard arguments last week in a case brought by investors against their fund-management firm.

Questions asked by the justices during the hearing of Jerry N. Jones et al. vs. Harris Associates LP suggest that while the ruling may not bring radical change, the Court could call for special attention on how much a fund manager charges its larger institutional clients, which typically pay much less than mutual-fund investors.

That in turn might lead to fund boards taking action in the coming year to reduce fees -- or at least to work harder to justify the fees their funds currently charge -- for fear of being sued.

"I think we could see [in the ruling] an added emphasis on the comparison between the two [fees]," said Ryan Leggio, fund analyst at Morningstar Inc.

It is likely the court will also restate the so-called Gartenberg standard for judging fund fees, which was effectively thrown out by U.S. District Judge Frank Easterbrook when he ruled in favor of Harris in May 2008. Judge Easterbrook said free-market forces should be left to set fees and investors could only successfully sue if fraud was involved.

Established by a 1982 court ruling in the case of Gartenberg vs. Merrill Lynch Asset Management Inc., the Gartenberg standard states that for a fee to be considered excessive it needs to be so "disproportionately large" that there is no way the fee negotiations could have been conducted at arm's length.

If the court restates Gartenberg but also specifically mentions comparing different fees, it would lead to what some have called a Gartenberg-plus standard. Such a ruling "is more likely now than before the oral arguments," said Mr. Leggio.

The investors' lawyer, David Frederick, argued before the court that fund firms charge investors in their mutual funds twice what they charge institutions even though they use "the same manager to provide the same research analytics from the same research group, from the same meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating them to different accounts."

John Donovan, representing Chicago-based fund firm Harris Associates, argued that fund investors cost more to service -- because of, among other things, greater regulatory requirements and customer service needs. But the justices quizzed him repeatedly about comparing fund fees with institutional fees.

"The justices kept coming back to the issue of fund fees versus institutional fees, and [I think] they could come out and say, 'You should pay attention to that,'" said Marguerite Bateman, partner at the law firm Sutherland Asbill &Brennan.

But the impact such a ruling would have on fund fees will depend on the wording of the decision, said Mr. Leggio. For example, a ruling that says comparisons "are crucial" to determining fair fees would be far stronger than one that says the comparison should be made "when appropriate."

If the ruling is strong enough, "there may be some slight downward pressure," on fees under a Gartenberg-plus standard, said Mr. Leggio. Fund boards would be keen to work by the new standards set by the Court, and in some cases the comparisons could lead to lower fees.

Even if fees don't come down, boards will likely work harder to justify their decisions, said Ms. Bateman.

"They'd want stronger support in board-meeting minutes for their decisions," she said.

A strong Gartenberg-plus standard could also boost investors unhappy about their fund fees in their efforts to see their fees cut.

Gartenberg-plus "will give plaintiffs weapons they can use to complain about fees," said Ms. Bateman. "It could quite possibly bring about more lawsuits."

For Banks, Rate Rules Could Mean Tough Times

A looming federal rule to cap the interest rates paid by weak banks could accelerate their demise and make life even harder for depositors.

Banks deemed to be less than "well capitalized" by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. won't be allowed, starting Jan. 1, to pay more than 0.75 percentage point above the U.S. average.

Just 4% of the nation's 8,185 federally insured banks weren't well-capitalized as of June 30. But weaker banks "drive up costs for the rest of the industry" by offering unusually high rates to lure deposits, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said when the rule was announced in May.

Reining in such banks will force them to compete "with one hand tied behind their back," said Lawrence Kaplan, a lawyer with Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &Walker LLP. "This will cause deposit outflows" that could accelerate the rate of bank failures. There have been 115 so far this year.

The curbs are "another nail in the coffin" of banks battered more by the real-estate meltdown than bad management, said Greg Murphy, chief executive of Royal Palm Bank of Florida, a unit of Mercantile Bancorp Inc., Quincy, Ill. Royal Palm pays 1.62% interest on savings accounts, about eight times higher than the U.S. average of 0.2% as of Monday.

Mr. Murphy said the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., bank hopes to avoid the FDIC interest-rate cap by merging its charter with the charter of another Mercantile-owned bank, which is well-capitalized. The curbs "are another factor that tells us we do the right thing" in combining the charters, he added.

The new rule allows some flexibility in local markets where competition is fierce, but the FDIC is likely to show little mercy, some experts said.

Nexity Bank, a unit of Nexity Financial Corp. based in Birmingham, Ala., might have to sharply reduce deposit rates because it was ordered by the FDIC in March to boost its capital levels. Greg L. Lee, Nexity's chairman and CEO, said he is "not alarmed," citing rivals that often pay higher rates than those advertised.

Most of the banks affected by the rule will face new pressure to fix their problems by getting rid of bad loans.

"If a bank has a capital deficiency, it should be shrinking," said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics.

BlackBerry Offers Low-Hanging Fruit

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Is smart-phone pioneer BlackBerry in danger of becoming the AOL of the mobile-device market?

Verizon Wireless's launch on Friday of the Droid phone, a Motorola-built handset using Google's Android operating system, signals the opening of a new front in the smart-phone war. Early buzz on the Droid suggests it may be the strongest competitor to Apple's iPhone so far. But it is BlackBerry maker Research In Motion, more than Apple, that is particularly vulnerable.

BlackBerry has failed to build on the popularity of its email service with a robust Internet browser. That wasn't a major issue while the iPhone, available only on AT&T, was the only other game in town. But now the array of competitive smart phones includes the Palm Pre on Sprint Nextel as well as the Droid.

Apple already is closing the market-share gap with RIM, boosting its global smart-phone share to 17% in the third quarter, estimates Strategy Analytics, while RIM rose to 19.5%. For 2008, RIM was at 15.6%, and Apple, at 9.1%. RIM could see some defections in coming months. Consumers now represent the majority of new subscribers. But the percentage claiming to be very satisfied with their BlackBerrys fell five percentage points to 43% between June and September, according to research firm ChangeWave. Its research also showed erosion among corporate IT departments, historically RIM's sweet spot. Apple has made inroads among corporate purchasers, although it lags far behind RIM.

Of course, RIM could still reinvent the BlackBerry and recapture momentum. Even if it does, though, it may find it difficult to maintain profit margins. Consider: RIM's gross margin dropped to 44% in the latest quarter from 56% three years ago, despite little change in the average selling price of its devices. That is partly because the more complex devices coming onto the market are more costly to make.

Devices aren't likely to become simpler. Yet prices are likely to come under pressure as competition intensifies. RIM also could face a squeeze on the fee it charges carriers for each subscriber.

All that suggests RIM's gross margin will continue declining. What's more, as Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff says, RIM will likely have to boost spending on R&D and marketing if it is to maintain its market share. The combined impact would be weak profit growth even if sales boomed. Citigroup analyst Jim Suva estimates RIM's operating margin will drop to 19.2% in fiscal 2011 from 23.1% last quarter, excluding litigation expense. That would slow EPS growth to just 1.7% in fiscal 2011 from this year, assuming 18% sales growth.

In the wake of a recent selloff, RIM is trading at 13.9 times consensus 2010 earnings. That appears cheap relative to stocks like Apple. But given the potential for slow earnings growth, it may be still pricey.

Overheard

From Trenton to Charlotte? Bank of America's chief executive search has highlighted the paucity of available executives with a history of running complex financial organizations. But one has just come available. Fresh from his rejection as governor by New Jersey voters, former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine already is being whispered about as a dark horse candidate. With BofA still under the government's thumb, his political experience could come in handy.

Utz Quality Foods was headed for a merger with neighboring snack maker Snyder's of Hanover. Then, according to executives, the Federal Trade Commission started fretting about pretzel pricing power. Utz, a small private company, balked at the potential cost of complying with a deeper review. After years of waving through big deals, it looks like somebody in Washington has choked on a pretzel again.

FT REPORT - DIGITAL BUSINESS
Compliance tools can also deliver financial benefits

Regulation

Stephen Pritchard says businesses are starting to see the opportunities that come along with following the rules

Given the turmoil that has engulfed the financial and business world since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it is hardly surprising that dealing with risk has moved swiftly up the enterprise agenda.

This new emphasis on managing risk, as well as regulatory compliance, is shaping the IT agenda, and not just in financial services. Last December, Forrester Research, the IT analyst firm, predicted that governance, risk and compliance (GRC) would be one of the priorities for business leaders in 2009.

But tighter regulations in the financial arena are only part of the story. As Forrester's Chris McClean points out, there is a wider issue of how businesses, and their employees, behave.

Risk management goes beyond meeting the demands of financial regulations, and extends into areas such as environmental compliance, supply chain integrity, the traceability and authenticity of goods and even whether staff are keeping to their employers' ethical codes.

"Investors, stakeholders, and executives seeking greater confidence in an enterprise's operations will demand the re-examination of compensation structures, financial planning, sales techniques, manufacturing processes, and other critical business functions," says Mr McClean.

The challenge for IT departments is to support the business's broader compliance needs, rather than simply designing or deploying point solutions.

Businesses have tended to view each regulation and compliance requirement as an isolated project, rather than developing an overall approach to GRC. This was, at least in part, a reaction to the previous round of financial scandals at the end of the dotcom boom, and the legislation, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that followed.

"The first wave [of regulation and compliance technology] was a sticking plaster," says Seamus Reilly, a specialist in enterprise risk in the technology and security risk services practice at Ernst & Young.

"It was very ineffective but it was a reaction to timescales. But we are now seeing organisations look for programmes that deliver efficient and effective compliance, but also deliver benefits such as providing more insights into their customers."

One way organisations can do this is by combining data sources or by creating data marts that provide a "single version of the truth" for regulation and compliance purposes.

This provides more accurate data, quicker decision making and, ideally, better customer service. Someone buying a service from a bank, for example, should not have to provide the same paperwork several times over.

Businesses are also operating in an environment where public scrutiny is the norm, suggests Douglas Stewart, a senior manager in risk services at Deloitte, the professional services firm. Increasingly, public companies are being asked to publish information such as statutory filings in near real time.

Regulators are encouraging more openness, Mr Stewart suggests, and businesses will have to respond with more efficient systems for releasing information on compliance.

But organisations are also looking to technology to improve the effectiveness of internal controls and, in particular, audit and regulatory compliance functions.

"Risk and compliance teams are using data analytics tools to predict trends and spot outliers," he says.

"That allows regulation work to be more focused. You can't replace people with technology, but you can use the technology to target your resources."

The use of business analytics in compliance is a move away from the conventional, sampling-based approach to audits.

At present, though, only a small number of organisations have moved beyond localised compliance systems - which are largely process-based - to ones that can identify trends and patterns in masses of data.

One reason, according to Donie Lochan, a partner in the Sydney office of Bain & Co, the management consultants, is that IT maturity and complexity is holding them back.

"Technology is enormously useful," he says. "Without it, it's nearly impossible to do the kind of regulation and compliance you need in financial services."

But complexity has become a bottleneck to better compliance, he suggests.

Too great a proportion of IT resources - as much as 80 per cent of budgets - is being taken up by managing and maintaining existing IT infrastructure. If the business needs extensive IT support to improve compliance, the resources might not be available.

"This is something most companies know about, but something always trumps it. It is viewed as something we need to tackle, but not right now," says Mr Lochan.

One answer could be to use compliance systems as a vehicle for a wider-reaching update of IT systems, and to find ways to bring a direct return on investment to the business.

In financial services, initiatives such as "Know Your Customer" force banks and other deposit takers to have a much more joined-up picture of their account holders, and if nothing else this provides a strong marketing opportunity.

"If you look at it more strategically, organisations [undertaking compliance work] will have a rich set of data that is valuable to the business. So the question is how to get more business value out of it," says Mr Lochan.

Compliance tools can also play a wider role in corporate governance, with technology playing a greater role in spotting unusual behaviour.

The sheer volume of transactional data in most businesses is now too great to be sifted by people, whether identifying a client applying for a mortgage they cannot afford, or a member of staff making unusual payments or filing suspicious expenses claims.

The third wave of compliance is to apply data analytics to these problems, suggests Ernst & Young's Mr Reilly.

"We can't yet find the smoking gun," he says, "but we can bring some insight."

International Investor
Hilton debt load weighs --- Blackstone seeks cut of $5 million to help its largest investment

Blackstone Group LP has begun talks with lenders to cut up to $5 billion from the $20 billion debt load carried by Hilton Worldwide, as the private-equity firm seeks to protect its single biggest investment, according to people familiar with the matter.

The talks are part of a restructuring of corporate debt under way across the economy. Companies hold roughly $1 trillion of senior loans and high-yield bonds that mature before 2015, much of it issued in leveraged buyouts from the middle of the decade. Many of those deals were struck at sky-high valuations, and now owners are trying to fix balance sheets to stave off default.

The talks also are another sign of the turmoil in the commercial real-estate industry. Delinquencies on commercial mortgages held by banks more than doubled to 4.7% in the third quarter, according to Foresight Analytics.

In the Hilton negotiations, Blackstone is considering contributing $800 million of new equity to buy back debt at a discount. It also is seeking to extend debt maturing in 2013 to 2016, while converting some junior slices of debt into equity. The $800 million in additional equity would come from funds managed by Blackstone that already have invested in the deal, the biggest equity investment ever made by the 24-year-old firm founded by Stephen Schwarzman and Peter G. Peterson.

Blackstone funds and co-investors originally put up $5.6 billion in equity in the deal, while assuming $20 billion in debt. Because the talks are in the preliminary stage, the people cautioned, it is unclear what the outcome will be. But Blackstone hopes the debt load will be cut by one-fourth, or $5 billion.

A number of issues are complicating the discussions. Roughly $4 billion of Hilton debt is held by the Federal Reserve, which assumed the position from Bear Stearns Cos. as part of a sale of the investment bank to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Also, the terms of the debt limit Blackstone's ability to repurchase Hilton debt.

Many debt workouts require borrowers to seek consent from scores of lenders, who bought the debt after it was securitized into bonds. The Hilton situation is different because banks hold nearly all of the debt, an unintended result of the closure of securitization markets soon after the Hilton deal was announced.

A Blackstone spokeswoman declined to comment.

It isn't clear how active the Fed, which is being advised by BlackRock Inc., will be in the talks. A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.

Some analysts believe that if hotel markets continue to slump, Hilton might not be able to generate enough cash to stay current on its debt.

Heard on the Street
GMAC Trades With Fear And Favor

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

As any parent knows, it rarely pays to play favorites.

The Treasury looks set to plow another $2.8 billion to $5.6 billion of capital into lender GMAC Financial Services to meet stress-test requirements. That raises a question: Why hasn't GMAC already had to raise this money from private investors?

After all, plenty of troubled banks have recently raised capital. Granted, GMAC isn't a public company, which makes selling equity harder. But it has selling points. New loans look profitable. In addition, the lender already has a hefty capital buffer, reducing the risk of future dilution. Its Tier 1 common ratio is 6.1%, substantially above the 4% required for large banks under a stressed scenario.

However, private investors may be unnerved by GMAC's shaky-looking funding. Subsidiary Ally Bank makes heavy use of high-rate CDs, which can be flighty. GMAC is issuing government-guaranteed debt. And 17% of its assets are financed using loans from the government-sponsored Federal Home Loan Bank system. Bank analysis firm Institutional Risk Analytics says regulators don't like that ratio going over 15%. The message here is that private creditors still seem reluctant to lend on an unprotected basis to GMAC.

The Treasury didn't step in to save CIT Group when credit markets became unfriendly. And CIT is arguably more important to the economy than GMAC, because it provides loans to an array of businesses, rather than one dysfunctional sector.

Prior commitments within the Treasury's bank-rescue plan may force it to provide more money to GMAC. But that creates a problem: Now GMAC knows it has favored status, it just has to wait for the next pile of cash to arrive.

German investors scour U.S. for bargains --- Companies scoop up commercial property at depressed prices

More than 25 years ago, when the U.S. commercial real-estate industry began to emerge from its last collapse, German investors were among the first to snap up properties at discount prices.

History may be repeating itself. While numerous foreign investors have begun to scout the U.S. market in recent months, German investors have been among the few that have actually done deals.

"Regardless of whether the U.S. has reached the bottom already or won't do so for another three-quarters of a year, prices today are good compared to long-term averages," said Matthias Danne, head of the real-estate investment business at DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale.

Deka is the asset manager for Germany's savings banks and operates the country's largest portfolio of open-ended property funds, with a total of some 19 billion euros ($28.24 billion) in property assets under management. The German open-ended funds are required by law to maintain high levels of liquidity. As a result, they don't take on a lot of debt and are more focused on generating income through dividends than property appreciation.

In September, Deka purchased 1999 K Street, a 12-story office building designed by architect Helmut Jahn and located in the central business district of Washington, D.C. Deka paid $208 million for the building, which analysts said represented a capitalization rate of about 6.3% and was at the top end of prices of prime office space in the capital. The capitalization rate, annual net income divided by purchase price, is a measure of how the market values real estate.

But Mr. Danne said that from a long-term perspective, the deal still is a bargain.

"We got one of the best properties in D.C., a brand-new fully rented office on K Street with 15-year leases," he said.

Foreign investors have spent about $2 billion on U.S. commercial properties this year, nearly half of the amount coming from German investors, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York property-research firm. Foreign investment could reach about $5 billion by the end of the year, the firm projects.

Compared with past years, however, foreign investment in U.S. property, never a major force, is the lowest it has been in recent years. At the peak of the property boom in 2007, foreign investors poured $33.4 billion into U.S. commercial properties, according to Real Capital Analytics. Last year, foreign investment plunged to $12.4 billion.

Unlike private-equity property funds, the German open-ended funds aren't looking for 15% to 20% returns, but aim at a dividend yield of 5% to 6%. That allows them to take a longer view of the market and to pay a premium to secure a deal.

That is why Deka's purchase in Washington stirred controversy.

"A lot of people are frustrated with the Germans for accepting 6.3% because cap rates in D.C. are more like 8%," said Dan Fasulo of Real Capital Analytics.

Other German buyers of U.S. property this year include insurance company Allianz SE, which purchased a 50% stake in Boston's One Beacon Square from Beacon Capital Partners in a deal that valued the building at $508 million. Also, Weingarten Realty, a Houston developer of community shopping centers, said this week that it had sold four retail properties to German fund Jamestown U.S.-Immobilien GmbH, a Cologne fund that invests in U.S. property, for $114 million. Two additional properties could be thrown in if Jamestown agrees to assume the debt on the properties, Weingarten said.

German investors were behind some of the first deals done in the wake of the collapse of the U.S. commercial real-estate market in the early 1990s. RFR Holdings Corp., led by two young German expatriates backed by family real-estate fortunes, snapped up properties in Manhattan. Also becoming active at an early stage were Jamestown and Hugo Mann, whose family made a fortune in the retail business. Ironically, RFR, which went on to buy Lever House and other trophy New York skyscrapers, now has headaches of its own from buying some buildings at the top of the market.

There have been few big deals this year in the U.S., but many notable transactions, such as the $330 million sale by HSBC Holdings PLC of its office tower in New York City to Israeli investor IDB Group, have been driven by foreign buyers.

Foreign investors also are looking at smaller investments to get a piece of U.S. property at what appear to be discount prices.

"Many local players have a lot of problems and that means this is a good opportunity for an investor like us with sufficient cash to get into the market," said Mats Johansson, president of Swedish construction group Skanska AB's U.S. commercial-development business.

Skanska's U.S. businesses have worked on the renovation of the United Nations building in New York and overseen construction of the new Meadowlands stadium in New Jersey. In the company's first push into U.S. commercial-property development, Skanska recently acquired a stalled prime office development just five blocks from the White House for $85 million. Completion is expected in 2011.

The development, known as 10th and G, is likely to be just the first for Skanska as it expands in the U.S. It is planning similar developments in Boston and Houston.

"Our plan is to invest between $500 million and $1 billion over the next three to four years," said Mr. Johansson.

Waiting for the Next McMansion to Drop

Despite some tentative signs of recovery, the U.S. housing market remains vulnerable to further price drops -- especially in areas where large numbers of mortgages are headed toward foreclosure over the next few years.

The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market data in 28 major metro areas shows sharp drops in the number of homes listed for sale across the country. But the potential supply of homes is far larger because banks are likely to acquire significant numbers of foreclosed homes in some areas, notably Las Vegas, Atlanta, Detroit, Phoenix, Miami and other parts of Florida, and Sacramento, Calif., over the next few years.

Sales of those homes may depress prices further. By contrast, metro areas with relatively low foreclosure and mortgage-delinquency rates include Boston, Denver, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle, Raleigh, N.C., and Portland, Ore., making them less vulnerable.

Homeowners and potential buyers have been whipsawed by conflicting signals about the state of the market in recent months. Ulani and Mike Thiessen found the market surprisingly hot when they went shopping for their first home in Las Vegas during the summer. With the help of Kim Kelly-Reed, an agent from One Source Realty &Management, the Thiessens finally bought a foreclosed house in September for about $136,000 -- but only after being outbid on three other houses.

"It's a crazy market out there," says Ms. Thiessen, who works for an electrical contractor.

Despite a continuing surge in defaults, there is a shortage of well-preserved foreclosed homes on the market in Las Vegas, Sacramento and some other metro areas where first-time home buyers have been competing with investors for newly affordable properties. "Anything under $300,000 that is decent within hours has dozens of offers," says Michael Lyon, CEO of Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento.

The supply of foreclosed homes listed for sale has dwindled largely because of government-mandated efforts to save as many borrowers as possible from losing their homes. That campaign has gummed up the foreclosure process, slowing the flow of houses into bank ownership -- but only temporarily.

Over the next few years, housing analysts believe, millions of other homes are heading for bank ownership, but no one can say how long that will take or when a sudden torrent of bank-owned properties may swamp certain local markets.

Nearly 27% of first-lien home mortgages are at least 30 days overdue or in foreclosure in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, according to research firm LPS Applied Analytics in Denver. The rate is 23% in Las Vegas, but about 8% in Denver and Seattle. The national average is 12.4%, up from 5.2% at the end of 2006.

Among the millions of homeowners whose fate remains undecided are Jill and Robert Loy, who live in Scottsdale, Ariz. They bought their home in 2004 for $630,000 but figure it is now worth only about $350,000, well below the $470,000 owed on their mortgage.

The couple fell behind on their loan payments last spring when Ms. Loy was temporarily jobless, and they have been trying to work out a modification of their loan terms with the company that collects payments on their mortgage, Colonial Savings FA of Fort Worth, Texas. A Colonial spokeswoman says the bank is trying to help the Loys.

The housing market is heading into the winter doldrums -- when fewer people shop for real estate -- after a summer marked by strong demand for low-end to midrange homes, spurred by a temporary federal tax credit for first-time buyers. How the market fares in the spring will depend largely on the state of the economy and the pace of foreclosures.

"The number of people receiving paychecks will drive the demand for houses and apartments," Jay Brinkmann, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, "and the recovery will begin when unemployment stops rising."

For now, the market seems to be stabilizing, says Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm. But if the job market gets much worse and mortgage rates rise sharply, "that could be the tipping point" for another drop in prices.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, predicts that average national home prices will bottom out in next year's third quarter, assuming that employment begins growing again in mid-2010. But prices in some metro areas still have a long way to fall, he believes. Prices in the second quarter of 2010 will be down about 30% from a year earlier in Miami, 27% in Orlando, Fla., 24% in Las Vegas and 23% in Phoenix, Moody's Economy.com forecasts.

Foreclosures and short sales (in which a home is offered for less than the mortgage balance) dominate the markets in some metro areas. Satish M. Mansukhani, a market strategist in New York, estimates that such "distressed" homes account for 79% of home listings in the Detroit area and 75% in Las Vegas, but just 16% in Houston and 7% in Boston.

One big question is how much more the federal government will do to prop up housing. Congress is debating whether to extend the tax credit for home buyers beyond Nov. 30. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is phasing out its massive purchases of mortgage-backed securities and plans to conclude the program by the end of March. Those purchases have helped keep interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages around 5%. Mr. Zandi says mortgage rates are likely to rise as much as one percentage point after the Fed ends that support. Analysts at Barclays Capital in New York forecast mortgage rates will be slightly over 6% by the end of March.

While supplies of moderately priced homes have shrunk, there is still a glut of high-priced houses in many areas, suggesting that prices on those properties may fall sharply as more owners default. In Sacramento, there are enough homes on the market at $600,000 and above to last more than 15 months at the recent rate of sales, compared with just 1.5 months for homes priced at $300,000 and below, according to Lyon Real Estate.

Home sellers will also face tougher competition from landlords, who generally have been cutting rents in the past year. The national apartment-vacancy rate in the third quarter was 7.8%, the highest in 23 years, according to Reis Inc., a New York research firm. It predicts "a few more quarters of distress, lower rents and higher vacancies."

Apartment rents may face further downward pressure as investors buy foreclosed single-family homes and turn them into rental units, says Ryan Severino, an economist at Reis, who notes that there is little data on the number of houses being converted into rental properties.

The Galleon Case: A Star Partner's Galleon Arrest Shakes Up Ranks at McKinsey --- Anil Kumar Put On Leave by Firm; Ties to India Elite

Anil Kumar became a star partner at consulting firm McKinsey &Co. by building relationships in the technology industry and the Indian business world. Now, he is facing allegations that he used his connections to help facilitate an insider-trading conspiracy by hedge fund Galleon Group.

U.S. federal prosecutors charged Mr. Kumar on Friday with securities fraud and conspiracy on allegations he passed along information to Galleon about some McKinsey clients, including computer-chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Galleon's billionaire founder, Raj Rajaratnam, and four others alleged to be co-conspirators were arrested along with Mr. Kumar, who is free on $5 million bail.

Mr. Kumar's alleged misdeeds have ensnared the management consultancy in one of its biggest scandals ever, one that hits at its core mission as a trusted adviser to businesses.

Through a lawyer, Mr. Kumar has denied the charges. McKinsey has put Mr. Kumar on an indefinite leave of absence. "This case is unprecedented in our history," said McKinsey spokesman Michael Stewart. "We have never had a case of a partner or anyone else in the firm being charged with criminal activity, if the allegations are true."

Mr. Kumar was assigned to the firm's Palo Alto, Calif., office at the time of his arrest. The 51-year-old consultant, one of McKinsey's more than 400 senior partners, joined the firm in 1986 in the U.S. and relocated to India in 1993 to help build the company's practice along with a small cadre of other partners. Former colleagues and associates describe him as ambitious and scrupulous.

McKinsey said it hasn't launched a probe. "We're trying to determine what kind of internal investigation we can do" without interfering with the government's efforts, Mr. Stewart said. "We have not been contacted by the authorities yet. We are in limbo."

Mr. Kumar made a name for himself within the company in 1998 by launching the McKinsey Knowledge Center, a facility in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon, where a team of several hundred employees carries out advanced business research and analytics to support McKinsey consultants. Such "knowledge process outsourcing" would later gain traction in the corporate world with investment banks, brokerage firms and hedge funds.

"It was really pioneering at the time," said one former McKinsey employee. "It was a hallmark of his time in India."

Mr. Kumar developed a close relationship with Rajat Gupta, an Indian-born McKinsey veteran whose eventual promotion to managing director of the firm's world-wide operations, the first non-Westerner to hold the post, raised the profile of Indians throughout the company.

Mr. Kumar helped Mr. Gupta launch the Indian School of Business in the southern city of Hyderabad in 1999. The school has tie-ups with international institutions like Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, and its governing board is stacked with a who's who of prominent Indian executives.

This week, Mr. Kumar told the Indian School of Business's executive board, of which Mr. Gupta is chairman, that he would take a leave of absence from his role as an adviser. A spokeswoman for the school declined to comment.

Insider trading and disclosure of a client's confidential information represent "the most mortal sin a McKinsey person could commit," said Richard Cavanagh, a McKinsey partner between 1970 and 1987. In the buttoned-down, strict McKinsey culture, "People get fired if they cheat on their expense account for like $20," he said.

Mr. Kumar's conviction could hurt McKinsey's ability to retain and attract corporate clients, Mr. Cavanagh and other ex-McKinsey staffers suggested. McKinsey partners "operate as an organization where clients trust them to keep their secrets," Mr. Cavanagh said.

In India, Mr. Kumar was a generalist who cultivated relationships with top Indian conglomerates, people familiar with his background said. Later, he specialized in high-tech fields. He is a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, one of the country's premier academic institutions.

"He was a very bright kid, though some felt he was reserved and a bit arrogant," said Sabu George, a classmate of Mr. Kumar's at the Indian Institute of Technology who is now an activist in India on health issues. "Everyone who knows him is totally shocked," he said, though he added he believes Mr. Kumar will be proved innocent.

In 1999, Mr. Kumar returned to the U.S. to work in Silicon Valley as an adviser to Internet and other high-tech companies, the people familiar with his background said.

More recently, Mr. Kumar began planning his post-McKinsey career, possibly as CEO of a major nonprofit organization in five to seven years, said Pravesh Mehra, a longtime friend who is a Heidrick &Struggles International Inc. recruiter.

"He wanted to do something significant and useful," said Mr. Mehra.

The federal complaint in the Galleon case alleges that Mr. Kumar obtained information from AMD and communicated it illegally to Mr. Rajaratnam to facilitate trades. Mr. Kumar "stood to benefit" because he was a direct or indirect investor in one or more funds affiliated with Galleon, according to the complaint.

AMD has said it is reviewing the situation.

The Property Report
Morgan Stanley and Its Waning Crescent --- Resolution for Slump-Hit Property Firm Draws Near: Cede Control to Barclays or Fight On?

Morgan Stanley may decide to take its final lumps on its unsuccessful $6.5 billion acquisition of Crescent Real Estate Equities Co., the latest of several setbacks for the firm known as one of Wall Street's largest property investors and managers.

Morgan Stanley already has taken about $700 million in write-downs and other losses from Crescent, which owned 54 office buildings, resorts and housing projects at the time of the firm's 2007 top-of-the-market buyout.

Now the investment bank is under pressure to turn the portfolio over to Barclays Capital, which provided a $2 billion loan to help finance the Crescent deal. The debt is due on Nov. 2.

With commercial-property values tumbling and rent rolls declining, Morgan Stanley likely will give up Crescent's properties to the Barclays PLC unit, according to people familiar with the matter.

At the same time, the firm also is considering other options such as putting in more capital to keep the investment afloat, these people said. Negotiations with Barclays could extend beyond the Nov. 2 deadline.

As of the end of the second quarter, Morgan Stanley carried the Crescent properties on its books with a value of $2.8 billion and debt of $2.5 billion, according to a research report by analysts at Citigroup Inc., based on their meeting with Morgan Stanley Chief Finance Officer Colm Kelleher in July.

That would mean the firm's remaining equity in the deal is about $300 million, which would be wiped out should Morgan Stanley opt to turn over the keys to Barclays and walk away from the investment.

Representatives at Morgan Stanley and Barclays declined to comment.

Shareholders of Morgan Stanley will likely get a more detailed picture of the firm's Crescent position when it reports third-quarter earnings Wednesday. In its second-quarter report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Morgan Stanley said a subsidiary of the firm "is currently in discussions with the lender regarding the orderly transfer of collateral and asset operations and other related matters."

The Crescent deal underscores the problems faced by U.S. financial institutions as a result of their aggressive push into commercial real estate when credit was easy and prices were rising.

The latest third-quarter earnings from U.S. banks show that commercial real estate is becoming a bigger drag on the economy as well as banks' bottom line.

At Bank of America Corp., one of the nation's largest lenders to commercial-property developers and investors, nonperforming commercial real-estate loans reached $6.9 billion in the third quarter, or 9.6% of its total such loans outstanding. That figure more than doubled the level in the year-earlier period.

Commercial real-estate problems began mounting last year as the credit crisis made refinancing debt difficult. But the situation is worsening because thousands of hotels, office buildings, stores and other properties are suffering declining incomes and can no longer pay debt service on the money they borrowed when times were good.

Morgan Stanley may soon have this problem with Crescent, some analysts say. Cash flow from Crescent's office properties, which make up the bulk of the portfolio, will likely fall below the amount required to pay debt service next year, according to an analysis by Matthew Anderson, partner at Foresight Analytics.

At the time of the acquisition, the properties were generating cash flow that was 2.5 times debt service, he said. That "debt-service coverage ratio" has fallen to 1.3 this year and will likely drop to between 0.8 and 0.9 in 2010, he said.

To be sure, Morgan Stanley has been selling Crescent properties to reduce debt since the deal was completed in August 2007. As a result, the kind of buildings in the Crescent portfolio have changed over time, which could have affected the cash flow.

Morgan Stanley's plans for Crescent ran off the track soon after it bought the portfolio from Richard Rainwater, the renowned Texas investor.

Morgan Stanley originally planned to put the properties in one of the real-estate funds it manages for institutions and wealthy individuals. But fund investors balked at buying the buildings at top-of-the-market prices, forcing Morgan Stanley to keep the properties on its own balance sheet.

The Barclays debt originally was due Aug. 3, but the bank agreed to a three-month extension.

Investment firms without the balance sheets of large investment banks typically don't buy property for real-estate funds until the money has been raised.

The benefit of buying before the money is in place -- as Morgan Stanley did with Crescent -- is that it allows investment banks to move quickly. But they risk losing investor commitments if the property they buy becomes undesirable.

Morgan Stanley has been one of the most active real-estate fund managers.

The firm announced raising at least $14 billion in 2006 and 2007 for its series of real-estate funds known as MSREF, which have taken some big hits as the property market has soured.

The California State Teachers' Retirement System, for instance, reports its $400 million investment in Morgan Stanley's MSREF VI International LP fund was down 80% as of March 31, and that its $137 million net investment in the MSREF V U.S. LP fund was worth $300,000. Other Calstrs real-estate investments with Morgan Stanley have fared better.

MSREF's bad bets include an investment in North Carolina developer Crescent Resources (unrelated to Crescent Real Estate Equities), which filed for bankruptcy protection in June, and a $3 billion portfolio of German office buildings.

Employers Begin Driving Your 401(k)

By Eleanor Laise

Businesses are taking more control of workers' 401(k)s, retreating from the 30-year experiment with employees running their own accounts.

Barclays PLC's Barclays Global Investors now urges employers to automatically direct 8% of workers' pay into 401(k) savings and build from there. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. in the past year has seen a sharp increase in plans moving all participants into target-date retirement funds -- even if those participants previously selected their own investments. Prudential Financial Inc. on Monday plans to announce a sweeping 401(k) package that, among other things, encourages employers to prohibit workers from borrowing against their retirement savings.

The moves are a more-aggressive version of the employer intervention that has taken hold in 401(k) plans in recent years. Many employers already automatically enroll workers in 401(k) plans and divert money from employee paychecks into retirement savings. Workers can typically opt out of the employer-directed moves. But they rarely do.

The greater employer control is a philosophical shift in 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans, which held $3.5 trillion at the end of last year. The new, more-paternalistic approach, with employers making most of the decisions, resembles a defined-benefit pension plan. But unlike a pension plan, individuals bear all the investment risk.

Fund firms and plan providers say the moves are necessary to get hands-off 401(k) savers on track for a secure retirement. Left to their own devices, some workers invest far too conservatively, others too aggressively, and many don't save nearly enough. Nearly one-third of participants who are offered access to company stock, for example, have put more than 20% of their balances into this relatively risky option, according to Vanguard Group.

Automatic plan features will help workers save enough for retirement and improve their diversification, says Stephen Utkus, director of the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research.

Employers introducing some of the more-aggressive automated features are finding that workers generally go along for the ride. Laboratory-equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. recently overhauled its 401(k) plan's investment lineup, giving participants a two-week period to select their own investments. Those that didn't make a choice were moved to target-date funds early last year.

Nearly three out of four participants were automatically shifted to the default funds, says Susan Gagne, vice president of employee benefits. Early this year, the company started automatically enrolling all new hires in the plan, directing 6% of their pay to 401(k) savings. More than 80% of those automatically enrolled stay in the plan.

But the move toward employer decision-making can present risks for participants. The steps are driving more savings into target-date funds, which hold a broad mix of investments and become more conservative over time. Many target-date funds were walloped last year in the market slide, sparking scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. The Senate Committee on Aging this month plans to examine fees, risks, and potential conflicts of interest in these funds.

In a recent analysis of investment options in nearly 13,000 plans, 401(k) data and analytics firm BrightScope Inc. found that expenses charged by target-date funds are significantly higher than those levied by other funds on plans' core investment menus.

Automatically putting a big chunk of workers' pay in stock-heavy, relatively high-fee funds is "a form of financial malpractice," says Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor.

Pension legislation passed in 2006 ignited the 401(k) automation trend, encouraging employers to automatically enroll workers. Employers jumped on board but generally directed only 2% or 3% of workers' pay toward plans.

Now many employers have decided to boost workers' saving rates. Nearly one-third of plans recently surveyed by consulting firm Hewitt Associates plan to automatically direct a bigger slice of workers' paychecks toward 401(k) accounts. And employers aren't stopping there -- an increasing number are automatically raising workers' contributions each year.

Employers are also taking steps to correct what they see as poor investment diversification, even if participants have previously chosen their own investments. More than half of plans signing up for T. Rowe's 401(k) recordkeeping services in the past year have used this "re-enrollment" strategy, defaulting all participants into target-date funds unless they opt out. That is up from roughly 30% a year earlier.

Market volatility raises new questions for employers shifting around workers' savings. Employers run the risk of moving participants out of funds at a market bottom, creating losses in their accounts, says Stacy Schaus, defined-contribution practice leader at Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco. What is more, workers may be moved into aggressive strategies without understanding the risk they're taking on, Ms. Schaus says.

Indeed, many participants were moved from conservative stable-value funds to stock-heavy target-date funds last year as their employers switched default investments, exposing people to losses that they may not have otherwise suffered, says Pamela Hess, director of retirement research at Hewitt. Many companies made the switch because 2006 pension legislation encouraged employers to use broadly diversified vehicles such as target-date funds as the default investment.

Some financial-services firms are pushing for employers to limit workers' ability to tap their 401(k) savings. Prudential plans to urge employers to prohibit 401(k) loans and limit the circumstances allowing hardship withdrawals. "When we see people using their 401(k) plans as checking accounts, we get concerned," says Christine Marcks, president of Prudential Retirement.

Yet the availability of loans can encourage workers to participate in the plans and can offer "short-term financial relief that may improve a participant's overall long-term financial standing," says a recent Government Accountability Office report.

What goes down must come up. So how should investors protect themselves when interest rates rise again?

With rates currently low, investors have been stampeding out of money-market funds, which pay an average 0.62% yearly, and into corporate, government and municipal bond funds, where the average return this year is 16.3%, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

That's almost on par with the stock market's gains. But those gains will quickly turn into big losses if interest rates start rising briskly again.

Under ordinary circumstances, rising interest rates send bond prices moving in the opposite direction, hurting investors who depend on fixed-income holdings for some of their income. As investors rush out of lower-paying bonds into the higher-paying ones, prices overall fall. For every one-point rise in the federal funds and other interest rates, the price of a 10-year Treasury decreases by 8.5%; a rise of two percentage points would chop a 10-year Treasury bond's value by 17%, using figures from Barclays Capital.

The Federal Reserve has said it will keep rates low for "an extended period" to fight the recession, and most forecasters say any eventual rise will be slow and gradual. But some disagree. A Federal Reserve official, Kevin Warsh, rattled bond investors late last month by saying increases may come "with greater swiftness." The Fed controls only short-term rates, but pushing them up often affects longer-term rates -- especially if inflation is in the air.

Investors can buy some cover by moving some or all of their cash into short-term bond funds, stable-value funds and bank certificates of deposits -- three shorter-term investments whose values are less sensitive to rate shock. No one expects these conservative approaches to yield dazzling double-digit returns, and if interest rates remain low, the need for them won't be as pressing. But they all do better than money-market funds. "What's important is to protect capital and get some measure of a return," says financial adviser Ralph Courage, head of Courage Partners LLC of Norfolk, Va. Here's how the alternatives work:

-- Short-term bond funds. These portfolios, with corporate and government bonds that have average maturities of just under three years, are less vulnerable to rate changes than those with longer maturities. Compare two funds from the same family -- Vanguard Short-Term Investment Grade, whose average maturity is 2.6 years, and Vanguard Long-Term Investment Grade, with a 22-year average. As interest rates fell over the past decade, the long-term fund has outperformed the short-term, rising an average 7.3% annually versus 4.9%. But in the event of a two-percentage-point rise in interest rates, the value of the long-term fund would drop 22%, compared with 3.9% for the short-term, according to Morningstar figures.

In 1994, when rates climbed two percentage points in six months, the Vanguard short-term fund lost a mere 0.8%. Today, its large amount of corporate bonds -- 40% of assets, compared with just 6% in Treasurys -- could soften losses. Why? An improving economy would stoke demand for corporates, and the yield gap between Treasurys and corporates, now 1.3 points, would likely narrow, and prices of corporate bonds would fall less on a relative basis than Treasurys.

You can buy individual short-term bonds yourself. Treasurys can be bought when issued directly from the government, at the Web site TreasuryDirect.gov. Corporate, municipal and most other bonds must be purchased from a broker, and you can expect to pay 1% to 2% of assets in fees and markups.

-- Stable-value funds. Offered within 401(k)s and other defined-contribution retirement plans, these products aim to shield investors from market downdrafts and deliver modest returns. Last year, when the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index plunged 37%, stable-value funds were up 4.6%. This year, with the S&P ahead 18.8%, the funds have advanced just 2.3%, according to Hueler Analytics, a market research firm.

Stability is a pretty enticing message for shell-shocked investors, after two ferocious bear markets in stocks within the past decade. Small wonder these funds made up 30% of defined-contribution assets in mid-2009, up from 20% in 2007. The funds invest in high-grade corporate bonds, Treasurys, cash and asset-backed securities, mainly on the short-term side -- a mix somewhat more susceptible to rate increases than short-term bond funds. A two-point interest rate rise results in a price drop of 6% for the underlying assets of the average stable-value fund, according to Stable Value Investment Association figures.

Investors who cash out, though, get a full 100 cents on the dollar of the fund's book value, regardless of the asset drop. The difference is made up by an insurance contract, called a "wrapper." Instances of investors losing money in stable-value funds are rare. One came earlier this year, as Chrysler teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, and a horde of the auto maker's white-collar workers withdrew their money from its stable-value fund. That overwhelmed the fund's protections, and it was liquidated. Investors ended up with 89 cents on the dollar.

Not everyone is a fan of the stable-value concept. "These things are sold by fear," says Barrett Porter, an adviser at money manager Abacus Portfolios LLC of Pacific Palisades, Calif. "Downside protection but minimal upside? I never have liked them."

Nevertheless, according to a study by David Babbel, of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and Miguel Herce of consultant Charles River Associates, stable-value funds averaged 6.3% annual returns over 20 years through 2008, better than the average of 4.1% for money markets over that period, and the 5.7% delivered by Barclays' index for intermediate corporate and government bonds.

-- Certificates of deposit. They don't pay much in interest, but they do beat most money-market funds. The average one-year CD now yields 0.82%, says Informa Research Services Inc. They are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., up to $250,000 for each bank account.

No one wants to be locked in a CD with low rates and years to run. To earn more while getting into position to do even better when rates rise, find community and regional banks (all federally insured) that are offering higher rates on CDs to build deposits. "They're a great place to hide" while awaiting rate boosts, says William Spiropoulos, chief executive of CoreStates Capital Advisors LLC in Newtown, Pa. Find them on BankRate.com.

For example, New South Federal Savings Bank, of Birmingham, Ala., is offering 2.13% for a one-year CD. Build a "ladder," allocating equal sums to cover CDs maturing after six months and one, two and three years. When the six-month CD matures, the former one-year CD now has six months left, the two-year has 18 months left and so on. Move the money from the mature CD into the vacant three-year slot at the top of the ladder, and you'll benefit when rates rise.

The Property Report: Tishman's Australia fund runs headlong into slump

In late 2004, when Tishman Speyer Properties became one of the first U.S. real-estate companies to launch a publicly listed fund on the Australian Stock Exchange, the future looked bright.

Tishman Speyer Office Fund gave Tishman a fresh source of capital, while offering Australian investors a chance to profit from the rising tide in U.S. office values with the security of knowing one of New York's most prominent property owners and developers was at their side.

Five years later, the outlook is much grimmer for the fund that is managed by an affiliate of the Tishman empire that also owns New York's Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building. The stock price, which touched highs near A$3 in early 2007, are off the lows in the single penny range this year but are still trading in the 35-cent range. And in the latest sign of its troubles, the fund is scrambling to raise cash and reduce its debt load by selling two California office buildings at substantial losses.

For fiscal year ending June 2009 the Tishman fund had an accounting loss after-tax of A$628.6 million ($568.2 million) compared with an after-tax loss of A$112 million in the year earlier. The 2009 loss was largely due to the decline in the value of its portfolio. As of June 30, the value of the fund's share of the portfolio was down about 34% to US$1.5 billion from a year earlier, the company reported. A spokesman for the fund and Tishman Speyer Properties declined to comment.

The Tishman fund has amassed a portfolio of 18 prime office buildings with tony addresses in such locations as Manhattan and Chicago.

In a sign that Tishman may have paid too dearly for some of those prime properties, the fund is now taking losses as it sells the properties into the downturn. "Investors are selling some of their healthiest assets in order to take care of other distressed issues," says Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital Analytics, a New York real estate research firm.

The sales are a necessary pain that the fund has undertaken to dig itself out from a US$164 million loan due to mature in December. Deutsche Bank AG is the lead lender of a group of banks providing this loan.

In Hawaii, fewer visitors and more debt --- Hotel-room demand declines sharply at a time when number of expensively renovated rooms is rising

For the hotel industry in the continental U.S., this downturn is the worst since the Great Depression. But the Hawaiian resort industry is taking a beating that's even more severe.

Hotel-room demand in the state has declined sharply at a time when the number of expensively renovated rooms is rising. Thus, occupancy at Hawaii's resorts dropped to 66.9% in the first eight months of this year, the lowest level since the same period in 1993 and down from this decade's high of 80.7% in 2005, according to Smith Travel Research. Meanwhile, revenue per available room has fallen nearly 25% in the past two years and now averages $150.75.

That combination means a number of Hawaii's resorts no longer generate enough revenue to pay the mortgages on their properties. Distressed debt tied to hotels is rising across the nation, but Hawaii has more troubled hotel debt per room than any other state, about $23,256 compared with $5,083 in California and $5,345 in Florida, according to statistics based on data from Real Capital Analytics. Overall, Hawaii's distressed debt tied to hotels totals nearly $1.6 billion.

Real Capital classifies as distressed any loan that's in foreclosure, receivership or bankruptcy or has been revised by the lender to help the borrower.

This isn't the situation investors anticipated when they began buying up Hawaiian resorts during the real-estate boom. Between 2004 and 2008, dozens of resorts traded hands at prices that ran as high as $800,000 a room, according to Hospitality Advisors LLC, a Honolulu-based hotel-consulting and management company. In many cases, the new owners planned costly expansions and renovations designed to upgrade the aging resorts and offer a higher level of service, and then brought in managers with prestigious brand names to operate the hotels.

Major renovations of existing hotels are common in Hawaii because construction of new resorts has been limited since the 1980s because of steep land prices and local governments' opposition to expansion. "So the name of the game is to buy, renovate and reposition," says Joseph Toy, president and CEO of the hotel-consulting company Hospitality Advisors, based in Honolulu. Many of the resorts that changed hands in recent years were built by Japanese owners in the 1980s.

But practitioners of that pricey repositioning strategy now find themselves in a bind due to the recession, the capital crisis and Hawaii's tourism downturn.

"The operating numbers have cratered, the underlying fundamentals aren't very good, and you have a whole bunch of problem loans," says David Carey, president and chief executive of Outrigger Enterprises Group, which owns 30 Hawaiian hotels, none in foreclosure.

Morgan Stanley, for example, teamed up with a local developer in 2007 to buy the 310-room Maui Prince Resort and 1,300 adjacent acres for $575 million. By this year, the resort's annual revenue had fallen 50% from 2007 levels, its monthly operating losses were nearly $1 million and plans to build luxury communities on the 526 hectares had fizzled, according to a lawyer representing Wells Fargo &Co., the trustee of the resort's $192.5 million mortgage. Wells Fargo put the resort in receivership last month. A Morgan Stanley representative declined to comment.

On Hawaii's big island, Westbrook Partners LLC, Farallon Capital Management LLC and Lodging Capital Partners LLC bought the 540-room Fairmont Orchid Hawaii in 2005 for $250 million. They spent $20 million to renovate the resort, but by this year it could no longer support its $230 million mortgage. The owners, who declined to comment for this story, forfeited the resort to lender Barclays Capital in June.

Local owner Anekona Real Estate Development has lost four hotels to lenders in the past year, including the 203-room Ilikai hotel made famous in the opening scenes of the 1970s television show, "Hawaii Five-0." IStar Financial Inc., which held the Ilikai's $60 million mortgage, foreclosed on the hotel last July. Anekona representatives couldn't be reached for comment.

On Maui, a partnership of resort developer GenCom Group, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Whitehall Street Global Real Estate LP and Highgate Holdings paid $175 million for the 548-room Ritz-Carlton Kapalua Bay in 2006 and undertook a $160 million renovation. Last April, the owners defaulted on the resort's $260 million mortgage from bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings, according to a disclosure by one of the investors in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. GenCom representatives didn't return messages seeking comment.

Vacationers and travelers probably won't notice changes because the lenders in most cases hire new, interim management companies to oversee the properties and work to preserve their business.

The world-wide tourism downturn has been particularly harsh in Hawaii because of its remote location and its upscale focus.

The number of domestic and international visitors to Hawaii has fallen 12% since 2007. Rising fuel prices and the March 2008 shutdowns of Aloha Airlines and ATA made air travel to -- and throughout -- Hawaii both challenging and expensive for tourists, leading many in the U.S. to take cheaper trips to closer locales like Mexico.

And the long-running decline in Japanese visitation -- down from 2.4 million in 1997 to an expected 1.2 million this year -- has been exacerbated by Japanese fears of the swine flu virus.

The tourism slump is hitting Hawaii's economy hard. The state's unemployment rate has risen to 7.5% from 2% before the downturn, Hawaii-based economist Paul Brewbaker says.

Many Hawaiian resorts have remained in the good graces of their lenders but are still suffering. Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell's MSD Capital and partner Rockpoint Capital LLC paid $502 million in 2006 for the 243-room Four Seasons Hualalai hotel and 3,561 hectares for residential development.

Since then, the hotel's annual cash flow has sunk to $7.9 million from $20.6 million, and occupancy has fallen to 54% from 87%, according to reports from the servicer of the hotel's securitized mortgage. Some of the drop resulted from $40 million in renovations that temporarily closed some rooms, Haulalai executives say.

The Property Report
Rosen's Piece of Zell's Office Empire Takes Downward Dive --- Stamford Property Bought by the Art Collector/Real-Estate Investor Is Estimated to Have Lost 30% or More in Value

New York City real-estate developer Aby Rosen is joining the long list of investors who have headaches from buying pieces of Sam Zell's $39 billion office building empire when it was dissolved in 2007.

Mr. Rosen, also is a well-known art collector and fixture in Manhattan society, paid $850 million back then for seven Stamford, Conn., office buildings. Now, the portfolio's value has plunged, and Mr. Rosen is in talks to modify the $300 million first mortgage secured by the properties.

In July, the loan, which was converted into commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, was transferred to a special servicer, a company that handles loans that are troubled and require attention. RFR Holding LLC, the New York-based firm founded by Mr. Rosen and his partner Michael Fuchs, said negotiations with lenders were due to a "minor required loan modification," and didn't involve a shortfall or default. The company declined to elaborate further. The special servicer, Centerline Capital Group, didn't respond to a request to comment.

Like many investors who bought at the top of the market, Mr. Rosen has seen the value of his Stamford properties fall sharply. He paid roughly $513 a square foot for the 1.6 million-square-foot portfolio. The property's value has dropped 30% or more, according to an estimate by Dan Fasulo, head of research for Real Capital Analytics.

The number of real-estate loans in special servicing is expected to increase sharply over the next few years as the commercial real-estate market deteriorates and the number of troubled loans rises.

At the end of September, about $9.4 billion in office loans were being handled by a special servicer, according to Trepp LLC, a research firm, representing 4.2% of all outstanding office CMBS. At the same time last year, just 0.4% of office loans, totaling less than $1 billion, were in special servicing.

A Treasury Department rule change in September that made it easier for property owners to restructure CMBS is also likely to increase the number of loans in special servicing, as landlords seek loan modifications.

Mr. Zell originally sold his Equity Office Properties two years ago to private-equity firm Blackstone Group in a deal valued at $39 billion. Blackstone then resold many of the properties to numerous other buyers. Los Angeles-based Maguire Properties Inc. and New York developer Harry Macklowe were among the buyers who have had to give buildings back to lenders.

The RFR-owned portfolio holds a key chunk of the prime office space in Stamford, a suburban town about 45 minutes from Manhattan that is home to several large financial-services and manufacturing companies. Office vacancy is up to 14.7% in the third quarter, compared with 12.3% in the year-earlier period, according to Torto Wheaton Research.

Vacancy in RFR's seven buildings has risen, according to CoStar Group, which tracks commercial-real-estate sales and leases nationwide. RFR says the buildings are more than 90% occupied and generating enough cash to pay debt service. They have signed 100,000 square feet of leases in the past two months, according to a person familiar with the properties.

Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs were both born in Frankfurt to children of Holocaust survivors, and many of their deals are backed by German investors. The pair began as owners of rental apartments on the Upper East Side, but in the late 1990s began expanding into the office market. In 1998, RFR gained control of the landmark Lever House, and in 2000 it purchased the Seagram Building, a glass and bronze skyscraper designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, paying $375 million.

Mr. Rosen also has emerged as a leading art-world figure. His collection includes work by Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Jeff Koons and Richard Prince. Openings at his Lever House Art Collection exhibitions have drawn wide acclaim. He just opened a new restaurant in the building, Casa Lever, where Madonna recently attended a dinner honoring director Pedro Almodovar.

Stamford isn't Mr. Rosen's only challenge.

In July, lenders ING Real Estate Finance and Swedbank AB, sued Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs for repayment of a $145 million hotel-construction loan that they personally guaranteed as part of a foreclosure action against the New York City project, known as the Shangri-La. RFR said the suit is of "no concern." ING didn't respond to a request to comment.

IPO Focus: Market's stony earth yields hardy offerings

Now may be the short-lived sweet spot for investing in initial public offerings.

IPOs last week had their biggest haul of the year, with more than $10 billion raised, accounting for more than half of 2009's $18 billion total.

This past week's multibillion-dollar deals for Banco Santander Brasil SA, the world's largest public offering this year, and Verisk Analytics Inc. will be followed this year by IPOs for Hyatt Corp., Dollar General Corp. and Dole Food Co.

Because companies that go public in hard economic times tend to be a relatively strong bunch, the 2009 field has a good chance of doing well over the long term.

"This year, you get the best and the brightest," says Bill Buhr, IPO strategist at research firm Morningstar Inc. "Next year, we might be back to the marginal players."

The FTSE Renaissance IPO Composite Index is up 39.5% this year, almost 20 percentage points better than the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index. Powered by such popular new stocks as Chinese water-treatment equipment maker Duoyuan Global Water Inc. and U.S. infant-formula company Mead Johnson Nutrition Co., the IPO index is having its best showing since its 2003 launch.

Historically, IPOs lag behind more seasoned offerings. While there are always enormous IPO successes such as Microsoft Corp. in 1986 and Google Inc. in 2004, most freshly minted stocks don't keep pace.

An IPO study by the University of Florida's Professor Jay Ritter, covering 1970 through 2008, tells the tale. New stocks trailed those of similar market value by 4.7% one year after launch and by 3.8% after five years.

But following severe market shake-ups, investors' risk appetite wanes, the number of new issues dwindles and only the hardiest IPOs come to market. They go on to outperform, Prof. Ritter's research shows.

Consider the aftermath of the 1987 crash: IPO volume fell two-thirds in 1988, and the fresh offerings such as Dell Inc. did 10.5% better on average over the ensuing three years than did older stocks. The story was the same in the tech slump of 2001 and 2002, with IPOs ahead of the others by 13.1% and 38.9%, respectively.

The pattern has held true even though 1988 and 2009 have been up years and 2001 and 2002, down years.

"You don't get the crazy IPOs in years like this one," says Tim Walker, IPO analyst at research company Hoover's Inc. Everyone remembers such wipeouts of the 1990s tech darlings as eToys.com, TheGlobe.com and Webvan.

This year, just 36 companies have gone public, says new-issue research firm Renaissance Capital LLC, which co-owns the IPO index. That is almost a 10th of the gang that did IPOs in 2007. Last year, the volume was light, too, although launches were clustered in the first half, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings -- and IPOs ended up slaughtered along with everything else.

As a group, IPOs are valued similar to the S&P 500. The IPO index is priced at 19.5 times trailing earnings, compared with 21.4 times for the S&P. But some issues are expensive: Verisk is priced at 31 times its earnings. Proponents say robust earnings growth justifies such multiples.

Today's IPOs are almost all solidly profitable, a far cry from the adulterated mix that usually comes to market and that typified the tech-boom era.

Take insurance data provider Verisk, which raised $1.88 billion. In the past several years, its revenue and earnings have risen smartly, even in the face of a steep recession. Net income increased 5% in 2008 and 12% in 2009's first half, compared with the year-earlier periods. So when Verisk debuted on Wednesday, it advanced an impressive 26%.

One of the biggest -- and riskiest -- hits this year is A123 Systems Inc., which makes lithium-ion batteries for electrical and hybrid cars. While in the red, A123 is developing battery systems for BMW, General Motors and Chrysler, among others. It also has received federal money.

The result: The story around this company is good enough to send the fledgling stock up 58% since its late-September debut.

Peri Hartman, a Seattle real-estate developer who specializes in green-friendly houses, bought 900 shares of A123, fully aware of the risks.

"Maybe in the end the auto companies won't pick it to make their batteries, but I am avidly interested in green technology, and they have a very good product," says the 52-year-old Mr. Hartman.

Still, the market isn't hospitable to all IPOs this year, which serves as a warning to weaker wannabes: 14 of 36 completed offerings are trading at less than the offering price.

IPOs in the still-struggling financial and real-estate realm aren't thriving.

The trouble for those companies is, says Prof. Ritter, "people know how hard that sector has been hit."

Banco Santander Brasil, a carve-out from its Spanish parent, raised $8 billion but is down 3% from the offer price. The IPO of Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance Inc. is a boost for its parent, private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, yet those who bought the offering are off 8%.

For individual investors, it still isn't easy to get in on IPOs, says Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. The bulk of shares are assigned to institutions and other sizable entities. As with Brazil's Santander, sometimes the stock drops below the offering price. Individual investors might consider buying at the offering with a limit order to protect them if there is a downdraft, or buying in a few days after they see how the stock has behaved.

A couple of funds focus on IPOs. Whether they should be held long-term is an open question. Three-year-old First Trust IPO Index, an exchange-traded fund with 100 holdings, is up 36% this year, after a 44% slide in 2008. IPO Plus Aftermarket, an open-end mutual fund with just 23 stocks, has been around since 1997. Sponsored by Renaissance Capital, it has an 11% total return in 2009, a 33% drop last year and a 10-year annualized return of minus 5%.

Year's Biggest IPOs Make Debuts --- Banco Santander Carve-Out Is a Record for Brazil; Verisk Jumps 24%

Faced with two of the biggest initial public offerings this year, investors saved their appetite for Verisk Analytics Inc. and turned cold on Banco Santander Brasil SA.

Shares in Banco Santander Brasil, the world's largest initial public offering in 2009, were priced well below market chatter, although in the middle of the proposed price range. The shares ended down 39 cents, or 2.9%, at $13.01 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday and down 3.7% on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.

At $8.04 billion, the deal eclipses the $7.34 billion raised by China State Construction Engineering Corp. in an IPO earlier this year, according to data from Dealogic. Banco Santander Brasil, a carve-out from Spanish parent Banco Santander SA, also is the largest IPO ever seen in Brazil.

Verisk, the largest solo U.S.-listed IPO of the year, closed up 24% at $27.22 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after the shares were priced at $22, above its indicated price range of $19 to $21.

The offering involving the insurance risk-analysis company, which raised nearly $1.88 billion, is the biggest American IPO since credit-card giant Visa Inc. raised $19.7 billion in March 2008.

Based in Jersey City, N.J., Verisk is the largest aggregator of actuarial and underwriting data related to U.S. property- and casualty-insurance risks, and it also provides statistical models and analytics to help detect fraud and quantify losses. Its revenue and profits have increased throughout the economic downturn.

All of the shares were sold by the company's insurer-owners, so proceeds go to them, not Verisk. Among the sellers are American International Group Inc., London-based ACE Group Holdings Inc., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. and Travelers Cos. All continue to retain stakes in Verisk. Berkshire Hathaway Inc., another owner, chose not to sell any shares in the IPO.

Underwriters were Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.

Like Verisk, Banco Santander Brasil had strong financial statements. But analysts said the sheer size of the dual-listed deal meant that most major investors received adequate allocations, leaving little appetite to acquire more once the stock began trading.

A total of 600 million units, 75 million more than originally planned, were priced at 23.50 reais and $13.40. The price came in below market estimates, which had the price falling at the high end of a range of 22 reais to 25 reais per share. Shares traded at 23.08 reais early afternoon.

Each unit, the equivalent of one American depositary share, represents 55 common shares and 50 preferred shares.

Brazilian and U.S. capital markets characterized the sale as an IPO, although strictly speaking it wasn't. Before the offer, 1.98% of the unit's shares were publicly held. Post-IPO, nearly 18% is held by the market. The remaining shares will be held by parent Banco Santander.

The Brazilian economy and its banking industry are considered a hot emerging-markets story, with strong potential to grow. Banking penetration in Brazil is considered low; the country's ratio of credit to gross domestic product is at 50% and mortgage loans account for 2% of the GDP, compared with 169% and 68%, respectively, in the U.S.

Banco Santander has invested heavily in Brazil over the past decade and wants to establish itself alongside the country's two major nongovernment-controlled banking titans, Itau Unibanco and Banco Bradesco SA. Santander has a network of 2,091 branches and 1,521 on-site service units in the country, and 21 million customers.

Global coordinators on the IPO were Banco Santander and Credit Suisse Group AG.

Abreast of the Market
Telecoms restrain stocks --- AT&T, Verizon pull Dow modestly lower; AirTran sheds 18%

U.S. stocks were weighed down by telecommunications companies in light trading Wednesday, as traders cautiously awaited the first big third-quarter earnings report after the closing bell.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 5.67 points, or 0.1%, at 9725.58. The average was pulled down by a 2.1% decline in AT&T. On Tuesday, the telecom giant reversed course and said it now will allow Internet-based phone calls on Apple's popular iPhone over AT&T's 3G network.

The telecom sector fell after the Federal Communications Commission chairman on Wednesday said he intends to proceed with Internet openness rules for cellular carriers. Verizon Communications was down 1% in late trading.

The Nasdaq Composite Index drifted between slight advances and declines, before closing up 0.3% at 2110.33. The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.3% to 1057.58. The index's telecommunications sector was down 3% in late trading, though that was offset by advances in financials, consumer staples and energy stocks.

Alcoa, up 1%, was set to effectively kick off the third-quarter earnings reporting season after the bell. The aluminum producer helped lead the Dow industrials higher on Monday and Tuesday, as stocks rallied on strong expectations for earnings and a surprise interest-rate increase in Australia that sparked recovery hopes. The Dow is up more than 200 points this week, approaching its highs for 2009.

Still, participants were hesitant on Wednesday to extend the pre-earnings season rally, with volume particularly light.

"Given the run recently, especially this week, everyone appears to be expecting companies to beat consensus views," said James Shelton, chief investment officer at Kanaly Trust in Houston. "That may mean we're now being set up for a disappointment."

Analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 to report a 25% decline in profits, only slightly better than the second quarter's 27% decline, according to Thomson Reuters.

Airtran Holdings sank 18% after the air carrier said it plans to sell $75 million in convertible senior notes and nine million shares.

Avis Budget fell 7.8% after the car renter said it plans to sell $250 million in debt.

In two of the biggest IPOs this year, trading was mixed. Insurance risk-analysis company Verisk Analytics rose 23%. Banco Santander Brasil, the world's largest initial public offering so far in 2009, declined 2% on the New York Stock Exchange.

U.S. Fed frets about commercial real estate --- With banks slow to take losses, fears of a residential-property-bust repeat; 'more pain likely lies ahead'

Banks in the U.S. "are slow" to take losses on their commercial real-estate loans being battered by slumping property values and rental payments, according to a Federal Reserve presentation to banking regulators last month.

The remarks suggest that banking regulators are girding for a rerun of the housing-related losses now slamming thousands of banks that failed to set aside enough capital during the boom to cushion themselves when the bubble burst. "Banks will be slow to recognize the severity of the loss -- just as they were in residential," according to the Fed presentation, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

A Fed official confirmed the authenticity of the document, prepared by an Atlanta Fed real-estate expert who is part of the central bank's Rapid Response program to spread information about emerging problem areas to federal and state banking examiners throughout the U.S.

While the Sept. 29 presentation by K.C. Conway doesn't represent the central bank's formal opinion, worries about the banking industry's commercial real-estate exposure have been building inside the Fed for months. "More pain likely lies ahead for this sector and for those banks with heavy commercial real estate exposures," New York Fed President Bill Dudley said in a speech Monday.

In another sign that many U.S. financial institutions are inadequately protected against potential losses on commercial real-estate loans, banks with heavy exposure to such loans set aside just 38 cents in reserves in the second quarter for every $1 in bad loans, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by The Wall Street Journal. That is a sharp decline from $1.58 in reserves for every $1 in bad loans from the beginning of 2007.

The Journal's analysis includes more than 800 banks that reported having more than half their loans tied up in commercial real-estate, ranging from apartments to office buildings to warehouses.

Loan-loss reserves typically rise and fall in any credit cycle, being drawn down as losses mount. Some analysts and investors say the recession combined with inadequate loan-loss provisions when times were good have left banks dangerously vulnerable to the deteriorating commercial real-estate market.

Mr. Conway's presentation painted a bleak picture of the sliding real-estate values and enormous debt that will need to be refinanced in the next few years. Vacancy rates in the apartment, retail and warehouse sectors already have exceeded those seen in the real-estate collapse of the early 1990s, Mr. Conway noted. His report also predicted that commercial real-estate losses would reach roughly 45% next year. Valuing real estate has always been tricky for banks, and the problem is particularly acute now because sales activity is practically nonexistent.

Some of the banks with especially low levels of loan-loss reserves are teetering. Capmark Bank, based in Midvale, Utah, and owned by commercial real-estate finance firm Capmark Financial Group Inc., had 11 cents in reserves for every $1 in bad loans it reported in the quarter ended June 30, the Journal analysis shows.

A Capmark spokeswoman said in a statement that the amount of loans written off by the bank, totaling $357 million as of June 30, "should be taken into account when evaluating possible future losses."

Capmark's parent company, owned by investors led by private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &Co., warned last month that a bankruptcy filing could be imminent and said regulators intend to order Capmark Bank to raise capital and improve its liquidity. Capmark Bank got a $600 million capital infusion from its parent company in late September.

These days, many U.S. banks have adopted a policy of extending loans when they come due even if they wouldn't make those loans now. In some cases, values of the underlying property have fallen below the amount of the loan.

"There's been an extend-and-pretend philosophy by banks to forestall hits to their balance sheets that might occur," says Patrick Phillips, new chief executive of the Urban Land Institute, a real-estate industry group.

Matthew Anderson, a partner at research firm Foresight Analytics, adds: "It's like taping paper over a hole in the wall."

Last month's Fed presentation supports criticisms that banks have been slow to take losses on bad commercial real-estate loans. The value of commercial real-estate loans as recorded by banks has declined at a much slower rate than property values since 2005. But banks have been slow to absorb losses on their loans partly due to "capital preservation" concerns, the report states.

Bank examiners are stepping up their scrutiny of commercial real-estate portfolios at U.S. banks. Michael Stevens, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, said regulators are reviewing greater volumes of commercial real-estate loans than they did before the financial crisis erupted.

Commercial real-estate loans are the second-largest loan type after home mortgages. More than half of the $3.4 trillion in outstanding commercial real-estate debt is held by banks.

The Fed presentation states that the most "toxic" loans on bank books are so-called interest-only loans, which require borrowers to repay interest but no principal. Those loans "get no benefit from amortization," the report states.

"Today, most of the borrowers are paying because interest rates are so low, but the question is whether the loans will get paid off when they come due," said Michael Straneva, global head of Ernst &Young's transaction real-estate practice.

Regulators are zeroing in on banks that use interest reserves to mask bad construction loans. When such loans are made, banks typically calculate interest that would be paid and set that money aside, basically paying themselves until the loan becomes due or the property generates cash flow.

Regulators want to make sure banks don't have a false sense of security only because the interest reserve is paying the loan. Banks need to look at "the sources of repayment" to determine whether the loan will get repaid, says Darryle Rude, supervisor of industrial banks at the Utah Department of Financial Institutions.

According to Foresight Analytics, more than 40 U.S. banks have been hit this year with enforcement actions by regulators that include alleged misuse of interest reserves.

Some banks with unusually low levels of loan-loss reserves based on the Journal analysis said those figures reflect their decision to aggressively write off hopeless loans. "We've tried to both build up our charge-offs and reserves," says David Shearrow, chief risk officer of United Community Banks Inc. About 80% of the Blairsville, Ga., bank's problem loans have been charged down to a level where the bank thinks it can sell them.

Deal of the Week: New Order: No Money, No Problem

By Maura Webber Sadovi

A Birmingham, Ala., office building has sold for about $147 million, in what is being billed as the largest office-building deal in the Southeast this year. But what is particularly notable about the transaction is how little cash the buyer had to put into it: $1.3 million.

The buyers -- a group that included Rainier Capital Management, a private Dallas real-estate firm; Net Lease Capital Advisors of Nashua, N.H.; and Ray Gee, an investor in Charlotte, N.C. -- purchased the 587,528-square-foot Social Security Administration Center in Birmingham from Opus South Corp. of Atlanta, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April.

To acquire the building, the Rainier group assumed a $140.7 million mortgage on the property held by Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of Aegon Group of the Netherlands, according to Doug Blough, chief financial officer of Net Lease Capital Advisors. It also paid the lender about $1.3 million in cash and issued Aegon a $5 million mezzanine note. Aegon declined to comment on the transaction.

The deal sheds light on a critical factor that is quietly fueling the few transactions that are getting to the closing table these days despite the dearth of new financing: assumable debt.

But the buyers also took other steps to sweeten the deal for Aegon. For example, they bought an insurance policy from HCC Insurance Holdings Inc. that guarantees a $47 million balloon payment on the Aegon mortgage will be paid when it comes due in about 19 years. They paid for that policy with an additional $10 million mezzanine note on the property. "This is what you need to do because there's no cash available," Mr. Blough says. HCC couldn't be reached for comment.

The buyers are in turn selling stakes in the building to investors looking for a so-called 1031-exchange transaction, named for a section of the U.S. tax code, that lets investors delay capital-gains taxes on proceeds from recently sold property by reinvesting in new property.

The transaction represents the highest total price paid for an office building in the southeastern U.S. so far this year, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York real-estate research firm. At $250 a square foot, it is also the highest per-square-foot price paid for a Birmingham office property since 2001, topping the previous mark of $217 set in March 2008, says Real Capital. The property is expected to produce an annual return of about 7.7% before debt but after expenses, people familiar with the deal said.

Besides assumable financing, the Birmingham building also was attractive to the buyers because it is fully occupied through a 20-year lease signed with a creditworthy tenant: the U.S. General Services Administration. The Social Security Administration, which operates regional payment and training centers at the site, is set to remain in the property through 2028.

Opus South is one of several regional operating companies of Opus Corp., a merchant builder based in Minnetonka, Minn., and until recently one of the largest private real-estate developers in the nation. Its business model of constructing buildings to be leased and sold got caught in the credit crunch, leaving Opus with short-term debt it couldn't refinance and dozens of projects it couldn't sell. An Opus spokeswoman said the sale is part of its plan to close Opus South's operations.

Opus began marketing the Birmingham building more than a year ago when it was in discussions to sell it for a price in the $160 million range, people close to the transaction say. Jay O'Meara, a senior vice president with CB Richard Ellis who represented Transamerica in the transaction, says more than 20 bidders were interested in the property after Opus filed for bankruptcy.

IPO Focus: Two IPOs to top $1 billion this week --- Santander Brasil may be among largest in world for 2009

This week heralds the arrival of two new stock offerings in the U.S. that should top the billion-dollar mark, with Brazil's fourth-largest bank and America's largest property-and-casualty insurance-data specialist aiming to debut.

Banco Santander Brasil SA, which is being carved out of Spain's Banco Santander SA, is holding a global stock offering that could top $7 billion, making it one of the world's largest this year. Verisk Analytics Inc., owned by a group of large insurers, is selling $1.7 billion in a U.S.-only deal. Both plan to launch Wednesday, with Verisk listing on the Nasdaq under the trading symbol VRSK, and Banco Santander Brasil doing a dual listing on the New York Stock Exchange as BSBR and on the Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias e Futuros as SANB11.

"These are two really unique deals," says Francis Gaskins, president of research firm IPOdesktop.com. The potential for banks to grow in emerging markets like Brazil is a draw for investors, and Verisk's strong cash flow and dominant position in its data and analytics niche should prove also attractive, he said.

Banco Santander Brasil's deal isn't technically an IPO -- the bank has a thin public float of 2% of its common shares in Brazil -- but the public sale of 15% of the company is being dubbed an IPO by many analysts and bankers because it is the first time a real trading market can be made in its shares.

By almost every measure, Banco Santander Brasil has been growing during the rough world economic climate, due in part to its acquisition of Banco Real in August 2008 and organic growth from pre-existing operations. Assets, customers, total deposits and profits rose in 2008 and again in the first half of 2009.

Morningstar Inc. analyst Maclovio Pina put a fair value of $13 per American depositary receipt on Banco Santander Brasil, roughly the midpoint of its expected range. In a research note, he said the country will "provide lush grounds" for the bank to grow despite some short-term challenges. While the Brazilian economy seems to have stabilized, near-term growth could be difficult and nonperforming loans are still on the rise, he noted.

Verisk, which was formed in 1971 as an advisory and ratings organization for the property- and casualty-insurance industry, has grown to become the largest aggregator of actuarial and underwriting data for that insurance segment. All the shares in its deal are being sold by its owners, a group of insurers that includes American International Group Inc., London-based ACE Group Holdings Inc., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. and Travelers Cos.

Verisk also provides statistical models and analytics to help detect fraud and quantify losses. Its revenue and net income have increased steadily in recent years, including through the economic downturn.

Deal of the Week: Apartment Know-How in NoHo?

By Maura Webber Sadovi

About two years ago, the owner of the Gallery at NoHo Commons was close to selling the apartment complex in the North Hollywood section of Los Angeles for more than $140 million, a person familiar with the matter said.

Now, the 438-unit complex has sold for $96 million.

The deal is a sign of the drop in values in the multifamily sector which has seen vacancy rates rise as cost-conscious renters have doubled-up or moved in with family members. Sales of apartment complexes nationwide have slowed to a trickle. Some $27 billion in apartment buildings traded in 2008 compared with $55 billion in 2007, according to Reis Inc., a New York real-estate research firm, based on a survey of transactions valued at $2 million or greater. Through the second quarter of this year, there has been less than $5 billion in deals.

But some investors have stayed behind as others have fled the sector and the sale of NoHo Commons gives a glimpse into their thinking. It was purchased by a nontraded real-estate investment trust managed by Behringer Harvard, a Dallas real-estate company. Behringer has become one of the biggest buyers of U.S. multifamily properties this year, buying five apartment complexes with 1,690 units for a total of about $274 million in cash and assumed debt.

Behringer executives say they see opportunity in the downdraft, which has sent U.S. apartment prices from $113,000 in the third quarter of 2008, to $80,000 in the second quarter, Reis says. "Properties of a very high quality are available at pricing that really wasn't available a few years ago," says Jason Mattox, chief administrative officer at Behringer.

Behringer Harvard was formed in 2001 by Robert Behringer, 61 years old, who worked for a large pension-fund adviser before he started two real-estate companies that became predecessors to Behringer. Behringer now has about $8 billion in assets under management through its various nontraded REITs as well as through some private partnerships and other affiliates, according to Robert Aisner, president and co-chief operating officer of Behringer Harvard.

The portfolio hasn't been immune to the downturn. For example, a Dallas condominium development by a Behringer-affiliated partnership converted the condo units to rentals about six months ago after they failed to sell quickly, Mr. Aisner says.

Behringer is able to go on a buying spree partly because it has been able to raise capital. Through early September, Behringer Harvard Multifamily REIT has raised about $249.2 million from a public offering begun in September 2008. It also has raised money in a private offering as well as about $200 million from Dutch pension fund PGGM. It also is taking advantage of financing still available for apartment acquisitions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.

Mr. Aisner says Behringer seeks to finance as much as 60% of the cost of its acquisitions, and will likely look to one of the housing-finance giants for a mortgage on the NoHo Commons complex for which it originally paid cash.

Apartment buildings are clearly producing higher returns than they used to. In 2007, the so-called capitalization rates of apartment buildings, derived by dividing a building's net operating income by the price paid, were 5.8%. Today they have risen to 7.1%, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York real-estate research firm.

The NoHo apartment complex, which offers such amenities as a pool, fitness center and a room that it bills as a recording studio, fetches monthly rents in the $2,400 range for a two-bedroom unit and has an occupancy rate of 91%.

The apartment property was attractive because if it is financed it could ultimately throw off a rate of return of more than 8%, says Herb Chase, managing director of Multi Housing Capital Advisors who represented the seller in the Los Angeles complex sale. Opportunities for such higher returns in apartments have begun to attract some investors who previously retreated to other perceived safer investments such as Treasury bonds after the recession hit. "Everybody was scared but people are less scared now," Mr. Chase says.

To be sure, the outlook for apartment properties is likely to get worse before it gets better. U.S. apartment vacancies are expected to peak next year at 8.1%, a 30-year high, according to Reis. It could sour further if the economy worsens and rents and occupancy rates continue to fall.

But some people think a recovery for apartments is likely in 2011. If the job market stabilizes in 2010, younger workers are likely to be the first to be hired back because they are cheaper to employ, the theory goes. Since many of those people are renters, that is going to drive the apartment recovery, says Victor Calanog, director of research for Reis.

China firm's German IPO to end Europe's dry spell

MADRID -- Banks, private-equity houses and investors in Europe will be paying close attention this week to see how a Chinese wireless company fares on Germany's primary stock exchange, the first new listing in more than a year.

Chinese mobile data-card manufacturer Vtion Wireless Technology AG will issue up to 4.5 million shares on the Deutsche Boerse on Thursday, after canceling an initial public offering last November. The last company to list on the primary market was SMA Solar Technology in June 2008, just as global financial markets began to melt down and the business for new listings went into a deep freeze.

China has led a recent global thaw, offering up the world's biggest IPO this year with a heavily oversubscribed $7.3 billion listing from China State Construction in July.

In two weeks, insurance-industry risk specialist Verisk Analytics Inc. will seek to raise $1.79 billion in the biggest U.S. IPO in more than a year, while Australia will test its market with department-store operator Myer Group Pty. Ltd.'s $2.15 billion listing later this year.

Europe's thaw has been hampered by the view that its recovery will lag behind the rest of the world's. But a rebound in financial markets, with the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 up 22% since the start of the year, has prompted private-equity houses, many eager to lighten their portfolios, as well as individual companies to begin approaching banks with proposals.

"It's been a long dry spell in IPOs, but it looks like it's gradually coming to an end," said Christian Steffens, head of equity capital markets at UniCredit in London. "The advice we and most other banks are giving private-equity firms is 'get ready to take advantage of the market opportunity.'"

While he would classify Vtion as a fairly small transaction that may not "be the swallow that makes the summer," Mr. Steffens said there has been a notable pickup in equity capital markets.

"What you've seen in Europe is really the rights issues to shore up the balance sheet, then moving into secondary placings again. Given that people have seen all these rights issues successfully placed, it's built up the confidence with investors as well as the companies and the banks," he said.

A rights issue is the sale of discounted shares to existing investors by a company in the market to raise capital, often viewed as the first step in the recovery of IPO markets.

UniCredit is helping to market a 336 million euro ($493 million) rights issue for Austrian brick-making giant Wienerberger AG. "That gives a pretty good indication because the construction and materials sector is viewed as cyclical," Mr. Steffens said.

UniCredit is also working on the 1 billion euros IPO of PGE, the largest utility in Poland.

David Hussey, London-based head of pan-European equities at MFC Global Investment Management, said his company had one small IPO pitched to it recently, the first in a long time, and have participated in several rights offerings.

According to Renaissance Capital, a Greenwich, Conn.-based IPO research firm, just two companies have listed in Europe this year, Max Property in London and a Polish coal company, raising a collective $500 million.

Renaissance counts only companies with market capitalization of at least $100 million.

Europe's slice of the global IPO market is small; world-wide, $33.8 billion has been raised this year.

In 2008, there were 25 European IPOs, which raised $14.7 billion, a far cry from the 178 companies that went to market in 2007 raising $93.1 billion. The global IPO market raised $258.5 billion in 2007 and $80.8 billion in 2008.

Eric Guja, research analyst at Renaissance, said the IPO market in Europe isn't as strong as elsewhere. "Eventually, they'll come back in Europe, but will probably lag the others [U.S. and Asia]."

Said MFC's Mr. Hussey, "I think it's very different in Western markets, which are much tougher than Asian markets, where you're offering new companies that haven't been owned before. It's an exciting time for Asia, and there's huge pent-up demand from retail investors and institutions to get into these opportunities.

"Over here, IPOs are most likely to come out of venture capital, where they kind of have to sell. That's less of an interesting opportunity. We're more focused on what is the price being offered. Is it a good discount to what we think is the value of the franchise?" he said.

Several European IPO possibilities have been circulating. U.K. insurer Aviva PLC has said that its Dutch insurance division Delta Lloyd will be spun off. According to reports, the listing may come in October and $1.4 billion of shares will be sold.

From Germany, chemical distributor Brenntag GmbH is rumored to be planning a $2.2 billion listing for the first half of 2010, expected to be the country's biggest IPO in years. A spokesman from Brenntag said that the company is owned by a private-equity firm, BC Partners Ltd., which may consider selling it sometime in the future, but couldn't give any details on a formal exit plan.

German builder Hochtief AG would neither confirm nor deny talk of a $3.1 billion listing of its airports division, possibly by the end of the year.

SmartMoney; Status Report: Small-Business Lending

Small-business loans are up at many of the nation's lenders, but business isn't exactly humming, and growing apprehension about commercial lending could leave a substantial number of firms without a source of capital.

The recent increase in lending has been clear. JPMorgan Chase, the parent company of Chase Bank and Washington Mutual, said it issued about $1.5 billion in loans to 4,177 small businesses with revenues up to $10 million during the second quarter, up 32% over the first quarter. Over the same period, Regions Financial said it issued or renewed $2 billion in loan commitments to small-business clients, a 31% hike over the first quarter.

Further, the country's top 22 banks receiving capital injections from the U.S. government collectively reported more of the same. Although the total outstanding balance of small-business loans fell 1% in June, the total number of small-business loan originations surged 26% over a month earlier, according to the Treasury's latest monthly bank lending survey.

Some lenders are newly bullish about issuing loans to small businesses because of a slight uptick in demand and the apparent success of the Small Business Administration's move to lift its flagship 7(a) loan guarantee to 90%, up from 75% or 85%.

"The SBA programs help you out with newer businesses or businesses that don't have a lot of collateral," says Maria C. Coyne, executive vice president of KeyBank who also noted an increase in demand for loans.

Still, lending isn't what it used to be. "In terms of our [current] lending pipeline, what we're seeing now in lending demand is 60% of what we'd expect in a normal lending environment," says John Asbury, the executive vice president of business services at Regions Financial. That's up from loan levels of less than 50%, which the bank logged in December of last year. But it's hardly back to normal, he says.

Firms holding their expansion plans in check may have a good reason, says Bob Coleman, a small business banking analyst in La Canada, Calif. "We're still in a recession," he says. "We're not talking Armageddon here, but it will [likely] remain tough for businesses to get loans," says Coleman.

The root of the problem is a lack solid private backing for small-business loans. One example is the disparate markets for the two components of 504 loans, which business owners use to purchase real estate and equipment. Although the secondary market for 504 debentures (the 40% stake of each of these loans that is guaranteed by the government) is flowing relatively freely, there is no secondary market for 504 first mortgages (the 50% stake made by private lenders), Coleman says. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the SBA was instructed to take steps that would establish a secondary market for these first mortgages, says Jonathan Swain, a SBA spokesman. "We are currently in the process of finalizing the regulations for that piece of the Recovery Act," he says.

Still, Coleman insists that the SBA is dragging its feet. Through the program, the Treasury would purchase mortgages if no other buyers step forward. Assurance of a buyer might drive banks to continue issuing 504 loans. Without that guarantee, banks could remain wary about issuing such loans, as many analysts expect the market for commercial loans to be the next shoe to drop, he says. Already, there are about $135 billion in defaulted commercial mortgages, a figure that has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, according to Real Capital Analytics, a firm that tracks commercial property sales.

Small-business advocates also worry about what will happen once the $375 million set aside by the SBA to temporarily eliminate loan fees and increase the agency's loan guarantee to 90% for 7(a) and 504 loan programs runs out. SBA-backed loans are expected to revert to their pre-Recovery Act status by the end of November or December, according to the SBA.

In addition, lending terms are still tight. According to the Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, 35% of domestic banks said they tightened credit for small firms in July, down slightly from more than 40% in April. And as many business owners have seen their credit scores slide, they've lost some of their ability to qualify for loans.

The steady stream of regional bank failures isn't helping either. Since last September, 108 banks have shuttered, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Many other banks have been bought out. For borrowers, industry consolidation means that there are fewer lenders to approach for loans, which can limit a company's ability to attract funding.

When PNC Financial Services Group acquired National City Corp. last December, John Snyder, a senior business consultant at Gannon University's Small Business Development Center in Erie, Pa., said his clients were left with few alternatives. "National City was always the biggest SBA lender in the area," he says. "Now that they've mostly been absorbed by PNC, they aren't [necessarily] willing to do SBA loans for start-ups," Snyder says. (According to PNC spokeswoman Meghan Cole, the bank does lend to start-ups   under the right circumstances, such as to those with an experienced manager or owner.)

U.S. News: Delayed Foreclosures Stalk Market

Debra and Arthur Scriven were served notice in June 2008 that their mortgage lender, a unit of Citigroup Inc., was preparing to foreclose on their home. Fifteen months later, the Scrivens are still in their home near Columbia, S.C., and battling to stay there, even though a dispute with the lender over how much they owe prompted them to stop making regular payments last year.

Legal snarls, bureaucracy and well-meaning efforts to keep families in their homes are slowing the flow of properties headed toward foreclosure sales, even when borrowers are in deep distress. While that buys time for families to work out their problems, some analysts believe the delays are prolonging the mortgage crisis and creating a growing "shadow" inventory of pent-up supply that will eventually hit the market.

The size of this shadow inventory is a source of concern and debate among real-estate agents and analysts who worry that when the supply is unleashed, it could interrupt the budding housing recovery and ignite a new wave of stress in the housing market.

"There's going to be a flood [of bank-owned homes] listed for sale at some point," says John Burns, a real-estate consultant based in Irvine, Calif. When that happens, Mr. Burns believes, home prices will fall further, particularly in markets with large numbers of foreclosures. Overall, he expects home prices to decline 6% next year.

Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &Associates, a research firm based in Cleveland, believes three million to four million foreclosed homes will be put up for sale in the next few years. The question is whether the flow of these homes onto the market will resemble "a fire hose or a garden hose or a drip," she says.

Analysts who track the shadow market have focused primarily on the gap between the number of seriously delinquent loans and the number of foreclosed homes for sale by mortgage companies. A loan is considered seriously delinquent, which typically means it is headed to foreclosure, if it is 90 days or more past due.

As of July, mortgage companies hadn't begun the foreclosure process on 1.2 million loans that were at least 90 days past due, according to estimates prepared for The Wall Street Journal by LPS Applied Analytics, which collects and analyzes mortgage data. An additional 1.5 million seriously delinquent loans were somewhere in the foreclosure process, though the lender hadn't yet acquired the property. The figures don't include home-equity loans and other second mortgages

Moreover, there were 217,000 loans in July where the borrower hadn't made a payment in at least a year but the lender hadn't begun the foreclosure process. In other words, 17% of home mortgages that are at least 12 months overdue aren't in foreclosure, up from 8% a year earlier.

Some borrowers may be able to catch up on their payments or receive a loan modification that helps them keep their home. There has also been an increase in short-sales, transactions in which at-risk borrowers sell their homes for less than the loan amount, with the lender's approval. In some cases, lenders have decided not to foreclose because the home's value is so low. These factors could mean fewer foreclosures.

Foreclosed homes are partly responsible for the recent increase in home sales. But foreclosures also push down home values. According to Collateral Analytics, a housing research firm, homes that have been foreclosed on typically sell at a 10% to 50% discount.

For now, the delays have led to what is probably a temporary drop in the supply of bank-owned homes in California and other places where investors and first-time home buyers have been competing for bargains. In Orange County, Calif., the number of bank-owned homes listed for sale dropped to 322 in early September from 1,404 in November 2008, according to Altera Real Estate.

But the number of foreclosures is expected to increase in the fourth quarter as mortgage-servicing companies determine who is eligible for a loan modification and who isn't. "We are going to see a spike from now to the end of the year in foreclosures as we take people out of the running" for a loan modification or other alternatives, says a Bank of America Corp. spokeswoman. Foreclosure sales had dropped to "abnormally low" levels in response to government efforts to stem foreclosures, she adds.

For the Scrivens, legal battles have complicated the process. Ms. Scrivens says Citigroup recently offered to modify their loan, but she and her husband rejected the offer because they objected to some of the conditions. A hearing on the foreclosure case is scheduled for Wednesday in a Kershaw County, S.C., court.

Citing customer privacy, a Citigroup spokesman declined to comment specifically on the Scrivens situation. "Our priority goal is to keep distressed borrowers in their homes and out of foreclosure, when possible," he said.

Buyout Fund Contemplates a REIT Turn

Richard Baker, a big investor in shopping centers and retailers, raised $400 million in 2007 for a "blank-check company" that would buy operating businesses like restaurants and casinos. But he didn't do a deal as the economy fell off a cliff.

Now he has another strategy that is being watched closely in the real-estate industry. Instead of returning the money -- which he would be required to do soon if he didn't spend it -- Mr. Baker wants to convert the company, named NRDC Acquisition Corp., into a public real-estate investment trust. The new company, named Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., would be geared toward buying retail properties from distressed owners.

The move is the latest sign real-estate investors are looking to the public markets for capital at a time banks are reluctant to lend and private capital is scarce. The strategy has paid off for many. Investors have bought more than $15 billion in REIT secondary stock sales so far this year.

Several companies have completed initial public offerings to raise money to invest in distressed real-estate debt, including Starwood Capital Group LLC's $810 million IPO last month. But Mr. Baker's attempt is different from these "mortgage REITs" because he would focus on buying actual properties -- specifically, supermarket-anchored strip shopping centers on the East and West coasts of the U.S. -- rather than the debt behind them.

If successful, Mr. Baker's attempt could set the stage for other companies to ask stock-market investors to fund blind pools for investing in shopping centers, warehouses, office buildings and other kinds of commercial real estate whose owners face loan defaults.

The NRDC conversion is subject to a tight deadline and a shareholder vote. But some analysts and investors have signaled an interest in the company.

To attract investors, Mr. Baker brought on Stuart Tanz, the former chief executive of strip-center landlord Pan Pacific Retail Properties Inc., to run the proposed REIT. Mr. Tanz sold Pan Pacific to Kimco Realty Corp. in late 2006, near the peak of the market.

NRDC is currently a special-purpose acquisition corporation, or SPAC, also known as a blank-check company. It was among a slew of SPACs formed during the finance boom to buy operating companies within a certain time frame, usually two years, using money raised in the public market. A majority of shareholders have to approve any deals. NRDC must return its shareholders' investment next month if it doesn't get a deal done, prompting the push to convert to a REIT before then.

Blind-pool REITs have rarely been tested, in large part because investors have to put a lot of faith in the acumen of the management team. "It just takes a huge leap of trust," says Yaacov Gross, an attorney who specializes in REITs in the New York office of law firm Morrison &Foerster LLP. "Unless you're doing it with a very, very highly regarded sponsor, it's very hard for me to see why an institutional investor would make that leap and give somebody permanent capital."

Mr. Baker and his father run National Realty &Development Corp., which owns 22 million square feet of shopping centers, corporate centers and residential communities. Mr. Baker is also president of NRDC Equity Partners LLC, a private-equity firm that has invested in retailers Hudson's Bay Co., Lord &Taylor and now-bankrupt Linens 'N Things.

An NRDC spokeswoman said its executives can't comment publicly ahead of the shareholder vote next month. But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, NRDC says the new REIT would seek to buy neighborhood shopping centers anchored by supermarkets or drugstores -- "necessity-based" properties that would fare better than other shopping centers if consumers continue to cut back on luxuries.

Green Street Advisors, a real-estate research firm, expressed support for the strategy in a note to clients last week. One-fifth of all U.S. strip-center properties changed hands during the asset-price bubble of 2004 to 2007, Green Street noted, citing Real Capital Analytics data, amounting to a total sales volume of $125 billion. That could mean distress sales ahead as the big loans required to do those deals come due.

Michael Tew, a partner at SPAC Research Partners, says real-estate deals are looking increasingly attractive to blank-check companies. At least two SPACs -- Capitol Acquisition Corp. and Enterprise Acquisition Corp. -- have announced plans to form or merge with mortgage REITs.

"A year and a half ago, looking at a Brazilian biodiesel company might have been attractive, but right now the most attractive space to play is in financial services and REITs," Mr. Tew said of SPACs. "There's a reason they're announcing REIT deals -- it's because that's where the capital is."

Deal of the Week: Lost a Thrift, Gained an Adviser

By Maura Webber Sadovi

Nearly one year after Seattle was rocked by the largest bank failure in U.S. history, the city has gotten a consolation prize.

While many office towers are languishing on the market nationwide for lack of credit and buyers, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Milwaukee has stepped up and paid J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. $115 million in cash for most of the largely empty 42-story office complex that once housed the headquarters of Washington Mutual Inc., the collapsed Seattle thrift.

Northwestern also will usher a new employer into the Emerald City.

Russell Investments, the investment-management firm known for its widely used stock indexes and a Northwestern subsidiary, will relocate its headquarters from Tacoma, Wash., next year. Russell, a company that Tacoma fought to keep, is expected to occupy about 300,000 square feet in the complex at 1301 Second Ave. It is a short walk from Pike Place Market, a favorite tourist hangout.

The former WaMu Center building -- designed by NBBJ, which also designed the new Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters -- will be renamed the Russell Investments Center.

"It's outstanding for the city of Seattle to have someone who has invested in real estate in such a down market," says Tim Ceis, the city's deputy mayor. "It's a shot in the arm both psychologically as well as financially."

The city also has a direct stake in the building's future.

Completed in 2006, the WaMu tower was built next to the Seattle Art Museum. A spokeswoman for the art museum says it built and expanded its museum space into part of a second, lower tower that is adjacent to the former WaMu Center. The museum owns the bottom 12 floors of the tower, of which it previously leased about 240,000 square feet to WaMu.

The space that had been leased by WaMu was financed with about $60 million in city-guaranteed bonds, Mr. Ceis says.

J.P. Morgan, which acquired the WaMu Center building as part of its $1.9 billion acquisition of WaMu's banking operations, didn't try to lease the space because it wanted to sell the building, he says.

Now the city hopes Northwestern will crank up the marketing program.

Northwestern appears to have gotten a bargain compared with what the property would have fetched in recent years.

At roughly $133 a square foot, Northwestern paid less than half the average price of about $320 a square foot fetched by larger Seattle area office properties near the market peak in 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York real-estate research firm.

Northwestern, with a real-estate equity portfolio valued at about $5.8 billion in June, said the acquisition is one of its first major purchases this year. Tom Zale, managing director of real estate for Northwestern, says the lower cost of buying the asset will give the company some breathing room to beef up the property's bottom line. However, he said the long-term prognosis for the Seattle market is very promising.

The short-term outlook, though, isn't that great.

Second-quarter vacancies in the city rose to 20.4%, well above the Seattle metrowide average of 17.4%, according to Property &Portfolio Research Inc.

Part of the problem: J.P. Morgan's decision late last year to return about 975,000 square feet of leased space to landlords, in WaMu's former headquarters complex and other locations.

Craig Kinzer, president of Kinzer Real Estate Services, which led Russell's site search, said Russell began considering the building last fall.

When James Dimon, chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, visited Seattle last year, Mr. Ceis recalls asking Mr. Dimon to take the city and museum's interest in the property into consideration.

A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan declined to comment on the meeting.

Mr. Kinzer says J.P. Morgan subsequently negotiated with Russell for months without putting the complex officially on the market.

"You have a city reeling from the loss of WaMu and J.P. Morgan Chase saying, 'What can we do to help you as long as we get a market price?"' Mr. Kinzer says.

In the end, Mr. Kinzer says, Northwestern "bought it empty and added value the day it closed."

Corus Bank Is the Latest To Be Seized By Regulators

Federal regulators seized Chicago- based Corus Bank on Friday, bringing to 91 the total failures this year and marking one of the first banks to be undone by deteriorating construction and commercial real-estate loans during the downturn.

The branches and deposits of Corus will be assumed by MB Financial Inc., which has more than $8 billion in assets and over 70 branches in Chicago and its suburbs. Corus, with 11 branches and an active online certificates of deposit business, had $6.6 billion in deposits as of the end of August.

Corus, which was owned by holding company Corus Bankshares Inc., concentrated heavily on condo construction lending in South Florida and other housing markets that are now struggling. More than half of the bank's$3.9 billion in condo construction loans were in nonaccrual or foreclosure in April.

The status of Corus's prize assets remains unclear. The company's delinquent condominium loans backed by 111 developments will likely be sold by the FDIC in coming weeks. A number of real-estate companies and private- equity firms have been vying to take those assets over in recent months.

Among those in competition for the condo assets is a venture of Related Cos., Lubert-Adler Partners LP and other investors; a venture of Miami-based developer Crescent Heights and Dallas-based investor Lone Star Funds; Colony Capital LLC and iStar Financial Inc. and Starwood Capital Group.

Corus will cost the government between $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion in losses, depending on the performance of the bank's outstanding loans, according to estimates by Foresight Analytics.

Corus's failure is the latest sign that banks, particularly small and midsize regional lenders, face a new round of pain beyond deteriorating home mortgages. Construction loans accounted for 88% of Corus's outstanding loans at the end of the first quarter, the largest share among any U.S. bank with more than $100 million in loans, according to Foresight Analytics.

Other commercial real-estate sectors are also beginning to get clobbered by the recession as evidenced by the bankruptcy filings by General Growth Properties Inc. and Extended Stay Hotels. Commercial real-estate loans could trigger an additional $100 billion in losses at more than 900 small and midsize banks if the economy deteriorates further, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal conducted earlier this year.

Corus's failure doesn't come as a big surprise. Federal regulators imposed higher reserve requirements in February, giving the condo lender until mid-June to raise cash or find a buyer. But the bank's sale dragged out as bidders worked over how to value the bank's sprawling condo assets.

Many of the company's top managers have departed over the past year, including Robert Glickman, the company's longtime chief executive whose father bought the small Minnesota lender in 1966. Mr. Glickman and his father, who last year held about half of the company's stock, have steadily sold most of their shares for pennies on the dollar since leaving the company in April.

Corus shifted from a student-loan and mortgage-loan firm 10 years ago, aggressively ramping up its commercial real-estate lending, first on hotels and office buildings, and later on condos. Even as other lenders pulled back in 2006 and 2007 amid worries about a bubble, Corus plunged ahead.

Many investors questioned that strategy and made bets that a condo bubble would burst by shorting Corus's stock.

Separately, regulators have shut Brickwell Community Bank in Brickwell, Minn. Brickwell's deposits will be assumed by CorTrust Bank, based in Mitchell, S.D. Its branches will reopen Saturday as offices of CorTrust Bank.

U.S. News: Mortgage-Aid Plan Gets Tepid Results

Just 12% of eligible borrowers have started trial loan modifications under the Obama administration's $75 billion mortgage foreclosure prevention plan, according to a Treasury report released Wednesday.

The latest data come amid increasing concern that the effort, which relies on hefty government incentives for lenders and borrowers, won't be enough to effectively combat mounting foreclosures across the country.

Under the program, eligible borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments or are at risk of imminent default can get their payments reduced during a trial period. Borrowers must typically be current on their payments in the trial program after three months and meet documentation requirements to qualify for a reworked mortgage.

There are growing questions about how many borrowers who receive trial modifications will ultimately get their loans reworked.

"I think they will be lucky to get 50% [of the trial modifications] to turn into real modifications," says Bob Caruso, executive vice president for strategy with Lender Processing Services Inc., a provider of mortgage technology, data and analytics.

The administration, which announced the program in February, has said it expects as many as four million borrowers to begin trial modifications. So far, more than 570,000 trial modifications have been offered to borrowers under the program and about 360,000 trial modifications are under way, the Treasury reported.

Nearly one in 12 borrowers are at least 90 days past due on their mortgage or are in foreclosure, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported last month.

Among large mortgage servicers, Wells Fargo &Co. and Bank of America Corp. have started trial modifications for 11% and 7%, respectively, of their eligible borrowers who are at least 60 days past due.

Cara Heiden, co-president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said the company increased the number of trial modifications by 64% in August. Bank of America Credit Loss Mitigation Strategies Executive Jack Schakett said the Treasury's figures don't include modifications done outside of the administration's program.

J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. has started trial modifications for 25% of eligible borrowers, and Citigroup Inc. 23%.

In an interview Wednesday, Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Barr called the program "highly effective" and predicted it will meet its goals.

But in a congressional hearing Wednesday, House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank (D., Mass.) said he is disappointed at the pace of the program. He threatened to revive a measure to allow bankruptcy judges to rework the terms of troubled mortgages if servicers didn't improve their efforts.

Mr. Schakett said about 15% of borrowers who begin trial modifications aren't likely to be able to make three payments during the trial period as required. The "big wild card," he said, is how many people won't receive a modification because they haven't provided the required documentation.

Mortgage-servicing companies say they are often beginning trial modifications based on verbal information from the borrower.

Some borrowers aren't providing the required information or their documents don't match the information provided verbally, said Michael Brauneis, director of regulatory risk consulting at Protiviti Inc. Some borrowers complain that mortgage companies often misplace documents they send in.

The Property Report: Investment picks up for French property --- Demand is driven by global investors as deal levels double

LONDON -- International commercial-property investors looking for prime assets are beginning to target France, which is emerging as the second-most popular market after the U.K.

The French investment market, which was static in the first quarter after almost two years of declines in activity, now seems to be moving again. Investment levels doubled in the second quarter, the biggest increase for that period in Europe, according to Aberdeen Property Investors.

There were three retail deals in the second quarter valued at more than 100 million euros ($143.4 million), including Hennes &Mauritz AB's April purchase of 31 Rue du Faubourg Honore from Unibail-Rodamco SA for 103.3 million euros, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Increased activity continued into the third quarter. In August, Deka Immobilien Investment GmbH closed on its purchase of office property Le Triangle Part Dieu in Lyon from ING Real Estate for 40 million euros. Also, GLL Real Estate Partners bought 10 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris for 50.1 million euros from AXA REIM, and Commerz Real bought the Espace Dumont d'Urville office asset in Paris from Klepierre SA for 32.7 million euros, according to Real Capital Analytics. All three properties are 100% occupied.

"Nine out of 10 investors we meet cite France as a top-three target country, alongside U.K. and Germany," said Giles Wilcox, head of real-estate adviser Savills PLC's European cross-border investment.

To be sure, French commercial property has been hurt along with the market in the rest of Europe by the lack of debt financing, which caused declines in values and damped sales. The 2.6 billion euros invested in the first half represents about 37% of what was invested in the same period last year. Investors paid 13 billion euros for French commercial property in all of 2008 and 28.6 billion euros the previous year, according to property adviser Cushman &Wakefield.

But France has held up better than many other markets in Europe. While the U.K property capital returns fell 26% last year, capital returns in France fell only about 6%, according to the Investment Property Databank Index.

London is attracting investors partly because of its decline in prices. But Paris, a favorite area within France, is becoming more popular as well because of its historic lack of volatility and because it doesn't rely on financial-services companies. Its tenant mix includes manufacturing, communication, and transportation and logistics companies. As a result, rental declines weren't as severe as in other European cities.

The city also has fewer properties with excessive debt levels, meaning there likely will be less distress in that market and fewer landlords willing to cut rents. Jones Lang LaSalle forecasts that investment activity in Ile-de-France will reach between 4 billion euros and 5 billion euros at the end of 2009, although most will come from Paris.

A large part of the demand for French property is coming from international investors, who were on the sidelines during the first quarter, accounting for only 7.2% of total investment in France. Deals picked up in the second quarter, accounting for about 46% of the 1.37 billion euros total, according to data from Cushman &Wakefield. German buyers are particularly active, especially open- and closed-end funds. Savills has seen an increase in German investor share to 20% of the French market in the first half from 14% in 2008.

While investors can get debt, the underlying assets have to provide stable incomes, such as long leases and secure tenants, and buyers must be able to show the ability to service the debt.

French property also is expected to see increased demand if financing markets loosen up. But lending terms remain prudent, with investors able to borrow up to only 60% of the value of certain properties, much less than they were able to borrow during the boom years, at margins of two percentage points for up to five years. To grease the skids, some sellers are providing financing and some vendors are buying with large amounts of equity and refinancing later, said Mr. Wilcox.

Until recently, most European institutions were limiting commercial real-estate loans to 10 million euros to 20 million euros. But lately, some are willing to put up as much as 100 million euros, although they remain a minority, according to Justin O'Connor, chief executive of Cordea Savills, a fund manager that has 2.5 billion euros of assets under management.

Lessons learned from the financial crisis --- Asset managers say cost cutting, low debt helped

ANYONE COMING BACK from their summer vacation this time two years ago couldn't miss that the financial markets had entered a state of crisis.

After last year's summer break, it was even worse. U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in mid-September and stock markets fell 30% within a month. They have yet to recover their former highs.

As the crisis raged, most asset-management companies were forced to cut costs as management fees fell and clients switched their money into safer investments. William Hutchings interviewed five managers to find out how they coped.

Could your company have been better prepared for the financial crisis?

Martin Gilbert

Aberdeen Asset Managers

One thing we should have done differently is to have implemented our cost-savings program sooner.

The transformational acquisition of Credit Suisse [Aberdeen agreed to buy some asset-management operations from Credit Suisse Group at the turn of the year] together with the business and capital alliance we agreed with Mitsubishi provided us with significant, long-term shareholders.

Andrew Formica

Henderson Global Investors

You would have hoped the diversity of our business would provide protection, but with all asset classes performing poorly last year, there was little area to hide for clients. We were fortunate we had already taken strong cost action from early 2008, as we had a cautious view on the outlook, though the outturn was far worse than we had predicted.

We have always had a prudent approach to debt. It allowed us to acquire New Star Asset Management, a deal that has exceeded our expectations.

James Barham

River and Mercantile Asset Management

River and Mercantile started trading in late 2006. The key elements of fund management, distribution and, critically, operations were established ahead of expected revenue streams, but the focus was on cost control. Staffing levels were carefully managed and, because the business was relatively immature, it had not become bloated and clumsy. Also, we had not saddled the business with any debt.

Ironically, this discipline ensured the business was well prepared for any downturn.

Alain Grisay

F&C Asset Management

Until July, F&C had the additional pressure of its majority shareholder trying to sell the company. But relative to many of our peers, F&C was defensively positioned before the crisis.

We are strong in the corporate-governance field and actively raised concerns with the banks over some of the events that led up to the crisis. Perhaps we could have been more robust or public with our concerns.

Larry Fink

BlackRock

There are always things you wish you had done differently or better.

In many ways, though, BlackRock has been preparing for crises since our founding. Our firm was based on the simple premise that risk management matters. That premise has guided continual investment in the best talent and a state-of-the-art enterprise investment system with fully integrated risk analytics.

Q: Once the crisis had begun, what steps did you take to protect your investors and your company from the worst of it?

Mr. Gilbert: In July 2008, we announced a program to reduce worldwide annual operating costs that would deliver net annualized benefits of approximately GBP 40 million [$65.3 million]. Since then, we have announced further cost savings of approximately GBP 20 million, in annualized terms, which will have a full- year effect in 2009-2010.

We were mindful of the risk that over-trimming our business to protect profits could be counterproductive later on.

Mr. Formica: At the start of 2008, we had expected markets to be challenging and were probably one of the first of our peers to take cost action. When I took over in November 2008, we took further measures to protect the profitability of the business.

In areas such as property and hedge funds, we were on the front foot in reducing debt and working with the banks ahead of any issues developing.

Mr. Barham: At a portfolio level, the team looked to ensure that portfolios were defensively positioned. At a company level, we look to diversify the revenue streams of the business and to ensure that they are not all related to the performance of the market.

Mr. Grisay: Where we could, we took risk off the table, a process we began implementing early on. However, in some of sub-asset classes, conditions were so illiquid that it was impossible to deal in volume and close down positions.

Our senior executives met regularly following the collapse of Lehman to monitor potential counterparty risks and we suspended stock-lending activities.

We took action early last year to adjust our cost base to reflect the weak operating outlook. This is never a comfortable thing to do, but the later you leave cost cutting, the deeper you will end up having to go eventually.

Q: Are there opportunities you regret not taking?

Mr. Gilbert: Perhaps one opportunity we missed was not launching a fixed-income recovery fund, and/or more pro-actively marketing our fixed-income capabilities at the start of the year. We should have invested more in government bonds last year.

Mr. Formica: We could have been bolder on some investment opportunities, though it was prudent to retain a focus on the downside. In client portfolios, we generally held to our views and have seen strong relative and absolute performance since the lows.

Mr. Grisay: It's worth pointing out that in the midst of the crisis, we successfully completed a bolt-on acquisition to create F&C REIT, our new real-estate asset manager. Already this transaction has been transformational for our property business and was earnings-accretive in the first full six months of reporting.

There is no doubt there were other acquisition opportunities we would have liked to look at more seriously last year, were it not for the fact that F&C was in an offer period. We are now in a good strategic position to consider possible deals.

Mr. Fink: We repositioned portfolios first defensively, to emphasize liquidity and safety, and later offensively -- in some cases, too early -- to take advantage of unique investment opportunities.

Q: Has the crisis led to a rethink of the way your company goes about its business? Is there anything you want to change?

Mr. Gilbert: While equity markets saw significant falls, the most surprising impact was felt in fixed-income markets, which experienced substantial falls. For those managers, like Aberdeen, which were overweight credit and underweight government bonds, performance suffered and led to outflows.

Fortunately, we maintained our overweight to credit position rather than making the worst mistake of switching at the moment of maximum loss, and our portfolios are outperforming strongly this year. However, what happened last year taught us some valuable lessons and with the addition of some fixed-income professionals from Credit Suisse, including the appointment of Paul Griffiths as head of fixed income, we have strengthened our top-down analysis while maintaining our rigorous bottom-up investment process.

Mr. Formica: More and more, it reinforces the need for the asset-management industry to focus on its clients and for improved transparency. An example is clients still have a strong need for absolute-return products. We need to provide more products that work toward this goal, but also to provide greater education on the risks and downsides to meeting this objective.

Mr. Barham: I feel this crisis should reinforce with all managers the importance of cost control and service. We have used this environment as an opportunity to renegotiate some of our contracts and ensure the business is receiving the best service at the right price.

Mr. Grisay: It has brought risk management even more to the forefront of client considerations. This is an area where we have been investing over recent years.

If anything, the crisis has pushed the corporate-governance debate center stage. F&C is a leading player in the field of governance and sustainable investment, and we will continue engaging with the companies we invest in with the aim of encouraging better management of environmental, social and governance risks. This is an area where we have been very active for decades and is a key focus for the future of our business.

Mr. Fink: We identified ways to streamline processes, simplify our platform, enhance our operating efficiency and focus on strategic investments for the future.

The transaction with Barclays Global Investors signals our desire to continue to enhance our capabilities, to help clients address financial challenges and meet their investment objectives.

Q: What will be the long-term impact of the crisis on the asset-management industry?

Mr. Gilbert: There are likely to be fewer asset managers. Survivors are likely to be large, global players or small specialist boutiques. As a global asset manager, we anticipate a more consistent approach to regulation with greater coordinated cross-border regulation in our markets.

Mr. Formica: We are going to experience greater scrutiny by clients and regulators. As an industry, we have nothing to fear on this front and should welcome the ability to provide greater disclosure and transparency, which in turn should improve the level of trust and confidence.

Products will be simpler. There was a lot of complexity wrapped up in products, which made it hard for clients to understand the full extent of the risks and issues they may have been exposed to.

The independence of the asset-management firm will become of increasing importance to the success of delivering investment performance for clients. The ability to hire and retain the best staff remains best in an independent firm.

Mr. Barham: There will be flows from illiquid products and asset classes back into more conventional liquid assets. Products that rely on leverage without portfolio-management skills have exhibited unexpected volatility and will struggle to regain their foothold in the market.

Fund managers and senior partners should have their remuneration closely aligned with the interests of their clients and performance of their business.

The underlying business and portfolio risk needs greater understanding, assessment and management. There needs to be a greater understanding regarding asset-class correlation. Diversification across obscure asset classes was supposed to deliver this, but it did not. The introduction of the Capital Requirements Directive has already had a significant impact on the funding requirements for new businesses. Further increases will raise additional barriers to entry for investment boutiques.

Mr. Grisay: The crisis has exposed fundamental flaws in business models that used too much leverage or lacked sufficient scale and diversification.

It has also prompted consolidation, as numerous banks and insurance companies have strategically decided asset management is both no longer a core activity nor the risk-free business they thought it was. The post-mortem of the crisis has also concluded that asset managers were not doing enough to exercise shareholder rights and to hold the banks to account.

Mr. Fink: I hope the crisis will lead to broader understanding of the differences between our industry and other financial services firms. Asset managers are fiduciaries for their clients. They generally do not do proprietary trading and do not use significant leverage.

The Property Report
Deal of the Week: Pressure Is On Both Buyers, Sellers

By Maura Webber Sadovi

Africa Israel Investments Ltd., a beleaguered Israeli real-estate company, has cut the price of a Miami parcel of land by more than half so it could complete its sale.

A group affiliated with Africa Israel agreed in 2006 to sell the seven-acre parcel in 2006 for about $88.7 million to a partnership led by Falcone Group of Boca Raton, Fla. But the deal never closed as the recession deepened and property values tumbled. Now, to end three years of wrangling, Africa Israel has agreed to reduce the price to about $39 million. The deal is expected to close later this month.

The deal reflects, in part, the pressure that Africa Israel has been under to raise cash. Led by Lev Leviev, an Israeli diamond merchant, the company is best known for its top-of-the-market purchase of the old New York Times building and the troubled Apthorp condominium-conversion development on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The company is selling some real-estate assets to pay off debt.

But the buyers also were under pressure to compromise. The group led by Falcone, a real-estate company owned by three brothers, had already sunk $18 million into the deal from the original deposit along with increases paid to keep extending the closing. In 2007, the Falcone-affiliated group, known as 150 NE 7th Street LLC, filed a lawsuit in a Florida circuit court and sought to recover its deposit money. But Africa Israel battled back. In an amended complaint filed earlier this year, the buyers alleged that the seller didn't meet certain conditions of sale, including failing to remove defects in the property's title in a "timely basis."

Art Falcone, Falcone Group's chief executive, described the price cut as a "settlement."

If the transaction closes as expected, it will be one of only a handful of larger commercial land sales this year. From January through July, the total value of sales of vacant land entitled for commercial development in the U.S. fell to about $636 million, from $5.5 billion in the year-earlier period, according to data from Real Capital Analytics based on a survey of transactions valued at $5 million or more.

The decline comes as some lenders, already skittish about financing any real-estate purchases in the recession, are just saying no to borrowers seeking loans on acquisitions of vacant land and empty buildings with no hope of near-term income.

"Lenders are avoiding properties without income like the plague," says Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics.

The new price comprises the $18 million that Falcone has put in so far, $17.5 million in additional cash and a $3.5 million loan from the seller due in two years, Mr. Falcone says.

The parcel is one of a number of properties totaling about 25 acres slated to be redeveloped into a mixed-use project dubbed Miami Worldcenter. It would turn a bleak stretch of the city's Park West section, now dotted with parking lots, into a roughly 12 million-square-foot walkable "city within a city" designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects.

Falcone Group, Marc Roberts Cos. and Centurion Partners are listed as the project's developers on its Web site.

Mr. Falcone says he is committed to the project's long-term vision but estimates it could be several years before the credit markets and demand for new real estate rebound from their current slump and enable the group to begin developing the project. "We'll wait it out," Mr. Falcone says.

The settlement between Falcone and Africa Israel was welcomed by some as a sign that the Miami Worldcenter project still has a chance of being realized.

Marc Sarnoff, a Miami commissioner who hopes that a convention center might eventually be included in the Miami Worldcenter plans, says Miami has seen a number of developers walk away from agreements to buy land for projects that were conceived before the downturn.

Mr. Sarnoff is hopeful that the parcel's lower price might ultimately make the Miami Worldcenter development more affordable. "As much as we don't want to see values go down, it could be a good thing," Mr. Sarnoff says. "Having a high basis in your property means you have to charge high rents."

Africa Israel and a partner had planned to develop a condominium or mixed-use project on the Miami site, according to a person familiar with the transaction.

Meanwhile, in New York, the owners of the famed Apthorp, which include Africa Israel USA and Feil Organization, a developer, recently reduced the prices on some condo units by as much as 50% in an effort to sell more units and keep the building from going back to being a rental.

REITs are poised to pick up the market's pieces --- Firms have raised nearly $15 billion in equity this year

Overleveraged private real-estate funds are gasping for money, but publicly traded property companies have been chugging down cash from the capital markets. Now, they are poised to emerge as more dominant players when the commercial-property market starts to recover.

Many expect the landscape change to be as profound as it was in the early 1990s, when many real-estate developers went public to avoid bankruptcy and helped turn real-estate investment trusts into a big force in the property market. Most of the leading private real-estate funds of the time vanished from the scene.

REITs are poised once again to pick up the pieces from the commercial-property bust.

This year, they have tapped the stock market for nearly $15 billion in new equity and this month have raised $2 billion from the sale of unsecured debt.

The equity deals diluted shareholders' ownership stakes, but positioned many REITs -- such as mall owner Simon Property Group Inc. and warehouse landlord ProLogis -- to avoid loan defaults and have buying power when distress hits the market.

Few of the private-equity funds that became Wall Street stars during the boom can say the same thing.

Many funds are trying to raise cash to recapitalize existing investments. But the strategy has been a hard sell.

The Townsend Group's Martin Rosenberg, who consults institutions on their real-estate investments, says he has seen 16 funds make such proposals since late last year, but only one has raised all the equity it asked for. Two others raised part of what they were seeking, and two more are on track to succeed, Mr. Rosenberg adds.

Funds also are having trouble raising money to take advantage of distressed opportunities because their traditional investors -- pension funds and other institutions -- have little to invest after going on a real-estate binge in the mid-2000s.

The country's 50 biggest public pension plans are on pace to commit only $5 billion to real-estate investment vehicles this year, according to trade publication Real Estate Alert. That would be the lowest total since 2003, compared with $17 billion last year and a peak of $36 billion in 2007.

In all, property funds raised $370 billion from 2003 to 2008, according to Probitas Partners, a San Francisco research firm. They were seen by many investors as being nimbler than public REITs, and they goosed returns with mountains of cheap debt.

All that debt has led to a spate of bankruptcies at companies taken over by private-equity funds -- such as Morgan Stanley Real Estate's Crescent Resources LLC and Colony Capital LLC's Station Casinos Inc. -- and huge markdowns across the industry. Even Prudential Financial Inc.'s $11 billion PRISA fund, with a reputation as one of the most conservative in the industry, told investors last month to expect a 55% peak-to-trough loss by the beginning of next year.

Private-equity funds invest money from pension funds and other institutional investors to buy properties or entire real-estate companies. They collect part of the profits and earn management fees.

Shares of publicly traded REITs, meanwhile, can be bought and sold by rank-and-file investors.

REITs, under closer scrutiny from analysts and shareholders, didn't take on as much debt as their private counterparts and proved to be astute sellers as the market peaked.

In 2006 and 2007, as values skyrocketed and private-equity funds and institutional investors were net buyers of $134 billion of property, public REITs sold $94 billion more in real estate than they bought, according to Real Capital Analytics data cited by Green Street Advisors.

Several publicly owned landlords, including Equity Office Properties and apartment giant Archstone-Smith Trust, went private in huge buyouts.

Their more-conservative strategy is now paying off, and REITs' lower leverage and greater transparency is attracting investors rattled by the downturn.

Investors rushed into the sector this spring after REITs fell 75% below their February 2007 peak. A survival-of-the-fittest storyline that many expected turned into a much broader rally as at least 48 successful stock offerings injected cash into the REITs.

"Everyone was predicting a have-and-have-not scenario, and that didn't play out at all," says Debra Cafaro, chief executive of health-care REIT Ventas Inc. "What happened was indiscriminate access to capital, which has buoyed the whole sector."

REITs, to be sure, are still suffering, and no one can tell when the commercial real-estate market will start to recover. The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index is still at about half its February 2007 peak.

The dilutive effect of the REITs' equity offerings has dismayed many investors, and some are wary of how volatile REIT stock prices have become.

Some private-equity funds, meanwhile, still have "dry powder" -- cash commitments from investors that haven't yet been put to use.

Many agree that public companies now have the best access to capital, the lifeblood of real-estate investing.

Starwood Capital Group LLC, which operates several private-equity property funds, recently raised $810 million in the public market to buy distressed debt, and other firms have said they will try the same thing.

"I think there are times when the public market is the better solution for a greater variety of strategies and a greater variety of assets, and I think that's more true right now than it's been in a while," says Randy Rowe, chairman of Green Courte Partners LLC, a Chicago private-equity real-estate firm.

Congress established the REIT structure in the 1960s, but the modern REIT era was born in the early 1990s, when companies such as Kimco Realty Corp. and Simon went public.

Deals &Deal Makers
Hotel receivers make the best of a tough task

The growing wave of U.S. hotels defaulting on their debt has spawned a growth industry for companies that oversee and operate hotels seized by lenders.

In many cases, the companies taking over the ailing properties own their own hotels as well. The new business is helping them hang tough during one of the worst hotel markets since World War II.

Prism Hotels &Resorts, which owns or manages roughly 20 hotels, has in the past year taken over as interim manager of 17 foreclosed hotels, including the 52-room Casa Madrona luxury hotel in Sausalito, Calif. Prism, which has another 20 management contracts pending, hired 22 new employees to help handle the workload at its Dallas headquarters and inherited hundreds of workers at the hotels it took over.

GF Management LLC, which manages or owns 60 hotels on a regular basis, has added oversight of 35 foreclosed hotels, ranging from a 400-room Sheraton in Orlando, Fla., to a 104-room Super 8 in Columbus, Ohio. Philadelphia-based GF has added dozens of workers.

If they pull off the new assignments well, they could emerge from the recession larger, stronger and more competitive. They typically charge fees of 1.5% to 5% of the hotel's revenue. An even bigger enticement is winning a long-term management assignment from whomever winds up buying the property.

But it promises to be a long slog for new management. With analysts projecting a recovery starting no sooner than late next year for hotels, interim managers anticipate a longer stay this time.

"In the early 1990s, a lot of our assignments were for six to 12 months," said Jeff Kolessar, a senior vice president at GF Management. "In the 2001-02 cycle, they were 12 to 18 months. This cycle, the assignments may last a little longer than that."

U.S. hotel occupancy, which registered 64% in July, is at its lowest level since Smith Travel Research began tracking the figure in 1987. Real-estate research company Real Capital Analytics now classifies $18 billion in hotel loans as distressed, meaning they are delinquent, in foreclosure, in bankruptcy or have been restructured by lenders. That compares with just $1.3 billion in distressed loans on hotels a year ago.

Interim managers' challenges often include completing abandoned renovations, appeasing hotel brands angry about the property's shortfalls and, occasionally, ousting the former owner from living onsite. Business sometimes can be revived by bolstering a hotel's customer service or reducing rates. R&R Hospitality, a court-appointed receiver overseeing two troubled hotels, salvaged a Los Angeles hotel's bookings this year by paying past-due amounts the hotel owed online-booking services such as Orbitz Worldwide Inc. and Expedia Inc.

A foreclosure doesn't always mean a big operator, such as a Marriott International Inc., will stop managing a hotel or licensing its brand to it. But, in some cases, a brand will drop a hotel in response to a previous owner's customer-service shortfalls or refusal to renovate the property.

Another challenge for interim managers: hanging on to the conventions and group meetings booked at those properties. Contracts for such events often allow the visiting groups to cancel if the hotel goes into foreclosure or receivership.

That happened at the 331-room Wigwam Golf Resort &Spa near Phoenix. Interim manager Destination Hotels &Resorts, a unit of Lowe Enterprises, took over management of Wigwam in May after the resort went through receivership and into bankruptcy. By then, the Wigwam had lost several conference bookings amid the management upheaval of the previous weeks. Destination hustled to retain the rest, succeeding in some cases but not in all.

"It takes a lot of work to convince a client that we're still going to be here in six months when they bring their group in, and we're going to service that event," said Michael Everett, a Destination senior vice president.

Sometimes, a few sweeteners are needed to keep group bookings from bolting. "You have to give something to entice them to stay," says Leslie Ng, chief investment officer at Interstate Hotels &Resorts, which regularly manages 225 hotels, owns 57 and this year has added management of five delinquent hotels. "That could be a reduced rate or a free coffee session" for the group, she says.

There isn't much that interim managers haven't already seen in previous downturns. Prism Chief Executive Steve Van recalled taking over a foreclosed, 400-room Orlando hotel in 2002 only to find the ousted owner loading the hotel's televisions and furniture into moving trucks. A deputy sheriff accompanying Mr. Van stopped the man.

GF Management's Mr. Kolessar recalled assuming management of a foreclosed hotel in Memphis, Tenn., in 2002 and evicting the former owner, who was operating a pigeon farm on the hotel's grounds.

Sometimes, the companies recruited to oversee a hotel get ensnared in its troubles. The owner of the Wigwam, Kabuto Arizona Properties LLC -- now in bankruptcy protection -- sued former manager Starwood Hotels &Resorts Worldwide Inc. and receiver Douglas Wilson Cos. last week. Kabuto alleges Starwood mismanaged the Wigwam and lost money, and Wilson as receiver failed to stop it. Wilson CEO Douglas P. Wilson called the lawsuit "absurd" and "superfluous." Starwood declined to comment.

(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

A New Jersey state judge dismissed Biovail Corp.'s complaint that hedge funds and research analysts colluded to depress its stock.

Biovail had alleged in a racketeering lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey in February 2006 that it was the victim of a bear run. The company accused SAC Capital Management LLC and others of conspiring with research firms Gradient Analytics and Gerson Lehrman Group Inc. to produce tainted bearish reports on Biovail.

Judge Donald Goldman dismissed the complaint "for failure to state a cause of action" and a "lack of personal jurisdiction."

A Biovail spokesman wasn't available to comment.

J.P. Morgan's office sale --- Bank aims to unload a slew of properties in a terrible market

J.P. MORGAN CHASE &Co. is marketing 23 office properties across the U.S. in an effort to rid itself of excess space. But the bank's timing, amid the worst property market in decades, means any sale is likely to come with sizable concessions.

The portfolio of properties for sale, with a combined 7.1 million square feet of space, includes four notable towers: One Chase Manhattan Plaza, near Wall Street; Four New York Plaza, also in the Financial District; the former headquarters of Washington Mutual in a downtown Seattle skyscraper that also houses the city's art museum; and a landmarked 1929 Art Deco building in Houston, the former headquarters of Texas Commerce Bank.

The portfolio is believed to be the largest single portfolio of office properties to hit the market this year and could raise more than $1 billion.

J.P. Morgan's real-estate holdings have increased significantly since the bank's acquisitions last year of Bear Stearns Cos. and the banking operations of Washington Mutual. Bank executives have repeatedly said they have too much real estate and intend to sell some of the office space.

J.P. Morgan already has moved many employees of its investment bank into Bear's former headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, which is located around the corner from J.P. Morgan's corporate offices on Park Avenue.

Selling such a large swath of real estate won't be easy. Values for office space have plummeted as corporations reduce staff. And with financing hard to come by, fewer deals are getting done. Across the country, $5.7 billion in office-building sales closed in the first half of 2009, compared with $30.9 billion in the first half of 2008, according to research firm Real Capital Analytics.

Just eight office buildings were sold in Manhattan in the first half of 2009, at an average price of $470 a square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics. In the same period last year, 43 properties changed hands in Manhattan at an average price of $877 a square foot.

Real-estate experts say that in order to sell some of the buildings, J.P. Morgan must offer incentives, including guaranteeing a building's income stream by structuring a sale-leaseback transaction. "They're not going to be able to sell Chase Manhattan Plaza without leasing back a significant amount of space," said Dan Fasulo, head of research at Real Capital Analytics.

In 2005, 2006 and 2007, investors would pay a premium for a building with vacant or soon-to-be vacant space under the assumption new tenants would pay even higher rents. Today in many ways the reverse is true, as investors look for buildings with high occupancy, high-quality tenants and stable rents.

"Vacant space right now is not ideal," said David Aubuchon, an analyst with Robert W. Baird &Co., adding he doesn't expect the office-real-estate market to hit bottom before the end of 2010. "Investors are not going to want to renew and find new leasing in this sort of environment."

So far, J.P. Morgan hasn't explicitly offered to finance the purchases, according to people familiar with the matter, forcing buyers to hunt for credit elsewhere. "Seller-financing has been the trick to get deals done," Mr. Aubuchon said. A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman declined to comment on the level of interest the bank has received in the properties.

Real-estate investment-banking firm Houlihan Lokey is representing J.P. Morgan in the sale.

Leading the News: Euro zone hits a bump --- Industrial output fell in June; worries over corporate credit

Industrial production in the 16 countries that use the euro fell in June, reversing the gain posted in May amid new warnings on the creditworthiness of European companies.

Figures released Wednesday by European Union statistics agency Eurostat showed industrial production fell 0.6% from May, and slid 17% from a year earlier, slowing from the 17.6% annual decline in May. It was the smallest yearly drop since February. Eurostat also revised the May monthly increase up to 0.6% from the original 0.5% gain.

The fall shows why the euro zone's emergence from its deep recession is expected to be slow and bumpy. However, the slowdown of the year-to-year decline indicates that the recovery -- as shown in recent pickups in purchasing managers' surveys -- is continuing.

"Manufacturing activity in the 16-country region is probably at or very close to its trough," said Martin van Vliet, economist for ING Economics. "Unfortunately, we fear that the climb back up will be much slower than in previous industrial recoveries."

Separately, Moody'sAnalytics said in a report that the overall creditworthiness of Western European companies fell to a new low in the second quarter.

Western European companies suffered a total of 177 downgrades in the quarter, the report says, considerably higher than the previous record of 134 set in the first three months of 2009.

Financial institutions across the majority of Western European countries saw most of the rating cuts, with a record 122 downgrades.

Moody's said the rapid deterioration in loan portfolios, accelerating asset impairments and thinning cushions of capital to protect against future losses were mainly to blame.

Many European businesses are struggling with a lack of pricing power as demand remains slack. On Wednesday, France reported its third month of falling consumer prices. The consumer-price index published by statistics office Insee fell 0.4% from June and dropped 0.7% from a year earlier. That joined other recent indications that the euro zone as a whole could post its second straight month-to-month drop in consumer prices for July.

Still, economists minimized the risk of deflation, defined as a protracted decline in the prices of goods and services that causes long-term damage to the economy.

"We expect inflation to gradually increase and return . . . to positive territory by November," said Luigi Speranza, an economist at BNP Paribas.

In Spain, home sales fell 26% in June on the year, amid continued pressure from the collapse of the decadelong housing boom, according to data from Spain's National Statistics Institute.

Nonetheless, the decline in home sales slowed; they had fallen 32% in May and 48% in April.

Mid-America's Lender No More --- CIT Sees Its Share of Loans To Small Businesses Fall; Bailout Rebuff Vindicated?

When CIT Group seemed on the edge of collapse last month, the lender argued for a government rescue by pointing out that a bankruptcy filing would be a big blow to Middle America. After all, CIT had been the nation's largest small-business lender for nine years in row.

That isn't the case anymore, according to a recent analysis by Foresight Analytics. The Oakland, Calif., research firm estimates that CIT has been knocked off the No. 1 spot all the way down to No. 16 by the dollar volume of loans to small business in the first nine months of the fiscal year ending in October. CIT's SBA lending volume fell 91% through June from the year-earlier period to just $66 million.

While many lenders' loan volumes have dropped amid the recession, CIT's decline has been accompanied by a market-share loss.

Lenders such as Live Oak Banking have moved in to fill the void. Live Oak has increased its small-business lending 40% this year to $107 million and gained 1.2% of overall market share, according to Foresight Analytics. Perhaps the biggest winner is TARP-recipient Wells Fargo, which has gained 2.6 points of market share and has replaced CIT as the largest small-business lender, at $466 million.

Small-business lending constitutes just 7.7% of CIT's overall corporate-finance loan volume. Still, the declines are indicative of the company's larger cash struggles. On Friday, CIT said it has suspended its dividend payments to conserve about $50 million a quarter. It also said it had received enough offers to complete the repurchasing of $1 billion of bonds due Aug. 17. Even with a deal with bondholders early this month to inject $3 billion in capital, CIT still faces $10 billion of debt coming due through 2010.

Despite fears, there have been few stories of businesses collapsing because of CIT's problems. With the market seeming to sort out the dislocations caused by CIT's liquidity struggles, the government's refusal to bail out CIT is looking smarter by the day.

Animal activism heightens in Europe

In the wake of a crackdown in Britain that has damped attacks by animal-rights extremists there, the battlefront appears to have shifted to continental Europe, where a series of companies and individuals connected even indirectly to animal research are being targeted by anonymous assailants.

Arson and threatening graffiti have been used in recent months against executives working for Swiss drug giant Novartis AG and NYSE Euronext, which operates the stock exchange where one big animal-research company is listed.

An employee of drug maker Schering-Plough Corp. in Belgium also was targeted, and animal-rights groups claim they have vandalized the cars and homes of people working for pharmaceutical companies Pfizer Inc. and Bayer AG and British bank Barclays PLC, among others.

The incidents have opened a new front in a battle that had previously been confined largely to Britain, where extremists early this decade began attacking Huntingdon Life Sciences, a company that tests drugs and other products on animals. Many recent attacks have been aimed not at HLS itself, but rather businesses that allegedly contract with the laboratory or are its financial backers. Novartis, however, says it hasn't used Huntingdon's services for many years.

HLS declined to comment on the identity of its clients or the attacks against Novartis or others. The company says it condemns any acts of intimidation or violence by extremists.

Some security experts say tougher laws and more focused police work in Britain have driven the militant wing of the animal-rights movement to mainland Europe, where until recently most animal-rights groups engaged in peaceful protests.

The British crackdown "pushed activity out of the U.K.," said James Christian, global head of security for Novartis, whose chief executive has been targeted in several incidents in recent weeks. "In continental Europe we used to get the occasional demonstration, people outside your gates," he said.

But in recent months the cars of seven or eight Novartis employees in Switzerland and Germany have been destroyed, and threatening slogans have been spray-painted on their homes, he said. Late last month, someone dug up and stole the ashes of CEO Daniel Vasella's mother from a Swiss cemetery. Graffiti including "Death to Vasella" has been spray-painted around the Swiss village where he lives, and early this week his vacation home in Austria caught fire in what Novartis says was an arson attack.

The company blames animal-rights militants for all the acts. Mr. Christian said the spread of such crimes across Europe has complicated the problem of dealing with them, as it is more difficult to coordinate the responses of various countries and law-enforcement agencies.

Police in Switzerland and Austria have confirmed many of the incidents but say they don't yet have suspects.

But anonymous people identifying themselves as animal-rights advocates have claimed responsibility online for many of the strikes. Wednesday, an animal-rights group calling itself MFAH Austria said it set fire to Dr. Vasella's house in Austria, using gasoline. Mr. Christian said some of the group's claims appeared exaggerated but said that Novartis believes animal extremist doused the house with gasoline and set it ablaze.

In April, a poster on a Web site claimed to have climbed over a gate at the home of Novartis board member Ulrich Lehner in Dusseldorf, Germany, spray-painted graffiti on his house and poured paint-stripper over a Porsche. The author claimed similar assaults were carried out the same night against several Bayer employees in the area. Mr. Christian of Novartis confirmed the attack on Mr. Lehner's property. A Bayer spokeswoman declined to comment.

In May, a poster to the same site reported returning to Mr. Ulrich's home and placing incendiary devices under two of his cars. Mr. Christian confirmed that the incident took place, saying that Mr. Ulrich discovered the devices, which were safely removed before causing any damage. A Novartis spokeswoman said Mr. Ulrich couldn't be reached for comment.

A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in the nearby city of Cologne confirmed that incendiary devices had been used against people in and around Dusseldorf, and said investigators suspect animal-rights extremists.

Both of the posts were made on a site run by Bite Back, a Florida-based group that describes itself as disseminating information about the radical animal-rights movement. "We feel that by giving a voice to anonymous activists who choose to break the law to help animals we are contributing to an important public discussion of animals in our society," a Bite Back representative, who declined to identify himself, said Thursday in an e-mailed reply to questions.

In a report published in April, Dutch intelligence officials said that it "seems highly likely" that a series of arson attacks in two Dutch towns at the end of 2008 "was directly related to the establishment" last year of a group called Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Netherlands, or SHAC-NL.

The arson was targeted at cars "belonging or thought to belong to" officials working for NYSE Euronext, said the Netherlands' General Intelligence and Security Service, in its report. Shares of Huntingdon's parent company, Life Sciences Research Inc., are listed on NYSE's Arca exchange, which has made NYSE Euronext a target for animal-rights militants.

In an emailed response to questions about the attacks, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext said: "In our view, these dangerous attacks against individuals are criminal acts committed by certain extremists and should be condemned. Our global-security division has been working and sharing information with law-enforcement and government authorities in Europe and the U.S. in order to help identify and apprehend those responsible for these acts." He declined to comment further.

SHAC-NL couldn't be reached to comment. A request to SHAC's U.K. office to clarify what, if any, relationship it has to the Dutch group wasn't answered.

In December, an anonymous poster to Bite Back's Web site claimed he had placed an incendiary device under two cars belonging to a NYSE Euronext official. Posters in recent months also claimed to have scrawled offensive graffiti on the home of a Pfizer executive in France and a Barclays official in London.

The militants said they targeted Barclays because it owned shares in Huntingdon Life Sciences. That company stopped trading on the London Stock Exchange several years ago, when a new parent company, Life Sciences Research Inc., was registered in the U.S. According to shareholder analytics firm Lionshares, a Barclays asset-management arm and another Barclays unit had owned or controlled just over 3% of Life Sciences Research as of Dec. 31; but Lionshares shows no record of current ownership of the stock by the Barclays entities.

A Barclays spokesman declined to comment on its stock ownership or on whether any of the company's executives had been targeted for attacks.

Deal of the Week: As Values Decline, Pension Funds Jump Into Real Estate

New York -- The Queens Center Mall doesn't seem to have followed the dour shopping-center story line of this recession.

Sales per square foot actually ticked up in 2008 to $876, and year-end occupancy stood at 97.5%. In the food court, 20-year-old shopper Mario Ontaneda, wearing a cap and jeans he purchased from stores in the mall, said: "I need to save up, but I'm constantly buying stuff."

The strong performance of Queens Center Mall, located in New York's borough of Queens, helps to explain why Cadillac Fairview Corp. agreed to pay $150 million and to assume $167 million in mortgage debt to acquire a 49% stake in the mall last week. Cadillac is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Macerich Co., the Santa Monica, Calif., real-estate investment trust, sold a stake in the one-million-square-foot mall as part of a broader plan to reduce debt.

The deal is among a few early signs that pension funds, a huge source of real-estate capital, are looking at new property investments even as they lick their wounds from past deals.

A day after the Queens Center deal was announced, the California Public Employees' Retirement System said it had closed a $463 million deal to buy a stake in 86 shopping centers around the U.S. from Macquarie CountryWide Trust of Australia.

Queens Center was Cadillac's first U.S. real-estate purchase since 1999. The company owns about $15 billion of mostly malls and office buildings in Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere.

"We've looked at, literally, billions of dollars worth of transactions and bid on several of them, but we haven't been successful from a pricing perspective for a long time," Cadillac Vice President of Investments Andrea Stephen said in an interview.

As property values fall, investors around the world are starting to pay attention to the U.S. market. Macerich said it expects to close two more joint ventures in the next two months as the publicly traded real-estate investment trust tries to reduce its $7.9 billion debt load. Chief Executive Art Coppola said in a conference call on Tuesday that a big U.S. pension fund and an international sovereign-wealth fund are the lead contenders to join those ventures.

Dropping property values and rising stock markets also are giving institutional investors like Cadillac Fairview more flexibility in making new real-estate investments. In the wake of the stock-market crisis last fall, many institutional investors were trying to reduce their exposure to real estate because of the "denominator effect." With equity portfolios losing value, and appraisers slow to mark down commercial property, some pension funds and college endowments found themselves with more real estate on their books than the percentage approved by their boards. Now, with stocks up and real estate down, that balance is starting to move back in line.

"Deals that make sense are pretty few and far between," said Martin Rosenberg of real-estate investment consultant Townsend Group. But "with the denominator effect abating, a lot of investors are working to find targeted ways to put capital to work today and to position capital to be deployed quickly as pressure on sellers continues to build."

The danger is moving too soon. Few commercial real-estate transactions are getting done, not only because they are hard to finance but also because it is unclear how much further the market will fall. Before last week's transactions, there had been only three retail deals of more than $100 million this year, according to research firm Real Capital Analytics. By this time in 2008, there had been 15 such deals.

Analysts said Macerich got a decent price, selling the stake in Queens Center to longtime partner Cadillac Fairview at a capitalization rate just over 7%. Real-estate participants have been warning that the cap rate -- annual net income divided by purchase price, a measure of how the market values real estate -- could hit double digits for some properties as distressed landlords are forced to sell.
