Large swings in the share prices of companies that are expected to be dropped or added to indices have become less common with the rise of passive investment, research has found.

The explosion of the exchange traded fund industry is helping dampen the "index effect", in which stock prices are affected by traders buying and selling them ahead of formal changes by index providers, according to Axioma, the analytics provider.

The share price of stocks expected to be included in indices have traditionally ramped up as traders buy them in the expectation of a profit when they sell to passive investors compelled to buy the equities once they join the index.

Some index providers name new constituents and dropouts in advance. Even then gains can be made as the equities can only be included in the ETF after the index is officially changed.

However, Axioma found the gains that can be made by trading in advance have decreased sharply over the past decade.

"The classic index effect has declined in magnitude in all markets tested," said Anthony Renshaw, director of index solutions at Axioma.

He said that a declining index effect meant investing in ETFs has been even cheaper than originally supposed for investors, many of whom choose the product for their lower fees.

Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT s daily deals briefing

FT premium subscribers canclick here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.

One thing to start: Nissan s board has voted to oust chairman Carlos Ghosn, sacking the man who led the company for nearly two decades and transformed it into one of the world s largest automotive groups. More here. Back to the show 	. 	. 	.

Not long ago,Goldman Sachs was the envy of Asian investment banking with its booming business in the region.

Part of that business was overseen byTim Leissner, the bank s then chairman of south-east Asia. Leissner was the architect of operation that built relationships with the most powerful people in his territory, including in Malaysia where the franchise began to flourish starting in 2008   just as the financial crisis started to set in.

Goldman's government connections in Malaysia proved lucrative. State-run1MDB hired Goldman to work on $6.5bn in bond deals that brought in about $600m in fees, an uncommonly high rate for the services.

Here's a great IFR piece from when the ink was barely dry on one of those placements, which includes a reference to the  veritable magician  who helped pull it off. More on him later.

Between 2008 and 2013, Goldman was the only western investment bank to rank among Malaysia s top 10 fee earners. At its peak in 2013, Malaysia generated about $82m in investment banking fees for Goldman, or 70 per cent of its total fees for south-east Asia, according to data fromRefinitiv.

All of this has come crashing down in the wake of one of the biggest corruption scandals in history surrounding 1MDB.

Former presidentNajib Razak has been accused of siphoning funds from 1MDB (he denies those charges). Leissner has pleaded guilty to crimes in connection to the scandal.

And Goldman s business in the region has suffered dearly. The bank has plummeted from the league tables, down at 17th place in south-east Asia in terms of fees as of the start of November, bringing in only $27m. Malaysia has generated no fees for the bank for the past two years, according to Refinitiv. Other markets such as Singapore and Indonesia are also down.

Here's the FT story looking at how Goldman is trying to recover.

But Goldman has another business working for it in the region: China.

Goldman has brought in about $640m this year in fees from Asia excluding Japan, putting it third behindBank of China andCitic. Business from China accounts for just over half of that income   a 40 per cent increase on all of last year and a record high for the bank. Its brand is highly coveted in China, as evidenced when a Shenzhen-based firm trading under the same Chinese characters was caught offering its services online in 2015.

 The China presence for global banks matters for perception, and because you re bringing in global clients and local knowhow,  saidGeorge Kuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition, the financial services data provider.

While China remains a bright spot for the group, big questions are looming over Goldman Sachs in Asia.

Leadership for example is one key question.Todd Leland, who moved to Hong Kong late last year as the bank s co-president in the region alongside Asia-Pacific securities head James Paradise, is now the head of the investment banking business.

His predecessor,Andrea Vella(the magician from the IFR story), has been caught up in the 1MDB scandal. Here's the FT piece on him from a few weeks back.

No one really knows how far the scandal will drag the bank into the mire, as lawsuits continue to emerge. An Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund has now sued Goldman over the 1MDB scandal, accusing it of bribing its officials during a  massive global conspiracy .

Who knows what's next. But more surprises are in store. The NYT reported on Thursday that former Goldman chief Lloyd Blankfeinhad a one on one meeting withJho Low (pictured below, seated), the Malaysian financier at the centre of the scandal.

Further reading?

Here's a recent John Gapper column on the 1MDB case, where he writes that  Wall Street is supposed to bring transparency to emerging markets, not to make corruption easier .

Robey Warshaw's latest financial results

London's most lethal M&A boutique   for its size, at least   recently published its latest financial results.

We are, of course, talking aboutRobey Warshaw, the advisory kiosk, which was set up a few years ago and has established itself as one of the City's most prominent houses.

That is a bit of a triumph given that the firm consists of three partners and around a dozen other employees, including assistants and a driver.

Here are the highlights:

*

Turnover for the year to March 2018 was 29.6m. That's down 59 per cent from the same period a year ago when it was 72.7m.

*

Profits for the three members who control the firm's equity  Simon Robey,Simon Warshaw andPhilip Apostolides   came in at 21.3m. That's down from 63.3m.

*

The net pay of the firm's highest paid member is disclosed as is customary. That person is Sir Simon (pictured above) who made 12.1m, down from 37.3m a year ago. DD has also used the firm's earnings to estimate that Sir Simon's share of Robey Warshaw's profit pool equates to about 58.8 per cent. The firm declined to comment.

*

The decline in the results are because the firm had fewer deals   includingReckitt Benckiser's purchase ofMead Johnson   close in the period compared with the previous year. Here's our write-up of their previous year results.

*

Before you start feeling too bad for firm and its down period, Robey Warshaw's year from March 2018 is looking like it could be significantly more lucrative. Recent deals includeComcast's takeover ofSky,Silver Lake's acquisition of the parent company ofZoopla, twoVodafone deals (one in India and another to buy Liberty Global assets in Europe) and more.

As demand for online retail outstrips the number of available warehouse workers, employers are increasingly relying on robots to get the job done.

Seeing that need, Beijing-based robot maker Geek Plus Inc. said Thursday it has raised $150 million to expand operations. The company said its logistics robots use artificial intelligence to perform simple warehouse tasks like sorting and moving objects.

Warburg Pincus led the round, an unusually large Series B for a logistics robotics company. Prior investors included Volcanics Venture and Vertex Ventures. Founded in 2015, Geek Plus has raised more than $210 million to date, according to the company's website.

The robotics sector has become increasingly crowded as well-funded startups race to develop robots amid a tight labor market.

Companies like Geek Plus and Fetch Robotics Inc. focus on warehouse work, while others such as Starship Technologies Ltd. have created robots for food and package delivery. Zume Pizza Inc., which makes cooking and delivery robots, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/zume-a-food-robotics-and-logistics-startup-cooks-up-2-25-billion-valuation-in-softbank-deal-1541099560" from SoftBank Group Corp. earlier this month.

With the hot market, Geek Plus said it expects its business to grow fivefold in the next year. Geek Plus said more than 5,000 of its robots are working around the world today, from mainland China to the U.S. They are deployed in industries including automotive, e-commerce and pharmaceuticals.

Goldman Sachs  Asia franchise suffers in 1MDB storm

Wall Street bank  persona non grata  in Malaysia but China remains strong point

The action for one of the worst crises in Goldman Sachs  history is now centred in the US, where prosecutors have charged two of the bank s former executives with money laundering and bribing foreign officials.

Back in Asia, the Malaysian corruption scandal is still unfolding. The question now is how deep the rot goes and how serious the damage will be to Goldman s wider business in the region, which the bank has built over decades.

 Sure, all of my clients are crooks 	. 	. 	. 

The impact of the 1MDB scandal has been swift. Tim Leissner, the former Goldman partner who has pleaded guilty to crimes in connection to the 1MDB scandal, left Goldman in 2016, by which time the bank had already started pulling back in the region. In 2013 it ranked number two in investment banking for fees in south-east Asia but only two years later, after the public eruption of the scandal, it had fallen to number 24, according to data from Refinitiv.

Alex Turnbull was a trader at Goldman s Singapore office in 2012 and 2013, the time the bank advised 1MDB, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at the heart of the scandal. Mr Turnbull, son of former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, is scathing in his assessment of the bank s approach to the region.

He told the Financial Times:  The attitude among some of the banking guys was 	. 	. 	. 	 Sure, all of my clients are crooks   so how the fuck else am I going to deal with them? 

 They kind of took the view that if I want to get things done in Asia then I will have to do it in the, quote unquote,  Asian way  	. 	. 	. 	Maybe that is your opinion but that is also a breach of US law. 

Mr Turnbull has claimed that he was sidelined from his position after raising questions over the Malaysia dealings. Insiders at Goldman have rejected the claims, stating Mr Turnbull had no exposure to 1MDB.

Mr Leissner told a court in August that it was  very much in line of its culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees , according to a transcript made public earlier this month.

Goldman has sought to portray the actions as the misdeeds of individuals rather than the broader cultural problems identified by Mr Turnbull and Mr Leissner. Last week, chief executive David Solomon sent a voicemail to employees, saying he was  personally outraged  by the  reprehensible  behaviour of  those individuals , which was  inconsistent with the good work and integrity that defines work that 40,000 of you do every day .

Even if that message prevails, the reputational damage is serious and Goldman investors are bracing for fines of at least several hundred million dollars. In Asia, though, the response is mixed.

Goldman backs away from Malaysia

 If you re a big corporate and you re in early-stage talks [with Goldman] on your next derivatives structuring, you can imagine people on the board saying,  Do we really have to go with the guys involved in 1MDB? ,  said Kevin Kwek, a Singapore-based analyst at Sanford C Bernstein.  On the other hand, these guys are Teflon and they have very deep relationships. 

In Malaysia, the bank s alleged involvement in a scheme that embezzled $2.7bn from 1MDB is creating the toughest challenge for its business since it expanded in the region a decade ago.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has refused to rule out forcing the bank out of the country, saying:  Goldman Sachs has done things which are wrong that they shouldn t have done. 

When Goldman decided to target Malaysia and the rest of south-east Asia as part of a wider regional expansion 10 years ago, that effort was led by Mr Leissner as the bank s then chairman of south-east Asia. Mr Leissner is credited with building the bank s relationships with Malaysian tycoons and the government of Najib Razak starting in 2008.

Its government connections in Malaysia   reinforced by meetings between Goldman s former chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and Mr Najib   initially proved lucrative. State-run 1MDB hired Goldman to work on $6.5bn in bond deals that brought in about $600m in fees, an uncommonly high rate for the services. Between 2008 and 2013, Goldman was the only western investment bank to rank among Malaysia s top-10 fee earners.

At its peak in 2013, Malaysia generated about $82m in investment banking fees for Goldman, or 70 per cent of its total fees for south-east Asia, according to data from Refinitiv. The $600m earned on work for 1MDB is not captured in the fees data because it was earned on bond spreads. Banks often criticise third-party fees data for not giving a complete picture of how they generate revenues.

Goldman s brand has shown little sign of recovery, taking 17th spot in south-east Asia for fees as of the start of November, bringing in only $27m. Malaysia has generated no fees for the bank for the past two years, according to Refinitiv. Other markets such as Singapore and Indonesia are also down.

Bankers in the region argue that as long as Malaysia s ruling coalition   which ousted 1MDB founder Najib Razak in the May elections   is in power, Goldman is likely to be shut out of the country, even if it reimburses the bond fees.

 They ve been persona non grata for some time,  said one senior banker in the region.  The government-linked companies haven t touched them for ages. The only good client they really had apart from 1MDB in Malaysia was [tycoon] Ananda Krishnan, but you haven t seen him using them either.  Mr Ananda could not be reached for comment.

Goldman s office in the country has been slashed in size, with just an asset management team remaining, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bank s former chairman of investment banking in Malaysia, Yusof Yaacob, left in 2014 to join Deutsche Bank as chief country officer.

Since the breakout of the 1MDB scandal in 2015, Goldman s name has been noticeably absent from sizeable deals done by large Malaysian investors, such as sovereign wealth fund Khazanah. Nor has it won significant business from the two largest investors in neighbouring Singapore, Temasek and GIC, during that time, according to a list of large M&A deals on which the bank has worked.

Instead its clientele in Malaysia has included smaller groups such as Australia-listed iProperty and private equity house Navis Capital Partners. It has also worked on a few inbound deals, such as Bank of China (Hong Kong) s investment in Malaysia.

The flurry of south-east Asia deals under Mr Leissner stood out in the bank s broader Asia business, which has focused most of its resources on China.

China focus endures

Goldman has brought in about $640m this year in fees from Asia excluding Japan, putting it third behind Bank of China and Citic. Business from China accounts for just over half of that income   a 40 per cent increase on all of last year and a record high for the bank.

The bank made early inroads into China, forging ties with some of the country s most important financiers. It underwrote the initial public offering of Tsingtao Brewery in 1993, the first flotation of a Chinese company on the Hong Kong stock exchange, presaging tens of billions of dollars in similar deals.

In 2004 it struck a deal with powerful Chinese financier Fang Fenglei for one of the first foreign securities joint ventures in the country. This arrangement, brokered by then-chief executive Henry Paulson, was hailed as a major breakthrough in China, ushering in several similar joint ventures by rivals.

 The China presence for global banks matters for perception, and because you re bringing in global clients and local know-how,  said George Kuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition, the financial services data provider.

The escalating 1MDB scandal has not dissuaded China s largest state groups from hiring Goldman. It worked on Postal Savings Bank of China s $7.6bn public flotation in 2016 and ChemChina s $44bn acquisition of Swiss agro-business giant Syngenta in the same year.

Its brand is highly coveted, as underlined when a Shenzhen-based firm trading under the same Chinese characters was caught offering its services online in 2015.

This sweep of lucrative Chinese deals was arranged under the watch of Andrea Vella, Goldman s former co-head of investment banking for Asia excluding Japan.

However, this month Mr Vella became the latest Goldman casualty in the 1MDB saga, raising questions over the direction of the bank s top leadership in the region.

The US Department of Justice said recently that an Italian partner at the bank was a co-conspirator in the scheme to embezzle billions from the Malaysian fund. Mr Vella, who is from Rome, has not been charged but was quickly put on leave.

New leadership in Asia

Attention has now focused on Todd Leland, who moved to Hong Kong late last year as the bank s co-president in the region alongside Asia-Pacific securities head James Paradise.

Mr Vella and co-investment banking head Kate Richdale were both moved out of management roles in October, prompting Mr Leland to be appointed as the bank s sole leader for investment banking. The posting is Mr Leland s first in Asia, and it is viewed as a challenge for a banker fresh to the region.

 This is not the job he moved here to do but he s been doing it for several months,  a Goldman colleague said.

The 1MDB case still threatens to produce more ugly surprises for Goldman. The group s shares in the US took their sharpest one-day dive since 2011 earlier this month after Malaysia s finance minister said it would seek a refund on the billions lost in the scandal. The bigger worry for Mr Leland and his colleagues is that the reputational damage it suffers could be even more expensive.

A business built over decades has been hit hard by dealings that threaten the bank's ambitions elsewhere in south-east Asia   but China beckons

The action for one of the biggest scandals in Goldman Sachs' history is centred in the US, where prosecutors have charged two of the bank's former executives with money laundering and bribing foreign officials.

Back in Asia, the Malaysian corruption scandal is still unfolding. The question now is how deep the rot goes and how serious the damage will be to Goldman's wider business in the region, which the bank has built over decades.

Do things the 'Asian way'

The impact of the 1MDB scandal has been swift. Tim Leissner, the former Goldman partner who has pleaded guilty to crimes in connection to the 1MDB scandal, left Goldman in 2016, by which time the bank had already started to pull back in the region.

In 2013 it ranked number two in investment banking for fees in southeast Asia but only two years later, after the public eruption of the scandal, it had fallen to number 24, according to data from Refinitiv.

Alex Turnbull was a trader at Goldman's Singapore office in 2012 and 2013, the time the bank advised 1MDB, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at the heart of the scandal. Mr Turnbull, son of Malcolm Turnbull, former Australian prime minister, is scathing in his assessment of the bank's approach to the region.

Bankers in the region argue that as long as Malaysia's ruling coalition, which ousted Mr Najib, 1MDB's founder, in May elections, is in power, Goldman is likely to be shut out of the country, even if it reimburses the bond fees.

"They've been persona non grata for some time," said one senior banker in the region. "The government-linked companies haven't touched them for ages. The only good client they really had apart from 1MDB in Malaysia was Ananda Krishnan, but you haven't seen him using them either." Mr Ananda, a tycoon, could not be reached for comment.

Goldman's office in Malaysia has been slashed in size, with just an asset management team remaining, according to a person familiar with the matter. Yusof Yaacob, the bank's former chairman of investment banking in Malaysia, left in 2014 to join Deutsche Bank as chief country officer.

Since the 1MDB scandal came to light in 2015, Goldman's name has been noticeably absent from sizeable deals done by large Malaysian investors, such as Khazanah, the sovereign wealth fund. Nor has it won significant business from Temasek and GIC, the largest investors in neighbouring Singapore, during that time, according to a list of large merger and acquisition deals on which the bank has worked.

Instead its clientele in Malaysia has included smaller groups such as Australia-listed iProperty, and Navis Capital Partners, a private equity house. It has also worked on a few inbound deals, such as Bank of China (Hong Kong)'s investment in Malaysia.

The flurry of south-east Asia deals under Mr Leissner stood out in the bank's broader Asia business, which has focused most of its resources on China.

China focus endures

Goldman has brought in about $640m this year in fees from Asia excluding Japan, putting it behind Bank of China and Citic. Business from China accounts for just over half of that income   a 40 per cent increase on all of last year and a record high for the bank.

The bank made early inroads into China, forging ties with some of the country's most important financiers. It underwrote the initial public offering of Tsingtao Brewery in 1993, the first flotation of a Chinese company on the Hong Kong stock exchange, presaging tens of billions of dollars in similar deals.

In 2004 it struck a deal with Fang Fenglei, the powerful Chinese financier, for one of the first foreign securities joint ventures in the country. This arrangement, brokered by Henry Paulson, then chief executive, was hailed as a breakthrough in China, ushering in several similar joint ventures by rivals.

"The China presence for global banks matters for perception, and because you're bringing in global clients and local knowhow," said George Kuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition, the financial services data provider.

The escalating 1MDB scandal has not dissuaded China's largest state groups from hiring Goldman. It worked on Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.6bn public flotation in 2016 and ChemChina's $44bn acquisition of Syngenta, the Swiss agro-business group, in the same year.

Its brand is highly coveted, as underlined when a Shenzhen-based company trading under the same Chinese characters was caught offering its services online in 2015.

This sweep of lucrative Chinese deals was arranged under the watch of Andrea Vella, Goldman's former co-head of investment banking for Asia excluding Japan.

However, this month Mr Vella became the latest Goldman casualty in the 1MDB saga, raising questions over the direction of the bank's top leadership in the region.

The US Department of Justice said recently that an Italian partner at the bank was a co-conspirator in the scheme to embezzle billions from the Malaysian fund. Mr Vella, who is from Rome, has not been charged but was quickly put on leave.

New leadership in Asia

Attention has now focused on Todd Leland, who moved to Hong Kong late last year as the bank's co-president in the region alongside James Paradise, head of Asia-Pacific securities.

Mr Vella and Kate Richdale, coinvestment banking head, were both moved out of management roles in October, prompting Mr Leland to be appointed as the bank's sole leader for investment banking. The posting is Mr Leland's first in Asia, and it is viewed as a challenge for a banker fresh to the region.

"This is not the job he moved here to do but he's been doing it for several months," a Goldman colleague said.

The 1MDB case still threatens to produce more ugly surprises for Goldman. The group's shares in the US took their sharpest one-day dive since 2011 earlier this month after Malaysia's finance ministry said that it would seek a refund on the billions lost in the scandal.

The bigger worry for Mr Leland and his colleagues is that the reputational damage it suffers could be even more expensive.

Power unit failure at ABB shows need to generate vital spark

T he strange and cumbersome corporate beast that is the industrial conglomerate must adapt or die. In the US, General Electric's share price has collapsed since its power equipment division slumped to a loss and concerns grew about its financial health.

In Switzerland, speculation swirls over Zurich-based ABB, which is in talks with Japan's Hitachi about divesting all or part of its power grids division. In the limelight is Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB's German-born boss since 2013. A company veteran, he transformed ABB's robotics division, which is its fastest growing unit.

As chief executive he has cut costs and focused the group, which has annual sales of $34bn, around industrial automation and electrification, robotics and power grids.

Yet ABB continues to underwhelm investors. Its share price has fallen 20 per cent over the past year, compared with 13 per cent at Siemens, its German rival (GE is down 55 per cent).

Two years ago, Mr Spiesshofer resisted calls for a break-up from Cevian Capital, the European activist investor that holds a 5 per cent stake. More recently, his mind appears to have changed.

News about a possible sale of the power grid division initially lifted ABB's share price; investors prefer simpler companies doing fewer things. That might appear to be further evidence of the weaknesses of a conglomerate model, but ABB's actions could also be demonstrating that the species can adapt and become fit for the future.

The case against conglomerates is that market efficiencies are greater when shareholders select their own portfolio mix. The argument for is, partly, that bringing businesses under one roof creates synergies, such as through sharing clients or supply chains, and that experienced managers are better at knowing whether, when and how to reshuffle portfolios.

Despite their unwieldy reputation, industrial conglomerates can be surprisingly agile. My favourite example is Mannesmann, the German steel pipe maker, which in the late 1990s transformed itself into a telecoms company and was then bought by the UK's Vodafone for 112bn.

Despite their Currently, portfolio management is in full swing at the world's biggest conglomerates. GE is shedding businesses in a frantic attempt to raise cash and refocus.

unwieldy reputation, conglomerates can be agile In a more orderly fashion, Siemens is overhauling its ailing power and gas unit while awaiting regulatory approval for a railway merger with France's Alstom.

Action is needed at ABB even though it avoided the pitfalls into which GE tumbled, quitting the power generation sector, which is weighing on GE and Siemens, in 2000.

Unlike GE, ABB has not moved into financial services.

Nor has it obviously overpaid significantly for recent acquisitions or fallen victim to management hubris. "GE are great at marketing   they are also great at bullshitting," said one Swiss company watcher. But Mr Spiesshofer has failed to restore to ABB the sustained growth needed to secure his job as chief executive. Under him, the Swiss group has earned a reputation for promising a turning point, only to disappoint. Revenues have been broadly flat over the past four years as Mr Spiesshofer has chopped out less profitable bits of the business.

Spinning off the power grid division   or ideas for a more radical ABB break-up that have been floated by some analysts   would not solve that strategic challenge directly.

Mr Spiesshofer has previously cited the costs of carving out the power grid unit. Industrial infrastructure companies also need global clout in markets.

James Stettler, analyst at Barclays, said: "I worry about infrastructure businesses [such as power grids] which are exposed to China because China is becoming an increasingly powerful competitor. If a buyer came along, great; if not, would it really be better outside ABB?" Nevertheless, a portfolio reshuffle could see ABB's shares trading nearer the higher multiples of "purer" industrial companies.

A portfolio shake-up would also be a chance to strengthen ABB in the growth markets of the future   using the proceeds, for instance, to fund a big push into artificial intelligence.

ABB watchers have also identified a need to invest more in marketing; the group's conservative approach to salesmanship stands in contrast with GE's chutzpah.

To survive in the jungle, a threatened beast has sometimes to make a leap.

Crispin Odey s bets on falling stocks helped his fund gain 7% last month

The stock market correction of the past two months has been painful for many investors, but a small group of bearish hedge fund managers believe their time has arrived.

These traders, who have been positioned for a slump and suffered as markets rose, are making hay and see further trouble ahead.

 There s a lot [for investors] to get worried about,  Crispin Odey, founding partner at Odey Asset Management, told the Financial Times.

His fund, which is betting on falling stocks, has gained more than 50 per cent this year, including gains of around 7 per cent last month. That makes it one of the world s top-performing hedge funds this year, but comes after overly bearish positions pushed him to a near-50 per cent loss in 2016.

He said that downwards market momentum is  very difficult to halt  when it is coupled with expensive equity valuations. He added:  The only way it s been halted has been lower interest rates, and that s not an option. 

Mr Odey said  many of the other features of a bear market are present . Those include China s cooling economy and companies  decision to spend gains from US tax cuts on share buybacks rather than capital investment. He added that  Joe Public has got in  to the market, which signals it s  the beginning of bad times .

Other managers also see reason for gloom.

 I think the cliff is near,  said Francesco Filia, founder of London-based Fasanara Capital, who has been predicting a market crash. He believes markets have been driven by crowded trades, such as buying exchange traded funds and selling volatility, during the bull market. That, he believes, has made the structure of the market fragile and is pushing it closer to a major correction.

His funds delivered gains of as much as 10 per cent for October and are up as much as 30 per cent so far this year.

The S&P 500 is down around a tenth from its all-time high hit in September, on the back of a rise in US interest rates and concerns about the technology sector.

The FTSE 100, meanwhile, wrestling with its own Brexit-related issues, hit its high back in May and has fallen 12 per cent since then, including a large drop early last month.

The sell-off has hit many hedge funds hard. They suffered their worst month of performance in seven years in October, according to data group HFR. Many are now in the red for the year, with funds on average down 1.7 per cent to the end of October.

Lansdowne Partners, for instance, which runs around $20bn, lost 5.4 per cent in its flagship Developed Markets fund last month, according to numbers sent to investors and seen by the FT. That fund is now down 5.6 per cent for the year.

Man GLG s European Long Short fund, meanwhile, lost 2.7 per cent last month and is down 4.2 per cent for the year. A spokeswoman for Man declined to comment.

Other funds, however, are profiting. North Asset Management s North Emerging Markets fund was up 8 per cent in October, driven by gains in some of its short positions. That brings its year-to-date returns to 10.4 per cent.

However Mr Filia, whose fund uses artificial intelligence and bets against ETFs in a bid to profit from large market falls, believes there is much further for the market to drop.

He says there is a one in four chance that the S&P will fall 40 per cent from its peak in the coming months, and a one in two chance that a decline of that scale will happen in the next two years.

 Nothing has happened yet,  he said.

Good day. Little progress is being made as women seek to close the gap in fundraising for their startups. What if venture-capital firms made a pledge to write more checks to female founders?

That's the premise guiding the Billion Dollar Fund for Women, an initiative that aims to address gender inequity in the world-wide startup ecosystem. In well under a year, the group says it is already halfway toward its goal of securing $1 billion in commitments from venture and angel groups toward the effort.

The fund was founded by investors and entrepreneurs Shelly Porges, Sarah Chen, Anousheh Ansari, Nadereh Chamlou and Anu Jain. Among the U.S. institutional firms that have earmarked funds for female founders are Fusion Fund, Rethink and Springboard Growth Capital. Now that sounds like progress.

Also a heads up on publishing: VC Daily will take a break for the holiday weekend and the newsletter will resume on Monday. Happy Thanksgiving from all of us at Pro VC.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Vietnam foray: Two years in the making, 500 Startups has closed a $14.1 million fund focused on Vietnamese startups. The fund is the first the firm has closed since co-founder Dave McClure resigned in 2017, according to a spokesperson for 500 Startups. It also comes after the firm last year ran into some headwinds overseas and halted fundraising for some of its funds. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

Constructive deal: Autodesk Inc. said it has acquired PlanGrid Inc., a creator of software for the construction industry, for $875 million. PlanGrid, based in San Francisco, had raised $69 million in funding since 2012 from investors including Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital and Tenaya Capital. WSJ Pro's Christopher Zinsli has more.

Latest SoftBank megadeal: Coupang, an e-commerce company that aims to be the Amazon.com of South Korea, has raised $2 billion in new funding from SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund. The funding, which marks the latest megadeal for SoftBank, valued Coupang at $9 billion post-money, according to a person familiar with the matter. Coupang's revenue is approaching $5 billion in 2018, double what it generated two years ago, according to Bom Kim, the founder and chief executive of Coupang. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has more.

Geron's Take: Privacy Alternatives to Big Tech's Cloud Services

By Tomio Geron

Consumer data has moved to the cloud and created a bonanza for tech companies. But that movement could shift back in the opposite direction, as consumers seek to secure their own data, rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations.

After the Snowden revelations on surveillance, Facebook's data breach, and countless hacks of consumer data, the public wants alternatives.

One of the most common examples is Signal, the encrypted messaging app that people use without fear of being monitored.

Now there's a new startup called Helm, which provides a device that people can use in their home to keep their email, calendar and contacts stored and accessible from a home server. Helm was seed funded by Initialized, Liquid 2, Fuel Capital and Tuesday Capital.

More in Geron's Take.

Exits

Wireless broadband services provider Airspan Networks Inc. has acquired peer Mimosa Networks Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Mimosa was backed by New Enterprise Associates and Oak Investment Partners.

VC Funds

Early-stage investor Story Ventures has set out to raise up to $40 million for its second fund, according to a regulatory filing. No commitments have been received for Story Ventures II LP, the filing indicates. The New York-based firm scored an exit in April when Adobe Systems Inc. acquired voice app platform Sayspring Inc.

New Money

Elon Musk's SpaceX raised $250 million from its first-ever high-yield loan sale, shrinking the size of the loan by $500 million after the company encountered a mixed reception from investors and worsening credit-market conditions. Read more.

Rare-disease drug developer PellePharm Inc. has gained $70 million through a collaboration with LEO Pharma that gives the Danish dermatology company an option to buy PellePharm for up to $690 million. PellePharm's topical drug, patidegib, is set to enter late-stage clinical trials in early 2019 with a goal of preventing skin lesions. Read more.

IBM Executive Named As Nielsen's New Chief

Nielsen Holdings PLC appointed David Kenny as chief executive as the ratings and data giant continues to review its strategic options amid activist pressure to either sell or spin off parts of its assets.

Mr. Kenny comes from International Business Machines Corp., where he served as senior vice president of cognitive solutions.

The 57-year-old will join Nielsen on Dec. 3, succeeding veteran Mitch Barns, who has been at the helm since 2014 and said in July that he would retire at the end of the year.

A longtime ad and technology executive, Mr. Kenny joins Nielsen at a critical juncture. The company began a full strategic review of its business in September, amid pressure to sell itself from activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which took an 8.4% stake in the company earlier this year.

The New York-based research company, which has a market capitalization of $9.1 billion, has come under pressure over the past few years because of changes in consumers' media habits, which include the rise of video consumption on mobile devices.

Nielsen's business includes media and television ratings operations, which is dubbed its "watch" segment, and its "buy" division, which tracks purchases of groceries and other consumer products.

The buy segment has been a weak spot, hampered by the changing retail environment and challenges that consumer-product companies face from new consumer tastes and shopping habits. Nielsen's stock has declined about 30% over the past year.

"There has never been a more important time for measurement and analytics around media and to have a trusted intermediary," Mr. Kenny said in an interview.

Nielsen Executive Chairman James Attwood said Mr. Kenny was chosen for his understanding of advertisers and his experience in artificial intelligence, big data and cloud technologies.

Encore (A Special Report) --- Banks Look for Mental Decline: Financial institutions are monitoring older customers for any early signs

By Lisa Ward 
1,090 words
21 November 2018
The Wall Street Journal
J

Banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions are starting to monitor older customers for mental capacity and susceptibility to fraud.

But then the question is this: Once a financial institution suspects that a customer is becoming cognitively impaired or increasingly at risk of fraud, what does it do with this information?

Financial exploitation of seniors is an underreported problem. The Securities and Exchange Commission released a report in June which said as much as 6.6% of the elderly in the U.S. had experienced financial exploitation in the previous 12 months.

Missed payments, duplicate checks and confusion about balances, meanwhile, can be the earliest signs that a customer is in cognitive decline, and thus at greater risk. Some financial institutions are beginning to share their misgivings with family members and government officials when they see warning signs.

Until recently many institutions thought privacy laws prevented them from taking these actions unless they suspected illicit activity. Some were unclear whether they should contact agencies, like Adult Protective Services, not traditionally considered law enforcement, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors.

A new federal regulation, signed into law in May, protects financial institutions from litigation should they report concerns about financial exploitation of seniors to government agencies. The regulation does not require that such concerns be reported.

But some experts would like the institutions to go further, and share such concerns about possible fraud and financial exploitation with one another (as they do in money-laundering cases). For example, legislative changes could allow financial institutions to share information about financial exploitation via the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The system is currently used to share data about money laundering and terrorist financing. The hope is that by catching cognitive changes early on, customers can be saved from losing part or all of their life savings.

"The crime just doesn't happen at one institution -- it happens across accounts and across institutions," says Larry Santucci, senior research fellow, Consumer Finance Institute at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank. Mr. Santucci researches how financial institutions could better share information about elder fraud.

"Reporting obligations vary by state and can be murky," he says. State law can also dictate how institutions respond. For instance, more than a dozen states allow investment advisory firms to place temporary holds on requests to disperse funds if financial exploitation is suspected. But there is no requirement to do so.

"Clients have a right to make poor financial decisions," says Marguerite DeLiema, a research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity, who says financial institutions can find themselves in a delicate balancing act since they are also required to follow clients' instructions.

While responsibility to report on the mental health of aging customers remains somewhat of a gray area, some companies are beefing up efforts to detect trouble spots. For example, with more computing power and software driven by artificial intelligence, banks now can monitor vast amounts of data and account activity that may reveal cognitive declines, or signs that a customer may be a victim of criminal activity, such as uncharacteristic withdrawals or ATM transactions in the middle of the night.

Some institutions are using machine learning -- computer programs that find patterns and take actions based on crunching massive amounts of customer data -- to identify which accounts are most vulnerable.

Researchers at University College Dublin used machine learning to sift through 250 million transactions involving accounts of customers over age 70 at a major U.S. financial institution. According to a recent report on the results, the institution's previous fraud-detection system had sent out 19,395 alerts to clients based on suspicious activity -- though human analysts afterward deemed only 74 of the incidents truly suspicious. By contrast, the machine-learning algorithm independently sent out 8,340 alerts, and identified 66 of those 74 suspicious activities as well as three other fraudulent cases initially missed by the analysts.

"This constitutes a very significant saving in terms of human resources, resources which can be better spent focusing on assessing suspicious cases to establish whether or not they are fraudulent," says Prof. Cal B. Muckley, a co-author of the paper and the department chair in operational risk, banking and finance at University College Dublin.

Financial institutions also are training staff, especially those who interact with customers, to spot red flags and question unusual patterns of behavior. But sometimes discussing such problems directly with customers can be difficult.

"Customers are often in denial or embarrassed," says Laurel Sykes, chief risk officer at California's Montecito Bank & Trust, adding the goal is to get someone to slow down and grasp what is happening before the money walks out the door.

Many organizations are asking new clients for emergency contacts should anything go wrong. And financial institutions are sometimes asking older clients if they want to allow family members to view their accounts without the ability to make financial decisions as an added layer of protection.

But sometimes relatives are the perpetrators of fraud. The National Adult Protective Services Association, a nonprofit focused on mistreatment of the elderly and other vulnerable adults, estimates that 90% of elder financial exploitation is committed by family members, caretakers or a trusted professional.

As a further protection, some say health-care professionals should be notified when an older financial client begins to show signs of cognitive decline. Jason Karlawish, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, says this would give the doctors another way to diagnose cognitive decline, and better protect account holders.

Trouble on the Line

If a telemarketer uses one of these lines, often heard in attempts to defraud seniors, just say 'No, thanks,' and hang up:

'You must act now'

'You've won a "free" gift, vacation, or prize (but you have to pay for "postage and handling" or other charges)'

'You must send money, give a credit card or bank account number, or have a check picked up by courier'

'You don't need to check out the company with anyone'

'You don't need any written information about the company or their references'

'You can't afford to miss this "high-profit, no-risk" offer'

Slowing global growth, a slide in cryptocurrencies and trade wars cloud outlook for sector

When Apple, the world's most valuable company, revealed this month that it would no longer disclose how many iPhones or Macs it sells, talk of 'peak iPhone' swirled around the market.

Although a seemingly minor reporting adjustment, the change reflects a broader concern that demand for smartphones is falling, sending shockwaves through the global semiconductor sector and other parts of the iPhone supply chain.

That, combined with other problems from falling cryptocurrency values to global trade wars, has prompted questions over whether the once high-flying semiconductor industry is facing a longterm, structural slide.

"In the last couple years, semiconductors along with  & other tech stocks have done really well," said Michael Arone, US-based chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "They have had high growth rates and they have been beneficiaries of mobile phone, tablets and gaming."

He added: "People are concerned the revenue growth won't live up to expectations  & If folks are not upgrading their devices at the same rate   whether phones or tablets or gaming   if the rate of replacement is slower, it is going to be an important signal that the economy is slowing."

The sector was dealt a huge blow yesterday when Chinese authorities claimed to have uncovered "massive evidence" of antitrust violations by three of the world's top memory chip manufacturers.

Officials in Beijing said an investigation into South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, and US-based Micron had made "important progress". The three companies account for more than 95 per cent of the world's supply of DRAM memory chips.

Fears of slowing global economic growth, mounting trade tension between the US and China, a bear market in Chinese equities, and the slide in cryptocurrency prices are also driving investors to cut risk, leading them to trim exposure to technology and semiconductor stocks that are more sensitive to the economy.

In the past few weeks, shares in some of the world's biggest semiconductor companies such Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics and Advanced Micro Devices in the US have dropped, as investors chop their holdings.

Those falls came after a string of companies in the sector issued weak thirdquarter earnings, pointing to an oversupply of memory chips and waning demand for products that use them.

Samsung Electronics, one of the largest technology groups in Asia, warned at the end of October of a decline in the price of memory chips due to China's rapid capacity expansion. The alarm bell was sounded even as the electronics group, which derives 80 per cent of its profits from memory chips, posted a record quarter for earnings.

Even the slide in the price of cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin falling from a high above $19,000 last year to below $6,000, is having a detrimental impact. TSMC, one of the largest technology companies in Asia, said in its thirdquarter earnings that "continued weakness in cryptocurrency mining demand" would offset some of its growth in the fourth quarter.

On Thursday, shares in US company Nvidia, which makes gaming chips, fell as much as 17 per cent after the company missed revenue expectations, which it blamed on the 'crypto hangover' resulting from growing chip stockpiles as cryptomining activity tapers off. Investors have also aired deeper concerns over the potential impact of a long trade war between the US and China.

"A lot of stocks have been punished during the trade tension, so any reversal should see a relief rally in the short term," said William Yuen, a fund manager at Invesco, based in Hong Kong. Despite the immediate headwinds, investors said the longer-term case for semiconductors was attractive, in part due to the growing demand for them in sectors such as autos and industrials, which are increasingly turning to robotics and artificial intelligence. Chris Retzler, portfolio manager at Needham Funds, said semiconductors are a barometer of the broader economy.

"Semis continue to play an ever increasing role in  & all of our lives," he added. "We are seeing semis more widely used in industrial areas like healthcare, energy, automobiles."

The share price weakness might provide an attractive entry point for investors who believe in the growth story. "Samsung is arguably the cheapest large-cap tech stock in all of Asia right now," said Oliver Cox, a fund manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. "Memory storage chips remain the primary source of profits and Samsung is the dominant global leader in the memory market in terms of share, profitability and technological capability.

"Current market conditions provide a classic test of investors' long-term convictions. We have been increasing largecap tech exposure at the margin." Still, investors are aware of the likelihood of further share price falls in the coming months, against a backdrop of geopolitical and economic uncertainty.

Casey McLean, an investment analyst at Fidelity International, said there was likely to be further falls in share prices as companies cut profit guidance. He said that the sector was about two-thirds of the way through the sell-off. "This coincides with the inventory cycle, which has built up amid demand weakness. It will take a few quarters to run down."

Investors will be watching the coming G20 meeting for signs of a reconciliation between China and the US, although any warm words will be treated with scepticism as investors brace for a new set of trade tariffs at the start of next year.

'If folks are not upgrading their devices at the same rate, it is going to be an important signal the economy is slowing '

The rise of  quantamental  investing: where man and machine meet

Asset managers adopt new approach in era defined by automation, algorithms and big data

As soon as the financial crisis started to recede, Jordi Visser knew something had to change. Algorithms were starting to rule markets, and hedge funds like the one he managed were confronting a tougher era.

So Mr Visser, chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, started to rethink how the $1.7bn hedge fund could survive in a less hospitable environment. The solution was to evolve and meld man and machine.  We are competing against computers these days, so we had to become more efficient,  Mr Visser said.

Mr Visser and Weiss are not the only ones making some adjustments  with varying degrees of gusto   to a new investing era defined more by automation, algorithms and big data.

Analysts have dubbed marrying quantitative and fundamental investing  quantamental , an admittedly ugly phrase, but one that many think will define the future of the asset management industry.

These initiatives are proliferating across the investing world, from small boutiques to sprawling asset management empires. In January, JPMorgan s $1.7tn investment arm set up a new data lab in its  intelligent digital solutions  division to try to improve its portfolio managers, rather than replace them entirely with algorithms.

 It augments existing expertise. We don t just 	. 	. 	. 	try to come up with strategies out of thin air,  said Ravit Mandell, JPMorgan Asset Management s chief data scientist.  There s stuff that happens in the human brain that is so hard to replicate. 

The 18-strong unit focuses on everything from automating and improving humdrum tasks such as pitch books and digital tools for customers, to more high-end demands such as product creation and improving JPMorgan s investing prowess.

The data unit has already used a form of artificial intelligence known as a neural network to analyse years of corporate earnings call transcripts to identify which words are particularly sensitive for markets, or might augur trouble.

That frequent uses of  great  and  congratulations  are generally good for a stock price, and talk of debt covenants and inventory overhangs are bad, might be obvious to any human fund manager, but they can only listen to or read a limited number of transcripts. A machine can scour thousands.

JPMorgan Asset Management s data scientists are creating an alert system that will ping its portfolio managers whenever transcripts are particularly positive or negative, and voice analytics that mean they can even detect worrying signals in someone s intonation.

Some investment groups are starting to use technology to spot well-known behavioural biases. For example, Essentia Analytics crunches individual trading data and looks for common foibles, such as fund managers  tendency to over-trade when on a losing streak, or hang on to poor investments for too long to avoid crystallising losses. When that happens, fund managers get sent an automated but personalised email signed  your future self  reminding them to be aware of these pitfalls.

 A computer can remind you to follow your own process,  said Clare Flynn Levy, Essentia s founder.  It s like a little light on your car dashboard flickering to remind you you re running out of oil. 

Weiss s chief data scientist Charles Crow has built something similar for the hedge fund: a digital  baseball card  system that analyses and ranks its portfolio managers according to 17 parameters, such as stale positions or movements in correlations, and alerts them to any issues.

In parallel, Weiss s top managers have a dashboard to allocate money to various teams, showing which ones are good at timing, but poorer at portfolio construction, or are expert stockpickers but have sectoral biases. This helps Mr Visser monitor for hints of crowded trades.

There are plenty of  quantamental  sceptics. Many pure quants are doubtful that traditional asset managers can master anything but the rudimentary, commoditised parts of their craft. Meanwhile, many traditional investors argue that it is an overhyped fad that is feeding short-termism.

Even fans admit that the cultural shift needed to fully embrace these new techniques by largely middle-aged investors is so significant that it could take years before the full potential of  quantamental  investing is realised.

 Behavioural change is the hardest part,  said Ms Flynn Levy, herself a former money manager.  I think an entire generation of fund managers have to age out of the industry before we really see big changes. 

Nonetheless, few money management executives doubt that technology will play an ever-increasing role, and many are hopeful about the potential to invigorate the industry s often patchy investment results.

For example, it appears to have helped Weiss last month, when many hedge funds were clobbered after having been sucked into technology stocks. Mr Visser declined to comment on performance, but an investor document seen by the Financial Times indicates that Weiss s main fund sidestepped most of October s torrid markets, and is up 6.3 per cent so far this year.

Mr Visser admitted that not all the hedge fund s portfolio managers were thrilled at the new measurements, tools and expectations, but argued that the quantitative tools were fair, objective and necessary.  They either want to get better and embrace it, or they fight it,  he said.  But it s a case of adapt or die.

 " La Bottega del Calzolaio Date founded: 1916 Country: Italy In 1916, Luca Del Vecchio opened a shoe repair shop in a small town near Salerno, southern Italy. Nearly a century later, his great-great nephews started using online market places to sell their handmade leather shoes and accessories. This revolutionised La Bottega del Calzolaio's productivity at a time when the country's independent businesses were struggling to stay afloat.

Orazio Del Vecchio (pictured) and his brother (also named Luca) grew up playing with leather in the family shop and became the fourth generation to take over the family business. In 2013, they set up an eBay store and increased turnover by 400 per cent in three years. The online transition was "an intuitive move to keep up with times", says Orazio.

Digitalisation not only boosted the brand's artisanal reputation but helped to market the "Made In Italy" products overseas. La Bottega del Calzolaio's own website has been operating since 2016, offering twice as many products as are available on the bricks-and-mortar store shelves. "It's an ancient profession, but it can be digitised and innovated, and it's far from disappearing," says Luca.

Today, the 10-strong online team works across different areas from digital management, shipping and customer care to graphic design and content. Luca and Orazio still place great importance on communicating with customers, but now use technology to do so, harnessing social networks and digital channels. They also plan to open international stores.

 " Asti Technologies Date founded: 1982 Country: Spain Vernica Pascual took over as chief executive of the family business based in Burgos, northern Spain, in 2006, and began a project to dramatically increase sales and expand overseas. The company had already created automated vehicles to help its customers move goods around factories and warehouses, but Pascual began to develop these further.

Asti became a European leader in making automated guided vehicles   robots that can ferry goods around industrial facilities. Asti's driverless forklifts and trailers can move everything from single crates and pallets to loads of several tonnes, guided by magnets, lasers and sensors.

In 2008, Pascual acquired all of Asti's shares and started a process of internationalising the business, signing deals with multinationals in the wiring, food and automotive sectors and opening an international sales office in Buenos Aires. The company now operates in 16 countries and since 2011 more than half of its profits have come from international sales.

It employs more than 230 people, including a large research department. Asti works with universities and research centres, such as Germany's Fraunhofer institute and Spain's Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology. Asti's Talent and Technology Foundation runs training for the company's staff and programmes to engage young people in technology and science.

 " Mycujoo Date founded: 2014 Country: Switzerland Welcome to the world of democratised football. On Mycujoo, any club, league or federation, however small, can broadcast their games to a worldwide audience. The online platform not only streams live matches in 65 countries across six continents but is expanding into other major sports.

For years, Pedro Presa   a lifelong fan of Portuguese football club, Boavista   struggled to find television coverage of third division matches. Top premier leagues took up most network space, leaving minor divisions, amateur leagues and women's football with next to no air time. After doing a masters in sports management and law, he teamed up in 2014 with his brother, Joo, an engineer in the oil and gas industry, and founded Mycujoo.

"Our platform is 100 per cent dedicated to football and our technology allows us to do this in a user-generated environment," says Joo (pictured in the black shirt with Pedro). For now, Mycujoo does not produce any content itself but provides a platform for 120 federations.

Partnerships with federations such as the Asian Football Confederation and Uefa in Europe have accelerated the platform's growth, and the pair expect to have streamed 20,000 live matches in 2018 alone, up from 4,200 in 2017.

"This is just an evolution of what is happening in other industries like Spotify with music," says Pedro. "We're connecting directly with the consumer to build a very democratic environment, enabling the same to everyone, regardless of location, conditions or financial capacity. Together with the network providers, we can build a far-reaching global community from the Pacific islands to the Himalayas."

The studio team in Zurich adds data to the live streams in real time, making match highlights easier to find and follow. "Every moment is connected to our Fifa standard unique ID database system, so every tag refers to a country, competition, club, team and even player involved in the moment," says Pedro. If a footballer gets a yellow card or scores a goal, it is automatically collected into a lifetime passport of their player history.

Next year, Mycujoo is expanding beyond football, launching a hockey spin-off after signing a five-year contract with the International Hockey Federation. "With the platform and tagging technology, we are on the way to becoming the biggest football community and sport network in the world," says Joo.

Nielsen Holdings Names IBM's David Kenny as CEO; Ratings and data company is under pressure to sell or spin off assets

Nielsen Holdings PLC appointed David Kenny as chief executive as the ratings and data giant continues to review its strategic options amid activist pressure to either sell or spin off parts of its assets.

Mr. Kenny comes from International Business Machines Corp., where he served as senior vice president of cognitive solutions. The 57-year-old will join Nielsen on Dec. 3, succeeding veteran Mitch Barns, who has been at the helm since 2014 and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nielsen-ceo-to-leave-at-end-of-year-1532603179" at the end of the year.

A longtime ad and technology executive, Mr. Kenny joins Nielsen at a critical juncture. The company began a full strategic review of its business in September, amid "https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-elliott-management-to-push-nielsen-holdings-to-sell-1534131900"Elliott Management Corp., which took an 8.4% stake in company earlier this year.

The New York-based research company, which has a market capitalization of $9.1 billion, has come under pressure over the past few years because of changes in consumers' media habits, which include the rise of video consumption on mobile devices.

Nielsen's business includes media and television ratings operations, which is dubbed its "watch" segment, and its "buy" division, which tracks purchases of groceries and other consumer products. The buy segment has been a weak spot, hampered by the changing retail environment and challenges that consumer-product companies face from new consumer tastes and shopping habits. Nielsen's stock has declined about 30% over the past year.

"There has never been a more important time for measurement and analytics around media and to have a trusted intermediary," Mr. Kenny said in an interview. There is also a "great need for advertisers to better understand where they are spending their money and what is working and what is not."

Nielsen Executive Chairman James Attwood said Mr. Kenny was chosen for his understanding of advertisers and his experience in artificial intelligence, big data and cloud technologies. Mr. Kenny has strong relationships with brands and media and technology companies, which he honed during his many years as a top executive at advertising giant Publicis Groupe SA.

Mr. Kenny also has connections to many private-equity companies, which may come in handy because such firms have expressed interest in Nielsen.

"Right now, I work for the public shareholders; if the best way to serve them is to go private, I don't have any issues with that," Mr. Kenny said. "I am very comfortable in either world."

Nielsen was taken private in 2006 by several buyout firms "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704739504576068414132006314".

Mr. Kenny said he would work to speed up the pace of the strategic review. "I have done this before, and I know the players," he added.

Before IBM, Mr. Kenny was CEO of the Weather Co., a weather-forecasting and information-technology company. Mr. Kenny sold the digital and data assets of Weather Co. to IBM in 2015.

Chernova's Take: Employee Activism Could Be Minefield for Defense Work

By Yuliya Chernova

The U.S. government's need to collaborate with the technology industry could clash with the reality of tech employees' activism, which sometimes takes aim at work with the military.

A new report by the National Defense Strategy Commission urges the Pentagon to work "assiduously to expand relationships with firms and industries including some that have been ambivalent or reluctant about working with the U.S. government."

There are plenty of recent examples of technology companies running into employee resistance to their work with the government.

One way companies can anticipate employee resistance is by setting a clear mission that focuses on the positive aspects of defense work.

As the climate turns, ESG powers into mainstream

Sustainability will become core says BlackRock but nagging doubts persist, write Attracta Mooneyand Peter Smith

When Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, outlined plans for the $6tn fund house to become a leader in sustainable investing, he was outspoken about the prospects for funds that use environmental, social and governance criteria.

"Sustainable investing will be a core component for how everyone invests," he told the Financial Times last month."We are only at the earlystages."

The boss of the world's largest asset manager is not the only one who believes ESG investing will grow rapidly. Asset managers worldwide are piling in, launchingESGfunds or integrating sustainable investing across various asset classes.

Assets under management in portfolios that use sustainable investing grewmore than600per cent to $23tn in the ten years to the end of 2016, according to a report fromthe Global Sustainable InvestmentAlliance But as asset managers embrace ESG, there are questions over whether the investment case is solid. There are also fears that some asset managers are piling in because of ESG'spopularityandthat their lack of expertise may lead to disappointing returns.

An ESG specialist says: "There is a big danger that the massive spike in attention is diluting what ESG means."

For decades, responsible investing was a tiny part of asset management, often reserved for religious investors. The focus was typically on excluding "sin stocks", such as tobacco companies.

This has changed as corporate scandals, including the Volkswagen emissions cheating issue, led to sharp share price falls. Investors questioned whether ESG issues could affect a company'sperformance.

AHarvardBusiness School studyin 2015   Corporate Sustainability: First Evidence on Materiality   marked a turning point in how investors viewed ESG. Its analysis of stock returns found that "firms with good performance on material sustainability issues significantly outperform firms with poor performance on these issues, suggesting that investments in sustainability issues are shareholder-value enhancing".

Other studies also conclude that ESG investing is beneficial. Hermes, the UK asset manager, said this month that companies with good or improving social characteristics tend to outperform by an average of 15 basis points amonth.

A 2015 study of studies, which examined 2,200 pieces of research, found that the "business case for ESG investing is empirically very well founded".

Jamie Carter, chief executive ofUK asset manager Oldfield Partners, last year found that companies with repeated ESG violations performed poorly but that shareholder engagement after a bad ESG event worked well.

Despite such studies, however, many people believe the robustness of ESG returns requires more researchrooted inexperience.

Onechallenge is thatESG,sustainable investing, responsible investing and impact investing are ill-defined, making it difficult to see if they addvalue.

Paul Lee, who has specialised in in ESG for various companies, says: "The evidence of ESG adding value is a bit flaky. It is blurredbythe fact that it is ill-defined." Despite this, he says sustainable investing "absolutely" does add value. "The question is what time horizon areyoulooking at."

Masja Zandbergen, head of ESG integration at Robeco, the Dutch asset manager, says that data looking at value added by ESG are not as robust as that for other aspects of investing."We see there is value but it is not as strong yet as it is for some of the traditional [financial] factors," she says.

Ms Zandbergen adds, however, that many issues have to be addressed globally, ranging from climate change to inequity to cyber security."[These] are leading to change in markets and regulation that is affecting companies.Taking these issues into account leads to better long-term investmentdecisions," she says.

I personally believe it will be stronger, just because of the overwhelminggrowthindemand."

And in London this week, 26members of Extinction Rebellion, a civil disobedience group, were arrested after a protest outside Downing Street. They want extreme action to make theUKcarbon neutral by 2025 (Britain's target is 2050) and warn of impendingfood shortages.

Climate change events and greater publicity have spurred demand from investors. A 2017 Morgan Stanley study found that three-quarters of investors, especially millennials and women, were interested in sustainable investing.

Asset managers are approaching ESG in different ways. Some are integratingESGinto wider processes with traditional financial metrics, while others, such as BlackRock, are launching funds with specific responsible investing mandates. Morningstar, the data provider, says launches of open-ended "socially conscious" funds, which includes funds that invest using ESG, rose to 325 in 2017, whichcompares with 135 in 2012.

Is ESG just being used as a marketing tool, though? Accusers say that if an asset manager believes ESG improves returns, it should be rolled out across its entire range. Assetmanagers, however, say incorporating ESGcanbeadrawn-outprocess.

Geir Lode, who leads the global equities team at Hermes, says it has taken theUKassetmanagernearly 10 years to incorporateESG.

Ms Zandbergen believes it "is important to integrate sustainability and not see it as a separate issue" but admits this is "difficult" because of a lack of information. "It has taken us manyyears. It is hard work," she says. She also warns that "without doing the background work" there is a risk of "disappointing results and questions about the benefits"ofESG. Some investors still watch the space warily. A survey of 650 investors with $24tn in assets published by Schroders, the UK asset manager, in September, found that a third of those polled said sustainabil-ity had little to no influence on their decisions. Despite this, three-quarters globally said that investing sustainably would grow in importance over the next fiveyears.

Iain Richards, head of governance and responsible investment at Columbia Threadneedle, the 370bn asset manager, says ESG has an important role in the investment process. "If you look at investing and decisions around capital, ESG is about providing an additional window[of information]."

Israeli disrupter sees opening in high fees charged by American lenders

Israeli-listed Bank Leumi is in talks with potential partners about launching its acclaimed online-only bank Pepper in the US, in what would mark the latest challenge to the high fees that America s main street lenders have enjoyed for decades.

Launched in mid-2017 to  disrupt from the inside , Pepper has won praise for its technology and is opening more accounts per day than its parent bank does across its 250 bricks and mortar branches in Israel.

 We said we wanted to go overseas and we searched wide,  Rakefet Russak-Aminoach, Bank Leumi s chief executive, told the Financial Times in New York, adding that the desire to expand was influenced by inquiries from foreign banks and potential partners.

After looking at markets including the UK and India, the US was chosen as the first international venture because of its size and because  (US banks) are very advanced in some areas but in some aspects they re so behind in basic banking , Ms Russak-Aminoach said.

She is far from the first person to spot an opportunity in a market where big banks expensive branch networks are supported by layers of charges for everything from wire transfers to ATM cash withdrawals.

Goldman Sachs jumped into the US online banking market two years ago with the launch of Marcus, Barclays is aiming to have a full online US bank by next year, and some regional banks including Capital One have created online spin offs.

Pure online banks such as Ally are also trying to undercut traditional banks, while fintechs like share trading platform Robinhood are planning to offer banking services.

Ms Russak-Aminoach said Pepper planned to be a scale player and would partner with a company that already has a large national US client base.

 We 	. 	. 	. 	are currently pursuing several options for collaborations in the US with significant and interesting players,  she said, declining to reveal their identities.

She said it was too early to speculate on how much funding the US entity would have, or the financial specifics, but Bank Leumi would only hold a minority stake in the entity. Bank Leumi s shareholders  capital is around $10bn and it has assets of NIS 450bn ($120bn).

Ms Russak-Aminoach argued that Pepper s technology will set it aside from the competition.  While most digital banks today are simply a new interface built on top of old legacy systems, Bank Leumi decided to deliberately create a self-disruption by building a fully-mobile, digital bank from the ground up,  she said.

A key feature is artificial intelligence which  allows us to get to know our customers, customise relevant content and offer them a personalised banking experience that differs from person to person   one that is completely different from the traditional banking language we have come to know.

CHART TO START THE WEEK

Just 10 investment managers captured about 90 per cent of last year's investor inflows into the asset management industry in North America as many small and medium-sized players struggled to attract business.

Investors globally directed about $2tn of new money last year into the investment industry, swelling worldwide assets under management to a record $88.5tn, according to McKinsey, the consultancy.

In spite of this benign backdrop, more than half of the North American-based managers that oversee assets of between $300bn and $1tn registered outflows last year.

In contrast, the biggest players, those with more than $1tn in assets, captured a disproportionate share of the new business. BlackRock and Vanguard, the world's two largest managers, both attracted record inflows last year, helped by the shift by investors into low-cost index tracking funds.

A growing number of pension schemes and other institutional investors is also abandoning traditional active funds in favour of concentrating assets into relationships with key strategic partners.

Many mid-sized managers try to offer "all things to all clients" but often lack the scale to match the breadth and depth of their larger rivals.

Onur Erzan, a partner in McKinsey's asset management practice, said those "stuck in the middle" had to choose where to compete according to their strengths. Building new data and analytics capabilities through alliances with technology companies could also help mid-sized players.

McKinsey said the need to build bigger companies that can compete with the trillionaires   managers with more than $1tn in assets   would drive more mergers and acquisitions activity. "Size alone does not determine destiny but the importance of scale will only grow in coming years," said Mr Erzan.

Insurers grapple with increasing wildfire risk

Financials. Natural catastrophes Changed conditions push sector to update models and pricing policies for California

It has been a terrible period in California. Devastating wildfires have killed at least 71 people and destroyed 12,000 buildings, making them among the most damaging fires to have hit the state.

The fires have also left insurers scrambling to work out how to deal with a threat that is rapidly becoming one of the most serious   and unpredictable   that they face.

The Camp and Woolsey fires that have been burning for ten days come just three months after the Ranch and River fires consumed about 300,000 acres in the north of the state and less than a year after the Thomas fire destroyed more than 280,000 acres and 1,000 structures in Ventura and Santa Barbara.

Mark Bove, natural catastrophe solutions manager at Munich Reinsurance America, said: "In general, overall wildfires in the US have gone down over the last 30-40 years, but what we've seen is a shift in severity   fires are more severe than they used to be."

There were two reasons fires have become more serious, Mr Bove said. One of them was climate change.

"California has drier conditions, and winter rains are coming later and later. So things are bone dry and can ignite very quickly."

The other is California's rising population and its distribution.

"We are building in areas that are more prone to fire risk and, because 90 per cent of fires have a human cause, you create more opportunities for wildfires to occur in these areas." Chris Folkman, a product manager at Risk Management Solutions, agrees.

"We are building a lot of houses in the wildland-urban interface. The increase of residence [in the interface in California] between 1990 and 2010 was 40 per cent, and of course it has only grown since.

"Typically, that's a nice suburban neighbourhood with a trail head at the end of the cul-de-sac   a desirable place to live."

Mr Folkman adds another risk: US firefighting practice, which has followed a policy of suppressing even small forest fires, which lets underbrush   fuel   build up.

That policy took hold in the early years of the 20th century, after a devastating series of fires in Washington, Idaho and Montana. In recent decades policy has shifted away from comprehensive suppression.

"There is an argument to be made that more smaller fires would have reduced the number of severe fires we see now," he said.

Paul Krump, executive vice-president of insurer Chubb, said: "No doubt wildfires are a significant peril in California. What used to be considered benign risks are in play today. We are always updating our models for that."

Those models, however, are not as advanced as they could be. The biggest risk facing US insurers has traditionally been windstorms on the east cost, so that is where the analysis has been focused.

Sridhar Manyem, director of industry research and analytics at AM Best, said: "The maturity of models for wildfires is not as good as hurricane models. Stochastic models are not as robust as for other perils but insurers can improve their stress testing, making sure they are not too concentrated in one area."

Mr Folkman of RMS said: "Insurers' own loss data is insufficient to quantify today's risk. There has been a string of record-breaking events, there is no precedent, no applicable historical data." So insurers must depend on computer simulations that take today's changed conditions into account.

Along with new risk models, there will have to be new pricing policies.

"These large and intense catastrophic wildfires will have to work their way into the industry pricing in California," said Mr Krump of Chubb. "Prudent underwriters are looking at the return periods differently in California. It's just common sense."

But in many western states, rate increases are highly regulated. In California, insurers must apply to the Department of Insurance for rate increases, a process that can take from three months to a year.

A 1988 law, Proposition 103, requires that companies justify the price increases with loss data and allows customer groups to present their objections.

Nancy Kincaid of the CDI said that "in many cases insurers do not get what is requested   there is a back-and-forth between our actuaries and the companies".

Pricing is not the only way insurers can protect themselves. They can also make sure that they put the right valuations on houses in fire zones.

Replacement costs awere much higher when whole areas were wiped out   the demand surge for tradespeople, and the logistical difficulty of working in burnt-out areas, could both push up the cost of rebuilding, Mr Krump pointed out.

However, wildfires are different from, for example, hurricanes, in that more can be done to ameliorate the damage they do, and in some cases prevent them.

Sean Burgess, chief claims officer at USAA, said his company offered significant discounts on homeowner policies for those who lived in towns that had received fire safety certification under a programme known as Firewise, run by the National Fire Protection Association.

USAA, like other companies, sends fire protection experts into the field to remove risks   such as underbrush or wooden patio furniture   around customers' homes, going so far as spraying fire-suppressant gel when fires are nearby.

Mr Burgess said: "You can't change the path of a hurricane" he said, "but you can change the path of some wildfires, and we do believe some of them can be prevented."

Good day. Welcome back from the weekend. Meatless burgers, ICO regulations and the real "Silicon Valley" top our lineup today. Let's get to it.

Today's Top Stories

Patties going public: It's time for Beyond Meat Inc. to test the public market's taste. The first maker of plant-based burgers to be sold alongside meat in butcher cases has filed for an initial public offering that could raise up to $100 million. Kleiner Perkins is listed in the company's IPO filing as the largest shareholder, with 16% stake, and Obvious Ventures owns 10.4%. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

ICO settlements: Two startups that raised money last year through cryptocurrency sales agreed to comply with investor-protection rules and offer money back to thousands of people who bought their digital tokens, marking a new stage in the government's clash with initial coin offerings. Paragon Coin Inc. and CarrierEQ Inc., which conducted unregistered coin offerings, each agreed to pay $250,000 in civil penalties and to notify investors they are eligible for refunds if they still own the token or can show they sold it at a loss. WSJ's Dave Michaels has more.

Life imitating art imitating life: HBO's comedy series "Silicon Valley" tells the story of scrappy startup Pied Piper, which hits on a brilliant algorithm for compressing information so it can zip through the pipes of the internet more quickly. Now a real-world startup, WaveOne Inc., is using an AI technique to improve upon existing real-life compression technology. And they are finding early success, according to a paper they submitted to an academic conference on Thursday. WSJ's Rolfe Winkler has more.

Roof's Take: Resistance Softens to Selling in Secondaries

By Katie Roof

When is it OK for a founder to sell shares?

Once viewed as a negative signal, the act of "taking money off the table" seems more like the norm. For late-stage startups, secondary transactions have become so commonplace that it is almost expected that employees will be able to sell shares before a liquidity event like an acquisition or an IPO.

GGV Capital's Jeff Richards, for one, has noticed the change, though he doesn't find it concerning.

"When I started my first company in 1997," quips Mr. Richards, "if you raised your hand as a founder and said you wanted liquidity you would get shot."

More in Roof's Take.

Exits

Oracle Corp. said it would acquire Talari Networks Inc., a provider of software-defined wide-area network technology, for an undisclosed amount. The San Jose, Calif.-based startup was backed by investors including Four Rivers Group, Menlo Ventures, Silver Creek Ventures and Square 1 Bank.

Fire disasters take their place alongside hurricanes as  major perils 

It has been a terrible period in California. Devastating  wildfires have killed at least 79 people and destroyed 13,000 buildings, making them among the most damaging fires to have hit the state.

The fires have also left insurers scrambling to work out how to deal with a threat that is rapidly becoming one of the most serious   and unpredictable   that they face.

The growing number of fires are costly for insurance companies.Last year s wildfires helped to push up losses incurred by homeowner and farm owner insurers from $4bn in 2016 to $16bn in 2017 according to rating agency AM Best. The Carr fire earlier this year cost $2bn on its own. Although it is still too early for reliable estimates of the cost of the latest fires, early indications are that it could be well in excess of $5bn.

Paul Krump, executive vice-president of insurerChubb, said:  No doubt wildfires are a significant peril in California. What used to be considered benign risks are in play today. We are always updating our models for that. 

Those models, however, are not as advanced as they could be. The biggest risk facing US insurers has traditionally been windstorms on the east cost, so that is where the analysis has been focused.

Sridhar Manyem, director of industry research and analytics at AM Best said:  The maturity of models for wildfires is not as good as hurricane models. Stochastic models are not as robust as for other perils but insurers can improve their stress testing, making sure they are not too concentrated in one area. 

 Insurers  own loss data is insufficient to quantify today s risk,  said Mr Folkman of Risk Management Solutions.  There has been a string of record-breaking events, there is no precedent, no applicable historical data,  he said, so insurers must depend on computer simulations that take today s changed conditions into account.

Along with new risk models, there will have to be new pricing policies.  These large and intense catastrophic wildfires will have to work their way into the industry pricing in California,  said Mr Krump of Chubb.  Prudent underwriters are looking at the return periods differently in California. It s just common sense. 

But in many western states rate increases are highly regulated. In California, insurers must apply to the Department of Insurance for rate increases, a process that can take from three months to a year. A 1988 law, Proposition 103, requires that companies justify the price increases with loss data and allows customer groups to present their objections. Nancy Kincaid of the CDI said that  in many cases insurers do not get what is requested   there is a back and forth between our actuaries and the companies .

Pricing is not the only way that insurers can protect themselves. They can also make sure that they put the right valuations on houses in fire zones. Replacement costs are much higher when whole areas are wiped out   the demand surge for tradespeople, and the logistical difficulty of working in burnt out areas can both push up the cost of rebuilding, Mr Krump pointed out.

However, wildfires are different from, for example, hurricanes, in that more can be done to ameliorate the damage they do, and in some cases prevent them.

Sean Burgess, chief claims officer at USAA, said his company offers significant discounts on homeowner policies for those who live in towns that have received fire safety certification under a programme known as Firewise, run by the National Fire Protection Association. USAA, like other companies, sends fire protection experts into the field to remove risks   such as underbrush or wooden patio furniture   around customers homes, going so far as spraying fire-suppressant gel when fires are nearby.

 You can t change the path of a hurricane  he said,  but you can change the path of some wildfires, and we do believe some of them can be prevented.

Fidelity Names Steve Neff Head of Asset Management Business; A 22-year veteran of the financial services firm, Neff has worked in technology roles

Fidelity Investments named the company's technology chief as its next head of asset management, the latest sign of the firm's shift away from its stock-picking roots.

Steve Neff succeeds Charles Morrison, who's retiring this December after 32 years with the firm, Fidelity Chairman Abigail Johnson wrote Friday in a memo to employees.

Mr. Neff, who joined Fidelity 22 years ago, has held a series of technology roles in asset management. He was chief information officer of the division until 2009, and since 2013 served as the firm's head of technology and global services.

Mr. Morrison, a former bond manager, had run the division for the past five years. As head of asset management, Mr. Morrison expanded the firm's lineup of exchange-traded funds and other low-cost investments. In August, Fidelity became the first manager to offer no-fee index funds.Fidelity announced his retirement last month.

Fidelity hasn't always picked a former investor to run the asset-management business and has chosen a technology leader once in the past. Mike Wilens, a one-time technology chief, ran the business a decade ago.

But Mr. Neff's rise reflects Fidelity's increasing move from a mutual-fund giant synonymous with stock and bond pickers to a firm that can offer products across an investor's portfolio.

Mr. Neff, 66, is a frequent writer on LinkedIn, the social-media network, where his articles cover topics ranging from leadership and workplace diversity to artificial intelligence. "Given the accelerated pace of advancements in our technology world today," Mr. Neff wrote in September, "we all need to become more at ease with change and rising expectations for digital literacy."

Fidelity isn't alone in changing as the business of managing other peoples' money broadly follows other financial services on a path toward increased digitization. The emergence of electronic trading, exchange-traded funds, computer-driven investing and data science have required each generation of industry executive to be more technology-savvy than the last.

"It's an opportune time for Steve to lead Asset Management, as technology is becoming increasingly important," Ms. Johnson wrote in the memo.

Fidelity's investment management business oversees more than $2 trillion in assets. While the business was once Fidelity's flagship, many younger clients may know the firm best for its brokerage services or 401(k) retirement platform.

"Throughout Fidelity's history, our most successful and impactful leaders have often been those who have assumed different roles in various parts of the firm," Ms. Johnson wrote. "Diversity of experience is something I have always valued because of the unique competitive advantages and interconnectedness of Fidelity's businesses."

Nvidia: tales from the crypto

Fall in cryptocurrency prices leaves chipmaker with inventory overload

Nvidia backers like to argue that the chipmaker deserves to replace Netflix as the N in the big, fast-growing Faang group of tech stocks. Not only is it a leader in graphics chips used for gaming but its products power some of the most transformational developments in computing, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. The trouble with signing up to the hottest trends is being left out of pocket when the hype dies down.

Cryptocurrency miner demand for Nvidia chips raised revenue last year. But the decision to stock up on the cards was a bad one. As prices for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin fell, so did demand.

Nvidia s core gaming unit, which sold the cards used for crypto-mining, still makes up the bulk of revenue. The drop in demand means total revenue for the third quarter looks disappointing at $3.8bn. The 21 per cent increase on last year is puny against the usual 50 per cent plus quarterly growth that has powered the stock price.

More worrying is a 7 per cent year-on-year fall in revenue forecast for the next quarter. If correct it will mark the company s first revenue decline in more than five years.

Nvidia thinks its  crypto hangover  will be temporary   and it will. New gaming chips released recently will find a bigger audience next year. It is still investing heavily in R&D too   which should mean new revenue streams to come. Operating expenses are up nearly 30 per cent on last year.

A sell-off since October along with the rest of the tech sector, plus the after hours share price fall means Nvidia s stock is trading at about 20 times expected earnings. That is still more than Intel, the world s biggest semiconductor company, which trades at 11 times forecast earnings. The long-term potential for growth is unchanged. Nvidia has more exciting opportunities than its peers.

But it is going to take longer than one rough quarter for inventory to go back to normal. If crypto prices stay low then miners may well try to sell their own chips. Even at lower prices, Nvidia s inventory backlog is going to prove hard to shift in just three months.

Companies analysis from our sister publication

Buy: Experian (EXPN)

Free cash flow rose by almost a fifth, while net debt remained at about 2.2 times adjusted cash profits, writes Emma Powell.

Experian s consumer services division has been the poor relation to its expanding business-to-business operations in recent years   the first half may represent a turning point. Organic revenue growth for the former came in at 5 per cent   compared with a 5 per cent contraction during the last financial year   as efforts to broaden and improve the product range started to pay off.

Management expects momentum in organic revenue generation to continue, anticipating full-year growth for the information group at the top of the 6 to 8 per cent guided range.

However, business-to-business operations continued to be the main driver of organic sales, with Europe, the Middle East and Africa/Asia Pacific leading the way. It launched big data platform Ascend   which provides clients with access to historic credit data   into those regions and pushed further into India, South Africa and south-east Asia. Contract wins for credit services and software in the utilities and banking sector helped boost like-for-like revenue by 5 per cent in the UK and Ireland.

Analysts at JPMorgan expect pre-tax profits of $1.2bn during the year to March 2019, giving earnings per share of 99 cents (from $1.2bn and 92 cents in 2018).

Hold: FirstGroup (FGP)

Cash flow more than doubled over the period, thanks to lower interest payments and the timing of certain working capital commitments at First Rail, writes Julia Faurschou.

As the proliferation of cheap flights makes long-distance coach travel unappealing, FirstGroup s Greyhound bus service continues to suffer.

In May, former chief executive Tim O Toole said the transport group would take a  new approach  to this part of the business, with a full external review already under way. Six months later, a 28.5m charge relating to Greyhound s exit from western Canada has further damaged half-year profitability.

But new chief executive Matthew Gregory said now the  lossmaking  Canadian operation has closed, Greyhound s performance should improve. In the meantime, disposal proceeds from bus station properties there could also help make up some of the shortfall.

The First Student school bus brand and First Bus city routes were the main drivers of growth during the first half, with adjusted operating profit up 114 per cent and 57 per cent at constant currency, respectively. First Student retained 92 per cent of its contracts during the most recent bidding season and exceeded management s expectations on new business wins. Meanwhile, First Bus benefited from a review of its routes and timetables, although lower high street footfall hurt passenger numbers, as fewer people take the bus into town centres.

FirstGroup s trains division, FirstRail, includes four weeks of trading from the South Western Rail (SWR) franchise, with sales up 80.7 per cent to 1.22bn   a 5.5 per cent like-for-like increase excluding SWR. But management said industry conditions remain  very challenging  with macroeconomic uncertainty, infrastructure upgrades and industrial action causing widespread disruption. An independent review is under way to determine how to return SWR to profitability.

Analysts at Liberum expect non-rail divisions to offset a tougher period for rail, leading to improved operating profit at group level. For now, the broker expects pre-tax profits of 214m for the year to March 2019, giving earnings per share of 13.2p (from 197m and 12.3p in full-year 2018).

Hold: Land Securities (LAND)

Net debt was flat at 3.7bn, but this represents a relatively comfortable loan-to-value ratio of 26.2 per cent.

Given the tough conditions facing the retail sector, Land Securities did well to minimise the effects on its retail portfolio. In valuation terms, shopping centres and shops fell 2.9 per cent, and retail parks by 4.5 per cent. By contrast, and against all the bearish headlines, London offices were revalued by 0.2 per cent in the six months to September 2018. Overall, the combined portfolio lost 1.4 per cent in value to 1,384p per share on an adjusted basis.

While the retail side remains vulnerable to changes in the way that consumers shop, the London office market is performing well; so much so that the company has a potential 2m sq ft in the development pipeline, representing a total development cost of 2bn. There are also plans to enter the small, but fast growing flexible office market, with 36,000 sq ft of space in Victoria Street, London, to be launched next year. Plans are also under way for mixed use developments on its suburban London retail sites including over 4,000 homes, with planning applications expected to be submitted in the first half of 2019.

Analysts at Peel Hunt are forecasting adjusted net asset value (NAV) at the March 2019 year end of 1,353.7p (from 1,402.7p in 2018).

The office market and housing construction look in far better shape than retail. But even with the shares at a near 40 per cent discount to NAV, current uncertainty limits the upside.

Cyber Daily: Protect Data by Untangling Your Web of Business Partners

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. Forget third-party risk. Consider fourth- and fifth-party risk. Companies that outsource storage or processing of corporate data can lose track of where their information is if they don't understand the web of contractors and subcontractors in a modern business supply chain. But vigilance is necessary if data is to remain protected, reports WSJ Pro Cybersecurity's Catherine Stupp.

Necessary, sure, but by no means easy. Executives from Barclays PLC and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. share some tips about tools and procedures that can help.

Companies Struggle to Track Down Data in a Maze of Subcontractors

By Catherine Stupp

Security professionals can struggle to figure out where their company's data goes once it leaves their systems and it can be an opaque process to find out what vendors their third-party suppliers hire. Continuous inventory work and automated tools to track data could help clarify risks in outsourcing data services, experts say.

"When you have issues with identifying your third parties, there's a good chance you haven't identified all your fourth parties. And this is where it starts to get messy," Michael Beck, head of global supplier assurance at Barclays PLC, said during a panel discussion at the Infosecurity North America conference Thursday in New York.

"One of the challenges regulators always put on banks is,  Do you know where your data is?' And the answer is generally,  We think so,'" Mr. Beck said.

External service providers have emerged as a major security vulnerability. Third-party firms were responsible for 42% of data breaches reported over the last year, according to a Ponemon Institute survey of 1,000 U.S. and U.K.-based technology and risk managers, which was published in November.

Mapping how data travels

Knowing which vendors hold a company's data is especially challenging for large firms that work with many third-party service providers, which in turn partner with subcontractors. In addition to identifying where data ends up, companies should rate the risks of their vendors based on the services they provide and determine if they are critical to business operations, said Frank Roppelt, senior manager for security policy and vendor risk at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.

Those assessments should look at criteria including how much company information vendors hold, whether they're connected to a firm's systems and applications, and whether they use cloud services, he said, speaking at the conference. Companies also should update continuously their records of which vendors perform specific services, he said.

Barclays' supply chain unit asks vendors to identify which subcontractors receive the company's data. The team visits those fourth- and fifth-party suppliers and does penetration tests against them, Mr. Beck said.

Tools from security firms can give supply-chain managers an insight into their vendors' business partners, Mr. Roppelt said. These include SecurityScorecard Inc., which offers a risk assessment service focused on third-party vendors, and Bitsight Technologies Inc., which provides a vendor management service that sends companies daily security updates.

To find vendors' business partners, some tools analyze the traffic of IP addresses and domain names, he said. Companies can then use that information to ask service providers to specify which subcontractors hold their data.

Beyond paper files

Supply chain and security managers could start their risk assessment by distributing questionnaires to their own employees in different business units. That would help them better understand departmental needs to outsource services. Security teams then can assess the risks of allowing outside access to corporate data, according to Mr. Roppelt.

"Understanding that factor of inherent risk and applying that level of due diligence is something that the industry still needs to work on," he said.

Over time, Mr. Beck has improved his methods of keeping inventories of where data is located.

When he worked at another company around a decade ago, Mr. Beck said, he received an order from the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and was unable to name the vendors his employer worked with.

"We literally had to go dig in file cabinets of all these people to go find contracts," he said.

Fake fingerprints outsmart biometric readers. Researchers at New York University and Michigan State University trained machine-learning algorithms to produce so-called Deep MasterPrints that look enough like real fingerprints to unlock devices. Some biometric readers verify only part of a fingerprint and therefore are tricked more easily, the researchers said in a paper presented Thursday at a security conference in Los Angeles. "Demonstrating flaws in existing authentication systems is considered to be an important part of developing more secure replacements in the future," writes The Guardian.

The MiSafes watch, which uses GPS to monitor the movements of children who wear it, doesn't encrypt data or secure user accounts, according to security researchers at Pen Test Partners LLP, the BBC reports. The watch was designed to feed location and other data to a mobile app on parents' smartphones as well as to let parents listen in on what the children are doing. Pen Test demonstrated how outsiders could track children in real-time and send message to a wearer that look like they are from parents. MiSafes didn't respond to requests for comment from BBC and Pen Test Partners.

WINNER

VMware, Apttus, QuisLex and ThinkSmart (Mitratech)

Standardising contracts

As the contracts essential to VMware's global technology service business increased in both number and in complexity, the company's legal team rewrote its entire contracting process.

In 2013, the team first reduced their involvement in contracting with the help of contract management software from Apttus. This halved the number of contract templates while managing the risks and liabilities in the complex agreements. VMware automated simple contracts such as non-disclosure agreements with the help of QuisLex, the legal process outsourcer. It used ThinkSmart's portal to enable contract approval on "any device, anywhere".

Finalising contracts now happens 50 per cent faster and the work with QuisLex saves more than $8.4m a year.

Axa

Smart contracts and blockchain

Thousands of EU residents experience flight delays of more than two hours every year, but only a few claim compensation. The insurance group Axa is making the process' easier with Fizzy, a smart contract launched in 2017 that uses blockchain to automate compensation.

Customers enter their flight details and the application uses data from the previous seven years to show the risk of delay and quotes for coverage. If a flight is delayed for more than two hours, the smart contractself-executes and compensates the policyholder. It currently covers 70 per cent of EU flights.

Axiom and the University of North Carolina

Standardising contracts

When the University of North Carolina set out to reduce the time spent negotiating clinical trial and confidentiality agreements, it looked at where negotiations had failed previously. With the help of Axiom, the managed services provider, it was able to identify contractual clauses that caused repeated problems. As a result, negotiation times have dropped by up to 70 per cent since April, generating revenues of more than $30m a year.

Capgemini

Smart contracts and blockchain

Professional services company Capgemini operates in 40 countries, employs more than 200,000 people and works with contracts in multiple languages. The range and diversity of its contracts had grown each year, until it exceeded company capacity. Lawyers used Symfact to collate and digitise more than 10,000 contracts, storing them in a searchable central repository.

Next, iManage Ravn was used to review high-value portfolios. The technology tracks obligations, flags breaches and identifies renewals. Visualisation tool Tableau was then used to create digestible reports, summarising entire client portfolios.

Dropbox and Ironclad

Automation

The Dropbox legal team wanted to reduce the time spent reviewing simple legal contracts and turned to Ironclad, a US West Coast-based provider of contract management software. Together, they created a playbook for nondisclosure agreements that non-specialist business colleagues could execute. Almost a quarter of the company's estimated 6,000 annual contracts have been executed on Ironclad since 2016.

The software integrates with other technology and is easy to adopt, which allowed the lawyers at Dropbox to focus on more complex transactions.

eBay and LawGeex

Simplifying the approvals process

Working with Israeli artificial intelligence company LawGeex, eBay streamlined the way it handled its high volume of "low-risk, lowdollar" contracts. When simple contracts reach the management system, the AI reviews them and assigns them a risk level. Low-risk "green" documents receive a brief human review before being sent for immediate signature. If it identifies a more significant risk, the contract is escalated for review. This triage approach reduced review times by up to 50 per cent in some cases in the past year.

HPE and Apttus

Reducing lawyer involvement

The enterprise information technology company HPE implemented Apttus's contract management tool to store contracts, manage and automate parts of the process, and collect new data. This cut contract response times in half from 48 to 24 hours, and halved negotiation times. The tool has also collected more than 3m data points, which are used to identify risk, predicting contracting costs with 99 per cent accuracy.

London Stock Exchange Group, Radiant Law, Lawyers on Demand

Standardising contracts

Facing an increased need for legal services, the London Stock Exchange Group first standardised contract templates and automated its processes in 2011 with the help of Radiant Law, a technology and outsourcing boutique.

Early this year it enlisted flexible resourcing firm Lawyers on Demand to help with procurement and intragroup agreements. The dual-provider model also trials technologies for the London Stock Exchange, allowing it to bring products to market faster.

Shell International

Visual contracts

When the legal team at Shell decided to make its contracting process easier for non-English speaking customers, they designed a visual contract, which was piloted this year. Starting with Shell's marine lubricants business, the legal team rewrote its general terms and conditions in plain English, added clear headings and visual elements and reduced the word count by 38 per cent. It has led to a significantly faster renewal of hard-to-close accounts since the change.

The AA and Thomson Reuters Legal Managed Services, Syke, Thomson Reuters Contract Express, eBrevia

Integrating different technologies

With just eight weeks to review and amend 2,600 contracts before the introduction of the EU's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the AA engaged consulting group Syke. Thomson Reuters then used eBrevia's artificial intelligence tool to review and extract contract data from the AA's agreements and automatically generate new contracts with Contract Express software.

The automated process allowed the AA to meet the deadline at a fifth of the cost of a traditional approach, and agreement data were added to the AA's SAP systems.

Good day. At the WSJ D.Live conference, conversation turned to the meteoric rise of China's internet superpowers.

Venture capitalists said Chinese entrepreneurs have a unique set of advantages, including a mobile-first mindset, a meritocratic outlook, easy access to centralized personal data and an aptitude for growth hacks.

Read more and pick up on the the buzz at the conference.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Robotic bidding: Companies vying for supremacy in robotic software are sparking an investment frenzy. In the latest escalation of the bidding, SoftBank Group Corp. has thrown its weight behind Automation Anywhere Inc. for a fresh investment that values the Silicon Valley startup at $2.6 billion. This comes in addition to Automation Anywhere's $250 million fundraising in July. And it follows the $3 billion valuation that competitor UiPath Inc. recently received. WSJ's Katie Roof and Rolfe Winkler have more.

Motley LPs: Motley Fool Ventures hopes its debut venture fund will best other attempts at democratizing venture capital. The fund, launched by privately held Motley Fool Holdings, has collected $145 million from some 800 individual limited partners. It's an exceptionally large haul for a traditionally structured venture fund raised entirely from individual investors. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the exclusive.

Grab and go: With the advent of automated cashier technology pioneered by Amazon.com and others, consumers are learning how to shop and exit stores without being rung up at a traditional checker at a cash register. One autonomous-checkout startup, Standard Cognition, has raised $40 million in Series A funding led by Initialized Capital, with participation by CRV, Y Combinator and Draper Associates. The startup's technology uses in-store cameras to identify what shoppers pick up and then charges their credit card when they leave. WSJ's Tomio Geron has the story.

Mack's Take:  Death by Pilot' Isn't Only Hazard for Health Tech

By Heather Mack

It's harder to succeed in health care than in pure technology, as every startup is painfully aware.

But the latest reminder came with the abrupt flameout of Driver, a clinical trial matching platform that had the ambitious goal of expanding cancer treatment options around the world. Despite a prestigious lineup of partnerships and $100 million in backing, Driver ran out of money and shut down operations just a few weeks after launching.

The reasons for its demise aren't complex: Consumers don't want to pay for health tech tools, and a company can go broke in the process of trying to prove its worth.

"Death by Pilot" is a common refrain in the industry. The startup burns through capital running collaborations with hospitals before it is able to generate enough revenue. Indeed, people weren't buying Driver's $3,000 app, and partners including the Mayo Clinic didn't bring the startup revenue it needed.

What's even riskier than pilots, some investors said, is running a startup with an unclear business model.

More in Mack's Take.

Exits

Sabre Corp. agreed to buy airline technology company Farelogix for about $360 million. Farelogix was backed by investors including Sandler Capital Management.

Microsoft Corp. agreed to acquire Xoxco Inc., a startup known for its Slack bot Howdy, for an undisclosed amount. The Austin, Texas-based company raised $1.5 million in seed funding in 2015 from investors including Bloomberg Beta, True Ventures and Betaworks.

VC Funds

Rock River Capital Partners has secured $23.5 million toward its first fund, according to a regulatory filing. The Madison, Wis.-based firm says it makes mostly early-stage investments of between $500,000 to $1 million in Midwestern software startups.

Meritage Funds is raising a venture fund targeted at $20 million, according to a regulatory filing by the Denver-based firm. Meritage has raised more than $10 million toward the Traction Fund's goal, the filing says.

Wonder Ventures has closed $15 million for its second pre-seed fund. The Los Angeles firm has invested in several regional startups including Clutter Inc., Airmap Inc. and Tala.

Industry News

A tidal wave of cash has helped turn China's internet startups into formidable superpowers rivaling their U.S. counterparts. But venture capitalists argue that a unique set of forces are also spurring the startups' ascendancy. Behind China's rise is a mobile-first mind-set among entrepreneurs who preach meritocracy, have easy access to centralized personal data and are adept at so-called growth hacks to aggregate supply and demand quickly, said venture capitalists at the WSJ Tech D.Live conference on Wednesday. Read more.

Uber Technologies Inc. said third-quarter revenue rose 38% from a year earlier to $2.95 billion, but that was less than the second-quarter year-over-year jump of 63%. Its loss widened to $1.07 billion from $891 million in the second quarter. Read more.

Experian: settling scores

Data is proliferating. Experian is expanding with it. Despite regulatory concerns the UK information services group looks set for further growth.

Companies can sell more, with less risk, if they can accurately score a potential customer's creditworthiness. Providing the data and products that allow them quickly to make such decisions makes up more than half of Experian's revenue (the rest comes from software, analytics and consumer services). All told, these services helped deliver group organic revenue growth of a chunky 8 per cent for the six months to the end of September.

Experian said yesterday that it expected that pace of sales growth to continue for the full year. That explains why the company's shares trade on a forward price/earnings multiple of 24 times   a small but deserved premium to a basket of peers.

Experian's services are awkward to replace, once embedded with clients. The company has a big exposure to developed economies such as the US, which accounts for two-fifths of group revenues. There, the business servicing the healthcare sector saw revenues grow by double digits.

The stock's rating also reflects opportunities in emerging markets. Asia-Pacific is of particular interest. Indonesia, for example, has tens of millions of consumers cut off from the formal banking system. But these people have mobile phones, from which a credit profile can be derived.

China is not an option for expansion, as Beijing balks at foreign companies using citizens' data. Other jurisdictions are getting more restrictive too.

Experian is among a number of companies accused by Privacy International of breaching GDPR, the EU's new data protection law. The company denies doing so.

Of greater concern is a big hack like that suffered by Equifax, a US-based rival. Yet even Equifax is still increasing its sales, a year after one of the worst breaches in history. That is a measure of how solid this industry is.

Aldrich Capital Partners, Vienna, Va.

Growth-equity firm Aldrich Capital Partners closed its debut fund with $256 million, said firm co-founders Mirza Baig and Raheel Zia.

The fund's backers include the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, according to pension documents. The firm will use the capital to invest in North American companies in the lower middle market, focusing on three technology subsectors: health-care technology, financial technology and application software.

Argosy Partners, Toronto

Argosy Partners said it will raise Shotgun Fund IV, a vehicle focused on "shotgun" deals in which one business partner wants to buy out the other. The firm is seeking up to 50 million Canadian dollars ($38.3 million) for the fund. Since its inception in 1999, the Shotgun Fund series has provided an "equity solution for the owner-managers of private, small and medium-sized Canadian businesses involved in shareholder disputes, or who simply require shareholder liquidity quickly and quietly," the firm said in a news release.

Arrowroot Capital Management, Santa Monica, Calif.

Software investor Arrowroot Capital Management is aiming to raise $315 million for its fourth growth-equity fund, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The goal for Arrowroot Capital IV LP is about 78% higher than the amount Arrowroot raised for its third fund, which closed last year with more than $177 million in limited-partner and general-partner commitments. The firm backs business-to-business software companies, aiming to invest $5 million to $25 million and taking either minority or majority ownership stakes.

C ordillera Investment Partners, San Francisco

Cordillera Investment Partners closed its second fund with $362 million. The amount collected for Cordillera Investment Fund II LP brings the firm's assets under management to $648 million. Cordillera in a news release said it targets investments it considers "unique and less correlated &in areas that it believes remain inefficient, misunderstood and not overcapitalized." The firm has invested in areas such as music royalties, water rights, international arbitration, commercial litigation finance and broadband spectrum licenses. Cordillera's previous fund closed on $197 million in 2017, according to a May document from the Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office, which states the latest fund had a $350 million target.

Greenbriar Equity Group, Rye, N.Y.

Transportation investor Greenbriar Equity Group is more than halfway to the fundraising goal for its latest vehicle, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Greenbriar Equity Fund IV LP and a parallel fund have gathered at least $607.8 million so far toward a $1 billion goal, the filings show. The firm invests in transportation and related industries, focusing on manufacturers and companies in the aerospace, automotive, distribution and logistics sectors, among others. Greenbriar's previous fund closed on $1.1 billion in 2014.

HealthpointCapital, New York

HealthpointCapital, a private-equity firm focused on the musculoskeletal sector, held a first closing on $100 million for its fourth fund. Musculoskeletal Fund IV has a $500 million target. HealthpointCapital said the new vehicle will invest in eight to 10 growth-stage technology and services companies in the orthopedic, spine, dental, maxillofacial, rehabilitation and digital-health sectors. The firm collected at least $410.8 million for HealthpointCapital Partners III LP, which was seeking $700 million, according to a 2008 regulatory filing. It isn't clear how much HealthpointCapital ultimately collected for the vehicle. The firm closed HealthpointCapital Partners II LP with $420 million in 2007.

H.I.G. Capital, Miami

H.I.G. Capital's growth-capital unit closed its third fund with $970 million of commitments. WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported H.I.G. Growth Buyouts & Equity Fund III LP was nearing a $950 million goal listed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Backers of the new fund include the Texas County & District Retirement System and Maine Public Employees Retirement System. H.I.G.'s latest vehicle will continue a strategy of investing in growth buyouts and structured equity in small-cap companies primarily in North America. The firm's previous fund in the series, H.I.G. Growth Equity Fund II LP, closed with $500 million in 2011. The firm also has collected at least $1.12 billion for a new offering the firm plans to commit to other H.I.G.-sponsored funds, according to another SEC filing. The amount for H.I.G. Strategic Partners Fund LP surpasses a $1 billion target indicated in an investor presentation made to the Texas Municipal Retirement System. It isn't known from the SEC filing whether the fund has officially closed. According to the presentation, H.I.G. plans to commit the vehicle to 12 funds the firm expects to bring to market over the next four years, as well as to selective co-investments alongside those funds.

Level Equity Management, New York

Level Equity Management closed Level Equity Growth Partners IV LP and Level Equity Opportunities Fund 2018 LP, securing $535 million and $200 million, respectively, in limited-partner commitments.

MidOcean Partners, New York

MidOcean Partners wrapped up its latest private-equity fund with $1.2 billion of investor commitments. The final closing of MidOcean Partners V LP came in at the fund's hard cap and ahead of its $1 billion target. The fundraising effort was the firm's most ambitious one since it closed its third fund above its $1.25 billion hard cap in 2007. The firm's next fund, MidOcean Partners IV LP, was a 2015 bridge fund that collected $300 million, a person familiar with the matter told WSJ Pro Private Equity last year. MidOcean targets control investments with minimum equity contribution of $25 million.

Piper Jaffray Merchant Banking, Minneapolis

Piper Jaffray Merchant Banking, a private-equity arm of Piper Jaffray Cos., raised $130 million for its second growth- equity fund.

Vista Equity Partners, Austin, Texas

Vista Equity Partners has collected $11.4 billion so far for its latest fund, and it isn't done yet. The private-equity firm is well on its way to raising a record-breaking $16 billion fund that will buy software companies, said people familiar with the fundraising. Vista held an initial closing for the flagship fund in late September, said a person familiar with the situation. If Vista Equity Partners Fund VII LP hits its goal, it would be the largest such buyout fund raised by an independent private- equity firm. It also would be Vista's largest fund to date. Vista wrapped up its previous fund last year with nearly $11.1 billion.

Commonfund focuses its secondary strategy on smaller deals, which the firm says tend to be less heavily intermediated.

Landmark Partners, Simsbury, Conn.

Landmark Partners held a $7 billion final closing for its latest secondary private-equity pool, beating an initial $4 billion target.

Good day. Compensation is often a topic of intense interest among our readers. As private-equity firms flush with capital continue to compete for top talent, many find they need to pay up to get it, a trend that has driven consistent pay growth for industry professionals in recent years. A new report from executive recruiter Heidrick & Struggles International Inc. shows that jobs in private equity remain as lucrative as ever.

Meanwhile, two forces that help drive that pay exits and fundraising continue. WSJ Pro's Jaewon Kang reports on a sale process for a private equity-backed beauty company Beauty Industry Group Inc., while William Louch has the lowdown on Scandinavian firm Summa Equity's latest fundraising efforts. Luis Garcia writes about an effort by emerging markets firm Actis to make impact measurement mainstream.

The Take: Finding a Universal Language for Investment Impact

By Luis Garcia

Private investors have long struggled to find a common language to define, let alone measure, the social or environmental impact of their investments.

Now, some are beginning to believe the United Nations' sustainable development goals may provide that language.

The SDGs are a set of 17 goals that address the world's most pressing development challenges. Agreed upon by 193 U.N. member states in 2015, the global goals as the SDGs also are called include eliminating poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, protecting the environment, promoting sustainable economic growth and making sure people can live healthy lives. Read Garcia's Take.

Bain Capital Ventures Raises $1 Billion for New Funds; After backing startups like DocuSign, Jet.com and SendGrid, the firm is the latest to raise $1 billion

Bain Capital Ventures, which has invested in DocuSign, Jet.com, and SendGrid, has raised $1 billion for its latest set of funds as venture firms mount ever-larger war chests for backing startups.

The funds include $650 million for its early-stage fund, $250 million for a co-investment fund for growth stage deals, plus $100 million in separate vehicles to invest on behalf of its partners. That's an increase from the firm's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bain-capital-ventures-closes-600m-fund-1467993136" to raise a $600 million early-stage fund and a $200 million growth fund.

Areas like artificial intelligence, cloud and autonomous vehicles are driving Bain's interest in deals across a number of sectors. The firm invests about 80% of its funds in business-to-business startups, with the rest in consumer or emerging technology. Its areas of focus include software as a service, cybersecurity and e-commerce.

About half of Bain's capital, now with $4.9 billion under management, is invested in early-stage deals. Last year Boston-based Bain launched a program to invest in a network of angel investors its version of a scout program. That has led to Bain doing Series A deals in crypto startup "https://www.wsj.com/articles/basis-raises-133-million-to-create-tokens-with-price-stability-1524097063" and cybersecurity startup Red Balloon Security Inc., along with 12 seed investments such as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/money-markets-for-crypto-assets-are-in-the-works-1526470201" and Lumina.

Ajay Agarwal, managing director, said Bain is optimistic about trends in enterprise with the acceleration of cloud computing, disruption of traditional industries and more mergers and acquisitions driven by incumbents buying cloud companies.

"We've had such a long history of success in b-to-b and so many assets we bring to the table for early-stage founders," Mr. Agarwal said. Bain will keep investing in consumer startups, adding to previous deals such as Jet.com and Rent the Runway. Other past investments include LinkedIn, Kiva Systems and SurveyMonkey.

Good day. Thanksgiving is still more than a week from now, and venture firms have already laid out a rich array of funding deals. In one of the busier days for big check writing, Tuesday's lineup includes six rounds that closed at more than $100 million apiece.

That doesn't even include the commitment SoftBank Group Corp. is making for WeWork Cos. Pass the gravy.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Rising in the East: Venture capitalists in New York and Virginia hope the arrival of Amazon.com Inc.'s next headquarters in those areas will be a magnet for technology talent that accelerates gains seen in their startup ecosystems. Startups in both locations could face initial higher costs as they compete with Amazon for workers. But over time, Amazon's plans to create up to 25,000 jobs in each city will add to the talent pools by drawing more technologists to the areas, investors said. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova and Brian Gormley have the story.

That's dope: Selling recreational pot, even in states where it's legal, is hardly a fast-growing business. But Eaze, whose on-demand delivery service navigates thorny regulations, thinks it has hit upon a channel of the cannabis market with lucrative potential. The San Francisco company launched a direct-to-consumer sales platform in 41 states exclusively for cannabidiol-based "wellness" products, which don't face the kind of legal barriers affecting recreational pot sales. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

Bain's billion: They invested in DocuSign, Jet.com and SendGrid. Now Bain Capital Ventures has raised $1 billion for its latest set of funds as venture firms mount ever-larger war chests for backing startups. The funds include $650 million for early-stage bets, $250 million for a co-investment fund for growth-stage deals, and $100 million in separate vehicles to invest on behalf of its partners. WSJ's Tomio Geron has more.

Geron's Take: Can Shopper Rewards Help Bitcoin Go Mainstream?

By Tomio Geron

Few real-world applications for bitcoin have broken into the mainstream.

But a new startup is betting it has found a way to make the virtual currency at once relevant and accessible via something people do every day: shopping.

The startup is called Lolli and it runs a rewards program that offers consumers bitcoin payments for shopping online. Although similar to cash-back-reward credit cards, Lolli's payout is exclusively in bitcoin and can be in sums larger than the 1% to 2% of cash purchases offered by standard card loyalty programs.

More in Geron's Take.

Exits

Two Chinese internet companies sharply scaled down their ambitions for Hong Kong share sales. BabyTree Group, an operator of Chinese maternity and parenting portals, began taking orders for an IPO worth up to 2.20 billion Hong Kong dollars ($281 million). It previously aimed to raise about $800 million, according to people familiar with the situation. Also launching a smaller-than-expected IPO this week is Tongcheng-Elong Holdings Ltd., China's third-largest online travel agent. Read more.

Synthorx Inc. disclosed plans for an IPO to finance clinical trials of a novel protein therapeutic to kill cancerous tumors. The company has raised at least $76.8 million from venture investors, including $63.7 million this year. The Series C round came in two tranches, most recently a $37.2 million slice this month. Avalon Ventures is the company's largest shareholder, with a 32% stake. Read more.

Vapotherm Inc., a maker of respiratory systems, priced its IPO of 4 million shares at $14 apiece, the low end of its anticipated range, to raise $56 million. The Exeter, N.H.-based company expected to price the IPO at $14 to $16 a share.

Skyview Capital acquired certain assets of Prynt Corp., which makes and markets photo-printing phone cases, through QuickerPics LLC. Prynt was backed by investors including GGV Capital.

VC Funds

At the WSJ D.Live conference Andrew Braccia, partner at Accel, and Kirsten Green, founder and managing partner at Forerunner Ventures, both said they haven't made a decision on whether to pursue future deals where the Saudi-backed SoftBank Group's Vision Fund is a co-investor. "It is top of mind," said Mr. Braccia, whose firm Accel has previously invested in SoftBank-backed companies such as Slack, Ola and Schematic Labs, according to PitchBook Data. Mr. Braccia added, "I think that is a question we're still thinking through as a firm." More from D.Live 2018.

Linse Capital is raising up to $65 million for its fifth fund, Linse Capital CP V LLC, according to a regulatory filing. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm was founded by Michael Linse, a former partner with Kleiner Perkins. Linse has invested in energy-related businesses including ChargePoint Inc. and Redaptive Inc. The firm's previous fund raised $25 million last year.

Schneider Electric has launched Schneider Electric Ventures with roughly  500 million ($563 million) to invest in companies that contribute to sustainability and energy efficiency. The fund has invested in six companies so far, including Claroty, Element Analytics and KGS. Schneider Electric's former VC arm, which was also called Schneider Electric Ventures, spun out as independent investor Aster Capital in 2006.

Portfolia Funds has closed its sixth fund for investments in women's health startups, raising an undisclosed amount from 249 investors. Last month, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm made its first investment from the Portfolia FemTech Fund in fertility-care startup Future Family.

New Money

SoftBank Group Corp. has committed $3 billion to WeWork Cos. in a deal that values the company at about $45 billion. If completed, the deal would make WeWork, which was last valued in a 2017 funding round at $20 billion, the second-most valuable U.S. startup. Read more.

PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Palantir Technologies Inc. appears to be a prosperous Silicon Valley spy-software machine. It crunches masses of data to find insights. Its analytics have been credited with helping track down Osama bin Laden. Its value by one measure is $20 billion, one of the highest among private tech companies, and its founders include famed investor Peter Thiel.

Behind this hot startup image, Palantir has struggled to live up to its reputation.

The company has begun planning an initial public offering but hasn't turned an annual profit in its 14-year history. It is trying to win more corporate customers, after years of flailing attempts, although some potential clients view Palantir as flippant toward business and are wary of its work for governments and intelligence agencies. It missed sales targets last year after hoped-for contracts fell through.

Its engineers were accustomed to spending profligately -- the company sponsored 13-course tasting-menu lunches with lobster tail and sashimi at headquarters -- calling such extravagance "Palantir Entitlement Syndrome."

Alex Karp, the company's chief executive, has added to the unconventional atmosphere. When he grows excited about an idea, say current and former employees, he balls his fists and taps employees rapid-fire in the solar plexus.

This all leaves Palantir, and Mr. Karp, at a familiar juncture in Silicon Valley. It has run like a scrappy startup even though it has become a global company. Facing appeals from investors and employees to go public, so they can more easily sell shares, Mr. Karp must now make Palantir into a more traditional operation.

"We're a company that's going into adolescence," Mr. Karp, 51 years old, says. "The rules for being a child and the rules for being an adult are different."

Palantir is among a host of "unicorns" -- startups valued over $1 billion -- that are losing money years after inception. Uber Technologies Inc. and WeWork Cos. have burned through more than $8 billion and $2 billion, respectively, and still lose money. That's in contrast to an earlier generation. Facebook Inc. turned an annual profit after five years.

Some investors are complaining to Palantir executives about long-delayed IPO plans, say people familiar with their complaints. Its principal patron, Mr. Thiel, pared his ownership in private sales at well below Palantir's $20 billion valuation, which came from its latest funding round, in 2015.

Investors say Mr. Karp and others at Palantir have told them the firm will turn profitable in 2019. Mr. Karp made that promise in some past years, too. And he still sends mixed messages on whether making money matters, often saying his primary focus is building the most important company in the world.

"The unintended consequence of the numbers we are likely to post," he says, "is profitability."

Palantir is interviewing investment banks about plans to go public as soon as next year. Behind the scenes, Mr. Karp is on a sort of apology tour. Meeting this year with clients in Washington, D.C., he pledged to change the impression of the firm's staff as overconfident, condescending and even sloppy.

"We were young kids rocking up in shorts and T-shirts," said Mr. Karp, according to people present, "and we realized that was hurting our credibility."

To cut costs, Palantir has been unloading office properties and slowed expensive hires. It is scrutinizing employee perks such as last-minute international business-class travel, a shock to a firm that once entertained a companywide debate over whether to restore artisanal bacon to the breakfast menu -- "Bacongate," employees called it. Palantir fired two employees who expensed lingerie and suits, people familiar with the episode say.

Palantir is pushing to make its analytics software more attractive to corporations and has won over companies including Credit Suisse Group AG, Merck KGaA, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, United Continental Holdings Inc. and Airbus SE.

Mr. Thiel, still Palantir's largest shareholder, says he has faith in the company. "You go underwater," Mr. Thiel says, "and the important thing is to come up for air at some point."

Interviews with current and former employees, investors and clients give an inside look at how Palantir is trying to turn around its business.

Named after a crystal ball in "The Lord of the Rings" series, Palantir was started in 2004 by recent Stanford University graduates and bankrolled with $30 million mostly from Mr. Thiel, a PayPal co-founder. The Central Intelligence Agency's venture-capital arm later chipped in.

It has raised around $2.5 billion in 12 rounds over 11 years. Investors include former Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz, Home Depot Inc. co-founder Ken Langone and Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp, The Wall Street Journal's parent.

Palantir's initial idea focused on selling a fraud-detection tool, similar to what PayPal uses. Customers would be government agencies looking to spot connections across far-flung data sets such as vehicle registrations or the locations of terrorist camps. Palantir soon counted clients including the U.S. Special Forces, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and international intelligence agencies.

Mr. Karp joined as CEO a few months in. While not a trained programmer, the multilingual Mr. Karp, with a philosophy Ph.D., took enthusiastically to running a global organization, spending around 250 days a year traveling. He sometimes answers his office phone loudly in German, nurturing gossip he is talking to one of his girlfriends in Europe.

"We have a large business in Germany," Mr. Karp says about those accounts. "Most of my German is being used to grow the business."

A self-described socialist whose preferred work uniform is athletic wear and bright beanies, he is a fitness nut who lives in a one-room Bavarian-style farmhouse. He occasionally shoves clients in the chest to demonstrate a Chinese martial-arts move to redirect force. He has three Tai Chi swords visible in his New York office and one in Palo Alto.

From the start, Palantir's work was furtive -- many employees had to apply for security clearances. Employees received five-figure bonus checks if they lived close to company offices.

The company early on focused mainly on government business. Its software has been credited by investors and its staff with helping the U.S. capture bin Laden, disrupt broader terrorist networks and chase swindlers including Bernard Madoff.

Outright talk of commerce was for years considered verboten. Mr. Karp would tell staff, in a nod to Palantir's engineering roots: "We are not going to have any f---ing salespeople."

Mr. Karp says: "If it began or ended with some vulgarity, I'm sure I said it."

As Palantir sought to expand from government into private industry, its business plan involved losing money early in hopes of lucrative assignments later. Jobs were labor-intensive, with software written in a bespoke programming language and taught one-on-one.

Instead of salespeople, Palantir sent so-called forward-deployed engineers to meet potential clients. Some engineers answered skeptical questions from business prospects by suggesting companies simply plug their data into Palantir's software and wait for it to spit out results -- a suggestion some took as aggressive and presumptuous.

Mr. Karp says clients have always controlled their own data.

Palantir's strategy with corporations reached a nadir around three years ago, when companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Hershey Co. dropped multimillion-dollar contracts with it. JPMorgan declined to comment. A Hershey spokesman said "Our project with Palantir was part of a learning journey in building these capabilities to garner insights."

Mr. Karp characterizes those struggles as part of a creative process now yielding results.

"This is not a science," he says. "We are a colony of artists. You cannot go to Basquiat or Monet and say, 'Well, that painting didn't capture the time.'"

To better appeal to corporations, Palantir about two years ago began rolling out a new product, Foundry, that amounts to off-the-rack software that amalgamates and crunches data across an organization.

Unlike prior efforts, in which engineers would tailor software client-by-client, Palantir designed Foundry to be more generic and folded into customers' existing computer networks. The software is typically used by dozens or hundreds of workers, not just software engineers who need special training. Palantir says it can potentially assign smaller teams to each client and reap bigger profits.

Foundry is helping Credit Suisse stitch together accounts across the world for a single client and spot potential money laundering, says the bank's chief compliance officer, Lara Warner. Merck uses it to manage sales data of fertility drugs in China and better forecast demand and inventory, a problem for which Merck early dispatched its own data-science team without success, Chief Digital Officer James Kugler says.

Fiat Chrysler uses the system to pinpoint part recalls. United says it began using Foundry this year to crunch customer surveys on when, for instance, an aircraft seat won't recline, and shoot the information to the appropriate mechanic where the plane has spare time on the ground and to a gate agent who can placate the flier.

"Our data problems are not a small number of big-data problems; they are a collection of thousands upon thousands of really small but interconnected problems," says Marc Fontaine, the digital transformation officer at Palantir client Airbus. Foundry's breakthrough, he says, is to "keep building and reusing the edifice that we use."

Palantir has lost its aversion to salespeople. It says it hired 35 of them this year.

The company ended last year with around $600 million of revenue and expects them to reach more than $750 million in 2018 and $1 billion in 2019, people briefed on the figures say. It has told investors it hopes to earn 70% of its revenue from corporations in the near future, from around half at present and around none in its early days.

Palantir still faces a public-perception problem. It has long drawn criticism for government work including software to help law enforcement expand surveillance of suspects. It has earned billions from U.S. government contracts across administrations of both parties, but immigration and privacy advocates have recently criticized its contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, suggesting the company is helping the Trump administration's separation of migrant families.

In meetings this year, some employees begged executives to end ICE contracts. Mr. Karp told them that Palantir helps stem the cross-border flow of drugs, not separate families, and that he wouldn't make business decisions to comport with short-term politics.

"They can't run their business on the basis of the latest political thing," says Palantir investor Mr. Langone, "or they wouldn't have a business."

Mr. Karp says his family has distaste for Palantir's work and that the Trump era has made it harder to make sales pitches.

"There are lots of customers globally and some domestically who feel they do not want to be affiliated with a company that powers the clandestine agencies of the world," he says. "We want a public perception that reflects who we are, and not everyone will like it."

Some investors say they are putting increasing pressure on Palantir, which has consistently pushed back IPO plans, to go public. "It's probably time to do something public," says Tim Sullivan, chief executive of Palantir investor Oceanic Partners. On the private markets, he says, "there's not very much demand" for shares.

Palantir reports financials in an annual staff gathering and this year the meeting was held late. That alarmed employees, whom Palantir has paid partly in hard-to-sell stock tied to company performance. Engineering head Shyam Sankar later stood before staff and warned that competition was stiffening.

"The Uruk-hai are coming!" he said, referring to a villainous "Lord of the Rings" army. Palantir offered additional pay in equity to staff who stick around long-term and slashed the per-share price of such options.

Mr. Karp says new cost-cutting efforts, like a pared-back travel policy, are about avoiding waste.

Morgan Stanley investment bankers have told Palantir that if it is to go public near the high end of a $36 billion to $41 billion valuation, it must convince the market there are years of growth ahead, say people familiar with the discussions.

Morgan Stanley's mutual funds, which own Palantir shares, in filings estimate Palantir's value at under $5 billion as of June. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Other funds peg the value higher.

Mr. Karp says Palantir's attitude toward an IPO is "completely schizophrenic." He told the Journal two years ago that an offering would allow employees "liquidity at a fair price." He now professes to have "no fixed opinion" on one.

Technology (A Special Report) --- More VC Money Put Into Fewer Deals

It has been a fast ride for Mexico City-based startup Grin Inc., which wants to bring shared electric scooters to market throughout Latin America.

Grin incorporated in April and launched its operations in July while at the Silicon Valley startup boot camp Y Combinator, where investors swooped in to give it a $20 million check. By October, it had raised $25 million more.

The rapid fundraising has been "amazing, as a founder," says Grin co-founder Sergio Romo, who says the investments valued the company at $182 million. "We knew if we wanted to be competitive in the space and move fast, we needed to raise a big round."

The investment frenzy that propelled Uber Technologies Inc., WeWork Cos. and other giant startups' valuations to new heights has trickled down to companies at their infancy.

But unlike the dot-com boom, when seemingly any 20-something with an idea was handed a check, investors are concentrating more money into fewer deals, leading to ballooning valuations.

The median size of seed investments -- usually the first money invested in a startup -- in the first nine months of this year in the U.S. stood at $2 million, nearly four times the $550,000 average in 2013, while the median valuation at the seed stage rose to $7 million from $4.7 million, according to data firm PitchBook. Startups in hot sectors or those run by more experienced entrepreneurs are taking on $30 million or $40 million before they've even launched their operations.

Within the past two months, one autonomous-trucking startup, Kodiak Robotics, announced a $40 million first round of investment, while another, Ike Robotics, is in talks with venture capitalists for an investment of more than $40 million, according to people familiar with the discussions. A financial-tech company called Figure Technologies, founded by Michael Cagney, the former chief executive of online lender Social Finance, raised $50 million in its first announced fundraising.

At the same time, the number of U.S. startups receiving an initial round of financing fell 40% in the first nine months of this year from the same period in 2015, to 1,594, according to PitchBook, as investors say there are fewer entrepreneurs who have viable ideas.

This price inflation for new startups is raising the stakes for investors, since companies are at their riskiest when the business isn't proven, or is only an idea.

Michael Seibel, chief executive of Y Combinator, says companies coming out of its incubator typically are valued between $6 million and $12 million. Grin was an extreme case, he says, coming at the height of a broader scooter frenzy among investors. Still, valuations and terms typically get bid up for the hottest 5% to 10% of companies in the incubator's batches, he says. That can sometimes mean raising too much money, leading to wasteful spending decisions, he says. "Sometimes founders can get carried away when they're one of the hot companies."

The emergence of small venture-capital shops is helping to propel startup valuations. While new entrants in venture capital were once rare, at least 223 U.S. firms have raised their first venture fund since 2012, according to PitchBook, bringing in more than $15 billion in new money.

These early-stage funds are popping up in increasingly esoteric areas. There are cannabis funds, artificial-intelligence funds and at least nine new real-estate-focused venture funds. Athletes like basketball star Kevin Durant and retired baseball great Derek Jeter are investing in early startups; football legend Joe Montana has a fund that invested in Grin.

For those looking for less competition, investors have -- not ironically -- coined a new term: pre-seed investing. It's essentially seed funding, in that it's the first money put into a company by outside investors, but it tends to involve smaller checks and to come even earlier in a company's life than seed funding traditionally has.

Meanwhile, some venture firms that typically invest at later stages are investing earlier to avoid colliding with SoftBank Group Corp.'s $92 billion Vision Fund and a number of other record-size growth funds being raised to back companies closer to their initial public offerings of shares.

"These megafunds have an impact that trickles down to the earlier stages," says Joe Horowitz, managing general partner at Icon Ventures, who says he finds the large checks and increased valuations concerning. Excess money is easily wasted, he says, through advertising or sales staff in an attempt to grow.

"Some markets can only grow at a certain pace no matter how much money you throw at them," he says.

Online lending: US fintechs gain from behaving more like banks

Platforms once out to change  the entire system  move away from  tech    and risk

When Noah Breslow rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in the week before Christmas 2014, it was a high point   perhaps the high point   for the fledgling online lending industry.

The company he ran, OnDeck, had grown rapidly in the years after the financial crisis by supplying quick and fuss-free credit to small businesses over the internet.

By then hundreds of similar online platforms had sprung up, trying to bypass Main Street lenders like Chase and Bank of America, which were grappling with a whole host of tougher regulations brought in after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.

One company targeting consumer loans, Lending Club of San Francisco, had made a splashy market debut two weeks before OnDeck, talking of transforming  the entire banking system, making it more transparent, more cost efficient, more consumer friendly .

Much of the excitement has evaporated. Rising delinquencies on some classes of loans and a governance scandal at Lending Club have given the entire industry a rough ride.

Talk of putting big brick-and-mortar lenders like Citibank and Bank of America out of business has turned to working with them, providing ready-made parcels of loans the banks can hold, while supplying software so that banks can originate loans to their existing customers more efficiently.

Meanwhile, most of the platforms have slashed sales teams, while increasing staff in their compliance and legal departments, as regulators have begun to pay more attention to the potential threats the platforms pose to financial stability.

Mr Breslow, a fast-talking Bostonian, says the entire online lending industry is better, and more durable, for that humbling experience. OnDeck itself has made money for its shareholders in three of the last four quarters, and has seen its shares more than double since a trough in May last year.

 2015 to 2017 was a pretty interesting time,  says the 43-year-old chief executive, from OnDeck s headquarters on Broadway in New York.  But we made some aggressive changes. 

Tech-focused investors were primed for rapid revenue growth, and when it failed to materialise, they sold the stock.

Key to the turnround was a realisation that the original  marketplace  structure had to change. Under that model, also known as  peer-to-peer,  companies like OnDeck tried to act like simple matchmakers, connecting applicants with investors who liked the look of their credit profile, in exchange for an upfront fee.

Back in the summer of 2015, some 40 per cent OnDeck s loans were funded that way. But that left it vulnerable to withdrawals of investors when market sentiment soured, leaving the company with a mountain of fixed costs to cover with patchy income.

Now, the company has shifted almost entirely to signing long-term supply deals with institutions such as banks and life insurance companies. Every loan that comes in through the door is effectively already committed to be sold.

OnDeck has aimed to overhaul its shareholder register, meanwhile, going out of its way to attract finance-focused investors, rather than tech accounts that wanted to see gung-ho growth every quarter.

OnDeck s skew towards the latter kind of investor was a byproduct of its initial public offering, when  fintech  was among the hottest themes on Wall Street. Back then, underwriters had courted tech-focused fund managers with prospectuses laden with Silicon Valley buzzwords like  total addressable market  and  proprietary algorithms that leverage behavioural data .

Investors like these were primed for rapid revenue growth, and when this failed to materialise, they sold the stock. OnDeck s peak-to-trough decline in its share price was 86 per cent; Lending Club s was 90 per cent. However much the companies protested that slower top-line growth was actually a positive   implying that they were being more selective on lending   investors were unpersuaded.

Over the past couple of years OnDeck has spent more time at investor conferences focused on financial stocks, while cultivating more of a following among financials-focused analysts.

The rewards are coming through, says one institutional investor who spoke on condition of anonymity. The problem was not the business   which is sound   but  the messaging , he says, which was falling on deaf ears.

I still think we are a fintech but a  tech  is a stretchNoah Breslow, OnDeck

Mr Breslow is happier with the investor mix now and how results are received. In the second quarter, for example, OnDeck reported a slight fall in loan originations, from $591m to $587m. But investors welcomed a relatively low net charge-off rate   a measure of bad debt   of 11.2 per cent, from 18.6 per cent a year earlier.

In the third quarter originations were back up and the charge-off rate edged down further, to 11.1 per cent. Shares in the company bounced almost one-third following the results   the biggest one-day move since the IPO.

 I still think we are a fintech but a  tech  is a stretch,  says Mr Breslow.  We acknowledge we have 	. 	. 	. 	credit risk and liquidity risk, which are hallmarks of financial companies,  he adds.  But at the same time I think we have a very differentiated 	. 	. 	. 	model at the core, which is powered by original technology and original analytics. Over time we expect companies in this business to be primarily valued by profits.

Elliott and Veritas team up to buy Athenahealth for $5.7bn

Deal values US healthcare technology group at 12% premium to last closing share price

Private equity firm Veritas Capital and hedge fund Elliott Management have agreed to buy US healthcare technology group Athenahealth for $5.7bn. The cash deal, announced Monday morning, values the provider of electronic healthcare record and medical billing software at $135 a share.

Elliott, which owns about 9 per cent of Athenahealth, will hold a minority stake via its Evergreen Coast Capital private equity arm.

For Veritas, which has some $10bn of assets under management, the buyout will be among the largest ever completed by the New York-based group.

The private equity fund has made a string of acquisitions over the past several years, including the purchase of a GE Healthcare unit in July for just under $1.1bn, which it intends to combine with its new acquisition.

Jeff Immelt, the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric who joined Athenahealth as chairman in February, said the  agreement with Veritas 	. 	. 	. 	maximises value for our shareholders and accelerates our goal to transform healthcare.  The $5.7bn price tag is based on Athenahealth s fully diluted share count.

The deal comes five months after Jonathan Bush, a co-founder of the company, resigned as chief executive after damaging revelations surrounding his personal life.

Mr Bush had been embroiled in a bitter tussle with Elliot, which was trying to boot him out of his role, arguing he was mismanaging the company.

Elliott approached Athenahealth with a $160-per-share takeover offer in May, a year after taking a stake in the company, but talks fizzled as the company s shares proved volatile. The stock rose as high as $164 in the wake of the Elliott offer in May but it closed at $120.35 on Friday, taking its decline for the year to nearly 10 per cent.

The activist fund lambasted the board for  fail[ing] to correct a host of identifiable operational issues . It said Athenahealth, which was one of the biggest winners from rules introduced under the Obama administration that required doctors to move their paper files over to computerised systems, was doomed to underperformance as a public company.

Some analysts said clunky technology left the company vulnerable to competition from better technologies using big data and artificial intelligence to help guide physicians. Last week, Athenahealth said third-quarter revenue fell short of analyst forecasts.

Elliott is run by Paul Singer, the activist investor whose decade-long battle over defaulted bonds issued by the government of Argentina at one point involved detaining one of the country s navy ships while it was docked in a Ghanaian port.

China's Race to Dominate AI; In an interview, Kai-Fu Lee also discusses why he thinks U.S. tech giants will never succeed in expanding in China

The U.S. may be winning the race in artificial intelligence for now. But it won't last for long.

So predicts Kai-Fu Lee, chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a Beijing-based venture-capital firm. He believes the U.S.'s current technological edge over China could disappear within five years, thanks to government support, a growing force of entrepreneurs and their speed of execution.

Mr. Lee, who previously was the head of Google Inc. in China, recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal about the AI race, entrepreneurship in China, and prospects for leading U.S. tech companies in the world's most populous country. Edited excerpts follow.

China vs. U.S.

WSJ: How do Chinese and U.S. strategies to develop AI differ?

MR. LEE: China's techno-utilitarian policy encourages technology to be launched first, observed, and allowed to proceed without obstruction if things go smoothly. If there are issues, it could quickly come up with regulations. An example is mobile payments. In the U.S., this might raise all kinds of lobby, security, hacking concerns from the credit-card companies and banks. But in China, Tencent and Alibaba were permitted to try to run payment systems as software companies, and they did a great job. Mobile payment took over in China.

In China, a highway is being built with sensors to improve autonomous driving, new cities are being developed with autonomous vehicles; some with two layers of roads one layer for pedestrians, pets, bicycles, and another layer for cars. All of these will help with testing for autonomous-vehicle systems to be launched sooner. With AI applications, you need a lot of data to do testing. China has a lot of data, so its approach allows it to move faster.

WSJ: What do you think the U.S. needs to improve on and where does China need to invest further when it comes to AI?

MR. LEE: It's going to be about who has more data, faster entrepreneurs, lots of AI engineers and government support. China will continue to catch up against the U.S. in terms of building products and monetizing. What could work in the U.S.'s favor is if someone disrupts the whole thing with a brand new fundamental technological change.

WSJ: Which country is ahead?

MR. LEE: In internet AI, which is algorithms making profitable recommendations for people based on their Web browsing history, China and the U.S. are about equal. China will probably get ahead because it has more user data. In business AI, where companies mine their customer data to come up with new product ideas and improve service, or use it to monitor systems to make them more efficient or lucrative, the U.S. is ahead, and will probably stay ahead because its enterprise data is properly archived and more usable for AI. In perception AI, or things like facial recognition and other biometric interfaces, China is ahead because it is building more sensors cheaply and for broader uses, and it will probably get further ahead.

In autonomous vehicles, it's incredibly hard to tell because it depends on policy. The question is, is the road ahead to making autonomous vehicles ubiquitous mostly about technology breakthroughs? Then the U.S. is ahead. If it's a matter of rapidly testing and evolving without policy, lobbying and unions holding it back, it would be China in the lead.

Work and the workplace

WSJ: What jobs will disappear because of AI?

MR. LEE: Customer service, but not every kind. Customer service with very high-end human touch will stay. Telemarketing and telesales will disappear. Dish washing, fruit picking, assembly-line inspection will all disappear. Paralegals and accountants but not 100%. Some lawyers who do form filling, those would be replaced.

Creativity-oriented jobs are safe. Working in a construction environment is safe. Cleaning is hard to do for a robot and every house is different, so that's safe.

WSJ: China is known for its intense startup work culture. It's often referred to as 996 work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. Is this a critical factor to the success of Chinese startups? Can this work culture foster true innovation?

MR. LEE: The most important things are focus, tenacity, operational excellence, speed of execution and hard work. They all come together. If you are just hard working but working dumb, that's not good. Then you get burned out. I'm personally concerned about my entrepreneurs but I don't have much hope of changing them. This culture cannot be changed in the next two to three decades as China still emerges from its current state.

WSJ: Do you think Chinese tech companies will be more successful because entrepreneurs there do the grunt work?

MR. LEE: The Chinese companies are not nearly as breakthrough-innovative as the many Silicon Valley greats. Whether it's Elon Musk or Steve Jobs. The whole Chinese education system doesn't really easily train these types of brilliant thinkers. But on the other hand, I think if Silicon Valley or the U.S. continues to view China as copycats, then it will miss many opportunities. The stereotype of looking at Chinese companies as lower-quality copycats will cause American entrepreneurs to have blinders on and miss stuff they should learn.

Chinese innovation

WSJ: Is there real innovation coming out of China now?

MR. LEE: Absolutely. WeChat [a payment and messaging platform from Tencent] is an example. If you look at ByteDance [the company that operates the news-aggregation app Toutiao], while traditional media may not like the content that's being put through, it's a very innovative way for displaying content. Think about minivideos Vine [a video app that was owned by Twitter] never worked out, but Chinese companies are doing great with minivideos. Bike-sharing apps like Mobike, these are innovative, creative business solutions that add value, but they weren't created the Silicon Valley way.

WSJ: Trade tensions between China and the U.S. are making it more difficult for foreign companies in China and Chinese companies looking to expand in the U.S. What are the prospects for U.S. tech companies in China?

MR. LEE: It's almost irrelevant. The U.S. and China are almost parallel universes. American companies will not succeed in China, with or without significant regulation. Same for Chinese companies in the U.S. We're almost at a point, at least in consumer internet and AI companies, where U.S. companies don't fit the ecosystem. Let's say ByteDance wants to come to the U. S. how are they going to get people to trust this brand? How will it answer questions about the newsfeed?

WSJ: So you don't think the Chinese government is making it more difficult for foreign companies to operate there? Or is it more an issue that U.S. companies built products that don't work for consumers in China?

MR. LEE: I actually think Google and Facebook will get some element of their products in China. But I don't think they will be successful, just because of the parallel-universe reason. Clearly, they are talking [about expanding into China] and Waymo [the autonomous-driving unit of Alphabet Inc.] got approval in Shanghai. Where American companies are likely to have a chance would be to work in a simple, nontangled part of this parallel universe such as doing something brand new.

Good day. SAP has agreed to acquire Qualtrics Inc. for $8 billion. The move takes the enterprise software startup off the market days before it was set to debut as a public company, echoing a similar scenario in January 2017, when Cisco Systems Inc. snatched up AppDynamics Inc. just before its own initial public offering.

VC winners in the SAP deal include Accel and Sequoia Capital, which first invested in Qualtrics in 2012, pumping in $35 million each at a $350 million valuation, according to a person familiar with the figures.

Accel and Sequoia own 16% and 9% of Qualtrics, respectively. Insight Venture Partners owns 15% after investing in a subsequent round of financing.

Utah-based Qualtrics had a $2.5 billion valuation in April 2017, after raising $180 million.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Crypto reboot: As an early cryptocurrency-focused firm, Pantera Capital racked up wins from investments in bitcoin and parlayed them into a crypto portfolio with hot startups. But Pantera's algorithmic Digital Asset Fund, one of the firm's newest funds, recently shifted its approach to rely on a more hands-on selection from its team after poor performance this year amid a collapse in the crypto market. Despite Pantera's early gains in its venture and bitcoin funds, the change presents a challenge for the firm, coming as Pantera works on raising multiple new crypto and venture funds. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has the exclusive.

Test for biotech unicorns: Moderna Inc., a $7 billion developer of new messenger RNA therapeutics, revealed plans to go public in what promises to be the most closely watched biotech IPO in recent memory. Biotech startups have been herded into the public markets recently as growth-hungry investors bet heavily on small drugmakers. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Next act: Nearly three months after leaving as GE Ventures' head of health-care technology investments, Lisa Suennen has chosen a new career path. Ms. Suennen will lead the venture fund of Manatt Phelps & Phillips, a legal and consulting firm. Additionally, she will head the firm's digital technology business, which helps companies strategically implement new technologies and protocols. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

Roof's Take: Unicorns Stampede in Breath-Taking Numbers

By Katie Roof

Startup valuations are hitting the billion-dollar mark in record numbers with still with no end in sight.

So far this year, 44 companies have joined the Billion Dollar Startup Club, according to PitchBook Data. This surpasses the 43 so-called unicorns that were newly minted in all of 2015, the previous record.

The year's entrants include scooter company Bird Rides Inc. and food delivery specialist DoorDash Inc., which both raised multiple rounds of capital in 2018.

While some view the trend as a sign that the industry has plenty of businesses ripe with promise, others worry that investors may be getting carried away.

Former Fed Vice Chair Voices Concern at Loosening Regulations | Fed Plans to Ease Stress Tests | Trump Administration to Drive Shift at Fannie, Freddie; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Monday, November 12, 2018

Good day. The Federal Reserve plans more changes that should ease the burden of stress tests on banks, as Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles outlined a sweetening of an April proposal that was already set to make things easier for financial institutions. A former Fed official spoke out against the central bank's regulatory rollbacks. Stanley Fischer, the former vice chairman, said he found such moves extremely worrisome. The Fed on Friday also said it would start publishing a report on the stability of the U.S. financial system, with the first one due Nov. 28.

Now for today's news and analysis &

Fed to Further Overhaul Stress-Testing Regime, Making It Easier for Banks to Pass

The Federal Reserve "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-to-further-overhaul-stress-testing-regime-making-it-easier-for-banks-to-pass-1541774507" its proposal to ease stress tests for the nation's largest banks with changes that could reduce the chance they fail the annual assessments. Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles in a Friday speech said the agency was considering revisions that could make the test scenarios more consistent from year to year and give firms their results before they wrap up shareholder-return plans. Big banks must pass the Fed's stress tests to be able to make shareholder payouts, although the timing of the test results means banks set those plans before knowing how they performed.

Federal Reserve to Begin Publishing Financial Stability Report

The Federal Reserve said it plans to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-begin-publishing-financial-stability-report-1541799312" a periodic report on the stability of the U.S. financial system, a bid to shed light on a potential source of risk as the economy's expansion progresses. The Financial Stability Report will be published semiannually beginning Nov. 28 and will feature an overview of how the Fed's Washington-based board of governors assesses the financial sector's resilience, the central bank said.

Fed's Former Second-in-Command Warns on Regulation Rollback

Stanley Fischer, the Federal Reserve's former vice chairman, is not happy with the push to ease banking regulations erected in the wake of the financial crisis.

Those rules were meant to ensure trouble at financial firms wouldn't again pull the economy into a free fall, Mr. Fisher told a gathering Friday at New York University. Now, "we are going in the other direction" and the easing of rules "is something that I find extremely worrisome."

Mr. Fisher acknowledged new rules like those in the Dodd-Frank Act made a lot of financial firms mad and that both small and large banks have been up in arms about their burdens. But he said a critical lesson central bankers and others need to take from the so-called great recession was lax bank oversight was a major driver of the crisis.

"The great recession, the great financial crisis, had as much to do with failures of supervision as with failures of monetary policy," Mr. Fischer said. Even now, "we have not taken that into account, with the same degree of seriousness, with the same degree of research work, that we've done in monetary theory and monetary policy."

Mr. Fischer didn't call out any leaders by name. Under the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, Randal Quarles, the central bank "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-to-further-overhaul-stress-testing-regime-making-it-easier-for-banks-to-pass-1541774507" parts of its regulatory structure, including the annual stress tests the central bank puts banks through to ensure they can withstand severe economic distress without failing and requiring bailouts.

Regulators are also "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-will-banks-do-with-cash-freed-up-by-rule-changes-no-one-knows-1541156404" requiring banks to keep cash on hand to deal with short-term bills, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-set-to-propose-looser-rules-for-large-u-s-banks-1540995057" how banks of different sizes are treated by regulations. Meanwhile, banks themselves "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-push-for-regulators-to-ease-up-on-them-1541509320" for a lighter regulatory touch.

Mr. Fischer, who served as vice chairman at the Fed from 2014 through 2017, was making points that should resonate.

There's a worry that current central-bank leaders and other regulatory authorities are forgetting just how severe the financial crisis was, and how large a role a light supervisory regime had played in creating the trouble. Some are concerned that rules are being pared back late in an economic expansion that may soon become the longest on record. Giving banks a freer hand now may lead to a new round of imprudent behavior, to uncertain ends.

Fed's Williams: Good Growth Depends on Strong Job Market

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said strong economic growth "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-williams-good-growth-depends-on-strong-job-market-1541772464" to what is going on in the job market. Sustained solid rates of growth are "dependent on a healthy job market," Mr. Williams told a conference at his bank. Mr. Williams, who is vice chairman of the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, didn't comment on the monetary policy outlook.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-harker-does-not-comment-on-monetary-policy-outlook-1541771121"

Russia Demotes Dollar's Role at Home, Taking a Swipe at U.S.

Russia is trying to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-demotes-dollars-role-at-home-taking-a-swipe-at-u-s-1541959204" as its economy buckles under U.S. sanctions and the country prepares for stricter penalties expected later this month. Russia's central bank now backs plans to execute more trade deals in rubles and other currencies, and tax incentives are being considered for exporters that shun the dollar.

China Central Bank Ready to Fine-Tune Policy if Necessary

China's central bank said it would ""https://centralbanking.cmail20.com/t/d-i-njtkrll-l-u/"" and fine-tune monetary policy as conditions warrant, while maintaining its usual prudent and neutral stance, in a likely nod to the potential effects of a trade conflict with the U.S., among other pressures.

U.S. on a Course to Spend More on Debt Than Defense

In the past decade, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-on-a-course-to-spend-more-on-debt-than-defense-1541937600" has risen to $15.9 trillion from $5.1 trillion, but financing all of that debt hasn't been a problem. Low inflation and strong global demand for safe U.S. Treasury bonds held the government's interest costs down. That's in the process of changing. In 2017, interest costs on federal debt of $263 billion accounted for 6.6% of all government spending and 1.4% of gross domestic product, well below averages of the previous 50 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates interest spending will rise to $915 billion by 2028, or 13% of all outlays and 3.1% of gross domestic product.

Mortgage Industry Braces for Trump Administration to Make Changes at Fannie, Freddie

By Andrew Ackerman

Split power in Congress means lawmakers are unlikely to overhaul how the government backstops more than half the U.S. mortgage market. That provides an opportunity for the Trump administration to take steps on its own and the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-industry-braces-for-trump-administration-to-make-changes-at-fannie-freddie-1541955600" to soften any potential changes.

In the short term, inaction is likely good news for the housing market as home sales and prices weaken amid rising interest rates. But the White House is expected to consider steps in the coming months that could reduce the government's footprint in backstopping the market through mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae FNMA -1.86% and Freddie Mac , FMCC -1.57% which have been under government control since the 2008 crisis.

The changes under consideration wouldn't affect existing mortgages, but could make it tougher and more expensive for people to get new ones.

The mortgage industry is wary of potentially disruptive policy shifts. The housing market is experiencing its longest slump in four years, weighed down by a combination of rising mortgage rates and high home prices, a dearth of inventory and a new tax law that reduces incentives for homeownership.

Some two dozen housing groups urged Washington policy makers in a September open letter to take "great care" that any efforts to remove Fannie and Freddie from government control "are prudently developed and implemented over a sensible time horizon."

Fannie and Freddie don't make loans. They purchase mortgages from lenders and repackage them as securities that are insured if the loans default, maintaining the plumbing of the $10 trillion U.S. mortgage market.

Getting Fannie and Freddie out of government conservatorship is the largest piece of unfinished business from the crisis era. While lawmakers have said overhauling the companies is a priority, they disagree on how to do it. The split in Congress come January means there is likely even less of a chance that legislation affecting Fannie and Freddie will become law.

In the coming weeks, the Trump administration is expected to signal its intentions for the companies when it nominates a successor to Mel Watt, the Obama-appointed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the companies. Mr. Watt is due to step down in early January when his five-year term expires. A nominee is expected around that time.

A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.

A conservative FHFA chief focused on drastically shrinking the government's role in housing could raise the fees the companies charge lenders to guarantee loans, potentially making it more expensive for borrowers to complete a loan backed by Fannie or Freddie. The new FHFA director also could decrease the maximum size of a loan that the companies could purchase, reversing increases during Mr. Watt's tenure that allowed larger loans to get Fannie and Freddie's backing. Such a move could have outsize effects in expensive coastal states such as California and New York, according to housing experts.

The industry is pushing the White House to consider more of a middle ground. They hope a new FHFA director will take only modest, incremental steps to reduce the companies' footprints in housing and to encourage new competitors backed with private capital.

"The question is more about pace than where we end up," Mortgage Bankers Association chief executive Robert Broeksmit said.

Abrupt changes to the companies' inner workings could cause more headwinds for the housing market, analysts say, driving borrowers to more expensive loans not backstopped by the government that might come with higher down-payment requirements and interest rates.

In Congress, it remains unlikely that lawmakers will be able to overcome major philosophical differences to hammer out any deal, despite pledges from some of them. Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), the expected new head of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, recently said she would make the issue a priority. Senate Republicans, likewise, have put the issue at the top of their to-do list.

This year's efforts to overhaul the companies fizzled out, as did a similar push in 2014. While top leaders in both parties promise a fresh attempt in 2019, tackling the matter remains a tall order because lawmakers have divergent views on what to do.

Conservative Republicans have generally called for a private market with limited or no new federal guarantees. Some centrist Republicans and many Democrats say a federal role is needed to preserve liquid markets for the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that drives home buying.

Goldman Sachs's Ex-CEO Lloyd Blankfein Met Malaysian at Center of 1MDB Scandal

By Tom Wright and Liz Hoffman

Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachss-ex-ceo-met-malaysian-twice-at-center-of-1mdb-scandal-1541779363?mod=hp_lead_pos3" with a Malaysian financier at the center of one of the world's largest financial scandals, including one after the Wall Street bank's compliance department had raised multiple concerns about the financier's background and said the bank shouldn't do business with him.

The financier, Jho Low, was indicted this month by the U.S. Justice Department and charged with helping steal billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Bhd., an investment fund that he helped run from behind the scenes. The Justice Department further alleges that two Goldman Sachs bankers participated in the schemes while hiding their collaboration with Mr. Low from Goldman's management in New York.

The meetings, held in 2009 and 2013 for Mr. Blankfein to meet Najib Razak, Malaysia's then prime minister, included discussions of 1MDB, according to people familiar with the meetings.

A Goldman spokesman said Mr. Blankfein met many people in his 12-year tenure atop the bank, and couldn't have known Malaysia's leader would bring Mr. Low to either meeting. Mr. Blankfein has no recollection of meeting Mr. Low, he said. There is no indication Mr. Blankfein was aware of the bank's compliance concerns about Mr. Low at the time.

Asked last week at a public forum about the developing scandal, Mr. Blankfein laid the blame on rogue employees. "These are guys who evaded our safeguards and lie," he said.

The Justice Department is continuing to investigate Goldman's role in the 1MDB scandal, including which bankers were aware of Goldman's interactions with Mr. Low and how the bank handled the matter once it learned of the alleged fraud. The bank is also investigating, searching hundreds of thousands of pages of emails, calendars and travel records of employees involved in the deals.

Goldman helped 1MDB raise more than $6.5 billion through three bond issuances in 2012 and 2013, and in the process made around $600 million in profits. Over half of the sum raised was allegedly stolen by Mr. Low and others in a scheme Mr. Low masterminded, according to the Justice Department indictment. The bank has said it couldn't have known what would happen to the money it helped raise.

Mr. Low, who Malaysia's government believes is in China, has denied wrongdoing.Tim Leissner, Goldman's former chairman of Southeast Asia, pleaded guilty in August to conspiring to launder money and violate foreign antibribery laws for helping siphon billions of dollars from the bond deals, according to filings made public last week. Former Goldman managing director Roger Ng was indicted on three counts of conspiring to violate foreign antibribery laws and launder money, the filings show.

When he pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Mr. Leissner said he "conspired with other employees and agents of Goldman Sachs very much in line of its culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees of Goldman Sachs," according to a heavily redacted transcript of the hearing, released Friday.

"I and several other employees of Goldman Sachs at the time also concealed that we knew that Jho Low was promising and paying bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials to obtain and retain 1MDB business for Goldman Sachs," Mr. Leissner said, adding that he and his co-workers knew some of the cash for the bribes came from the bonds Goldman sold for 1MDB.

An attorney for Mr. Leissner declined to comment on the indictment. Mr. Ng, who is under arrest in Malaysia, couldn't be reached.

The indictment also named an "Italian national" at Goldman as a co-conspirator who allegedly helped keep Mr. Low's involvement in 1MDB hidden from the bank's management in New York. People familiar with the matter say the person is Andrea Vella, a Hong Kong-based partner who helped structure the 1MDB bonds and rose to be co-head of investment banking in Asia.

Goldman put Mr. Vella on leave after the indictment was unsealed last week. He had been stripped of his management responsibilities two weeks earlier in a management shakeup. Mr. Vella, who hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, didn't respond to a request for comment.

In 2015, after news about 1MDB broke in international media, Goldman moved to reduce the size of its Singapore office, through which much of the 1MDB bond transaction business had been run.

One of the executives on a list of people to be laid off at the time, a Swiss national named Cyrus Shey who had worked closely with Mr. Vella on the 1MDB bonds, was unhappy about being fired, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Vella told colleagues at Goldman he was concerned Mr. Shey could go public with details about 1MDB at a time of scrutiny of the business, and he interceded to ensure Mr. Shey wasn't immediately let go, according to the person. Mr. Shey later got a $1.5 million private loan from Mr. Leissner, who was then Goldman's chairman of Southeast Asia, the person said. Mr. Leissner left the bank in early 2016.

Mr. Shey didn't respond to questions. His lawyer said Mr. Shey never planned to discuss 1MDB publicly; the lawyer didn't respond to questions about the private loan from Mr. Leissner.

Mr. Leissner and his lawyer didn't respond to requests for comments for this article.

The Justice Department indictment alleges that Messrs. Leissner and Ng sought to cover up their activities by repeatedly assuring Goldman executives Mr. Low wasn't involved in their work with 1MDB, even as Mr. Low kept turning up at meetings.

The first meeting attended by Mr. Blankfein in November 2009, in New York's Four Season's hotel, was set up by Messrs. Leissner and Ng for Goldman to pursue deals with 1MDB, according to an affidavit, made public last week, from an FBI agent involved in the investigations.

Two months earlier, Mr. Leissner had attempted to get Mr. Low an account with Goldman's private bank in Switzerland, but was turned down because of compliance concerns about the source of Mr. Low's wealth, the affidavit says. Mr. Blankfein's attendance alongside Mr. Low and then-Prime Minister Najib at the 2009 meeting was first reported by Bloomberg.

In the following years, as Goldman helped 1MDB raise money, the role of Mr. Low at the fund was a constant source of concern for the bank's New York-based compliance executives and lawyers, the affidavit says. Two former Goldman executives based in Asia said Mr. Low's role in the fund was widely talked about in the office.

Lawyers and members of Goldman committees that vet deals constantly asked Mr. Leissner by email and in meetings whether Mr. Low was involved. On multiple occasions, Mr. Leissner denied that Mr. Low played any role, according to the affidavit.

In March 2013, Goldman sold the last of three bonds for 1MDB. On March 10, just over a week ahead of the $3 billion bond issuance, a meeting of a New York-based committee that decides what deals and clients Goldman should back quizzed Mr. Leissner about Mr. Low's role as an intermediary at 1MDB, the affidavit says.

After the deal, in late April, a member of the committee emailed Mr. Leissner with further concerns about Mr. Low's role, the affidavit adds. Mr. Leissner denied Mr. Low had any involvement, according to the affidavit.

Just a few months later, in September 2013, Mr. Blankfein met Mr. Low for a second time. Mr. Leissner arranged for Mr. Najib, Malaysia's then prime minister, to sit down with around 20 high-level Goldman clients at New York's Mandarin Oriental hotel. Mr. Low attended with Mr. Najib, people familiar with the matter say.

In late 2014, Mr. Blankfein praised Messrs. Leissner and Vella for their efforts in arranging business with Malaysia.

"Look at what Tim and Andrea did in Malaysia," he told a meeting in New York on how to build business in growth markets. "We have to do more of that."

Losses Pile Up at Fintech Firm SoFi as Rates Rise

By Peter Rudegeair

Online lender Social Finance Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/losses-pile-up-at-fintech-firm-sofi-as-rates-rise-1541947939" for the second consecutive quarter as loan volume sagged and the company spent big sums on expansion plans.

The San Francisco-based financial-technology startup recorded an adjusted loss of around $12 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during the third quarter, according to a person familiar with the company's financial results.

That came after an adjusted loss of around $150 million in the second quarter and an adjusted profit of $56 million in the third quarter of 2017, according to the person and an investor letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

SoFi's main business of refinancing student loans is particularly sensitive to interest rates. Lacking its own base of deposits, the company borrows money at variable rates from banks to then lend to recent graduates. Most of its target customers previously took out a student loan at a fixed rate from the federal government, so SoFi can only pass on so much of its own higher borrowing costs to consumers before its offers stop being competitive with borrowers' existing loans.

That dynamic helped drive down loan volume. The company extended around $2.5 billion in refinanced student, unsecured consumer and mortgage loans in the third quarter, according to the investor letter. That's down nearly 30% from the same period a year ago.

Under Anthony Noto, who took over as chief executive in March, loan volume has fallen for two straight quarters. Faced with a tougher environment for consumer lending, he has attempted to make the lending business more efficient while branching out into areas like banking and investing.

"We optimized for investing over profitability this quarter, and expect this to continue given the opportunity in front of us," Mr. Noto wrote. He said the company is emphasizing loan quality over volume.

SoFi Money, the company's high-interest checking account, is now available to nearly 700,000 SoFi customers. Mr. Noto wrote in the recent shareholder letter that the company is revamping its wealth-management service to let customers buy single stocks, exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrencies and make use of robo-advisor services by the end of the first quarter of 2019.

The new initiatives and other projects to improve SoFi's internal technology were costly in the third quarter, helping push the company's overall expenses above $100 million, according to the person familiar with SoFi's financials.

It's also not clear when they'll bear fruit. SoFi Money, for instance, charges no account fees and is designed to interest borrowers and retail investors in other SoFi services.

Some of SoFi's recent financial performance has been due to changes in the value of loans it holds on its balance sheet. That had a "material negative impact" on SoFi's second-quarter results but gave a boost to its third-quarter results as the company sold the vast majority of those loans at prices above where SoFi had revalued them, according to letters to shareholders.

In recent weeks, SoFi also closed on a $560 million revolving line of credit from a group of six banks, according to the shareholder letter. The Journal reported in July that SoFi executives were in talks for a loan that could help fund potential buyouts of other financial-technology firms.

Why  Free Trading' on Robinhood Isn't Really Free

By Alexander Osipovich and Lisa Beilfuss

In the 1990s, online brokerages like E*Trade Financial Corp. were the hot new way to play the stock market.

Now, that niche belongs to Robinhood Markets Inc., the Silicon Valley startup that has amassed six million users with a smartphone app, marketing aimed at millennials and commission-free trades.

But Robinhood isn't for everyone. And if you think that promise of free trading is too good to be true, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001?tesla=y".

Founded in 2012 and recently valued at $5.6 billion, Robinhood makes money, in part, by sending customer orders to high-frequency traders in exchange for cash. It's a controversial but legal practice in the brokerage industry called payment for order flow.

Robinhood says it makes free trading possible. "The revenue we receive from these rebates helps us cover the costs of operating our business and allows us to offer commission-free trading," Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev said in an Oct. 12 blog post.

Supporters of the practice say that routing orders to speedy traders benefits individual investors, because they can get better prices than they would at the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

But that's only if the broker passes that benefit, which brokers call "price improvement," down to the customer.

It's unclear whether Robinhood gives customers that benefit. Unlike E*Trade, Charles Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.  which also take payment for order flow Robinhood doesn't publish data on how much price improvement it gives customers.

The upshot: When you buy or sell shares on Robinhood, the app is likely executing your trade at a slightly worse price than another broker would, market veterans say.

A Robinhood spokesman declined to answer detailed questions for this article, pointing to Mr. Tenev's blog post and a list of frequently asked questions on Robinhood's website.

IS ROBINHOOD REALLY FREE?

It's free to set up an account, and there's no fee to execute trades.

Robinhood charges a monthly fee for its margin-lending service, Robinhood Gold. And if you want to move your account from Robinhood to another broker, you must pay $75.

Then there's the cost embedded in stock prices.

At brokers like Schwab or Fidelity Investments, when you buy shares, the price at which your order gets filled is generally a little lower than the price of buying those shares on public stock exchanges. Conversely, when you sell shares, the price is generally a bit higher than the exchanges' selling price.

The difference is often less than a penny. But it adds up for larger trades. Schwab, for instance, says that for orders of 500 to 1,999 shares of S&P 500 companies, the average savings from price improvement is $10.80.

Without any data, it's unclear whether Robinhood customers receive similar savings.

SO WHY ISN'T ROBINHOOD GIVING ME THAT BENEFIT?

To understand that, let's explore what happens when a broker sends your order to a high-speed trader.

Such firms make money by "market-making," or buying and selling shares all day and collecting the difference between the buy and sell price. That's risky to do on exchanges, where banks or hedge funds can suddenly snap up or dump many shares, moving their price and hitting market makers with losses. That risk leads market makers to be cautious and quote wider spreads. For instance, they might offer to buy Apple Inc. at $200.00 and sell Apple at $200.05, a five-cent spread.

But when market makers trade with individual investors, whose orders tend to be small, they can tighten those spreads. For instance, they might offer to buy Apple for $200.02 and sell it for $200.03, a one-cent spread.

That benefits small investors, who save two cents on each share buying at $200.03 instead of $200.05, for instance. The market maker still makes a small profit from the one-cent spread.

What if the broker demands a big payment from the market maker? That reduces the market maker's profit, forcing it to quote a wider spread. And the customer gets less price improvement.

And Robinhood appears to be taking more cash for orders than rivals, regulatory filings show.

If a customer buys 100 shares of Apple for $200 each a $20,000 purchase Robinhood could get up to $5.20 for routing that order to electronic-trading giant Citadel Securities LLC, according to calculations based on a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Schwab would be paid around 9 cents for sending the same order to Citadel, while TD Ameritrade would get 16 cents on average, according to these companies' SEC filings.

That's a nearly 60-to-1 difference between what Robinhood and Schwab are paid. The gap isn't always so wide, because of differences in the formulas used to determine the size of the payments. Still, Robinhood often makes much more for the same orders, the filings suggest.

One executive with a high-speed trading firm that executes orders for Robinhood said its price improvement is much worse than that of competing brokers.

Robinhood's FAQ says "our execution quality and speed matches or beats what's found at other major brokerages." But it doesn't give statistics on price improvement.

SO IS ROBINHOOD RIGHT FOR ME?

It depends. Robinhood is best for a small investor who makes frequent trades of a few shares at a time.

For small trades, the benefits of saving money on commissions outweigh any gains from price improvement, said Chris Nagy, managing principal of KOR Group, a firm that studies quality of trade executions.

But if you're trading hundreds or thousands of shares at a time, you're better off elsewhere, said Mr. Nagy, who was previously a TD Ameritrade executive. You might pay a $4.95 commission at a rival brokerage, but you would save more than that because the shares would have a better price than at Robinhood.

"At the end of the day," Mr. Nagy said, "there's no such thing as a free lunch."

Central-Bank Balance Sheets and Monetary Policy

"Monetary policy interest rates alone "https://voxeu.org/article/central-bank-balance-sheets-and-monetary-policy" as a sufficient representation of the stance of monetary policy, especially when they are at very low levels," Idris Ademuyiwa, Pierre Siklos and Samantha St. Amand write in a VoxEU column. "The use of unconventional monetary policies, including balance sheet policies and forward guidance, will likely become more frequent in the future." However, available data on central banks' balance sheets can make evaluating their policy stances difficult, they say, writing: "A global effort to improve the availability, timeliness, and quality of central bank balance sheet data is needed in order to improve the accountability of central bank interventions and promote robust empirical research. These efforts should include establishing internationally consistent balance sheet accounting principles for central banks, and identifying separate components of the balance sheet targeting monetary policy and financial stability policy."

Can technology alter the art market?

Tech World Cryptocurrency, blockchain and a fine art registry   what are the benefits and pitfalls and will AI replace human taste? By Alice Hancock

D ebate over the role of technology in the art market has exploded this year. Portion, an auction house that accepts only cryptocurrency, was launched last month. Before that there was the emergence of Codex Protocol, a new registry for fine art, wine and collectibles based on blockchain technology. Even the 252-year-old auction house Christie's has got in on the act. At its inaugural "Art and Tech" summit this summer, it explored questions that had more to do with new technologies than Old Masters. "What is blockchain, really?" was the title of one event. Will artificial intelligence one day be able to appraise art and antiques? This was another question posed by art valuation website Mearto to its clients in a survey in March. Fifty-five per cent of respondents thought the answer was "probably" or "definitely" yes. Art valuation is based on many factors. Mearto listed 10, from artist and subject to provenance, condition and, finally, the market. "You may be in possession of a beautiful work of art but if nobody's interested in buying it, unfortunately it doesn't hold much monetary value," the site says. The underlying issue is taste.

For an industry bound by tradition, things are moving   relatively   fast. Discussion has centred on two possible ways forward. Some in the industry are pro-blockchain, a decentralised digital ledger to which data are added in chronological "blocks"; some lean more towards the power of AI.

Anne Bracegirdle, a photography specialist at Christie's, is among blockchain's evangelists. She sees it as one way to put more information into the hands of clients who are frustrated with the market. "They will ask things like, 'This piece sold for 50,000 last week and now it's selling for 30,000. Why?' " Bracegirdle's vision is of a single blockchain-based industry-wide registry that would record provenance, ownership, condition and value. "Clients could understand the market themselves," she says. Right now, no complete record of fine-art ownership exists.

Using a "total registry" idea, consumers could also judge for themselves how much an artwork might be worth. There could be potential benefits for the art market too: greater transparency and trust, more secure data storage. However, such a registry would need immense amounts of data, much of it relating to pieces hundreds of years old. The investment, and workload, would be huge.

Jess Houlgrave, co-founder of Codex Protocol, believes in even greater democratisation. She thinks that anyone   not just art experts   should be able to add data to Codex's registry of artworks. The technology itself could be used to "verify the identity of the person adding something"   a good solution in an industry that is "all about reputation", she says.

Not everyone is convinced. Noah Wunsch, Sotheby's vice-president of digital strategy, believes it is still too early to tell what part blockchain might play in the art market. He wants to establish whether nanotechnology could be used to connect a physical object   be it a painting, sculpture or vase   to its entry on a digital registry. The link between object and online record "is a big part of the conversation that is often missed", he argues. Without it, blockchain is not worth the hype.

AI, Wunsch argues, is better developed for immediate consumer needs. Indeed, Sotheby's paid an undisclosed sum in January to acquire Thread Genius, an image recognition platform that uses machine learning to personalise recommendations of art to clients.

Wunsch is sensitive to the idea that automation could replace a specialist with years of market experience. "I think we are going to find out in the coming years whether the algorithm will be able to price art," he says. But he points to the success of other algorithms as a sign of how things might change. "We didn't think that a machine would be able to guess what music you might like."

For the moment, and without much industry consensus, neither AI nor blockchain looks set to replace human taste and judgment. But, as Wunsch points out: "The algorithm is never complete. It gets smarter and smarter."

For an industry bound by tradition, things are moving   relatively   fast

Goldman Sachs, Persimmon, Spotify, Symantec, Toyota, Macquarie, eBay and more

Dear readers,

Markets got what they wanted from the US midterm elections;gridlock.The Democrats took control of the House of Representatives while Republicans held the Senate. That spares Wall Street the uncertainty that comes from legislators attempting to legislate. Instead, investors hope to focus on fundamentals such as earnings.

Some hope. Earningsrose 25per cent in the third quarter, year on year, but that is a marker that earnings season is over. The yawning void will be filled with political scandal and monetary policy angst.

The last thing Wall Street wanted was to give US populists another reason to pull out the piata stick. Yet Goldman Sachs has offered itself up for another thrashing. The bank will receive kudos for a list of new partners featuring more women and members of minority groups. But that was overshadowed by news that the US Department of Justice has charged two Goldman employees with assisting with the multi-billion-dollar looting of 1MDB, Malaysia s sovereign investment fund. Lex noted that the old partnership model might have spared Goldman involvement in such controversies.

Banker-bashing is also a favourite pursuit of hard-left UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Investors are becoming increasingly wary of the chances that a Brexit-induced snafu may deliver another UK election that Mr Corbyn could win. The UK environment is not kind to highly paid executives, as the departure of Jeff Fairburn, boss of builder Persimmon, showed. And short-sellers such as Steve Eisman, who made a mint from the US subprime crisis, are placing their bets accordingly. However, Lex noted that mostUK stocks with bigshort positions are those facing big structural challenges, such as retail and construction, or those deemed simply overvalued, such as technology.

Yes, investors can get a bit carried away with tech stocks. Who knew? Spotify shares havelost about a third since peaking in July as the music streaming company succumbed to the broader market malaise. Buying your own shares when they become cheaper seems to make sense, but as Lex noted it is an unusual strategy for a high-growth company with heavy investment requirements. Meanwhile, protecting such online activity is the bailiwick of Symantec. The US cyber security group may be good at foiling hackers but it failed to forestall accounting irregularities. Lex reckons that Symantec investors would feel pretty chipper if a mooted bid from private equity group Thoma Bravo offered anything near a 30 per cent premium.

When technologicaland regulatory disruption coincide,large corporations need unaccustomed nimbleness. The automobilesector is under fire for failures in emission reduction, even as it scramblesto adapt to new energy and artificial intelligence protocols. Lex praisesToyota for thinking outsidethe steel box. Given Toyota s low share price, its pursuit of hydrogen-powered vehicles offers investors a free punt on fuel-cell technology.

Back in finance, there are some jurisdictions wherethe benefits of lighter regulation are being felt. Australia s Macquarie has delivered a total return to shareholders of 650 per cent over the past 10 years, noted Lex. That s more than three times what Goldmanmanages. It reflectsthe relatively free rein of the country s Prudential Regulation Authorityand the bank s exposure to a fast-growing region.

Still greater independencecan be found in the world of online auctions, where globalised price discovery has free marketeers salivating. Yet, as Lex observes, eBay is shifting its model more towardsfixed prices and behemoths such as Amazon are increasing their exposure to third-party sellers.

That s the difficultywith investing. Everything changes.

Have a good weekend,

Jamie Chisholm

Good day. An aspiring seed investor named Euwyn Poon is the man at the helm (or perhaps handlebars) of Spin, which is the first U.S. electric scooter startup to go corporate through an acquisition. Ford Motor Co. agreed to buy Spin for between $80 million and $90 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Soon after the deal was announced, WSJ Pro caught up with an ebullient-sounding Mr. Poon and learned that he took an unexpected route to running a scooter startup, having set out to make seed deals with capital he raised in China and through his network of fellow Y Combinator alumni.

While in China working with investors, he witnessed the boom in bike sharing and hit on the idea to do something like it with scooters.

Spin's decision to go with Ford was heavily based on the mobility industry's fast-changing landscape as regulation ramps up. Ford's longstanding relationships with cities and college campuses gives Spin, which failed to get operating permits in its hometown of San Francisco, valuable "leverage" as it grows at scale.

Mr. Poon likened Ford's purchase of Spin, founded in 2016, to "a Series C investment" and having a venture partner that can open doors for a fledgling startup.

Before settling on a deal with Ford, Spin was approached by prospective bidders spanning ride sharing, internet giants and other car makers, but he declined to name any of them.

Mr. Poon said his work with his seed firm, Exponent Capital, "moved to the back burner" as he focuses on running Spin.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Gateway to Gates: Investors are doubling down on their bet that two venture capitalists with ties to Bill Gates can make successful venture investments across a range of life-sciences sectors. Biomatics Capital Partners, co-founded by Julie Sunderland and Boris Nikolic, has raised $300 million for its second fund, two years after closing its debut vehicle at $200 million. Before starting Biomatics in 2016, Ms. Sunderland directed program-related investments for the Gates Foundation and Dr. Nikolic advised Mr. Gates on science and technology. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Revolution Ventures, the venture firm co-founded by America Online co-founder Steve Case, is aiming to raise $200 million for its third fund, according to a regulatory filing. In 2017, Revolution closed on $150 million for its Rise of the Rest Seed Fund. The Washington-based firm earlier this year invested in freelance finance worker marketplace Paro and framing service startup Framebridge Inc.

Health Velocity Capital has raised more than $185 million for its first fund, which will be invested in health-care software and services companies. Health Velocity, which has offices in San Francisco and Nashville, Tenn., makes growth-stage investments and raised Health Velocity Capital I from strategic investors like Cigna and financial backers, including pensions and family offices. Investments include Contessa Health, a provider of hospital-at-home services, Infusion Express, an operator of outpatient-infusion centers, and Spero Health, a provider of outpatient medication-assisted treatment centers for people with opiate substance abuse problems.

Gormley's Take: Are Hefty Deals for Biotech Yielding Bigger Returns?

By Brian Gormley

Biotech entrepreneurs are parlaying intense interest in their industry into giant venture funding rounds. That has prompted investors to watch for whether this leads to stronger companies and better returns.

With funds pouring into biotech, startups now routinely command high valuations. Some 24% of third-quarter life sciences venture rounds tracked by Cooley were raised at pre-money valuations of more than $100 million, up from 15% in the same period last year.

Scarcity is helping drive up prices, because the number of companies started isn't keeping pace with the jump in venture investment.

Says Andrew Schiff, managing partner of Aisling Capital: "The amount of compelling new science is on the rise it's our hope that that translates into many more clinical targets."

Women in venture capital are supporting upstarts in some of the most exciting corners of the startup ecosystem, from cryptocurrency to biotechnology.

As the 10 venture capitalists profiled in our latest edition of Women to Watch show, the ways they have entered the industry are equally varied. They come from academia, entrepreneurship or finance. Some worked their way up the ranks at established investment houses, while others forged their own paths by launching new firms.

Either way, they are united by their willingness to make risky bets on disrupters in sectors they are passionate about.

Christine Aylward

Managing Partner, Magnetic Ventures

A career in life sciences that has spanned multiple disciplines and markets has prepared Christine Aylward for her newest role: founder and sole managing partner of San Francisco firm Magnetic Ventures. Launched in May with a $100 million target for its first fund, Ms. Aylward's firm builds on her experience in investing, operations and business development across life sciences. She also is a senior adviser at TPG Growth's Rise Fund and co-founder of Making Of, a digital-media platform she formed with actress Natalie Portman. Ms. Aylward, 50, gained investment experience from her time at Foresite Capital Management, where she was a managing director for more than five years, and technology-enabled investment bank Epoch Partners. At Foresite, Ms. Aylward worked on deals for companies including 10X Genomics Inc. and Aimmune Therapeutics Inc. In that role, she brought domain expertise gleaned from years in business development and other leadership roles at pharmaceutical companies including Roche Holdings AG and Salix Pharmaceuticals.

Enke Bashllari

Managing Director, Arkitekt Ventures

Enke Bashllari never set out to be a venture investor. Trained as a neuroscientist, she was studying at Columbia University in the mid-2000s when she became aware of a disconnect between the science and business communities that was thwarting the advancement of medicine. "I realized there was significant innovation both in research labs and in hospitals, but it wasn't getting optimally translated into companies. They were more like science projects," Ms. Bashllari said. That insight prompted Ms. Bashllari to balance her scientific skills with financial education. After finishing her doctorate, advising family offices on life science deals, and working with angel investor groups, she launched Arkitekt Ventures in New York in January 2017. The early-stage fund focuses on companies advancing health and care delivery models. Portfolio companies include brain-machine interface startup Paradromics Inc. and technology-enabled primary care service Parsley Health Inc. "I look for founders with strong technical skill sets who understand science and have a long-term approach to changing the paradigm of health care," Ms. Bashllari said.

Abbie Celniker

Partner, Third Rock Ventures

Abbie Celniker started her career in biotechnology at Genentech Inc. in the mid-1980s and never looked back. Dr. Celniker, now a partner with Third Rock Ventures, joined Genentech after earning a doctorate in molecular biology from the University of Arizona College of Medicine. It was a seminal time in biotech, as advances in genetic engineering were enabling scientists to swiftly make proteins such as growth hormones that could help patients. From Genentech, Dr. Celniker, 59, went on to take executive positions at drug companies such as Wyeth, Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Novartis AG, where she was global head of biologics from 2006 to 2008. Looking to return to the entrepreneurial atmosphere she enjoyed at Genentech, she took chief executive jobs at venture-backed drugmaker Taligen Therapeutics Inc. and later at Third Rock-backed Eleven Biotherapeutics (now Sesen Bio Inc.). In 2016, she joined Third Rock as a partner, where she has been involved in launching portfolio companies Rheos Medicines and Goldfinch Biopharma Inc. As a builder of biotech companies, "There's always a problem to be solved, and that's super exciting to me," she said.

Sarah Guo

Partner, Greylock Partners

Sarah Guo became a partner at Greylock Partners earlier this year, and she hasn't even reached her 30th birthday. Ms. Guo, 29, started as an associate at Greylock more than five years ago, following a stint at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as an investment banker and investor in growth-stage companies. She worked her way up to principal and now partner, but she said that wasn't her original plan. Ms. Guo said she initially thought of venture investing as no more than a "learning experience." She thought she might work at a startup or become an entrepreneur like her parents. She wound up liking investing more than she had expected. She said she "appreciates the vote of confidence from my partnership" and has been "very lucky to get a lot of great mentorship from the senior investors." Now Ms. Guo is looking to find the next generation of enterprise companies, in categories such as machine learning and semiconductors.

Kathryn Haun

General Partner, a16z crypto

Kathryn "Katie" Haun's Twitter feed is sprinkled with plugs for cryptocurrency startups and comments about law enforcement. That's par for the course for this new general partner at a16z crypto and former federal prosecutor. Ms. Haun was an assistant U.S. attorney and the first coordinator for digital currency at the Justice Department. She investigated money laundering and other cybercrimes, especially in the cryptocurrency arena. Ms. Haun left the government last year and delved into the private sector, joining the boards of Coinbase Global Inc., one of the most highly valued venture-backed crypto companies, as well as security startup HackerOne Inc. She began advising crypto startups and investing personally. It was on the board of Coinbase that Ms. Haun met Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. In June, they teamed up to launch a16z crypto, a new $300 million fund dedicated to investing in equity and digital tokens of crypto startups. Ms. Haun said she would help "to foster responsible innovation and strike the right balance between innovation and regulation."

Annie Kadavy

Partner, Redpoint Ventures

Earlier this year, Annie Kadavy became the first female partner at Redpoint Ventures. At age 33, she also is the firm's youngest partner. Although Ms. Kadavy believes "luck is part of it," she already has had an active career. Most recently, she was head of strategic operations at Uber Freight for Uber Technologies Inc. Before that, she spent four years on the investment team at Charles River Ventures, where she invested in ClassPass Inc., DoorDash Inc. and Patreon Inc. She also has worked at SV Angel and Bain & Co. Ms. Kadavy said the biggest challenge has been venture investing's long feedback cycle. "You don't know if those were good decisions for many years," she said. To combat this, she keeps lists of every company she evaluates and her gut reactions. Then she periodically looks it over to "see where I was right or wrong, which helped inform my future decisions and gave me some of my confidence in my ability to pick winners."

Angela Tran Kingyens

General Partners, Version One Ventures

Angela Tran Kingyens took a different path to the top of seed-stage firm Version One Ventures, working her way up from analyst to principal to general partner. One of two general partners at the firm, she has sourced deals for companies such as Shippo and Blockstack PBC. Her recent focus has been on direct-to-consumer health startups like Scanwell Health Inc. and Qurasense Inc. that make accessing services easier or cheaper. "That's what gets me most excited: how to transform [health care] by changing costs and giving interesting access to consumers," said Ms. Kingyens, who holds a doctorate in operations research and engineering from the University of Toronto. Originally from Toronto, Ms. Kingyens is based in San Francisco and invests there as well as in New York and Canada. Version One is one of the few seed firms to invest across geographies, she said. She credits her rise to general partner to her mentor and partner at Version One, Boris Wertz. She believes the venture industry is becoming more inclusive. When her firm set out to hire an associate, many of the applicants were women.

Clare Ozawa

Managing Director, Versant Ventures

Clare Ozawa loves the teamwork involved in being an early-stage biotechnology venture-capital investor. As a managing director of Versant Ventures, Dr. Ozawa has worked with academic scientists and entrepreneurs to get biotech startups off the ground. Since joining Versant a decade ago, she has been involved with companies such as Flexion Therapeutics Inc., which went public in 2014, and cancer drug-discovery startup Quanticel Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Celgene Corp. in 2015. Dr. Ozawa, 44, caught the biotech bug as an undergraduate at Stanford University, where she worked in the lab of biochemist and Nobel Laureate Paul Berg. It was there that she grew inspired to see life science discoveries turned into health-care products. She joined Novartis AG in 2006. Two years later, Versant's Brad Bolzon recruited her to join the firm to focus on the opposite end of the drug industry: biotech startup investing. The experience of joining a venture firm "couldn't have been more different" from the role she had at a large pharmaceutical company, she recalled, but she said she has found the roll-up-your-sleeves process of building and funding drug startups fascinating.

Heidi Krauel Patel

Partner, Rethink Impact

Heidi Krauel Patel is a partner at Rethink Impact, a $112 million early- and growth-stage firm that approaches investments with a gender focus. Before joining Rethink in 2016, Ms. Patel worked in investment banking at Deutsche Bank AG, in corporate venture capital at AOL Time Warner Ventures and as the director of Pacific Community Ventures, which provides resources for small to midsize businesses in underserved communities. At Rethink, Ms. Patel has led deals and sits on the boards of companies including mental-health startup Spring Care Inc. and cognitive function assessment software maker Savonix Inc. While many startups are tackling health and wellness, Rethink narrows its focus through a few key aspects. "We take community building very seriously and seek out diverse founding teams," Ms. Patel said. "We fundamentally believe diversity starts at the top, and we apply an impact lens to all investments."

Linda Xie

Managing Director, Scalar Capital

Linda Xie, co-founder of crypto firm Scalar Capital, is one of a crop of former early Coinbase Global Inc. employees starting crypto companies and funds. Ms. Xie's firm focuses on token and coin investments, but she also has made personal equity angel investments in startups including dYdX Trading Inc. and Starkware. She also is an adviser to 0x, which is building tech for a decentralized exchange. Her work with crypto startups can be quite different from making traditional equity investments. In equity startups, she helps with scaling, go-to-market and recruiting, whereas with token projects it is more about how to build a community, make sure tokens are distributed to as many people as possible, and create "moats" around projects so that copycats can't "fork" and copy them. "I really love getting to learn about new tech that's being developed and getting to talk to teams building in this space," Ms. Xie said.

Women have made tremendous inroads in the private-equity industry over the past decade, although they still are dramatically underrepresented among senior leadership.

Our third edition of the Women to Watch series reflects the breadth of experience female private-equity deal makers have amassed across areas such as financial technology, health care, software and consumer brands. As in previous years, we spoke with a range of members from the private-equity community to compile an initial roster of nominees, which we then narrowed to the names here. This list emphasizes senior women in the industry but also features outstanding members of a younger generation of rising stars.

Justine Cheng

Partner, Cornell Capital

Justine Cheng joined Cornell Capital in 2016 after spending more than a decade on Fortress Investment Group's private-equity team. Ms. Cheng, a partner at the New York shop founded by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Henry Cornell, led the five-year-old firm's investment last year in Corelle Brands LLC, owner of homeware brands that include Corelle and Pyrex. Previously, at Fortress, she was chief financial officer and chief operating officer of New Senior Investment Group Inc. and Newcastle Investment Corp. "It takes creativity, dedication and determination to source successful deals, optimize operations and drive growth," Ms. Cheng said. "A diverse environment generates the best results." The executive also formerly worked at UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG. Ms. Cheng received her bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia University.

Candice Corvetti

Principal, Berkshire Partners

Although Candice Corvetti only joined Berkshire Partners about four years ago, she quickly earned a reputation at the Boston firm for her sharp analytical skills and an unusually high level of emotional intelligence that enables her to easily connect with the management teams of portfolio companies, according to Kevin Callaghan, a managing director at Berkshire. "She has a high EQ that permits her to read a room well," Mr. Callaghan said. "Even in her first year, I've seen her step in and take a conversation in a way more productive direction than where I was steering it." An alumna of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Ms. Corvetti cut her private-equity teeth at Chicago-based Madison Dearborn Partners before attending business school. At Berkshire, she has worked on investments in companies such as Advanced Drainage Systems Inc., a maker of pipes and other water-management products, and Asurion LLC, which offers mobile-device protection services. She recently has been heavily involved with Parts Town, a provider of restaurant-equipment parts that Berkshire backed in 2016. She has been deeply involved in helping the company expand through add-on acquisitions, including the purchase of PartsXpress this year. "She gets the culture of Parts Town, which is pretty distinctive, and helps represents that well to outsiders," Mr. Callaghan said. Ms. Corvetti said one of the biggest lessons she has learned throughout her career has been understanding the importance of developing strong, productive relationships. "A lot of people start as an analyst, and everything is about the importance of getting the numbers right, but it quickly transitions to engaging with people, figuring out what their strengths are and getting to know management teams," she said. "That's my favorite part of the job."

Hilary Gosher

Managing Director, Insight Venture Partners

Hilary Gosher joined Insight Venture Partners in 2000 as an associate to work with early-stage investments. At the time, the firm was buying minority stakes in software companies. Since then, Ms. Gosher's focus has been largely on venture-capital investing, but she also works with larger companies such as publicly traded Delivery Hero SE. She sits on the food-delivery company's board and that of messaging-application maker Hustle Inc. In 2002, she founded Insight Onsite, a group that works to accelerate scale at portfolio companies. Ms. Gosher also is an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs for technology entrepreneurship and is a founding member of Parity Partners, a group that aims to accelerate gender diversity at leadership levels within companies. "I see that there is a tremendous opportunity for women in venture and private equity because it's a career that combines curiosity, expertise, problem-solving and intuition," Ms. Gosher said. "Like all careers, it takes guts and staying power to reach the top, but it's a fulfilling and interesting career. I hope more women enter and stay in the industry because doing so has the potential to change business not only which businesses get funded, but the leadership composition of the businesses they fund."

Jill Granoff

Chief Executive, Eurazeo Brands

For the past 18 months, Jill Granoff has been leading Eurazeo Brands, an $800 million division that private investor Eurazeo launched last year to focus on U.S. and European consumer and retail brands. Under Ms. Granoff, Eurazeo Brands already has backed two businesses and is looking at a pipeline of other investment opportunities. The firm last November took a majority stake in Nest Fragrances, a brand known for its scented candles, and in July sealed a minority investment in makeup company Pat McGrath Labs. "I love that we are students of retail and consumer change," Ms. Granoff said. She added that Eurazeo Brands' deal flow has been most active in the beauty, fashion and food categories. "In the sector which I lead, women are the purchasers and consumers of beauty, fashion and wellness products. We have the firsthand knowledge and experience in terms of what customers are looking for." Ms. Granoff previously was chief executive of retailers Vince Holding Corp., Kellwood Co. and Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. She received her bachelor's degree from Duke University and her master of business administration from Columbia University.

Laura Grattan

Managing Director, Thomas H. Lee Partners

Laura Grattan started her career at Boston-based Thomas H. Lee Partners in 2005, just as the buyout industry was entering one of the biggest boom eras in its history. During the two years that followed, she worked as a junior professional across a range of deals and industries. "It was a soup-to-nuts overview of what one could participate in with private equity," Ms. Grattan said. When she returned to Thomas H. Lee in 2009 after two years at Harvard Business School, she encountered a much different investment environment. The experience she gained working with portfolio companies during one of the biggest financial downturns in history gave her the ability to "see the real nitty-gritty of the operating side of the firm's business," said Scott Sperling, co-president of Thomas H. Lee. When Ms. Grattan rejoined the firm in 2009, she began to specialize in media, information services and technology. Since then, she has honed her focus more specifically on software. Although she has been involved with a range of technology companies in the past nine years, one that she is particularly proud of is Alfresco Software Inc., a provider of open-source enterprise software designed to help companies with content management and information governance that Thomas H. Lee backed this year. Ms. Grattan said that having a healthy curiosity and valuing integrity have been particularly crucial to her throughout her private-equity career. She also stressed the importance of building personal resilience. "In this industry, you spend a lot of time on opportunities that don't come to fruition, and not every portfolio company is going to be a smooth ride," she said.

Karen Kenworthy

Partner, Stripes Group

As a partner of Stripes Group, Karen Kenworthy focuses on the firm's investments in branded consumer companies and has been instrumental in building its specialization in consumer products and e-commerce. Since raising its first fund in 2009, Stripes Group believed that branded businesses need a "direct touchpoint with the consumer" such as social media, e-commerce and digital marketing, Ms. Kenworthy said of the growth-equity firm's approach. Although investors were skeptical of Stripes Group's vision in its early days, the firm has successfully raised four funds and manages more than $2 billion today. "It's about being a good partner. Things aren't always looking as pretty as they should be," Ms. Kenworthy said. "One thing in growth-stage businesses is that it's not always a clean path." Ms. Kenworthy has led Stripes Group's deals with plant-based beverage company Califia Farms LP; breakfast and lunch restaurant chain Snooze and pet food business Stella & Chewy's LLC, among others. She worked at consulting firm Bain & Co. before joining Stripes Group. Ms. Kenworthy received her bachelor's degree from Yale University and her master of business administration from Stanford University.

Natalie Kolbe

Partner and Head of Private Equity, Actis

Based in her native country of South Africa, Natalie Kolbe oversees private-equity investments for emerging-markets firm Actis in all corners of the developing world from South Asia to Africa to Latin America in sectors as diverse as education and renewable energy. These regions' "thriving environment" and "constant change" were what attracted Ms. Kolbe to Actis 15 years ago, she said. She relishes the opportunities she has at Actis to apply lessons learned in one market to another. She compared, for example, Actis's investments in South African financial-services company Alexander Forbes Group Holdings Ltd. which an Actis-led consortium took private in 2007 and public again in 2014 to an investment in Nigerian pension-fund manager Sigma Pensions Ltd., which Actis backed in 2015. "[Sigma] was in the same industry but in a much earlier stage," she said. "Being able to bring that experience from South Africa &and have an impact at the board level and with the management, that's really fulfilling." Ms. Kolbe joined Actis's team in 2003 as an analyst and made her way up the ranks of the firm, becoming a partner in 2011 and head of private equity in 2016. As advice to women considering a career in the industry, she said, "We'll have to make sacrifices" and "there's no substitute for hard work," but "don't beat yourself up." Above all, she said, it is crucial to be in a supportive environment and have a supportive boss. "If you no longer feel that's the case," she said, "find another place."

Jennifer Lee

Vice President, Edison Partners

Jennifer Lee is a vice president at Edison Partners, where she focuses on making financial-technology investments for the growth-equity firm. Ms. Lee started her career as the first sales executive at cybersecurity company ForgeRock. She stayed with the company for nearly five years before completing her master of business administration at Columbia University. The Edison vice president began her education at Johns Hopkins University, where she was on the pre-med track, following in the footsteps of her parents, who both are in the medical field. However, her curiosity about "how businesses work and organizations succeed" eventually led her to pursue a bachelor's degree in economics from the school. While completing her M.B.A., she worked in the hedge-fund group at Commerzbank AG. Since joining Edison in 2016, Ms. Lee has co-led investments in businesses such as personal-finance company MoneyLion Inc., data-analytics software provider Giant Oak and Bento for Business, which offers employee expense cards. She recently helped bring on Vista Equity Partners as a fellow investor in regulatory-technology provider ComplySci. She said she enjoys working as a financial-technology investor, because regulators are "more open to collaboration with fintech folks." Ms. Lee in March attended meetings with members of the Treasury Department to discuss current financial regulations and educate Capitol Hill staffers about the online-lending and financial-technology industries.

Sheila Schweitzer

Managing Partner, Blue Ox Healthcare Partners

Sheila Schweitzer is a co-founder and managing partner of health care-focused Blue Ox Healthcare Partners, where she also is part of the firm's investment committee. Ms. Schweitzer is the founder, and a board member, of Blue Ox-backed PatientMatters, which provides financial-services technology to hospitals. Before launching Blue Ox, Ms. Schweitzer held a number of executive-level positions across the health-care sector. She has worked at health-care companies such as claims-processing company Envoy Corp., online-services company MedUnite Inc. and financial-software provider CareMedic Systems Inc., all of which since have been sold to other companies. Ms. Schweitzer started her career at Citizens State Bank in Owensboro, Ky., helping roll out ATMs when they were first introduced. It was this work that led her to fall in love with technology, she said. Ms. Schweitzer later worked at Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's, where she helped to roll out a point-of-service system for food, liquor and inventories. "I remember when I was in my 20s at my first CEO job sitting in a chair thinking  I have no idea what to do, and who do I go to?'" she said. "I think I bring a level of  been there, done that', a lot of scars, a lot of mistakes and I really enjoy working with management teams that have this huge opportunity ahead of them."

Alisa Williams

Senior Associate, VMG Partners

Alisa Williams supports portfolio companies of VMG Partners, working closely with management teams on expansion strategies. She joined the San Francisco firm in 2015 after spending two years at the midmarket group of Wells Fargo & Co.'s investment banking division as an analyst. In particular, Ms. Williams fell in love with the consumer sector and helping entrepreneurs navigate through the rapidly changing category. The Yale University alumna currently works with food-delivery company Daily Harvest Inc., snack makers Health Warrior and Nature's Bakery, chocolate brand Lily's Sweets LLC and skin-care brand Drunk Elephant LLC. "It's a daily relationship," said Ms. Williams. "Constantly being a student is the most important for success."

Lauren Young

Principal, Advent International Corp.

When Lauren Young joined Advent International Corp. in 2011, after graduating from Harvard Business School, the Boston-based firm was just building a dedicated technology team in its recently opened New York office. Back then, Ms. Young was one of only a small handful of people who focused exclusively on tech deals, and often found herself competing with firms that had vastly larger teams. Although she found the task of helping to build Advent's tech portfolio exciting, it was also challenging. "It was a slow process, but I look back from then to where we are today, and it's night and day," she said. David Mussafer, a managing partner at Advent, said Ms. Young has been involved in almost all of the software and tech deals the firm has done in the U.S. in recent years. She was heavily involved in one of Advent's largest tech deals, the 2017 purchase of CCC Information Services Inc., a software provider for auto businesses and insurers. Mr. Mussafer said Ms. Young not only brings intelligence and great ideas to the team, but also an ability to easily connect with everyone she works with. "She's one of our secret weapons when we unleash the Advent team on a deal," Mr. Mussafer said. "We know that the management team will come back and say  I love your team, particularly Lauren.'" Although Ms. Young says she strives to be personable and connect with people, she also admits she can be very structured in what she wants to accomplish. "One of the most important things in our world is being able to be personable, but at the end of the day, we still want to be sure we get our math right," she said.

Banking & Finance: Wall Street Analysts Are Selling More Data

Wall Street analysts are doing data differently.

Banks for years have crunched data on company earnings, price targets and other mundane metrics for clients who might use the information to make investing and trading decisions. Now they are pulling data from social-media sentiment, geospatial mapping and other unorthodox sources. They are also increasingly making their data feeds available directly to clients, without the surrounding research notes that often go unread.

The changes are the banks' latest strategy to try to juice up interest in -- and revenue from -- their giant research arms that are struggling to stay relevant.

Banks have long provided research as part of a bundle of services to trading clients, but now many clients are either pushing to lower their trading bills or are more likely to base their decisions on quantitative algorithms than qualitative research. Only about 21% of research emails tracked by Street Contxt, a startup that distributes and tracks Wall Street content, were even opened during the second quarter.

UBS Group AG recently spun out the data team it built for its research business into a separate unit inside the bank. Research analysts will continue to use the service, but now clients can also tap into it directly.

"People say data is the new oil, but there is a refiner needed," said Barry Hurewitz, UBS's global head of the group, called Evidence Lab. "And we're an integrated refiner of that data."

The unit houses hundreds of data experts and specialists that consume thousands of raw data sources and shape them into usable information for investors. For example, the group analyzed job reviews on the website Glassdoor for several insurers, to judge which might lose underwriters. It also tracked Google searches for Netflix Inc. show "Marvel's Luke Cage," and found less interest in the show when it made its second season debut.

Before UBS, Mr. Hurewitz worked at Morgan Stanley, where just over a decade ago he helped start a data unit now called AlphaWise.

AlphaWise, which today employs more than 100 data scientists and other engineers, is part of Morgan Stanley's research unit. Research analysts tap it for its analytics services and nontraditional data to formulate views on the industries they cover.

In a recent note, Morgan Stanley's real-estate investment analysts cited road-network maps to determine which malls had more or less spending power from nearby potential customers, based on how long it takes to drive to the mall rather than just a simple radius. The analysts hypothesized that people would drive to a better mall, but only if it was less than five minutes further away.

The group's data resources are now increasingly shared across the firm, including with Morgan Stanley's trading desk, which employs its own data experts that work with clients.

At HSBC Holdings PLC, research analysts recently used software to read the transcripts of 20,000 corporate earnings calls to spot trends.

For example, the software could pinpoint when executives talked about business difficulties, and distinguish that from talk of "technical difficulties" with the conference call dial-in. The bank is exploring how to keep running the software to generate alerts for clients.

But some trading desks don't want to handle new kinds of data directly. One concern is verifying that the data don't contain personal information. Banks don't want to get pulled into the privacy controversies engulfing social media firms.

Jefferies Financial Group Inc. has made itself more of a conduit between clients and data. A team on its stock-trading desk advises clients on finding, evaluating and using new data sources, and the bank sponsors conferences connecting investors and data vendors.

Other banks say their edge is offering up their own data. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has long collected data that informs its own business decisions -- such as specialized measures of volatility -- into a centralized repository.

Now Goldman is providing more of that data to clients in a formal way, via real-time direct links through its Marquee web software.

---

New Approaches

To Client Analysis

Research arms gained notoriety after some analysts leaked private information to clients in the 1990s, spurring a regulatory crackdown. Since then, the units have pulled other levers to try to gin up business.

Analysts now often arrange meetings for clients with top executives at companies they cover. Some banks recently began collecting data on their own clients, like what research they click on and when.

Banks say the information lets them better price their research products, but the tracking has rankled some clients who don't want to be watched.

Wall Street is also recruiting new kinds of people for these efforts.

Barclays PLC over the summer hired digital media startup Buzzfeed's principal data scientist, Adam Kelleher, to lead a new data group within the bank's research unit.

It is a new step for both Barclays and Mr. Kelleher, who has a Ph.D. in physics.

To become a research analyst, he had to take two exams with more than 300 questions.

Hack Dissection: HSBC Hit in Suspected Credential-Stuffing Attack

By Catherine Stupp

Data from around 1% of HSBC Bank PLC's 1.4 million U.S.-based customers was breached last month, the bank disclosed. Hackers likely carried out the attack using credentials stolen from a different source, according to the company.

What HSBC says:

What was breached: Personal data including names; mailing addresses; phone numbers; email addresses; dates of birth; account numbers, types and balances; transaction history; payee account information and statement history.

When it discovered the incident: The bank noticed unauthorized activity on Oct. 4 and restricted hackers' access to the accounts on Oct. 14. It began notifying customers on Nov. 2 and has now informed all affected account holders.

What is happening now: HSBC has introduced multi-factor authentication for online banking accounts and implemented the CAPTCHA security service at log-in to test whether users are machines or humans.

HSBC suspects hackers used a method known as credential stuffing by purchasing stolen account log-in information to access the data. In an email, a spokesman said HSBC advises customers use unique passwords and change them regularly. "HSBC regrets this incident," he said.

WSJ Pro Cybersecurity spoke to two analysts about the breach and the growth of credential stuffing. They are Jarrod Overson, director of engineering at Shape Security Inc.; and Angel Grant, director of identity, fraud and risk intelligence at RSA Security LLC.

Here are edited excerpts from the separate conversations:

Q: Does the limited number of affected accounts tell us anything about how hackers might have gained access to this data?

Ms. Grant: That's a good indicator that this is more of an account takeover type of attack where a cybercriminal purchased credentials in the underground & What we're seeing is this emergent gray web, which is basically credentials and credit cards that were stolen [and] sold on social media sites. So for example, if you go to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, the social media of your choice and type in "CVV2,"... you'll actually see stolen cards right there.

Mr. Overson: This is more of a traditional credential stuffing attack. The fact that it was primarily U.S.-based visitors that were victims strengthens that [theory] because a lot of territories in the EU have additional requirements for financial services to protect web log-ins, while those are optional in the U.S. Credential stuffing attacks are wide-net attacks where attackers will take breached credentials from other breaches & The subset of users who were affected at HSBC are likely people who re-used their email and password across multiple sites.

Q: Do you see any indication of how the attackers found these HSBC credentials?

Mr. Overson: Given that there are tiers of attackers and criminals are generally good at one or two things, they probably acquired these credentials from another group that made these publicly available online and engaged in these attacks using automated tools... You can assume that these credentials were used probably across many other sites as well in this attack campaign. HSBC was probably just one of the services caught up in it. And these automated tools go and test these accounts across dozens or hundreds of sites at the same time and whatever is hit is subject to targeted fraud.

Q: Are you seeing an increase in the amount of stolen credentials for sale online?

Ms. Grant: We were investigating a cyber criminal for one of our customers. We usually do a social profile of that person to try to understand their persona, and we always go to their social presence. When we came across that, we ended up finding over 500 criminal organizations selling things on social media sites. It's credit cards, it's credentials like account username [and] password combinations. We're seeing them sell botnets, techniques on how to run a DDoS attack, tutorials.

Mr. Overson: What we're seeing right now is an explosion of this as a viable attack vector for criminals because of how cheap it has become to rapidly scale out globally distributed attacks on cloud services.

Q: Does the 10-day time frame between how long attackers had access and when HSBC responded suggest how the bank may have discovered this breach?

Mr. Overson: Because credential stuffing attacks and account takeovers in general easily fly under the radar unless a company is trained to look for this sort of attack, it's likely that they noticed a pattern of fraud somewhat recently, then tracked that fraud back to a number of attacks taken over with similar properties, then tracked that back and noticed a trend of traffic active over a period of time in early October.

Q: What safeguards do you recommend?

Ms. Grant: We're seeing a lot of tactics where cyber criminals are gaming the different channels. For example, they'll actually call into the call center to have their passwords changed or add a new payee and then log into the online banking session so they can try to bypass some of those anomaly detections that are in place. If an organization doesn't have the cross-channel or omni-channel fraud strategy that correlates all the channels that that user's engaging, whether it be mobile, branch, online, etc., then they're not going to have a full picture of that user & I'd recommend behavioral analytics.

Companies urged to update Apache Struts. The Apache Foundation, a nonprofit software organization, is encouraging users to install a security patch to fix a critical vulnerability that could allow hackers to take over unprotected servers and install malicious software, according to CyberScoop. The Apache Foundation said its Struts 2 web application framework is affected by the flaw, CyberScoop reports. The data breach at Equifax Inc. last year that affected about 148 million consumers was possible in part because the credit-reporting firm didn't patch a known vulnerability in the Struts framework, according to Ars Technica.

Canadian university went offline to stop attack. Nova Scotia's St. Francis Xavier University this week is bringing servers, Wi-Fi systems and educational materials back online following a cyberattack, according to CBC.

Bank of Canada's Poloz Defends Central-Bank Independence | Australia Keeps Rates on Hold | The Market Warning Signs Investors Are Watching; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Tuesday, November 6, 2018

Good day. Bank of Canada chief Stephen Poloz has weighed in on the hot topic of central-bank autonomy. Independent monetary policy isn't just an abstraction, he said it brings practical benefits in the form of lower borrowing costs. Mr. Poloz also sees stock-market volatility as a welcome sign that the global economy is normalizing. Australia's central bank raised its growth forecasts as it kept rates on hold. And it's Election Day in the U.S., concluding a campaign that has played out against the backdrop of a bull market nearly a decade old. The Wall Street Journal has a round-up of the indicators that investors are monitoring for signs of a bear market.

Now on to today's news and analysis &

Bank of Canada Chief Says Market Volatility a Sign of Normalization

Higher bond yields and the return of stock-market volatility are signs the global economy "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-canada-chief-says-market-volatility-a-sign-of-normalization-1541426095" after a decade of ultralow interest rates, Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz said. Speaking before the Canada-U.K. Chamber of Commerce in London, Mr. Poloz said the longstanding trend toward lower bond yields appears to be over as interest rates rise and risks are shifted back to markets. The change is producing a recalibration in equity markets and leading to a more normal level of volatility, he said.

Poloz Warns on Undermining Central-Bank Independence

After his speech in London, the Bank of Canada governor warned that attempts by governments to undermine central-bank independence eventually "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-canada-chief-warns-on-undermining-central-bank-independence-1541444327" for households and businesses. "Central-bank independence is not some theoretical concept. It is a bastion of the stability we live in," he said at a press conference.

RBA Holds Rates Steady, Revises Some Forecasts

The Reserve Bank of Australia"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rba-holds-rates-steady-revises-some-forecasts-1541482483?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3" Tuesday, while offering a more bullish view of the economic outlook. The central bank's policy-setting board left the cash rate target at 1.5% where it has been for more than two years as the RBA waits for signs of gains in wages and the inflation rate. Still, the central bank has become more optimistic about Australia's economy. It raised its growth forecasts for gross domestic product and cut its projected unemployment rate.

Where to Find Treasury Buyers? Not Asia

Asian investors are proving "https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-to-find-treasury-buyers-not-asia-1541422801?tesla=y" to buy U.S. government bonds, even as the Treasury Department prepares to sell $1.3 trillion of new debt in the new fiscal year. Foreigners increased their holdings of Treasurys by $78 billion in the first eight months of this calendar year, according to the Treasury. That is just over half of what they bought in the same period last year. Declines in Asian emerging markets' currencies have helped their exports remain competitive versus China, but they also have reduced the need for them to buy Treasurys a popular way for central banks to weaken their currencies against the dollar, said Torsten Slk, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.

Brazil Central Bank Likely to Keep Rates at Historic Lows

The Central Bank of Brazil said it's likely to keep rates at historic lows for the time being amid sluggish economic growth. In the minutes to last week's monetary decision, the central bank repeated its argument that economic reforms are needed to keep interest rates from rising too high, and that Brazil's economy stands to suffer if developed nations raise their own rates rapidly.

Predicting the Next Bear Market in Six Charts

Nine years, seven months, four weeks and one day into the current bull market, "https://centralbanking.cmail20.com/t/d-l-njldujk-jlohthuq-k/" whether a bear is on the horizon. While there is no single indicator that can predict market turns on its own, here are six things analysts are watching from deal activity to jobless claims to see if the next bear market, typically defined as a 20% decline from a recent peak, is around the corner.

Rollback Begins on Postcrisis Swaps-Trading Rules

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTON Regulators started rewriting postcrisis swaps-trading rules on Monday, approving a proposal that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rollback-begins-on-postcrisis-swaps-trading-rules-1541443308?tesla=y" for how trades can be executed.

By a 4-1 vote, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed changes that would allow more ways to trade swaps on electronic platforms known as swap-execution facilities. The proposal would affect the biggest categories of products interest-rate and credit-default swaps that are routed through central clearinghouses. Currently, around 85% of those contracts are centrally cleared.

The changes have been championed by CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, a Republican, who has long complained Obama-era rules were harming liquidity in swaps markets. On Monday, he said the proposal would bring "daylight to the marketplace" as Congress intended in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law.

The proposal would require more types of trades including a host of foreign-currency interest-rate swaps to occur on the platforms, a change that could lead to as much as a 50% increase in daily trade volumes, according to estimates.

Currently, many types of cleared swaps must be traded using one of two execution methods: either by using of a centralized database of contract prices or through a "request for quotation" system that requires buyers to seek price quotes from a minimum of three swap dealers. Under the proposal, traders wouldn't be restricted to those methods of execution, a change that Mr. Giancarlo has long advocated because he believes it will make trading on transparent platforms more attractive.

Investment firms and hedge funds have generally benefited from the increased transparency and efficiency that platform trading has brought to the marketplace since the current rule set went into effect in 2013. Firms worry those benefits might disappear if the loosened rules dilute transparency.

"Revisions to the framework should not lead us back to an era where pricing was opaque and liquidity could only be sourced bilaterally," said Stephen Berger, managing director at Citadel LLC. "That would be a major setback."

Firms that currently trade on platforms wouldn't have to change their business models if they prefer not to. Additionally, firms that currently trade privately may be enticed by the efficiency provided by platforms if the rules are more flexible, according to Kevin McPartland, managing director at Greenwich Associates. It is an open question how platform trading would work for swaps that are traditionally traded over the phone with direct contact between buyer and seller.

The CFTC also voted 5-0 to keep the swap dealer registration threshold at $8 billion, a level that was set to drop to $3 billion starting next year under a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. The higher threshold allows many financial, energy and agricultural companies to avoid registering as swap dealers, providing a reprieve to some firms that use swaps to hedge risks.

Citigroup to Keep Chairman, CEO Roles Separate

By Telis Demos

Citigroup Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/citigroup-to-keep-chairman-ceo-roles-separate-1541426400?tesla=y" chairman and chief executive roles separate.

The bank's board Monday said it has selected director John Dugan, a former top banking regulator, as chairman. Mr. Dugan will move into the role in January, following Michael O'Neill's retirement, setting him up to preside over the bank's annual meeting next year.

Mr. O'Neill's move was expected, but the board hadn't before indicated how it would replace him. While some other banks that split the chief executive and chairman roles after the financial crisis have recombined them, Citigroup has kept them apart.

Chief Executive Michael Corbat and O'Neill discussed the possibility of Mr. Corbat adding chairman to his title, and Mr. O'Neill expressed support, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Corbat ultimately opted not to seek the additional role, in part to avoid the distraction of a potential fight over his elevation, the person said.

Mr. Dugan's career has taken him in and out of government. He was a senior U.S. Treasury official in the late 1980s and early 1990s and later advocated on behalf of banks as a partner at law firm Covington & Burling LLP.

He was head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency from 2005 to 2010, a span that included the financial crisis and Citigroup's bailout. He left the OCC"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703886904576031680217022252"before joining Citigroup's board last year.

Investors "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324503204578315974068117186"to support combining the chief executive and chairman posts. In recent years, two of Mr. Corbat's peers JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO James Dimon and Bank of America Corp. chief Brian Moynihan faced down tough campaigns by some shareholders to strip them of their chairman titles.

Mr. Corbat has overseen a comprehensive restructuring of Citigroup since "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444354004578060481361878480", moving the bank past the days of failing Federal Reserve stress tests.

The bank's stock jumped in 2017 as it embarked on an ambitious capital return plan, with Mr. Corbat declaring the restructuring over and setting his sights on growth. But the stock has lagged behind peers over the past year, in part due to continuing struggles in the global lender's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/citigroups-credit-card-growth-plans-hit-a-snag-1510569001".

In May, activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners LP said it had amassed "https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-investor-valueact-has-a-roughly-1-2-billion-stake-in-citigroup-1525724983"in the bank. In a letter to its investors, ValueAct said Citigroup's core global banking franchise was strong but said Wall Street was distracted by the bank's halting progress in U.S. cards, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

Mr. O'Neill became "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204571404577257560677102958", when Vikram Pandit was CEO. Mr. Pandit, who had overseen the bank"https://www.wsj.com/articles/citigroups-crisis-chief-finds-home-in-finances-new-frontier-1532178001"and its massive government bailout, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443854204578060280201488530"when it became clear Mr. O'Neill and the board was about to replace him with Mr. Corbat.

Goldman Disclosure in 1MDB Probe Points to Potential Control, Culture Concerns

By Samuel Rubenfeld

The alleged involvement of former employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in one of the biggest financial frauds in recent history has forced the firm to shine a spotlight on its business culture and internal controls.

In its third-quarter earnings report, filed to regulators on Friday, Goldman cited language from a recent indictment against a former partner for bribery and money laundering involving Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB. Goldman acknowledged for the first time the firm could face significant penalties resulting from the allegations but added that it is cooperating with investigators.

The 400-word disclosure is the most extensive yet from the firm regarding investigations into 1MDB. In addition to summarizing the U.S. allegations against its employees, the filing highlights potential weaknesses in Goldman's compliance program.

The charges were the first criminal allegations in the U.S. probe of the alleged multibillion-dollar fraud related to 1MDB. Investigators in multiple countries are probing corruption linked to the fund, with U.S. prosecutors saying at least $2.7 billion was misappropriated.

The indictment alleges the firm's "system of internal accounting controls could be easily circumvented and that the firm's business culture, particularly in Southeast Asia, at times prioritized consummation of deals ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions," Goldman wrote in the filing.

The disclosure follows allegations, unsealed last week by U.S. prosecutors, that Roger Ng, a former participating managing director, and Timothy Leissner, a former participating managing director who had led Goldman's Southeast Asia unit, paid bribes, and stole and laundered money from 1MDB.

The plea and charging documents cited by Goldman indicate that Messrs. Leissner and Ng circumvented the firm's internal accounting controls in part by intentionally deceiving control personnel and internal committees.

Goldman's disclosure signals the firm might be talking with prosecutors about a settlement, said William Garrett, content and data analytics manager for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Clearinghouse, a research center and part of the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford Law School. Regulators are expected to examine the bank's language about its controls when considering a penalty.

"There's an expectation among regulators that business culture alone may not be [reason] enough [for culpable individuals] to get past the internal controls," he said.

Rarely does a company avoid charges if a company's compliance program fails in an entire division or region, said Kathleen M. Hamann, a partner at law firm Pierce Atwood LLP who prosecuted foreign-bribery cases when serving at the Justice Department.

A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.

Goldman underwrote $6.5 billion in bonds for 1MDB, and it earned $600 million in fees for the deals. The bankers allegedly secured the deals through the bribery of government officials, controlled offshore accounts through which stolen money was funneled, and helped launder the proceeds. U.S. prosecutors are negotiating with Goldman over the firm's own culpability, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal last week.

Mr. Leissner pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He also agreed to forfeit $43.7 million. Mr. Ng was charged alongside Malaysian financier Jho Low, the suspected mastermind of the fraud, with three counts of conspiring to violate the FCPA and launder money.

A Goldman partner is cited in court documents as an unnamed co-conspirator who allegedly knew bribes were being paid, and had helped Mr. Leissner get around the compliance officials. That partner, Goldman said, was put on leave.

Mr. Ng was arrested and will be extradited to the U.S. to face the charges, Malaysian police told local media. A spokesman for Mr. Low, a fugitive last seen in China, told the Journal last week that he maintains his innocence.

Why Does Credit Growth Crowd Out Real Economic Growth?

"The growth of a country's financial system "https://www.nber.org/papers/w25079.pdf?sy=079" on productivity growth," according to a National Bureau of Economic Research paper. "That is, higher growth in the financial sector reduces real growth. Financial booms are not, in general, growth-enhancing," authors Stephen G. Cecchetti and Enisse Kharroubi find. They add that "credit booms harm what we normally think of as the engines for growth those industries that have either lower asset tangibility or high R&D-intensity. This evidence, together with recent experience during the financial crisis, leads us to conclude that there is a pressing need to reassess the relationship of finance and real growth in modern economic systems."

AI Funds Draw Cash but Struggle; Investors like the idea of artificial intelligence  and robotics. They may not like the returns.

Artificial intelligence and robotics are two of the hottest sectors in tech and ETF providers are starting to take notice.

Several firms have introduced AI-focused funds in recent months, including fund giant BlackRock. In June, the company announced the launch of iShares Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (IRBO), an exchange-traded fund offering exposure to global companies involved in different aspects of the technology, featuring names like iRobot Corp., Advanced Micro Devices and 3D Systems Corp.

"We identified robotics and artificial intelligence as an exciting global investment theme," says Daniel Prince, head of iShares product consulting at BlackRock. "There have been many milestones and breakthroughs in robotics, AI and the intersection of the two."

The entry of firms like BlackRock is to be expected in a surging "thematic" area like AI and robotics, says Dave Nadig, managing director of news and analysis site ETF.com. New entrants, he says, are also being attracted by the success of established funds like Robo Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (ROBO), which has assets of $1.57 billion, and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which stands at $1.72 billion.

"That's a big enough pool that the bigger players are inevitably going to want to jump in," he says.

Robo Global CEO Travis Briggs says specialized ETFs like ROBO offer direct exposure to the surging field that is hard to find in broader, tech-focused ETFs, despite the growth of AI and robotics across the tech sector as a whole. For example, ROBO includes access to small and medium-size companies that produce not just robotic arms used for surgery but the companies that make the components that go into those arms.

Recent decline

But recent times have been tough for the funds. BOTZ has seen returns of minus 16.8% year to date, and ROBO is down by 12.1%. BlackRock's $8.7 million IRBO is down 9.5% since its inception in June.

Mr. Briggs acknowledges that it "seems contradictory that such evolving technologies could be lagging." He attributes it partly to a hangover effect following a particularly buoyant 2017, when ROBO returned about 44%. Additionally, he points to declining demand in China, thanks to a tightening monetary policy and trade tensions with the U.S.

Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X, says investor expectations for the area became extremely high in 2017, but earnings of a number of companies missed those expectations earlier this year. However, he is bullish, arguing that "long-term growth expectations are completely unchanged."

BlackRock's Mr. Prince notes that in the short term, growth stocks "may be susceptible to volatility, but we launched IRBO to capture the long-term theme of a structural shift in the economy leveraging robotics and AI innovation."

A narrow theme

The recent poor performance is partly due to choppy markets more broadly in October, says Mr. Nadig. Many of the companies in the funds, he says, are small or midsize high-growth or momentum names, which "tend to be the first ones on the sell sheet when we get a roll-off in the market." Mr. Nadig says investors need to be cautious when investing in a niche area.

"Anytime you invest in a narrow theme like this, you are in fact a speculator, whether you think of yourself as one or not."

Questions arise of what happens in event of market slide

Defensive factors Rising interest rates threaten to shrink smart beta's appeal, says Chris Flood

Smart beta strategies have grown hugely in popularity since the 2008 financial crisis, a period marked by a strong bounceback in stock markets worldwide.

Investors now face the question of how well current smart beta strategies would perform if there were any future sharp downturn in equity markets.

"Some factors, such as low volatility, are intrinsically more defensive than the equity market as a whole and can provide some protection in a downturn versus a conventional market capitalisation weighted index," says Vincent Denoiseux, head of portfolio solutions at DWS.

Ana Harris, global head of equity portfolio strategists at State Street Global Advisors, says the performance of its smart beta products over the financial crash backed this point.

"We did see that some of the more defensive factors, such as low volatility, were able to provide some protection in relative terms when equity markets fell sharply in late 2008."

Smart beta factors can lead, however, to large losses and multiyear periods of underperformance. Research Affiliates, the indices and data analytics provider, recently published a study that illustrated the weaknesses in smart beta strategies that occurred widely across leading stock markets between 1990 and 2017.

"The risks of factor-based investing are usually understated and the diversification benefits tend to be overstated," says Vitali Kalesnik, an analyst at Research Affiliates. "Investors with exposure to multiple factors may still experience severe drawdowns [losses] and decade long periods of underperformance," he adds.

Nicolas Rabener, managing director at FactorResearch, has examined the performance of long-short smart beta portfolios based on the S&P 500 over a number of crisis periods.

These include the implosion of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the Greek debt crisis in 2010 and US sell-offs in August 2011, August 2015 and January 2016.

His study shows that while most factors did provide some capital protection, none did consistently well in all of the crisis periods.

Low volatility factor exposures intuitively should provide protection during a period of market turmoil. But low volatility strategies also tend to be based on sectors such as telecoms and utilities that deliver steady dividends and which are viewed as substitutes for bonds. "If interest rates rise, then low volatility ETFs could become toxic," says Mr Rabener.

Discrepancies also emerge when comparing the performance of smart beta across stock markets globally. Smart beta factors appear to have performed more strongly in Europe over the past 20 years than in the US, where there are more investors following these strategies. "Japan is also more challenging   some of the classic smart beta factors appear to have worked less effectively because of the structure of the market and the behaviour of local investors," Mr Rabener adds.

Corey Hoffstein, co-founder of Newfound Research, says there has been increased interest in defensive smart beta strategies, because of the extended nature of the current US bull market.

Diversification is prudent, he says. "The devil is in the implementation details."

Goldman Disclosure in 1MDB Probe Points to Potential Control, Culture Concerns; Firm is cooperating with investigators and warned it could face significant penalties

The alleged involvement of former employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in one of the biggest financial frauds in recent history has forced the firm to shine a spotlight on its business culture and internal controls.

In its third-quarter earnings report, filed to regulators on Friday, Goldman cited language from a recent indictment against a former partner for bribery and money laundering involving Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB. Goldman acknowledged for the first time the firm could face significant penalties resulting from the allegations but added that it is cooperating with investigators.

The 400-word disclosure is the most extensive yet from the firm regarding investigations into 1MDB. In addition to summarizing the U.S. allegations against its employees, the filing highlights potential weaknesses in Goldman's compliance program.

The charges were the first criminal allegations in the U.S. probe of the alleged multibillion-dollar fraud related to 1MDB. Investigators in multiple countries are probing corruption linked to the fund, with U.S. prosecutors saying at least $2.7 billion was misappropriated.

The indictment alleges the firm's "system of internal accounting controls could be easily circumvented and that the firm's business culture, particularly in Southeast Asia, at times prioritized consummation of deals ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions," Goldman wrote in the filing.

The disclosure follows allegations, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-charge-former-goldman-bankers-in-malaysia-1mdb-scandal-1541077318?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4", that Roger Ng, a former participating managing director, and Timothy Leissner, a former participating managing director who had led Goldman's Southeast Asia unit, paid bribes, and stole and laundered money from 1MDB.

The plea and charging documents cited by Goldman indicate that Messrs. Leissner and Ng circumvented the firm's internal accounting controls in part by intentionally deceiving control personnel and internal committees.

Goldman's disclosure signals the firm might be talking with prosecutors about a settlement, said William Garrett, content and data analytics manager for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Clearinghouse, a research center and part of the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford Law School. Regulators are expected to examine the bank's language about its controls when considering a penalty.

"There's an expectation among regulators that business culture alone may not be [reason] enough [for culpable individuals] to get past the internal controls," he said.

Rarely does a company avoid charges if a company's compliance program fails in an entire division or region, said Kathleen M. Hamann, a partner at law firm Pierce Atwood LLP who prosecuted foreign-bribery cases when serving at the Justice Department.

A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.

Goldman underwrote $6.5 billion in bonds for 1MDB, and it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-ties-to-scandal-plagued-1mdb-run-deep-1482362362". The bankers allegedly secured the deals through the bribery of government officials, controlled offshore accounts through which stolen money was funneled, and helped launder the proceeds. U.S. prosecutors are negotiating with Goldman over the firm's own culpability, people familiar with the matter "https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-charge-former-goldman-bankers-in-malaysia-1mdb-scandal-1541077318?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4".

Mr. Leissner pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He also agreed to forfeit $43.7 million. Mr. Ng was charged alongside Malaysian financier Jho Low, the suspected mastermind of the fraud, with three counts of conspiring to violate the FCPA and launder money.

A Goldman partner is cited in court documents as an unnamed co-conspirator who allegedly knew bribes were being paid, and had helped Mr. Leissner get around the compliance officials. That partner, Goldman said, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-changes-asia-banking-leadership-as-new-ceo-digs-in-1540051038?mod=article_inline".

Mr. Ng was arrested and will be extradited to the U.S. to face the charges, Malaysian police told local media. A spokesman for Mr. Low, a fugitive last seen in China, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-charge-former-goldman-bankers-in-malaysia-1mdb-scandal-1541077318?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2"that he maintains his innocence.

Markets
It's Now or Never for 'Hedged' Bond ETFs; These fixed-income funds were designed for just this type of market environment

When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The same is true for most bond ETFs, unless they have a hedge.

A number of fixed-income exchange-traded funds include hedges designed to mitigate the effects of rising rates. Many of these products, launched a few years ago for just this type of environment, have been performing as their builders intended.

Here's a starter guide to a barely scratched corner of the fixed-income ETF market.

Spot the hedge

In a rising-interest-rate environment, hedging can be key to keeping a bond ETF above water. According to research firm XTF Inc., 60% of fixed-income ETFs were down for the year through Oct. 29 as the target federal-funds rate moved higher over the course of the year. By contrast, the handful of hedged fixed-income ETFs are showing positive performance.

Several products from BlackRock Inc.'s iShares, WisdomTree Holdings, ProShare Advisors LLC and DWS Group's Xtrackers are achieving this performance up between 2% and 6% year to date, and attracting assets by hedging a variety of risks, including interest-rate moves and inflation expectations. Slightly more expensive and much less liquid than their plain-vanilla cousins, these ETFs can be used to reduce volatility while still delivering yield.

"Hedging was actually detrimental to performance for the first couple of years for many of these products," says Todd Rosenbluth, New York-based director of ETF and mutual-fund research for CFRA. "But now a few have developed a track record and more significant assets and volume," Mr. Rosenbluth says.

Employed effectively as part of a fixed-income portfolio, Mr. Rosenbluth says, several of these products have offered both reduced volatility and a greater risk-reward profile then their unhedged cousins. Yet of the $65 billion in net assets added this year to the $600 billion managed by fixed-income ETFs, most of the new money is going to short-term and floating-rate bond ETFs, traditional products less likely to get whipsawed by rising rates, and core offerings favored in diversified asset allocations. Hedged fixed-income ETFs collectively added $850 million this year through Oct. 24, according to ETF.com.

While many of the products have similar-sounding names, their underlying holdings or indexes and their hedging mechanisms can vary. The focus of each product tends to vary from the aggregate bond market to investment-grade corporate securities to high-yield debt to emerging markets.

Interest-rate hedging

To understand how interest-rate-hedging ETFs work, it helps first to understand the concept of duration, a measurement based on the timing of interest payments and return of principal for individual bonds. Expressed in years, duration can also be used to gauge sensitivity to interest-rate fluctuations. Generally, a one-percentage-point move in rates (up or down) will shift the price of the bond or bond portfolio in the opposite direction, multiplied by the duration. So, a rise in rates of 1 percentage point would sink the price of a five-year-duration bond or bond portfolio 5%.

Interest-rate-hedged ETFs are manufactured to have a duration of approximately zero. For example, ProShares Investment Grade Interest Rate Hedged ETF (IGHG) and Deutsche X-trackers Investment Grade Bond Interest Rate Hedged ETF (IGIH) attempt to do this by selling Treasury futures contracts that rise in value when Treasurys lose value i.e. when interest rates rise. This gain (or potential gain) helps to offset the decline in price of the bonds held by the ETF.

Alternatively, an ETF could use a type of financial derivative known as an interest-rate swap to achieve the same effect. The actively managed iShares Interest Rate Hedged Corporate Bond ETF (LQDH) does this by holding shares of the $31.6 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) and by selling derivatives that entitle the ETF to floating payments in return for fixed payments. If interest rates move higher, the ETF receives cash that can help to offset any price decline in its core holding, in this case LQD.

"The rates-hedging instruments can be seen in the disclosed holdings, and their effectiveness can be measured," says Raj Sharan, director of quantitative analytics and risk at Savos Investments, a division of AssetMark Inc.

Each of the issuers admonishes investors that these products are built mostly for quick, steep interest-rate moves, exactly like those experienced over the past several months.

"It's a way to reduce risk in a rising-rate environment," says Brad Krom, associate director of research at WisdomTree Investments, which launched a suite of hedged products five years ago on the day the Fed began tapering its bond purchases, including the $294 million WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged High Yield Bond Fund (HYZD).

One catch, says Mr. Krom, is that the hedged products deliver a "net yield," which covers the cost of the hedging activity in the distributions made to investors, which means the yield will be less than it is for unhedged products.

Negative duration and more

While the interest-rate-hedged fixed-income ETFs simply seek to eliminate the risk of rising rates, WisdomTree also has hung a shingle for products that attempt to actually goose returns for those looking to take a more aggressive stance in a rising-rate environment.

With roughly $100 million collectively in Negative Duration High Yield Bond (HYND) and Negative Duration U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGND), the WisdomTree products target minus 7 and minus 5 duration, respectively. So a rate rise of 1 percentage point would send the price of HYND up 7%. Such exposure would supercharge fund returns in a period of aggressive rate increases but also leaves it more vulnerable to losses if interest rates stay the same or fall. If rates fall one point, the price of HYND would fall 7%.

Other products, such as short-bond ETFs from ProShares and Direxion, reset their exposure daily and are built for active traders. And, of course, investors always have the option to carry out a short trade on their own, but will take on the associated carrying costs of borrowing an ETF.

Another possibility

iShares Inflation Hedged Corporate Bond ETF (LQDI), launched in May, takes a similar approach to LQDH but uses futures and swaps based on a measure of inflation. While only a few months into existence, this fund may not fare any better with investors than the $14 million ProShares Inflation Expectations ETF (RINF) launched in 2012 that is long U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities and short conventional Treasurys.

TP ICAP snaps up US energy broker Axiom

UK interdealer broker reports muted improvement in trading after summer of troubles

TP ICAP, the UK interdealer broker, has moved to put a turbulent summer behind it with a deal to buy Axiom Commodity Group, a US energy broker, for up to $29m.

The takeover is the first under new chief executive Nicolas Breteau and follows months of upheaval in which the company removed former boss John Phizackerley and issued a profit warning, saying it needed to scrap an annualised cost savings target for 2019.

Departing chairman Rupert Robson argued that TP ICAP has to invest to meet evolving industry trends. That includes spending on Mifid II, Brexit and legal and IT costs.

In a trading update on Friday that accompanied news of the deal, the London broker said full-year results would be in line with its lowered market guidance. Shares in the group rose 3.3 per cent to 298p, their highest level since the profit warning.

The purchase of Houston-based Axiom, first revealed by the Financial Times, from its founding partners will further bolster its position as the world s largest energy broker. Earlier this year TP ICAP also bought SCS Commodities, another US broker.

TP ICAP will pay an initial $15.1m in cash for Axiom, with deferred payments totalling up to $14m over the next three years.

Axiom, which brokers physical oil and pipeline capacity in the US, has 22 brokers and made a pre-tax profit of $5.3m last year. Its senior management will all remain with TP ICAP.

TP also reported a muted improvement in trading performance and Mr Breteau said there had been  periodic volatility  in its markets in October after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates.

Revenue for the four months to the end of October rose 1 per cent from 568m a year ago. Turnover in the first 10 months of the year was 1 per cent lower than the 1.5bn it reported in 2017. TP ICAP s brokers act as middlemen for interest rate swaps market, which investors use to hedge and speculate on future rate moves.

 Recent volatility hasn t signalled much improvement,  said Paul McGinnis, an analyst at Shore Capital.

Energy and commodity markets, which account for nearly a fifth of group turnover, remained challenging. Data, which saw an 11 per cent growth in turnover, had been earmarked as a growth engine under Mr Phizackerley.

 This underlines our firmly-held belief that investing in growth areas such as data and analytics will benefit TP ICAP over the longer-term,  said Mr Breteau.

PE Firms Eye Perfect Exit Storm for Oil-and-Gas Software Providers

Almost six years since private-equity firms began pouring capital into the oil-and-gas software sector, sponsors now want to ride an upswing in oil prices to exits.

As oil prices have rebounded steadily in recent years, prospects have improved for software providers serving the industry. At the same time, software investors flush with capital have noted the favorable shift in the oil-and-gas industry and have been willing to pay high premiums to buy these companies. Private-equity owners of oil-and-gas software providers are betting this convergence of forces will translate into both more exit opportunities and high returns.

"I think it's a large market where tech can be disruptive in a positive way," said Tom Barnds, a managing director and the founding partner at Accel-KKR, which recently sold software provider Oildex to private equity-backed Drilling Info Holdings Inc. "I think the other piece of the equation is there's been a little bit of pent up activity because certainly oil and energy markets were challenged for a couple of years."

As of Sept. 19, private-equity firms backed nine deals involving software companies serving the energy sector, according to data provider PitchBook Data Inc. By contrast, they backed eight such deals in 2017 and five in each of 2015 and 2016, respectively. Firms this year also have scored three exits in the sector, already matching three exits in 2017, PitchBook data show.

Sponsors poured more than $3.5 billion into 25 deals in the energy-software sector between 2012 and 2014, according to PitchBook. Energy-technology companies formed to meet the growing needs of oil-and-gas producers, providing software for land management, life-cycle reporting for wells, tracking for active oil rigs and accounting. As the oil-and-gas industry boomed and more customers lined up for these software products, private equity began pouring capital into the space.

"What you saw with the advent of shale and when PE looked more closely was around the beginning part of the decade, into the downturn," said Ethan Phillips, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. who focuses on the oil-and-gas and private-equity industries. He added that a 2012 investment led by Insight Venture Partners in Drilling Info and Advent International Corp.'s 2013 investment in P2 Energy Solutions Inc. ranked among the large deals that took place during that time.

In late 2014, however, software providers got caught in the swift downturn in oil prices, although many of them weathered the change better than other oil-services companies. Many oil-and-gas software companies looked inward, working on operating efficiencies and inorganic growth.

Anika Agarwal, a managing director at Insight, said the industry has changed a lot since the firm invested in Drilling Info. She said that although the oil-and-gas pricing environment was volatile, its customers found the company's software even more vital.

"The reliance on data and analytics continues to help the companies weather the storms themselves," said Ms. Agarwal of the company's performance as oil prices plummeted. "If anything in a downturn, they need that even more."

Ms. Agarwal said that in the more than six years since Insight invested in Drilling Info, the company has completed 10 acquisitions, many of which it backed when oil prices were under pressure. Its customer base, too, has changed with the addition of more oil-and-gas companies, as well as hedge funds and financial players who are interested in the software for its data, she said.

Drilling Info also since has added Genstar Capital as its new majority owner in a deal that people familiar with the matter said valued the company at roughly $1 billion. Insight still holds a stake in Drilling Info.

Others that weathered the uncertain climate of the oil-and-gas downturn have been rewarded with lucrative equity opportunities.

M33 Growth recently took a minority stake in Waterfield Energy Software, a provider of accounting software for oil-and-gas upstream and midstream companies. Elsewhere, Oildex's sale to Drilling Info brought in a more than four-times return on invested capital for Accel-KKR, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.

Although 2018 so far has proven to be a positive year for software providers in the space, it isn't clear how long this window will remain open. Macroeconomic pressures and fluctuations in oil prices could pose fresh challenges for the sector. However, Mr. Barnds of Accel-KKR is largely bullish on the category.

"I think it's going to be a healthy deal market if the oil and energy market remains within plus or minus 15% of where it is today," he said.

Tech Swoon Stings Hedge Funds; Broad declines for hedge funds prompt dismay among some investors

Hedge funds that rode the technology wave up are getting bruised on the way down.

Tiger Global Management posted a 9.4% net loss in its tech-focused hedge fund last month, according to people familiar with the firm. The fund is up roughly 10% net for the year through October, beating the S&P 500 and the industry on average.

Less specialized hedge funds were hit as well. Soroban Capital Partners was down 9% for the month, while Glenview Capital Management and Melvin Capital Management lost 11% and 15%, respectively, according to people familiar with the firms. Suvretta Capital Management lost 8.1% in October, according to an investor document.

Third Point's losses of 6.7% to 6.9% in its funds a loss of roughly $1 billion in a month have taken it into the red for the year.

The broad declines for hedge funds in October occurred during one of the most violent pullback in stocks in more than seven years. Stocks around the world lost about $5 trillion in value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, as shares in Europe and Asia also tumbled.

The S&P 500 lost nearly 7% last month, marking its worst October since 2008. It is up 3% for the year through October.

The magnitude and widespread nature of losses are prompting dismay among some investors. While hedge funds are expected to lag bull markets because they are hedged or have bets against the market or specific companies that eat into their returns clients expect them to outperform during downturns. Hedge funds also commonly market themselves as being uncorrelated with broader markets.

But hedge funds betting on and against stocks lost 7.4% for October, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a client report Friday. For the year through October, the funds on average were down 4.9%.

Oct. 24 was particularly damaging for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-stock-picking-hedge-funds-just-had-their-worst-day-in-six-years-1540491863" which had their worst day in almost seven years, according to another Goldman report. Those funds tracked by Goldman dropped 1.44% that day, the report said.

A slight rebound in technology shares at the end of October helped some hedge funds trim their losses, traders said.

Hedge funds have steadily increased their exposure to the tech sector over the past several years as the number of publicly traded U.S. companies has shrunk and technology companies have helped drive returns. The tech sector jumped 37% in 2017, nearly doubling the broader S&P 500's advance. Health-care and technology stocks drove the stock market higher this year before October.

"It was either get on the bus or you got left in the dust," said Scott Warner of Paamco Prisma, which manages or advises on $30 billion in client money. "You saw people starting to drift to a narrower and narrower subset of ideas, especially very large managers whose investible universe is not that big."

Chasing companies that were leading the market was only part of the reason some managers piled into technology.

Fundamentally, many investors have found technology companies attractive the last several years believing these firms were well positioned to succeed even when there is growing competition from China and Europe. They also expected rising interest rates to hurt some other large sectors, including consumer staples and utilities.

At the end of June, one of the FANG grouping Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. made up at least 5% of 163 hedge-fund firms' U.S. stockholdings, according to an analysis of securities filings by portfolio analytics firm Novus. That is up from 93 hedge funds three years earlier, the firm found.

The industry's exposure to those four stocks as a percentage of their growing tech sector investments over that three-year period increased by about 75%, according to other analysis by Novus.

Despite the October selloff, some investors in hedge funds said their tech investments generally have remained profitable over the long term.

"One of the big concerns has been how sustainable is that source of return," said Alex Band, of outsourced investment firm Partners Capital, which advises on more than $24 billion of client money. But "there's a lot of value to many of these companies."

Other factors hurt hedge funds last month, said investors, including a selloff in popular biotech companies, bets against retail companies that rallied and weakness in European equities.

The $28 billion Tiger Global was among the earliest of hedge funds to focus on technology investing, and it now manages more money in its venture capital funds than in its hedge fund. In an Oct. 31 letter to investors, the firm said its concentration in "high-growth companies" that had hurt it in October had contributed to its gains the first nine months of the year.

Tiger Global also said it had been "adding to certain longs where prospective returns have increased and covering some shorts that have declined. In general, we are more optimistic about our portfolio after this move."

Good day. Rember all of those initial coin offerings piling up crypto cash in 2017? Some venture capitalists who invested in them worry that the assets they raised could be too much of a good thing.

Be sure to read today's story about the trials and tribulations of startups trying to balance their crypto treasury management with their core mission: being tech innovators.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Crypto correction: This year's reversal in fortunes for virtual currencies is causing distractions for crypto startups. Scores of the software-focused companies have raised hefty sums of volatile cryptocurrencies in initial coin offerings. Now some venture capitalists worry that entrepreneurs are bogged down in so-called crypto treasury-management strategies and focusing more on financial engineering than software engineering. "We've seen lots of founders where they will play with investor money, speculating on the markets," said Joey Krug, co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron and Yuliya Chernova have the story.

A bigger piece of the pie: Zume Inc. is in the process of raising a major new round of capital through SoftBank's Vision Fund in a deal expected to give the pizza delivery and food-logistics startup a valuation of about $2.25 billion. Zume's new valuation, which assumes both tranches get completed, would represent a giant leap from the $170 million valuation the startup received as part of a funding round about a year ago. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the scoop.

Better than Beanie Babies? The company behind the blockchain-based game CryptoKitties has raised $15 million in Series A-2 funding. Launched in December 2017 by Dapper Labs Inc., CryptoKitties is one of the few blockchain-based applications that have broken through to popular usage by consumers. The game lets people buy, sell, trade and breed digital felines that are embedded on the blockchain. The game was so popular that it slowed down the Ethereum network late last year. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has more.

Gormley's Take: Placing Fewer Bets on Heart-Drug Developers

By Brian Gormley

Venture capitalists are making fewer investments in drugs for heart disease, showing that big markets with pressing needs aren't always appealing to investors.

Heart disease is the leading killer in the U.S., but venture funding for drug treatments has dwindled.

Availability of generic medicines for conditions like high blood pressure set a high bar for new drugs, which must be superior to command a premium price, said Dion Madsen, co-founder of Amplitude Ventures. Investors also worry about the cost of large-scale clinical trials often needed to show that a heart drug delivers favorable outcomes.

But some startups are finding ways to streamline drug development and lower costs. Corvidia Therapeutics Inc. secured $60 million in April from Venrock and others by taking a precision-medicine approach to cardiovascular and kidney conditions.

More in Gormley's Take.

Swedish Firm eEquity Seeks  150 Million for Online-Commerce Bets

Swedish growth-equity firm eEquity is seeking to raise as much as  150 million ($171.1 million) to back fast-growing digital companies, said a person familiar with the matter.

The firm, which counts online fashion retailer NA-KD AB among its current investments, has held a first close on  60 million, the person added.

Founded in 2010 by entrepreneurs Magnus Wiberg and Patrik Hedelin, eEquity provides growth capital to technology companies based in Northern Europe.

The fund can take minority and majority stakes and pitches itself to potential investment targets as something between a venture-capital and a buyout fund, Mr. Hedelin said.

"There are too many venture and buyout funds and lots of competition," Mr. Hedelin said. "We have the flexibility to take minority or majority stakes and provide capital to help grow businesses."

The new fund will target up to 15 investments and write equity checks of up to  10 million.

The firm seeks to profit from the rapid growth of online retail and harness big data and social media to boost revenue at its portfolio companies, Mr. Hedelin said. "Only a small proportion of retail is online but the market is growing."

This year has seen a surge in the number of firms seeking to raise growth-capital funds in Europe.

WSJ Pro Private Equity reported in August that for the first time more growth funds are trying to raise capital in Europe than typical buyout funds, citing data provider Preqin Ltd. Buyout firms tend to differ from growth investors as they typically use leverage and buy controlling stakes in companies they back.

A number of large buyout firms, including KKR & Co., also have moved into the space to gain access to fast-growing companies which might be too small for their flagship buyout funds to invest in. WSJ Pro Private Equity this week reported CVC Capital Partners"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cvc-targets-up-to-1-5-billion-for-latest-growth-fund-1541005688?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3" for its latest technology growth fund.

Market turmoil sees investors turn to ETF options for protection

A chastening October reminds some investors about the risks of a further drop

Warning signals are flashing from the exchange traded funds industry as investors intensify their use of ETFs to shield portfolios from the risk of a sharp correction in the US stock market.

The huge volume of trading activity linked to ETFs means these index tracking funds have become a closely watched barometer of US market conditions for institutional investors and professional traders.

The S&P 500, the main US equity benchmark, has fallen 8.4 per cent since reaching an all-time high on September 20. Concerns about the outlook for company earnings, rising US interest rates and vows by US president Donald Trump to escalate the trade war with China threaten to end the rally for the US equity market that has lasted more than nine years.

The October downturn has coincided with a marked increase in ETF activity. ETF trades accounted for about a third of daily US stock market activity in October, the highest monthly share for more than three years. The world s largest ETF, known as SPY, alone accounted for about a quarter of the $1.4tn in US ETF trading activity registered in that month.

Observers are also paying close attention to demand for derivatives linked to ETFs, an increasingly important set of tools for market professionals. The most volatile trading days in October have seen activity in derivative  puts  that provide investors with an option to sell SPY at a pre-determined price running at double the pace of  calls  that give a right to buy the ETF.

 Investors have clearly ramped up their usage of ETFs as well as other derivatives including futures and options on ETFs as tools to reposition and hedge [protect] their holdings,  said Katherine Fogertey, an analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York.

Similar trends have also been seen for some days in October in options activity linked to other important US ETFs, including Invesco s $411bn QQQ that tracks the Nasdaq Composite. The Nasdaq has fallen 11.7 per cent since its peak in late-August, reflecting worries about the lofty valuations attached to US tech stocks. The largest ETF tracking US smaller companies   BlackRock s $44.5bn IWM   has also seen days where put option activity has increased significantly, suggesting that concerns about the outlook for US earnings go beyond the tech sector.

Ms Fogertey said the shifts in options positioning reflected adjustments by investors to existing hedges and portfolios to current market conditions and should not be automatically interpreted as a bearish signal for the US market.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley, however, said the US had entered a  rolling bear  market with almost four out of every 10 US stocks having fallen 20 per cent at some point from their price high over the previous 12 months.

 The message from Mr Market is clear. The consensus outlook for US earnings growth next year is too rosy,  said Adam Virgadamo, an equity strategist. Morgan Stanley has told clients that the S&P 500 could fall to 2,450 points, a decline of 16.4 per cent from its peak, and thereafter trade in a wide range between 2,400 and 3,000 for up to two years.

Short interest in both SPY and QQQ rose about 6 per cent in October, according to data from S3 Partners, a New York-based financial technology and analytics company, which found that more than a fifth of the outstanding shares of both ETFs were out on loan. A rise in ETF short interest can reflect growing appetite among hedge funds to bet on further market weakness as well as demand from market makers for hedging purposes

Economy
Worker-Productivity Gains Coming Up Short in Stronger Economy; Output per hour for workers in nonfarm businesses rose 1.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, marking the 32nd straight quarter of yearly growth below 2%

WASHINGTON Despite strong economic growth and historically low unemployment, a government report released Thursday pointed to an important missing ingredient so far in the U.S. expansion: worker-productivity improvements.

Output per hour for workers in nonfarm businesses rose 1.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, marking the 32nd straight quarter of yearly growth below 2%, a long and consistent stretch of anemic growth that hasn't happened before in the post-World War II era.

There were some signs of improvement. For a six-month period between April and September, worker productivity gains beat a 2% annualized growth rate. Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics, called that "strong by recent standards" and Daniel Silver at JPMorgan Chase & Co. called it "solid."

Still, there have been previous six-months bursts of growth like that in this expansion that weren't sustained and thus didn't develop into strong yearly growth. If the latest six-month stretch doesn't hold up, some economists say, the economy's fast overall growth rate won't be sustained.

"Since we're getting slow growth of productivity, and...relatively slow growth of the workforce, that means we're going to get slower growth of gross domestic product," said Martin Baily, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and former adviser to President Clinton.

An economy's long-run growth is determined by its number of workers and how much they produce. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, yearly productivity gains routinely beat 3%, sometimes exceeding 4%. Without productivity gains, economic growth depends on growing the workforce, something that is hard to accomplish now because so many baby boomers are retiring.

To boost growth for much of the expansion, businesses have been hiring more workers, as opposed to aggressively boosting the output of the workers they have.

That meant more jobs and more income for millions of Americans, which is good news, but it has also been a conundrum. Advances in technology such as artificial intelligence led some economists to foresee big gains in worker productivity that haven't shown up in the statistics. Moreover, with the jobless rate so low and workers in many industries scarce, companies have a big incentive to invest aggressively to help their workers become more productive.

One factor at play: The historically low unemployment rate means companies are hiring less-skilled workers to fill jobs, a potential drag on productivity.

Increases in business investment earlier this year could offset that drag, but business investment in the third quarter grew at a meager 0.8% annual rate, in part because spending on oil and gas rigs was down.

Beth Ann Bovino of S&P Global Ratings said that one quarter of investment pullback doesn't make a trend, but "if that continues, that's a concern down the road" for productivity gains. In another potential warning sign, the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday said its manufacturing index "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-factory-sector-growth-retreated-a-bit-in-october-1541082434", including a drop in its new orders index.

Tariffs could also pose operational challenges for some companies. Frans van Houten, the CEO of Netherlands-based health-technology company Philips NV, said last week that headwinds created by the recent tariffs between the U.S. and China "will require us to work on additional productivity measures to absorb these negative impacts."

Advances in worker wages and inflation are also closely tied to productivity gains. Wages tend to rise when productivity is strong. While wages show signs of picking up, some of the gains for workers are being eaten up by inflation, which has also risen. Hourly compensation for workers in nonfarm businesses, adjusted for inflation, was up just 0.1% in the third quarter from a year earlier.

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans underscored the need for stronger productivity in a September speech.

"Higher sustainable growth would be great. However, we can't get there without boosting the underlying trends in labor input or productivity," Mr. Evans said.

Establishing a credit history and building a good credit score can be a bit of a Catch-22 for young adults.

Take two of my daughters. Just as one was wrapping up her freshman year of college, she applied for a credit card and was denied because she has student loans (even though no payments are due until after she graduates). Her older sister, who was about to graduate without any student loans, was denied because she had no credit record at all.

It used to be that card applications were thrust into the hands of college students during freshman orientation. But it became harder for young adults to get a card following passage of the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which requires those under age 21 to have a cosigner or proof of independent income.

So what is a young adult to do? Here are some steps to consider, year by year, to help students begin building a strong credit profile.

Freshman Year

Parents can start by adding their college freshman as an authorized user on one of their credit cards but should do so only if they have good credit scores themselves, says Nancy Bistritz-Balkan, vice president of consumer education and advocacy at credit-reporting firm Equifax Inc. If they don't, it could hurt the student right out of the gate. A good parental score is in the high 600s or above, says Ethan Dornhelm, vice president of scores and analytics at FICO, which created the credit-scoring model most lenders see.

Another good early option is a secured credit card, says Bruce McClary, vice president of communications at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. No credit check is required since the card is funded by depositing cash. The consumer essentially spends his or her own money and replenishes it each month by paying the bill.

At age 18, students can begin requesting free credit reports each year from the big three credit-reporting companies, Experian PLC, TransUnion and Equifax via "http://annualcreditreport.com". This allows them to check for fraudulent activity and begin to understand how their profile is built. The reports won't include a FICO score, however. Students may be able to get that free through their bank or by using Discover Credit Scorecard, an online tool. Free scores also are available through financial apps such as Mint and Credit Karma, but they use a model known as VantageScore 3.0, which can vary from the FICO score.

Sophomore Year

Some students have a car by now, subsidized by parents. Parents may be making the car payments, while the child covers gas and insurance costs. One way to help the student start building a credit history is to flip that arrangement: Have the student cosign the auto loan and make the payments, while the parents cover insurance and other costs. One caveat: The debt associated with that loan could hurt a child on future credit applications.

Experts say paying utility, cellphone and subscription bills on time, as well as responsible debit-card use, won't bolster a student's credit history. But students who live off campus and make reliable monthly rent payments can use services such as Rental Kharma or ClearNow to have those payments reported to credit bureaus, says Jeff Richardson, vice president of marketing for VantageScore Solutions. Many of these services require landlords to be registered and charge monthly fees.

For the first solo, unsecured credit application, a gas or retail credit card is a good way to go, says Mrs. Bistritz-Balkan. The amounts approved are often low, so even a part-time job can provide enough income to qualify. With any credit granted, use it regularly but never let your balances grow to more than 30% of the available credit line. And pay it off in full each month.

Junior Year

If they can swing it, students may want to begin making small payments on student debt even if they anticipate taking out more loans for the final two years of college. The lender will report payments to credit agencies, even for amounts much smaller than the full payments due after graduation. If students make the payments with an automatic debit plan, they may qualify for a small interest-rate reduction. Students should first research whether there are drawbacks to making payments before the loan is due, as might be the case for those entering fields that include loan-forgiveness plans.

In the case of my younger child, while her student loans initially led to a denial, she was ultimately able to be approved for a student credit card (with a $500 limit) because when she appealed she was able to demonstrate that her remaining college fund was worth more than the loans that had sunk her. So students may want to apply for credit before the full four years of student loans have been issued, and while college savings can still be leveraged.

Students who have had a secured credit card for a year or two with a perfect payment history should be able to graduate to an unsecured one now. They should compare deals from various card issuers, including their current lender.

Senior Year

Students who still don't have a credit card of any kind should consider applying for a student card before graduation. These have relatively low credit lines, but less stringent underwriting so they aren't as dependent on income.

Those who have had a student card for a while with a stellar record should ask their lenders for more favorable terms, such as lower rates and lower or no annual fees.

"If you've have several years of no missed payments and your balances are relatively low, then there's no reason your FICO score wouldn't be in the high 600s or above and that's a pretty solid score that could qualify you for mainstream credit," says Mr. Dornhelm.

The U.S. private sector added 227,000 jobs in October, according to a report released Wednesday, largely driven by employment growth at larger businesses.

The ADP National Employment report measures the change in nonfarm private sector employment in the U.S. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting 180,000 jobs to be added.

The 227,000 new jobs are the most the private sector has added since February of this year when it added 241,000 jobs, according to data from the ADP Research Institute and Moody's Analytics, which put together the monthly report.

Large businesses, or those that have at least 500 employees, added 102,000 in October, according to data from the ADP Research Institute and Moody's Analytics, which put together the monthly report. Medium-size businesses, or those with between 50 and 499 employees, added 96,000 jobs.

"We continue to see larger employers benefit in this environment as they are more apt to provide the competitive wages and strong benefits employees desire," said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, in prepared remarks. He added that "the only blemish is the struggles small businesses are having filling open job positions."

The service sector was again the biggest beneficiary of the new jobs, adding 189,000.

Within the service industry, trade, transportation and utilities added 61,000 jobs, the most of any of the sector subcategories.

Capital One's Tech Transformation; Capital One CIO Rob Alexander on the challenges and advantages of a bank operating as a technology company

Capital One Financial Corp. wants to be both a technology company and a bank.

Since 2011, Chief Information Officer Rob Alexander has expanded his technology staff to 9,000 from 2,500, hiring hundreds of software engineers, developers and artificial-intelligence experts to develop products such as a recently launched digital chatbot.

He also helped spearhead an effort over the past three years to move the bank's back-end software development tools and infrastructure to the public cloud. That way, he says, the bank's technical staff can get software products to market faster, more easily and with top-notch security.

The rate at which Capital One is relying on the cloud, embracing technology and competing for AI talent is "surprising and remarkable," says Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy for financial-company research firm Autonomous Research.

Mr. Alexander spoke with The Wall Street Journal about the development of the bank's chatbot, Eno, and the challenges and advantages of operating like a technology company. Edited excerpts follow.

Understanding intent

WSJ: Did you run into any challenges creating the Eno chatbot?

MR. ALEXANDER: In 2016 we experimented with and piloted a version of Eno that was built on a commercial third-party natural language processing AI engine. We quickly came to the conclusion that while the performance was good, it really has to be great for customers to use it.

The off-the-shelf natural language processing models weren't good enough, and we had to start from scratch and build our own because we care about accuracy in two ways. One, Eno needed the ability to understand the intent of a request, and then the functionality to execute on that intent. The first version of Eno didn't understand the intent well enough.

For example, we calculated 2,500 ways a customer might request his or her balance, including misspellings and things that autocorrect does. The model is constantly learning what those variations are and what the customer's intent was.

WSJ: What have you changed about Eno over time based on customer feedback?

MR. ALEXANDER: If the chatbot can't help customers with things that are important to them, or they get generic responses, they won't use it.

A lot of customers ask Eno to remind them before their bill is due on their card. We have trained Eno to understand that request, and then automate the process of setting up reminders for customers in advance of when their bill is due.

Other examples of that proactivity would be if we see fraudulent or suspicious activity on your account, Eno can automatically reach out to you through the mobile app, SMS text or email. If we see a double charge for the same merchant right away or an unusually big tip on a restaurant bill out of pattern, Eno will send a notification or email or SMS text to a customer that says, "Hey, this looks suspicious, did you mean to do that?"

WSJ: You said there are 2,500 ways a customer might request their balance. What common customer phrasings did it not recognize before that it does now?

MR. ALEXANDER: Some examples of this include "How much money is in my account?" This is an example of an inquiry that doesn't directly use the word "balance," but Eno understands the intent behind the question.

"How much have I racked up on my card?" This is an example where a customer is speaking in natural language, in a way they would think about balance, despite the context being a bit unclear.

WSJ: Can you provide some examples of things that Eno wasn't doing well that you changed, based on feedback?

MR. ALEXANDER: As we started in our web application, we noticed customers typing in very lengthy messages. This would confuse Eno, due to multiple intents, and extraneous information. So we did a design change: Up front, Eno says that it does better with shorter questions. This reduced customer friction, and Eno has responded better. Typically, we prefer to adapt the tech to the human behavior, but in this case we saw an opportunity to influence human behavior in a way that set both Eno and the customer up for success while the technology continues to evolve.

WSJ: What makes Eno different as a result of it being created by an in-house team of technologists?

MR. ALEXANDER: One important point to call out is that Eno wasn't just built by a team of in-house technologists. It was built by an integrated team of product, tech and design professionals, all contributing to the project's success from start to finish.

Eno's personality is a great example of the outcomes from that operating model. When we set out to design the intelligent assistant, we recognized that character development was a capability we didn't have so we hired filmmakers, anthropologists, journalists and designers with deep experience in character development to help define and shape how our intelligent assistant would connect with our customers. Today, we have an incredibly talented in-house AI design team that is deeply focused on creating experiences that lead to contextually relevant, meaningful conversations and relationships rooted in trust, empathy and understanding.

For example, our decision to design Eno as a gender-neutral intelligent assistant was made by that internal team.

Talent competition

WSJ: What's an example of a challenge you've had to overcome in the transition toward operating more like a technology company?

MR. ALEXANDER: It's really about how to attract and retain the type of talent that you need, and in quantities that are required to fulfill on that mission of operating like a technology company. Today we hire software engineers, data engineers, machine learning and cloud infrastructure and cyber engineering. That's the toughest challenge in this whole thing, because you're trying to attract a kind of talent that's in high demand in the marketplace.

WSJ: What are you doing to attract that talent?

MR. ALEXANDER: We have to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and we benchmark ourselves against tech companies and their compensation. Our founder is still the CEO, and there's that ethos that you get with a founder-led organization. It feels much more like a startup. We're also very focused on providing an environment that allows people to learn and build their skills.

WSJ: You oversee 9,000 technology staff. As a bank, why do you need that many technologists?

MR. ALEXANDER: We recognized that customers ultimately are going to choose financial institutions that offer the same kind of experiences they can get in other domains in their digital lives. We need to operate like technology companies that are delivering those experiences in other dimensions of their lives, which means we need to be building our own software solutions, and doing that requires a highly technical workforce. Just like Amazon, Netflix or Uber need to have great engineering technology staffs to build their products, we need to have the same thing for banking.

WSJ: What are some areas of opportunity that you've identified for using machine learning to serve customers better?

MR. ALEXANDER: Fraud is a really interesting problem. The hard part from a technology perspective is you have to make decisions in real time. We've got a customer standing there at point-of-sale and there is this 50-millisecond requirement to return an answer on "do we approve this transaction?"

You've got to have really sophisticated technology to deal with the volume of data and deal with it in real time, and you want to apply complex algorithms to distinguish those transactions that are abnormal and out of pattern and look like fraud. But you've got to tune it well because you don't want to decline a real transaction. We've been investing heavily in this.

Another machine-learning example is a feature we've developed as part of our auto-finance business. You take an image of a car that is either a photo that you take or you can hold up your phone with your camera in real time and point it at a car that you're interested in and we can automatically in real time tell you what your monthly payment would be on that vehicle.

VC Daily: Longevity Backer ARCH Is Refueling; Bold Fee Structures for New Funds

Good day. So-called longevity startups, which are developing treatments that target specific conditions linked to the aging process, have been having a moment lately. We have a story today about a new fundraising by ARCH Venture Partners, one of the chief investors behind the scenes of the anti-aging movement.

We'll also share exclusive details about the customs-evasion tactics used by some gig workers helping to deliver items to shoppers abroad. Plus, Yuliya Chernova's Take today raises some urgent questions about the large funds and fee structures that first-time venture firms are running up the flagpole.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Bio boost: Bio-focused ARCH Venture Partners, an early investor in longevity startup Unity Biotechnology Inc. and gene-sequencing specialist Illumina Inc., is in the market to raise up to $600 million for what would be the firm's 10th and potentially largest fund. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

Delivery duty: Online companies like San Francisco-based Grabr that hook up travelers willing to deliver items to shoppers abroad are building a new industry, but their users often participate in an age-old tradition: customs evasion. The Wall Street Journal interviewed more than a dozen Grabr travelers, almost all of whom said they tried to bring expensive items through customs without paying duties. WSJ's Andrea Fuller has the exclusive.

Scooter deal-maker: Less than three months after announcing an investment from Uber Technologies Inc., electric-scooter startup Lime has landed one of its key business executives. Lime hired David Richter as chief of business, where he will oversee mergers and acquisitions, sales strategy and other finance operations. He held a similar role at Uber for more than four years. WSJ's Greg Bensinger has the exclusive.

Chernova's Take: Taking on Bigger Bets, and Charging More for It

By Yuliya Chernova

Here's one way to summarize the hot venture market of 2018: VCs have been raising larger funds, and some of them doing so faster than usual, based on paper gains. Higher VC fund fees and investments in unproven expensive sectors like crypto are becoming more common.

Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital just closed $1 billion for a pair of funds on mostly unrealized performance. The firm charged 2.5% in management fees, compared to the 2% typical fee, as WSJ Pro Venture Capital previously reported.

At least Thrive Capital already has a few funds under its belt, but some new firms expect a similar fee structure.

In this market, however, that money easily flows from LPs to VCs and then on to the entrepreneurs. Large bets are now the norm, which exposes VCs to potentially large losses if any one company goes under.

More in Chernova's Take.

Exits

Technology-enabled health-care network Carbon Health has merged with Direct Urgent Care, a network of urgent care centers. San Francisco-based Carbon is backed by investors including Builders VC, Javelin Venture Partners and Two Sigma Ventures.

VC Funds

Define Ventures is raising a first fund of up to $65 million, according to a regulatory filing. The San Francisco-based firm was founded this year and has secured $50 million in committed capital as of Monday. Lynne Chou O'Keefe, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers who handles health-care investments, is listed as the managing director of Define Ventures. Ms. Chou O'Keefe declined to comment on the filing.

Circulate Capital is raising a $90 million fund to invest in companies and infrastructure across Southern Asia dedicated to combating the ocean plastic crisis. Limited partners expected to invest in the fund include PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, Dow, Danone, Unilever and Coca-Cola Co.

South African technology group Naspers Ltd. has committed 1.4 billion South African rand, ($95 million) to Naspers Foundry, which will back tech startups in that country.

Work-Bench Ventures, a New York-based venture firm focused on enterprise technologies, has raised $46.2 million for its second fund, according to a regulatory filing.

Moonrise Capital is seeking to raise up to $200 million for Moonrise Venture Partners II LP, according to a regulatory filing. Donald Pascal, a managing partner at Moonrise, appears on the document.

New Money

Enable Injections Inc., a Cincinnati-based developer of wearable devices for the subcutaneous delivery of biologics and other high-volume therapeutics, has completed the first close of a round targeted at $50 million.

Investment and government initiatives ignite start-up scenes from Singapore to Penang

South-east Asia s tech start-up scene is getting hotter by the year. Money is pouring in and valuations are soaring as investors bet big on the region s rapid growth, huge markets and youthful, mobile-savvy consumers.

With so much at stake, cities from Singapore to Vietnam s Ho Chi Minh City are competing to become the next Silicon Valley   home not only to successful start-ups but also to the mentors, investors and institutions that support them.

The Nikkei Asian Review looked at criteria ranging from number of start-ups to cost of office space and selected the five cities below as the hottest places for innovation in south-east Asia.

Singapore

Number of tech start-ups

4,300 as of 2016

Government support

Programmes providing equity funding, preferential loans or R&D financing, access to co-working space and incubation facilities, tax breaks for start-ups and investors, preferential immigration policies for foreign talent

Education/talent pool

National University of Singapore, ranked 11th in the 2019 QS World University Rankings, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Institute of Technology, Nanyang Business School and Insead s Singapore campus

Access to funding

Wide range of investors, including individual angels, family office funds, hedge funds, private equity, venture capital; government programmes typically match private sector-led funding

Transportation

Transportation infrastructure among world s best; Changi Airport less than 30 minutes by taxi from most business, residential districts

Office rent

$7.20 per sq ft per month for Grade A office in central business district in July-September quarter, according to JLL

In early 2015, Sinuhe Arroyo spotted a chance for his artificial intelligence start-up to win a contract with a government agency in Singapore. But his colleagues warned him against it, since their company, Taiger, though based in Singapore, was incorporated in Spain.

Mr Arroyo, the company s founder and chief executive, pressed ahead anyway   and was pleasantly surprised when Taiger became the first foreign company to win a contract from the Singaporean government.

 My colleagues had opposed 	. 	. 	. 	bidding, saying it would be a waste of time. But I insisted Singapore is such a transparent meritocracy that we have a chance to win a contract if we have a convincing technology. I was right,  recalls Mr Arroyo.

The Taiger team had moved to Singapore from the US at the end of 2014 because they saw a less-cultivated, more transparent and faster-growing business technology market in Asia.

In 2016, after receiving two more government tenders, Taiger reincorporated in Singapore. The following year, Singapore s start-up-backing agency SGInnovate invested in Taiger in its first fundraising round, alongside local private equity firm Tembusu Partners.

Today Taiger is a darling of Singapore s AI start-up scene. Its clients include such global companies as AIA Group, Banco Santander, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Standard Chartered. And Mr Arroyo advises government panels on national AI strategies.

Long established as a financial centre, Singapore has become the leading start-up hub in south-east Asia thanks to a mix of ready capital and government policies. According to Enterprise Singapore, the number of start-ups in the city-state increased from about 2,800 in 2003 to 4,300 in 2016. Venture capital funding jumped from $80m in 2010 to $1.2bn in 2017, according to KPMG.

Singaporean venture capitalist Yinglan Tan sees a  lifetime opportunity  in his home country. He left Sequoia Capital last year to found his own venture capital firm, Insignia Ventures Partners, based in Singapore.

He sees plenty of room for growth, noting that south-east Asia s total tech industry market cap is roughly $20bn, compared with $300bn in India, where the GDP per capita of $1,700 is less than half of south-east Asia s $3,800.  South-east Asia s tech industry should be at least $100bn, which presents a huge opportunity for various types of start-ups and VCs,  Mr Tan said.

Singapore is attracting global investors who want to use it as a base to invest in south-east Asia s tech sector, mainly because of the country s rule of law and tax regime, Mr Tan said. It is also attracting entrepreneurs and other talent thanks to its ease of doing businesses, quality of life and high level of education, he added.

 Lots of US-educated fellow Singaporeans are coming back,  Mr Tan said. Some non-native entrepreneurs like Mr Arroyo, a Spanish citizen, are choosing Singapore as the place for incorporation as well.

As a Sequoia partner, Mr Tan lived in Silicon Valley, which has thrived with an ecosystem of angel investors, entrepreneurs turned mentors, venture capitalists, lawyers and banks. He says that Singapore is rapidly developing those supporting functions as well.  Five years ago there was almost none of those. Now we see a critical mass of mentors and supporters,  Mr Tan said.

One of those crucial elements is incubation space. The Singaporean government has been proactive in fostering this aspect as well.

In 2011 the National University of Singapore launched a start-up-incubation space called Block 71 in a renovated industrial building. Taking its name from its street address, Block 71 adopted a similar strategy to 500 Startups, the pioneering incubator launched a year earlier in Silicon Valley.

Today Block 71 is a cluster of seven incubation buildings set on a 16,000 sq m piece of land. It hosts 250 start-ups and 30 incubators and VCs   making it one of the largest clusters of start-ups in the world.

Michael Yap, a Block 71-based venture capitalist who worked in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong s office when Block 71 was launched, says Singaporeans still need to  think harder  about how the city-state should adapt to change.

For example, if Indonesia   the region s largest economy and home to four  unicorns    accelerates reforms and becomes more business-friendly, it is unclear whether Singapore could maintain its advantage as a regional hub for entrepreneurs and investors.

 We should think about what roles we can play in different environments so that people would not forget about Singapore and jump to Indonesia,  Yap said.

Indonesia s capital may not be the easiest place to do business   the city is plagued by chronic traffic jams and there is plenty of red tape. But despite the hassles, Jakarta has recently become one of south-east Asia s most exciting start-up hubs.

Indonesia boasts four unicorns   start-ups valued at $1bn or more   and it is the second-largest recipient of venture capital in south-east Asia, behind only Singapore. Venture capital firms pumped $1.4bn into 123 deals in 2016, double the value of their commitments a year earlier, according to consultancy AT Kearney and Google. Deal values more than likely doubled again in 2017.

 Now we are seeing a much more consistent rise of start-ups,  said Ridzki Syahputera, corporate development manager at Convergence Ventures, a local venture capital firm.  I think a lot of it is market confidence that they will get funding. Entrepreneurs believe that they can get funding, whereas five years ago, they might have thought, only if I am really the best would I be able to successfully fundraise. 

It is Indonesia s market potential that has international investors excited. The country has the world s fourth-largest population, of more than 260m people, 60 per cent of whom are under 40. They are also digital-savvy: smartphone penetration is set to reach 78 per cent in 2020.

Unlike countries with smaller domestic markets like Singapore or South Korea, Indonesia s start-up scene is focused on the consumer sector. Its unicorns are all consumer-centric: Tokopedia and Bukalapak are e-commerce companies, while Go-Jek started off as a ride-hailing app and is now a platform for ordering a variety of daily services. Traveloka is an online travel service.

The next wave of start-ups has focused on ancillary services such as payments, logistics and advertising technology. And while the shallowness of Indonesia s capital markets means that an IPO exit strategy is unfeasible for most start-ups, the country s unicorns are now acting as acquirers of these new businesses   further invigorating the ecosystem in the nation s capital.

President Joko Widodo s push to make Indonesia the biggest digital economy in the region has contributed to the momentum. His administration is backing an initiative to foster 1,000 start-ups by 2020 with a total valuation of $10bn, and it plays a key role in the Nexticorn programme, which brings together promising local start-ups with international investors to help with latter-stage funding.

In 2017 Mr Widodo ordered the relevant ministries to support start-ups, including by offering grants to incubators. His administration also made it easier for e-commerce companies to receive low-rate bank loans and provided simplified tax procedures for those with annual turnover below 4.8bn rupiah.

 I am pretty content with what is happening, how Jakarta is developing as a city,  said Benedicto Haryono, co-founder and chief executive of the online P2P lending service KoinWorks. Founded in 2015, it is one of the many fintech start-ups springing up in the city.

But he added that problems remain.  Hiring is still a challenge. [There is a] lack of talent, the talent pool is so small,  Mr Haryono said.  If you have money, yes you can hire, but if you have to compete with the likes of Go-Jek on hiring, it is difficult. 

This issue is  not easy to fix overnight , said Shekhar Chauhan, principal at AT Kearney. According to the consultancy, Indonesia produces only 278 engineers per 1m people each year, far behind regional peers like Malaysia or Thailand, which produce well over a thousand.

 One of the recommendations we had was facilitating, getting in more foreign talent, which is another issue in Indonesia,  Mr Chauhan said. Indonesia is wary of bringing in skilled foreign labour, as it may hamper job opportunities for its young workforce.

The combination of large amounts of money chasing start-ups without enough talent is raising some concern among investors, he added.

 That is where they might hit roadblocks,  Mr Chauhan said.

Bangkok

Number of tech start-ups

750 in Thailand

Government support

Three acts under consideration could lower barriers to start-ups, including by removing foreign ownership caps; Thailand 4.0 initiative aims to shift country to tech-oriented, knowledge economy

Education/talent pool

Mahidol University and Chulalongkorn University, both in Top 60 on QS Asia University Ranking 2018

Access to funding

Thai corporations and state-owned enterprises have launched several venture capital firms and accelerator programmes; The Stock Exchange of Thailand in May launched a crowdfunding platform for start-ups and small and midsize enterprises; foreign investment also on the rise

Transportation

Served by two international airports; well-developed transportation infrastructure within city

Office rent

1,186 baht ($36.36) per sq m per month for prime space, according to CBRE Research

The charms of Bangkok that have long attracted holiday-goers are increasingly appealing to multinational entrepreneurs wanting to set up shop in Asia. Developed infrastructure, good access to neighbouring markets, affordable prices and sunny weather are only a handful of the reasons why start-ups are sprouting in the Thai capital.

German-born Michael Cluzel, co-founder and group chief executive of restaurant booking app operator Eatigo, chose Bangkok for its headquarters and the app s debut market because of its high mobile internet penetration rate and less competitive environment compared with advanced western economies.

Eatigo offers diners time-based discounts   deals are better during off-peak hours   so that eateries can fill up their empty tables. Mr Cluzel got the idea from how aeroplanes and hotels change their rates depending on availability.

 Nobody in the world had ever done such an app for restaurants before so we needed to invent a new playbook,  Mr Cluzel told the Nikkei Asian Review.  We didn t want to do it through a looking glass in New York or San Francisco   we wanted to be in a market where we can learn, and Asia was just right. 

Bangkok was a good fit for Eatigo, with its population of 8.2m, rising middle class, few restaurant app rivals, strong dining culture and   perhaps above all   discount-loving consumers.

Mr Cluzel and his three co-founders also saw Bangkok as a springboard to other Asian markets.

 If it works here, we thought it is going to work in Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta,  he said, citing similarities such as the culture of dining out and expanding middle-income consumers.

After launching in Bangkok in 2014, the app is now in six countries, including in competitive markets like Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, Singapore and Hong Kong   and has grabbed the leading share in many of them.

Multinational start-ups like Eatigo are not unusual in Bangkok. Japanese entrepreneur Yojiro Koshi picked Bangkok as the base for TalentEx, which offers human resource-related services, in part because he liked its mix of urban development and liveability.

 Bangkok was liveable for my family, compared to Singapore, which would be too expensive, or Jakarta, which still lacks a lot of basic infrastructure like public transportation,  he said. Bangkok also has a large base of Japanese corporations that could be his potential clients.

Rising government support is set to draw more start-ups to Thailand, especially Bangkok. The military junta has positioned start-ups as a crucial player in its  Thailand 4.0  policy, which aims to shift the nation s industries from labour-intensive to tech-oriented and knowledge-based.

One obstacle facing entrepreneurs launching a start-up in Thailand is the 49 per cent foreign ownership cap, which restricts them from receiving funds from foreign venture capital firms, and a range of business fields that are off-limits to foreigners unless they have a Thai co-founder.

But three government policies   the Thailand Startup Act, Regulatory Sandbox Act and Thai Bayh-Dole Act   are in the works that could ease some of these restrictions. A clause in the draft of the Thailand Startup Act, for example, would allow start-ups to be 100 per cent foreign-owned. The new rules are expected to be enacted before the next general election, which could come as early as February 2019.

Funding opportunities are growing, too. Thai start-ups raised at least $100m in 2017, a more than tenfold increase from 2013, according to start-up website Techsauce. Thai corporations and state-owned enterprises have launched a slew of venture capital firms and accelerator programmes in the past year or two. And in May, the Stock Exchange of Thailand launched a crowdfunding platform for start-ups and small and midsize enterprises to source funding from institutional investors and venture capital firms.

Foreign capital is also flowing in. In late 2017, Bangkok-based online fashion brand Pomelo Fashion raised $19m in a series B round led by Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com and Indonesian investment firm Provident Capital Partners. Japan s leading online fashion company Start Today (since renamed Zozo) also joined the round. It was reportedly the largest series B fundraising in Thailand at that time.

 Our investors have created so many new opportunities for our Thai company,  said David Jou, the Korean-American co-founder of Pomelo. The fast-fashion brand focuses primarily on Asian markets. Its designers are all hired locally to fit local tastes, and their price points are about half those of western fashion brands like Zara and H&M.

JD has listed Pomelo s clothes on its websites in Thailand and Indonesia and might pave the way for Pomelo to venture into the Chinese market, Mr Jou said. The fact that it is a Thai company might help: Thailand is the No. 1 destination for Chinese travellers, and its food is popular in China.

 Being a Thai company,  Mr Jou said,  is an opportunity for us.

Penang

Number of tech start-ups

More than 900 in Malaysia

Government support

Tax holidays for up to 10 years for qualifying start-ups under government programmes aimed at promoting technology companies; angel investors can receive a tax deduction of up to 500,000 ringgit ($120,000) in their third year

Education/talent pool

Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre, a federal initiative, runs its own academy offering short-term courses for school leavers and working adults; courses range from app development to augmented reality

Access to funding

State-owned Cradle Fund gives grants of between 25,000 ringgit and 800,000 ringgit. Cradle Fund, through wholly owned subsidiary Cradle Seed Ventures, invests 1m to 3m ringgit in local start-ups

Transportation

Penang International Airport connects to major cities in south-east Asia; MaGIC provides travel and accommodation allowances for participants in its Global Accelerator Programme, an exchange meeting for start-ups in the region

Office rent

200-600 ringgit ($48-144) per month for co-working space at MaGIC centers

There is no doubt that Malaysia s most famous start-up is the one that got away. Two years after Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling launched the MyTeksi ride-hailing app in Malaysia, the company   by then renamed Grab   relocated its headquarters to neighbouring Singapore. Since that move in 2014, Grab has become a $10bn company and taken over Uber s south-east Asia business.

But Ashran Ghazi, who runs the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre, or MaGIC, says he is not dwelling on the past. His agency, which was set up in 2014 to raise the country s next generation of entrepreneurs, is focused on building  awesome companies , he said. Keeping successful start-ups in Malaysia is not a primary consideration, he added.

There is no shortage of entrepreneurs in the country, many of whom are congregating in the northern island of Penang. Among them is Ai Ching Goh, who gave up her marketing job at Procter & Gamble to establish Piktochart, a visual communications app that makes it easier for nondesigners to create infographics. Founded in 2012 Piktochart boasts more than 13m registered users   about half of whom are in North America.

 We are not just a design-tool app per se but one that allows users to tell a better story through charts,  said 32-year-old Ms Goh, who has about 60 employees representing 15 nationalities.

The company s app is aimed at anyone from students to small and midsize businesses.

Penang has long been home to multinational companies, including chipmaking giant Intel, which fostered a strong engineering workforce. The state government is pushing harder to encourage entrepreneurship, a job that should be easier since the national elections in May. Penang was under opposition rule for a decade, which meant it received little aid for development from the federal government.

 It is pivotal to show that it s possible for a company based in Penang to become a global company,  said Howie Chang of aCAT, an agency launched in 2015 to promote entrepreneurship.

Among Penang s homegrown engineers is 26-year-old Jin Xi Cheong, who left Intel to start Poladrone, a drone start-up that launched in 2016 with guidance from aCat.

The company uses drones to take high-resolution photographs for technical analysis in the agriculture and oil and gas sectors. Now based near Kuala Lumpur, Poladrone counts Malaysia s leading palm oil companies like Sime Darby Plantation as its customers. Its services include measuring tree density for fertiliser forecasts and disease detection   jobs that had to be done manually before.

Plantation owners in neighbouring Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam have knocked on Poladrone s door for solutions, said Mr Cheong, who added that he was considering expanding abroad.

Another Penang start-up is EasyParcel, an online parcel delivery operator that has tied up with more than 10 couriers, including DHL and FedEx. After four years in operation, EasyParcel has over 400,000 users in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, earning a margin from the bulk discount provided by the couriers.

Most of these start-ups share a common feature: government support of some kind, especially funding. The Cradle Fund is one of the government agencies that has been nurturing start-ups since 2003, disbursing grants of between 25,000 ringgit ($6,012) and 800,000 ringgit.

The fund, which has backed over 700 tech-based start-ups, has also become a source of venture capital. With a targeted investment size of between 1m ringgit and 3m ringgit per company, its wholly owned unit Cradle Seed Ventures takes minority equity stakes of not more than 25 per cent in companies that are involved in mobile technology, software and enterprise solutions, and hardware engineering.

To keep up with global trends, the fund is on the lookout for companies active in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.

Dzuleira Abu Bakar, Cradle Seed Ventures chief executive, however, says the idea is not simply to copy other markets.

 I believe each country moves at its own pace given the market dynamics, readiness of talent, infrastructure and other economic variables   not so much the catch-up game but more of moving in the direction of where technology trends are headed towards.

Ho Chi Minh City

Number of tech start-ups

About 3,000 in Vietnam

Government support

Tax incentives, favourable land leasing terms, training programmes; government plans to launch $85m start-up fund this year; many local government-related bodies and companies have also launched funds, platforms to support start-ups

Education/talent pool

Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, a member college of Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, is known for its technology, engineering and business management programmes

Availability of funding

About 70 venture capital funds operating in Vietnam, more than two-thirds from overseas; these include CyberAgent Ventures, Incubate Fund, SoftBank Capital, Crystal Horse Investments, Asia Venture Group

Transportation

Ho Chi Minh City is served by Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Vietnam s largest airport; city s first metro line scheduled to open in 2020 to relieve heavy traffic congestion

Office rent

$50 per sq m per month for Grade A space as of second quarter, according to JLL

When ecommerce platform Sendo raised $50m this year from SoftBank and other foreign investors, it was a reflection of two trends in Vietnam: booming online sales and rising interest in one of Asia s fastest-growing economies.

As an ecommerce platform for individuals and small businesses to sell their goods, Sendo has benefited from strong annual online sales growth of 30 per cent in Vietnam in recent years. That high growth rate is expected to continue at least through 2020, according to the Vietnam E-Commerce Association.

Nguyen Dac Viet Dung, Sendo s chairman, says he plans to raise more money to keep growing.  We [will] seek one or two more rounds of fundraising in the next five years,  he told Nikkei in a recent interview.

Vietnam s start-up environment is less well-developed than regional rivals like Singapore or Indonesia, but the central government is aiming to change that. It has set up three main high-tech parks in Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City, and it is creating incentives for the development of new high-tech businesses   including the planned launch of an $85m start-up fund this year.

Ho Chi Minh City has kicked off construction of an incubator for local tech start-ups inside the Saigon Hi-Tech Park, already home to tech giants such as Intel and Samsung. The facility will cover an area of more than 11,000 sq m, and officials say the city has spent $90m on start-up and innovation programmes there in the past two years.

Vietnam does not keep statistics on start-ups, but pan-Asia consultancy Dezan Shira & Associates says $290m was invested in 92 Vietnamese start-ups in 2017. According to tech news site Techsauce, there were about 3,000 start-ups operating in the country last year.

Investment is coming from inside and outside Vietnam. Tiki, another ecommerce platform, raised $54m from China s JD.com this year, following $17m from internet company VNG in 2016 and an undisclosed amount from CyberAgent Ventures, Seedcom and Sumitomo. Momo, an e-wallet and payments app, received $28m from Standard Chartered Private Equity and Goldman Sachs in 2016.

IDG Ventures Vietnam was the first venture capital firm to focus on technology start-ups in the country when it launched in 2004. The fund manages $100m and has invested in some 40 start-ups in the fields of technology, media and consumer industries. This year VinaCapital, an investment fund that manages $1.8bn in assets, launched the $100m VinaCapital Ventures VC fund, one of the biggest local funds for start-ups. In all, there are some 70 venture capital funds operating in Vietnam, more than two-thirds of them from overseas.

Much of the tech start-up activity in Vietnam centres on blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies   despite the fact that the country has yet to craft a regulatory framework for those industries following a series of scandals.

In April, Vietnam was at the centre of the biggest fraud in cryptocurrency history, where investors said they lost as much as $660m through scams linked to initial coin offerings. The government has since taken a hard line on the industry.

But many companies remain bullish on the opportunity for blockchain-related businesses in Vietnam   including Nami Corp. The company is developing AI and blockchain technologies for its financial investment ecosystem and products for managing financial services.

 Vietnam lacks a legal framework for crypto and related technologies, which means people are often confused when we talk about bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain,  said Giap Van Dai, the 27-year-old co-founder of Nami.  It should take four or five more years before the blockchain technique can be applied in local business communities, since it will take time for the market to accept it and for authorities to come up with related regulations. 

According to Mr Dai, the blockchain industry in Vietnam employs about 2,000 people, up from 30 in 2017. Many of them graduated overseas and gained experience developing apps, financial services and other products in developed countries, including in the US, Japan and Singapore.

 Young people are enthusiastic to learn and work in the new industry,  Mr Dai said.

Good day. And welcome back from the weekend, where millions of people of various ages put in some serious time in front of video games. Those masses helped "Fortnite" creator Epic Games Inc. command a nearly $15 billion valuation the subject of two stories today.

In other games, the Boston Red Sox took care of, well, business by taking Game 5 to clinch the World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Which means a bit more swagger for the Massachusetts tech scene.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Quick turnaround: David Sacks is already raising a second fund for his firm Craft Ventures, having invested most of his $350 million debut fund after a little more than a year, according to people familiar with the situation. The second fund, targeting up to $500 million, will focus on leading Series A rounds, one of the people said. It will continue to invest in the equity of blockchain companies, but will no longer buy cryptocurrencies, which underperformed. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the exclusive.

Epic valuation: Epic Games Inc., the creator of the smash-hit videogame "Fortnite," is valued at almost $15 billion as part of a major new investment round, according to people familiar with the matter. The company Friday said it received an investment of about $1.25 billion. At least some of the investment came from sales of shares by existing holders, the people said. The new investors included KKR, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well aXiomatic, which owns the competitive-videogaming organization Team Liquid. WSJ's Sarah Needleman and WSJ Pro's Katie Roof have more.

Lung deal: Galecto Biotech AB said it has raised  79 million ($90 million) to develop an alternative to the first two drugs approved for the serious lung disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Galecto's drug is inhaled, which concentrates the treatment in the lungs and limits exposure around the body. That could make it safer than existing competitors, according to the Danish company. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Roof's Take: On the High Price of Fun and Gaming

By Katie Roof

The competition to get a piece of the top gaming startups is fierce right now, with some investors agreeing to lofty prices to win deals.

We saw that with "Fortnite"-maker Epic Games Inc., which announced a $1.25 billion new investment round on Friday. Venture firms including Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed invested at a nearly $15 billion valuation.

But even the most popular games can fade away as fads and get into trouble.

So why all the big bets on gaming?

Ethan Kurzweil, a partner at Bessemer and early investor in game-streaming platform Twitch before it sold to Amazon.com Inc., says investor skepticism may have actually helped some businesses.

More in Roof's Take.

Exits

Shares of Gamida Cell Ltd. closed Friday at $8.44 apiece, up 5.5% from their initial public offering price. The Jerusalem-based developer of cell therapies sold 6.25 million shares at $8 apiece in the IPO.

Chinese banks start scanning borrowers  facial ticks

Ping An technology designed to help vet potentially fraudulent borrowers

Chinese banks have started using micro-expression technology in an effort to spot the early signs of fraud in customers  facial movements.

The banks are worried that some potential customers may be lying about the uses of loans, so they have developed systems that use smartphone cameras to detect minute facial expressions and indicate when a user is being economical with the truth.

Chinese banks are among the first in the world to use the technology commercially. Ping An, the financial services conglomerate, has developed the technology and is using it in its lending businesses. Western groups have so far shied away from the technology because of concerns about its reliability and the ethics of using it.

Ping An s technology can identify 54 brief, involuntary micro-expressions, which the face often creates before the brain has a chance to control facial movements. They include eyeballs moving back and forth and rapid blinking, and often take place in only 1/15 to 1/25 of a second.

Lee Yuansiong, one of Ping An s deputy chief executives, said:  We use micro expression recognition technology to review loan applications. It captures subtle changes in customers  facial expressions which help to identify and warn against fraud risks. 

He added:  We ve reduced credit losses by 60 per cent using this technology. It is more accurate than other approaches to fraud detection. 

The company does not use micro-expressions alone to decide whether or not to lend money. However, if the technology spots something amiss, the client will be flagged for extra investigation. Ping An is not the only company experimenting with the technology.

Kee Sun-Tuan, chief information officer in China at Standard Chartered, said:  Micro-expression technology acts like a lie-detector, using the camera in a phone to check people s responses to questions and scan their facial movements. 

One of the advantages of the system is that it allows banks to remotely assess lending risk. That means they can start lending in places where they do not necessarily have a physical presence.

That is not so much of an issue for Ping An, which has 1.4m insurance agents across China. But StanChart s Chinese network has only slightly more than 100 outlets.

 We are testing this technology which, as one of the tools for due diligence, could potentially allow us to serve a wider group of clients through remote lending, without the need for an extensive physical branch network,  added Mr Kee.

Not everyone is a fan of the new technology though. Husayn Kassai, co-founder of facial recognition company Onfido, said academic studies had  not always yielded consistent results  on whether micro-expression systems were a reliable indicator of deception.

 Besides, even if the feasibility is proven through research, there are serious ethical questions around such a use case,  said Mr Kassai.  For instance, such a system would probably need to be used without the user s awareness in order to capture natural micro-expressions which raises questions around a user s informed consent. 

There are questions over the consequences of turning down a loan application on the basis of a false positive from the technology, he said, adding that it would be hard to explain under Europe s new general data protection regulation.

Ping An has made investment in technology a priority, putting 1 per cent of its annual revenues into research and development. That adds up to Rmb50bn ($7.2bn) over the past decade. The group employs 23,000 R&D personnel and 500 big data experts.

 A lot of data is shared within Ping An, with the customers  permission,  said Mr Lee.  We use big data to guide our product development, service strategy, underwriting and risk selection.

China sees explosive growth of billionaires

Rich Chinese entrepreneurs are joining the global billionaires club at the rate of two a week, driving a record $1.4tn annual increase in the collective wealth of the world s most exclusive tribe to an all-time high of $8.9tn.

Just 30 years after China allowed private enterprise, the country s billionaires now number 373 and account for almost one in five of the global total of 2,158, according to an annual survey compiled by UBS, the world s largest wealth manager, and PwC, the professional services provider.

 China has overtaken the US as the place where exceptional wealth is created at the fastest rate. China s vast population, technology innovation and productivity growth, combined with government support, are providing unprecedented opportunities for individuals to build businesses,  said Josef Stadler, head of ultra high net worth at UBS s wealth management unit.

The explosive growth of the Chinese billionaire class is contributing to rising inequality across the country, an issue of mounting concern to policymakers in Beijing.

The 19th national congress of the Communist party, held in October 2017, identified the building of a  moderately prosperous society  as a goal, implying a recognition of the need to spread the benefits of China s growing economic wealth more fairly.

Virtually all of China s billionaires, who saw their combined wealth surge 39 per cent last year to $1.2tn, have made their own fortunes even though many of the early successful entrepreneurs had little formal education.

Technology entrepreneurs building businesses in the internet, ecommerce, biotechnology and artificial intelligence sectors are now contributing a growing number to the new entrants to China s billionaires cohort.

Stock market flotations have helped the founders of companies to crystallise huge gains, with many of the initial public offerings on the country s stock markets in 2017 commanding high valuations.

Wang Jian, a former research fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle, became an overnight billionaire when BGI Genomics floated on the Shenzhen exchange in July 2017. Mr Wang owns a 32.5 per cent stake in BGI, which saw its market capitalisation surge from $1.2bn at the time of the IPO to a peak of about $16bn in November before dropping to about $2.9bn this week.

A total of 631 new companies floated on stock exchanges across the greater China region in 2017, raising a total of $52bn, according to PwC.

The explosive growth of the Chinese billionaires class is contributing to rising inequality across the country, an issue of mounting concern to policymakers in Beijing.

The most recent national congress of the ruling Communist party, held in October 2017, identified the building of a "moderately prosperous society" as a goal, implying a recognition of the need to spread the benefits of China's growing economic wealth more fairly.

In the US, membership of the billionaires club reached 585 after gaining 22 net new joiners, helping to swell their combined wealth by 12 per cent to $3.1tn.

Mr Stadler said growth in the US was far slower than five years ago, possibly due in part to pressures on hedge fund managers where both fees and performance have deteriorated.

 We are also witnessing the rise of  stealth wealth  where the tendency to keep businesses in private ownership for longer before a listing on the public market means that wealth creation is under-reported in the US and also in Europe,  said Mr Stadler.

Seventeen new billionaires were minted in Europe, taking its ultra-rich population to 414. The combined wealth of Europe s billionaires rose 19 per cent to $1.9tn, partly reflecting the substantial appreciation in the value of the euro against the dollar last year.

Good day. The health-care system is at risk. It isn't only from soaring prices and political wrangling; its exposure to hackers and other bad cyber-actors is a growing concern, as evidenced by a recent breach of a government portal used by health insurers and brokers. Brian Gormley's Take today focuses on that vulnerability and the startups seeking to address it.

Heading into the weekend, the World Series features two teams from the rival startup hubs of California and Massachusetts. So far the Boston Red Sox seem in control, with a 2-games-to-none advantage over the L.A. Dodgers. Bragging rights for the tech world are at stake...

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Rent-to-buy: Expedia Group Inc. has bought two startups that help multifamily property owners manage short-term rentals as the online travel company looks to expand accommodation options and capture share from firms like Airbnb Inc. Expedia said it acquired San Francisco-based Pillow, which helps long-term tenants rent their residences for short stays. Pillow's investors included Mayfield Fund, Sterling Equity, Peak Capital Partners, Expansion VC and Veritas Investments. Expedia also bought Chicago-based ApartmentJet, which enables multifamily owners and operators to rent vacant units. ApartmentJet's backers included Network Ventures and BlueTree Venture Fund. WSJ's Aisha Al-Muslim has more.

Ad-free news: A startup that aims to sell subscriptions to an ad-free online news bundle is adding staff ahead of its anticipated launch in the first quarter of next year. To fund the push, Scroll has raised $7 million in second-round funding, said Tony Haile, the company's founder and chief executive. Mr. Haile hopes to convince publishers and news consumers to embrace his vision of a fast-loading, ad-free news experience for $5 a month. WSJ's Benjamin Mullin has more.

Gormley's Take: Cybersecurity Focus Turns to Health Care

By Brian Gormley

A recent HealthCare.gov data breach highlights the value that hackers place on medical information and the opportunity for companies with technology to thwart these attacks.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last week said hackers breached a HealthCare.gov portal that agents and brokers use to assist consumers seeking health insurance. Digitally connected medical devices can also be hacked.

Awareness of health-data security is increasing, but startups still have to spell out their value proposition to medical organizations, which have many legacy IT tools and must be convinced of the business case for buying the latest technology, said Sean Cunningham, a managing director at cybersecurity investor ForgePoint Capital.

Kang's Take: Capitalizing on Merger Magic

Private equity is increasingly hoping that one plus one will equal three.

More private-equity firms are buying two midsize companies simultaneously with the goal of combining them, a tactic they hope will generate stronger returns as they continue to face rising valuations and a shortage of assets.

Indeed, the strategy has become more common for firms in the past few years. Thoma Bravo, for instance, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thoma-bravo-to-merge-runzheimer-motus-1516220498?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" mileage-tracking software makers Runzheimer International Ltd. and Motus LLC earlier this year. In 2017, Centerbridge Partners"https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-sells-syncsort-and-vision-solutions-to-centerbridge-partners-1499338800?mod=article_inline"analytics companies Syncsort Inc. and Vision Solutions Inc. from Clearlake Capital Group. Bain Capital, meanwhile, combined utility businesses Big Tex Trailers Inc. and American Trailer Works Inc. the year before that.

While firms have occasionally pursued this combination strategy, investors particularly larger-cap sponsors increasingly are thinking about the benefits of doing such combination deals, said Mike Lindemann, a managing director at midmarket-focused investment bank Robert W. Baird & Co.

"Valuations have certainly gone up in the last couple of years. There's a dearth of targets and investments for larger sponsors within their core size range," said Mr. Lindemann, who typically advises on transactions ranging from $100 million to $3 billion.

Upper midmarket investors, for instance, will consider buying the No. 2 and No. 3 players in a niche category of a broader industry where there tends to be less regulatory risk, Mr. Lindemann said.

Firms are betting that adding two smaller businesses won't only result in an entity that is just as big as or bigger than the No. 1 player, but also create synergies with their existing infrastructure and customers. By combining peers early on, private-equity firms also are hoping they'll have enough time to work through any operational kinks and ultimately generate higher returns.

Such transactions are taking place as private-equity firms go lower in the market to deploy capital. In the continuing sellers' market, investors are finding a flurry of similar businesses testing the water. This wave of combo deals is likely to continue, particularly against the backdrop of record-high amounts of capital being raised by private equity.

Still, the marriage of two peers often requires much more work than do add-on acquisitions. Investors must be ready to roll up their sleeves to cut costs and further build the combined entity's presence, as they search for potential avenues of growth. Certainly, the benefits of such deals could be huge, but the risks could be even bigger making it hard to get a positive number out of one plus one.

Intel's Venture Arm Lays Off One Quarter of Investment Team; Firm seeks to make a smaller number of larger deals more closely related to Intel's core business

Intel Capital, the venture arm of semiconductor giant Intel Corp., has laid off one quarter of its 60-person investment team, as the firm moves to making a smaller number of larger deals more closely related to its parent company's core business.

The shift reflects the challenges corporate venture arms of large companies face in keeping up with rapid changes in the venture industry as corporate priorities shift over time.

Intel Capital, with active investments in more than 300 companies, has been one of Silicon Valley's most prolific corporate venture firms, investing broadly in areas including software, internet, drones, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles.

The firm, however, has been moving over the past few years toward backing a smaller number of deals with larger checks, and that has led to a decision in August to reduce staffing.

Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, said it didn't make sense to have 60 investment professionals aiming to make 30 deals a year, which is about half the number of deals the firm did annually in the years before he was put in charge in 2015. He added that the decision was "gut-wrenching" but was necessary to support the new focus and to add the most value for its portfolio companies.

"There's deal creep where you want to do more than 30 deals a year," Mr. Brooks said. "It finally dawned on me that we had a structural problem."

So far this year, Intel Capital has invested in 31 new companies and 41 follow-on deals, investing a total of $252 million, according to the company.

The changes come as the firm's corporate parent is undergoing a search for a new chief executive following "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-resigns-after-violating-company-policy-1529586884"in June. Mr. Brooks said his unit's new strategy has the support of top Intel Corp. management.

As part of the changes, Mr. Brooks said he is reinstating a compensation policy resembling the way traditional venture firms pay its investors carried interest, or a percentage of the profits, when a portfolio company is sold or goes public. Intel did away with carry for its investment staff shortly before he became president of Intel Capital, he said.

The firm also will no longer do seed-stage deals, but will still do venture deals at the Series A, B, and C stages with the aim of investing about $400 million a year.

Since Mr. Brooks joined Intel Capital, the firm also has moved to focus more on strategic investments in startups that are directly relevant to Intel's chip business rather than its previously broader mix of deals.

Mr. Brooks said the firm will still invest across a variety of areas including artificial intelligence, cloud computing and the Internet of Things, but it intends to stop investing in sectors such as e-commerce and related areas.

"We got together in August and very thoroughly decided which domains we want to focus on and which we can add value to relative to the rest of Intel's domain expertise," Mr. Brooks said.

One of the investors departing is Christine Herron, an early-stage investor who was also co-lead of Intel Capital's Diversity Initiative, formerly known as the Diversity Fund, a program that backs founders who are women or minorities, as well as those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, disabled or veterans. Ms. Herron, who had been at the firm eight years, declined to comment. Mr. Brooks said Intel Capital will continue operating the Diversity Initiative program.

Since 1991, Intel Capital has invested more than $12 billion in more than 1,500 companies globally.

Singapore s Grab launches prepaid card with Mastercard

New product expected to provide valuable insight into south-east Asian consumers

Grab, the south-east Asian ride-hailing company, has partnered with Mastercard to launch prepaid cards, in a move that will give both parties valuable consumer insight in one of the world s most financially excluded regions.

The two companies aim to launch both virtual and physical versions of the prepaid cards in the first half of 2019, starting in Singapore, Grab s home market, and the Philippines, with the intention of rolling out the service across the region.

The cards will give Grab and Mastercard significant insight into consumer trends in a region where 200m people are expected to enter the middle class by 2030.

Grab, which was set up in 2012 and is currently valued at $11bn, is moving aggressively into sectors beyond ride-hailing, such as healthcare, food delivery and mobile payments, helping to cement its dominant position in the region at a time when rivals, including Indonesia s Go-Jek, accelerate their own expansions.

Reuben Lai, senior managing director at Grab s financial arm, said the new product would help Grab create products and services tailored to the needs of consumers and merchants, and price them effectively.

Rama Sridhar, executive vice-president for digital and emerging partnerships and new payment flows at Mastercard, said pairing Grab s existing insight into consumer behaviour with the US company s data analytics and experience with financial institutions would help  create lending products, which is what most regulators are hoping for across south-east Asia .

Partnering with Grab gives Mastercard access to a region where credit card use has historically been low. According to Boston Consulting Group, there are 177 credit cards for every 100 people in the US, compared with 29 per 100 in Thailand and 5 per 100 in Vietnam.

 It helps us leverage Grab as a partner to tap into a huge demographic that was perhaps underserved until now,  said Ms Sridhar.

However, BCG said last month that in south-east Asia, where small businesses tend to prefer cash on delivery over credit cards, consumers are likely to  leap directly from cash to digital payments, skipping credit and debit cards .

Asked who Grab s competitors would be in prepaid cards, Mr Lai said:  Seventy per cent [of south-east Asians] are unbanked. Ninety per cent don t have a card. Who is our competitor? Cash or digital wallets?

Biotech startup XtalPi Inc. has closed its second financing this year, nabbing $46 million to boost its ability to help drugmakers be more efficient.

XtalPi uses artificial intelligence, quantum physics and cloud computing to aid pharmaceutical researchers. The company, which disclosed a $15 million Series B round in January, says it now has raised a total of $66 million including this Series B-1 extension.

XtalPi says it can help pharmaceutical scientists predict which drug compounds have desirable qualities. This helps them make better decisions about which to develop, said spokeswoman Ruyu Wang.

The company already can predict certain physical and chemical characteristics of drug molecules. It expects to gain the ability to predict more of these characteristics with the help of this financing, according to Ms. Wang.

XtalPi, based in Cambridge, Mass., in May said it had joined with Pfizer Inc. to develop a software platform for molecular modeling of small-molecule drugs. XtalPi hasn't revealed names of other drugmakers it is working with, Ms. Wang said.

China Life Healthcare Fund led this new financing, which also included SIG and Yael Capital. Investors in the original Series B included Google, Sequoia China and Tencent.

Silicon Roundabout trumps Silicon Valley

In fintech at least, Shoreditch is stealing a march over San Francisco

Silicon Valley has long dwarfed London s Silicon Roundabout as the number one global tech hub. But new evidence shows that in the fintech space at least, Shoreditch is stealing a march over San Fran.

UK newbies   ie firms set up after 2005   now account for an  eye popping  63 per cent of the UK'sfinancial servicescompanies and 14 per cent of the region's $206bn banking and payments revenues, according to a new report by consultancy Accenture.

The ascendancy of the British upstarts far outstrips their progress in the US, where firms created after 2005 make up just 19 per cent of the financial services market and have won just 3.5 per cent of the $1.04tn pool of banking and payments revenues.

Accenture, which analysed more than 20,000 banking and payments companies globally for the report, cites several explanations for why start-ups are having a better time of it in the UK.

Firstly, post-crisis regulations in the US lifted the bar for new entrants seeking a banking licence there   to the benefit of large incumbents. The Accenture analysis found that more than half of current accounts opened in the US in 2017 were captured by the biggest three banks, who are all spending big on digital development.

Meanwhile US regional banks are focused on  cost reduction and struggling to grow their balance sheets . This means they have ceded some ground to up-and-coming groups such as Stripe, the San Francisco-based private payments company that was valued at a plump $20bn after its latest investment round.

In the UK, the regulatory landscape is helping the smallest players take on the old guard. In 2010, the UK s Financial Conduct Authority granted Metro a full banking licence   marking the first new UKbank to be licensed in 150 years. Now 15 fintechs, including Monzo, Atom Bank and Starling, hold full banking licences.

Industry insiders say broader support from regulators has also been keyin nurturing fintechs. TheFCA launched a  sandbox in 2016that gives companies temporary approval to try out new products, reducing the time and cost of getting them to market, and allowing them to raise funding more easily.

Close to 100 firms have been accepted into the sandbox since its birth. In the US, regulators have been more cautious, with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau only announcing plans for a sandbox in July this year, for example.

The FCA has alsopushed aheadwith the early adoption of the EU s  open banking  rules, which force big lenders to open up access to client data for fintechs, where permission has been granted.

Tristan Thomas, Monzo s head of marketing and community, said the rules have already meant some  are starting to compete [even] without a banking licence .

These include fintechs that are now  offering services such as budgeting and acting as a central hub for your services, by pulling together lots of bank accounts into one view , he said. The UK's Budexplicitly takes advantage of the open banking rules to deliver a service itdescribesas  part fintech app store, part financial marketplace, part search engine . Another venture,Emma, uses artificial intelligence technology to help you manage your spending.

Momentum in the space brings risks, of course. Let s not forget that several months ago, fast-growing pre-paid card operator Revolutrevealedthat it had discovered a spate of suspected money laundering on its systems and had to contact authorities, prompting concerns over its compliance processes.

Still,the future remains fairly bright and there is bounty on the horizons, including a775m pot of cash that the Royal Bank of Scotland is set to invest into the small banking sector next February, under orders from European regulators.

A pessimist could liken this to the dying man's rally, the final EU boost for UK fintechs before the hammer comes down on Brexit in March and untold disasters erupt. Fortunately, there are more optimists than pessimists in the fintech world.

Further fintech fascination

RIP ICOs?Remember Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)? They were all the rage in the first quarter, when you could scarcely move (at a fintech conference at least) without running into someone who was suitably smug about his or her share of the $6.9bn that was raised from issuing coinin the first three months of the year. April and May were pretty good months too, with another $3.7bn raised. Since then, not so much. In the following four months   ie June through September   less than $1.7bn was raised in ICO money, according to Token Data. Alphaville's Jemima Kelly explains how crytpo iskilling itself.

Peer-to-painChina s peer-to-peer lenders have warned their numbers will fall from around 1,500 to as few as 50 over the next year as regulators crack down on debt and risk in the $120bn industry. The clampdown has already prompted a wave of defaults, leading to protests from retail investors, while many executives in the industry have been barred by police from leaving the country. Separately, British peer-to-peer property lender Lendy appears to have come unstuck and appealed to the FCA for help, after almost two-thirds of its borrowers failed to repay their loans on time. More here.

Banking on blockchainFurther evidence that after years of talking about blockchain, big banks are finallydoing blockchain. NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, last week becamethe first bankto sign up toa new blockchain-based platform that aims to dramatically streamline the process around the3.5tn a year global syndicated loans market. Fusion LenderComm, whichwas developed by Finastra,R3and a consortium of banks, is expected to add others to its platform shortly.The news comes just weeks after JPMorgan Chase and its partners announced theexpansionof their blockchain-based interbank paymentsplatform, which is now banks' biggest live blockchain project.

Deutsche Bank has hired a top IT executive from the Bank of England as part of a wider plan to cut costs by ramping up the use of cloud technology.

The German lender said it had recruited Deeptasree  Dee  Mitra as head of cloud platforms for data solutions in its global transaction banking division, a newly created role. Deutsche hopes to cut IT costs by moving services and applications to the cloud, rather than running them on its own physical servers.

Ms Dee will  lead the implementation of GTB s strategy for leveraging the public cloud for advanced data analytics and [artificial intelligence],  wrote Thomas Nielsen, GTB s chief digital officer, in an email to the bank s staff seen by the Financial Times. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson confirmed the email s authenticity.

Deutsche s chief executive Christian Sewing has repeatedly stressed his desire to grow the bank s GTB division, which includes cash management, payments and trade finance for corporate clients. Last week the bank announced that Stefan Hoops, a close confidant of Mr Sewing, had replaced John Gibbons as head of GTB.

The division currently accounts for more than a quarter of Deutsche s investment banking revenue and generated top-line sales of  3.9bn in 2017.

Ms Mitra is GTB s second high-profile external hire in as many months. In September, Deutsche announced JPMorgan Chase s data specialist David Gleason would join as GTB s chief data officer, to better monetise the lender s vast store of client and transaction data.

Ms Mitra will be based in London and report to Mr Gleason and Mr Nielsen.

U.S.  Unbanked' Population Continues to Fall; More households have bank accounts thanks to strong economy, according to 2017 FDIC survey

The number of U.S. households without a bank account fell to 6.5% in 2017, according to a "https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2017/2017report.pdf", as the improved economy helped bring mainstream banking services to more people.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Tuesday the number of "unbanked" households reached its lowest level last year since the regulator began the biennial survey in 2009. The share of households without an account at a federally insured financial institution was down half a percentage point from 7% in 2015, which the FDIC said "can be explained almost entirely by improvements in the socioeconomic circumstances of U.S. households."

In 2017, the U.S. had 8.4 million unbanked households, or about 14.1 million adults, though the number has been falling since 2011. That year, 8.2% of U.S. households were unbanked.

Lower-income households and households that are less educated have higher rates of being unbanked and underbanked, the FDIC said. The regulator defines someone who is underbanked as a person who has an account at an insured firm but also uses financial services outside the traditional banking system, such as payday loans or check-cashing services.

In 2017, 18.7% of U.S. households were considered underbanked, the FDIC said, down from 19.9% in 2015.

The latest survey highlighted a rapid change in how households accessed banking services in the digital age. The proportion of households with bank accounts that used mobile banking in the previous 12 months soared to 40.4% in 2017, nearly double the level in 2013. Online banking was used by 63% of households.

Among those who used mobile banking, 35% checked balances or transactions, and 26.5% paid bills. Gaining in popularity are relatively new functions such as depositing checks electronically, which was embraced by 18% of households with bank accounts, up from 5.6% in 2013.

Despite consumers' expanded access to banking, one in five households, or 22.7 million, didn't use mainstream credit such as credit cards and mortgages in the prior year, which may have left them without a credit score. Meanwhile, 22.1% of households turned to nonbank firms providing such services as check cashing, remittances and payday loans, typically charging much higher fees than banks.

The FDIC estimates about a fifth of households likely have little or no credit history. Black and Hispanic households, or those headed by a person with disability, account for large chunks of this group. Fair Isaac Corp., the provider of the widely used FICO credit score, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-a-higher-credit-score-soon-your-cash-could-help-1540123200"next year that factors in how consumers manage money in their bank accounts.

"There are a number of firms who are looking to innovate in this space, and to use new data, new model and technique," said Keith Ernst, associate director for consumer research and examination analytics at the FDIC. "We do think that investments in that sort of technology have the potential to open up access to credit for more and more households."

Battle for Mexico's Oro Negro Heats Up as Creditors Attempt to Seize Oil Rigs; Company faces standoff with bondholders on oil rig

The battle for control over bankrupt Mexican oil-drilling company Oro Negro turned ugly over the weekend, as attorneys for the company's creditors, escorted by Mexican federal police officers, flew in helicopters to Oro Negro's five drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and attempted to seize control of them, setting up a tense standoff that continued Monday.

On Friday, a criminal court judge in Mexico City ruled the rigs must be handed over to the bondholders.

Mexico City prosecutors have been investigating Oro Negro, an embattled oil-services firm led Gonzalo Gil, the son of Mexico's former finance minister, for fraud, according to disclosures Oro Negro made in a New York bankruptcy court last week.

Ricardo Contreras, a lawyer representing the creditors group, on Sunday flew out over the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico with the police officers, attempting to enforce the judge's order. He managed to land on just one of the drilling platforms, known as Decus, after workers placed obstacles on the heliports of the others, according to videos of the incident and both sides' accounts.

"A criminal judge ordered restitution of the rigs and ordered federal authorities to assist in those orders. It's that simple," said Paul Leand, a New York investor who heads the ad hoc committee of Oro Negro bondholders, an oversight body. "At the end of the day, we have no interest in holding on to these rigs. What we're interested in is protecting and securing our collateral."

The dust-up is just the latest chapter in a yearslong fight between Oro Negro, its creditors and Petrleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, Mexico's massive state oil company, but illustrates how the 2014 collapse in oil prices continues to reverberate even today for some investors.

On the eve of Mexico's historic oil reform, which was signed into law in 2013, Oro Negro raised nearly $1 billion in debt and hundreds of millions in equities, leased five drilling rigs from Singapore, and rushed to join a handful of oil-services companies offering to lease maritime oil platforms known as jackup rigs to Pemex to help the oil giant increase crude oil production.

But the collapse in crude prices prompted Pemex to pull back, slashing the day rates it paid to contractors. Soon, Oro Negro couldn't make debt payments and filed for bankruptcy protection in Mexico last year.

As the situation began to sour, all three parties began exchanging legal broadsides. This year, Oro Negro filed a complaint under the North American Free Trade Agreement, alleging Pemex colluded with bondholders to put the driller out of business and hand over its assets to a competitor that had received preferential treatment through the downturn. Pemex and the bondholders deny any wrongdoing.

"The oil-field services sector has taken a major beating over the course of the downturn in prices, and specifically the offshore market has had a tough time," said Pablo Medina, an Houston-based analyst with research firm Welligence Energy Analytics. "A lot of the investments in that space were very ill-timed. Pemex's reduction of its drilling activities took a lot of companies like Oro Negro by surprise."

Oro Negro sought and won "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexicos-oro-negro-files-for-u-s-bankruptcy-court-protection-1524520211?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3"in the U.S. in April, defeating an objection from bondholders. Chapter 15 acts much like chapter 11, halting lawsuits and blocking creditors from seizing assets governed by U.S. law.

On Monday, Oro Negro filed a lawsuit asking Judge Shelley Chapman, the New York bankruptcy judge overseeing the Oro Negro case, for a cease-and-desist order preventing bondholders from taking over or otherwise interfering with the rigs. The lawsuit also is seeking payment for damages.

What happens next is unclear. As of Monday afternoon, Mr. Contreras, the lawyer for the bondholders, as well another individual, remained on the Decus oil rig, without contact with the company, and additional helicopters have been blocked from landing, according to the bondholder group.

The Take: PE Firms and the Case for Consolidation in the Shale Industry

By Luis Garcia

Activist investors are pushing shale oil-and-gas companies to merge, and private-equity firms eager to exit their portfolio companies have reason to urge them on.

Kimmeridge Energy Management Co., a private-equity firm that invests in oil-and-gas assets as well as in shares of public energy companies, has disclosed a nearly 10% stake in Resolute Energy Corp. and is pressing the company to combine with another oil-and-gas producer, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

More consolidation among shale companies also stands to create much needed exit opportunities for energy-focused private-equity firms, as larger and more profitable producers would be better positioned to buy private equity-backed assets. Read more in Garcia's Take.

Corporate, Military Leaders Look to AI to Stay Ahead of Hackers

By Kim S. Nash

ABOARD THE HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH -- Leaders of the U.K. Royal Navy and U.S. Navy agreed Monday to cooperate to develop cybersecurity and artificial intelligence capabilities. AI is steadily transforming cybersecurity, yet there are no established rules for how to apply AI or how to explain the decisions it makes, sometimes with humans removed from the process, military and corporate leaders warn.

The agreement is intended to bolster defense technology as cybersecurity threats intensify, said Commodore Ian Annett, assistant chief of staff for information warfare and CIO of the Royal Navy, who spoke at the Atlantic Future Forum on Monday aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth, a Royal Navy aircraft carrier anchored off New York Harbor.

Companies and military organizations should expect adversaries, including nation-states, to use AI technology against them, said Rear Adm. David Hahn, chief of Naval Research for the U.S. Navy, speaking at the forum.

Defensive and offensive cybersecurity tools to use aboard and launch from ships provide military leaders with more options to deal with adversaries, Rear Adm. Hahn said. "This ship is the platform."

State of the art vessel

The HMS Queen Elizabeth, which is the biggest ship in the Royal Navy, was built to accommodate the F-35B stealth fighter jet from Lockheed Martin Corp. The ship cost about 3 billion, or about $3.9 billion.

The vessel can carry up to 40 aircraft and was designed in part to store and analyze data for cyberwarfare efforts at sea, according to the Royal Navy. It is expected to enter service in 2020.

"The most important thing is we recognize we have to be a first mover," Rear Adm. Hahn said. "We have to move faster than competitors."

AI tools can help companies prepare for cyberattacks by, for instance, automating parts of exercises that repeatedly test corporate and military defenses. AI also can play a role in responding to attacks underway, when malicious code is spreading in a network faster than a network administrator or other staff member can stop it. Companies have developed processes and tools for detecting and responding to cybersecurity incidents. The next step is to anticipate them, said Sean Plankey, cyber intelligence advisor at BP America Inc.

Cracking Open the Algorithms

Attack simulations that use AI to analyze information about known attacks can help corporations and governments understand where and how hackers will strike, Mr. Plankey said in an interview on board the Queen Elizabeth. "You want to get in front with intelligence to characterize adversaries," he said. BP and Lockheed sponsored the Atlantic Future Forum with Amazon Web Services, BAE Systems PLC, BlackRock Inc., C5 Capital, CQS, Ineos and Raytheon Co.

Today, transparency isn't a given in military systems, said Chris C. Demchak, Rear Adm. Grace M. Hopper Professor of Cyber Security and director of the Cyber and Innovation Policy Institute at the U.S. Naval War College.

Defense contractors historically have kept much of their proprietary technology secret but that approach won't work as AI is woven through cyberattacks and the military will have to adjust algorithms to respond to changes in tactics from attackers, Dr. Demchak said at the forum.

"You get [AI systems] in black boxes and you're not allowed to break them open," she said. "If you don't have the ability to open them, you don't have the ability to correct for what the adversaries are doing."

Automation, AI Can Help Business Leaders Before and After Cyber Incidents

By Catherine Stupp

NEW YORK -- More than one year after FedEx Corp. was hit by the NotPetya attack, the company's chief information security officer sees the need for businesses to use automation when they respond to big, fast-spreading attacks.

Some of FedEx's computer systems shut down around the world when they were infected by the malware that spread across Europe in June 2017.

The attack, which cost FedEx $400 million in recovery expenses, taught the company's security team that automated cyber defense systems could detect fast-moving viruses much more quickly than humans are able to do.

"Use incidence response, maybe even use some of the advanced techniques such as machine learning and automated measures because human beings cannot respond in a matter of minutes if this kind of volume spreads," FedEx's Gene Sun said Monday, speaking during a panel discussion at the ONUG conference, an industry gathering focused on open infrastructure and standards.

"We always measure ourselves on the mean time to detect and mean time to respond. In those kind of events, minutes and seconds matter," he added.

The NotPetya malware hit Ukrainian accounting software company MeDoc and then moved into FedEx's computer systems, according to Mr. Sun.

"Tens of thousands of machines got bricked, it was within a few minutes worldwide," Mr. Sun said.

Letting code do human work

Some companies also look to artificial intelligence as a way to bolster the preventive measures they already use by making them faster and more efficient.

James Routh, chief security officer at Aetna Inc., said companies could benefit from automating red-teaming exercises, which simulate cyber attacks to test employee readiness but can be time-consuming for security teams to run.

"That's where a lot of the labor intensity comes from. So if you can do that, you can run red teams rapidly. If you do them quarterly, you can do them weekly. There's a lot of newer technology that allows us to create a lot of synthetic incidents," Mr. Routh said, speaking at the ONUG conference.

"The faster you can do that cycle and the more automation you can apply to it, the more often you can do it," he added.

Simulations can provide clear data to help make decisions about cybersecurity approaches, said Richard Warner, general manager of U.S. federal business at Improbable Worlds Ltd.

Improbable, a startup based in London, supplies simulation technology to game developers and companies and wants to work with U.S. defense contractors to simulate cybersecurity exercises for the military. The company, backed in part by SoftBank Group Corp., is a U.K. unicorn, valued at more than $1 billion.

"Too often, we make decisions without evidence and fail to understand the interconnectedness of systems," he said.

U.K. supermarket chain faces payouts over data breach. A British Court ruled Monday that retailer Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC, known as Morrisons, is liable for a data breach in which employees' personal data was posted online by a disgruntled staffer, the Associated Press reports. More than 5,500 employees sued the company after senior auditor Andrew Skelton publicly leaked information such as their names, addresses and bank details in 2014. Mr. Skelton was found guilty of fraud in 2015 and sentenced to jail for 8 years. Morrisons argued that it should not be liable because the former employee's actions were criminal and the company worked fast to get the employee data taken down. The chain said it would appeal to the Supreme Court.

Super Micro to review motherboards for spy chips. One of the largest suppliers of server motherboards said on Monday that it would review its hardware for malicious chips following allegations made in a recent Bloomberg Businessweek article, Reuters reports. According to the Bloomberg report, the Chinese government installed small chips into motherboards made by Super Micro Computer Inc., allowing Beijing to spy on a variety of large American technology firms, many of whom denied the allegations. "Despite the lack of any proof that a malicious hardware chip exists, we are undertaking a complicated and time-consuming review to further address the article," Super Micro wrote in a letter to customers.

AWS chief asks Bloomberg to retract chip story. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, called on Bloomberg to retract its story about spy chips being embedded into motherboards, following a similar request made last week by Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, CNBC reports. Mr. Jassy wrote in a tweet Monday that the Bloomberg report, which alleged that Super Micro hardware used by Apple and AWS was compromised by the Chinese government, offered no proof and was poorly reported. "Reporters got played or took liberties. Bloomberg should retract," he said.

Japan tells Facebook to improve data security. Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission asked Facebook Inc. to implement a number of data protection measures following security lapses that affected tens of millions of users this year, Reuters reports. The government commission requested that Facebook fully communicate security issues to users, increase surveillance of third-party applications on the social network and inform regulators of changes in security safeguards. The request comes weeks after a security breach at Facebook compromised the personal information of about 29 million people.

Gene-editing technology could potentially transform everything from human health to agriculture. First, however, scientists need help to make that happen.

Synthego Corp. is among several startups angling to be the go-to supplier of tools needed in Crispr-based experiments. Founded in 2012 by former SpaceX engineers, the company provides thousands of researchers with software and molecular materials like enzymes and synthetic RNA.

Now, with $110 million in new funding, the company plans to launch products that get researchers out of the lab and into clinical testing. Founders Fund led the round, which brings the Redwood City, Calif.-based company's total raised to date to $160 million. Existing investors 8VC and Menlo Ventures also contributed.

"A lot of gene-editing and cell therapies are moving into the clinical phase, and we want to be their enabler," said co-founder and Chief Executive Paul Dabrowski.

Synthego's platform was designed to help researchers cut their costs and speed up their work through automation and machine learning.

Clients from agriculture to biopharmaceuticals can use the platform to identify which cell lines or enzymes are needed for a particular experiment, then order synthetically engineered versions of those products.

Since launching its first products in 2016, Synthego said it has acquired thousands of customers including large corporations, startups and academic institutions. Thus far, its products are only approved for use in the research phase. Now, the company plans to build out a certified facility and product portfolio cleared for use in clinical studies.

To get to that point, Mr. Dabrowski said Synthego is working closely with its clinical partners to develop the next generation of the platform and product line. Stanford professor and physician Dr. Matthew Porteus, a cell therapy expert who is the scientific co-founder of Crispr Therapeutics AG, has joined Synthego's board.

Clearlake Capital Group agreed to acquire Vendor Credentialing Service LLC, a provider of health-care credentialing software that does business as symplr.

The deal values the company at approximately $550 million, said a person familiar with the situation.

The transaction is an exit for existing investors CapStreet Group, which invested in symplr in 2012, and Pamlico Capital, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0120151123ebbnksnzc?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" the company in 2015.

The acquisition by Clearlake was the result of an auction process run by William Blair & Co., which worked with symplr and its backers on the sale.

Symplr's software-as-a-service platform is focused on health-care governance, and risk-and-compliance services, including provider management, credentialing and payer enrollment. The Houston company provides its services to more than 1,500 customers, including physicians, hospitals and health-care vendors.

Another person familiar with the deal said the company has had strong organic growth, with more than 20% top line revenue growth year over year.

Clearlake is likely to use symplr as a platform for acquisitions, targeting companies in the credentialing space as well as those in adjacent areas such as patient safety and analytics, the person said.

Santa Monica, Calif.-based Clearlake makes investments in companies in the software and technology, energy and industrials, and food and consumer-services sectors. The firm in March said it raised more than $3.6 billion for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-raises-over-3-6-billion-for-its-latest-fund-1521194401?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2".

Earlier this month, the firm's portfolio company Perforce Software Inc. acquired Perfecto Mobile Ltd., a provider of cloud-based mobile and web application testing software.

Government puts effort into quest to make 20 unicorns by 2023

Start-ups Shinzo Abe has pledged to help double venture capital investment, says Leo Lewis

On October 15, four months after making history by raising $1.2bn in its initial public offering, Mercari was doing exactly what investors hoped it would. The company   which had already gained recognition for becoming Japan's first unicorn, defined as a start-up valued at over $1bn   was busily selling stuff on its app.

Items for sale on Mercari's e-commerce portal that day included a pink and blue pair of ecigarette starter kits, a pair of scuffed children's rain boots and an unopened tube of Yves Saint Laurent all-in-one foundation. Mundane, perhaps, but the site has created a trading forum that did not exist before and Japan has learnt, through Mercari, that the country is capable of producing a tech unicorn.

The question now, for investors, government and Japan's would-be unicorn breeders of the future, is whether it can produce more. For the government of prime minister Shinzo Abe, it is an especially potent issue. His administration wants to spur venture capital investment relative to gross domestic product to twice its current levels by 2022 and help create 20 unicorn start-ups by 2023. Achieving that goal will be a big challenge, say analysts at Mizuho Securities, who add that the pipeline of potential new unicorns is almost empty.

The venture capital market in Japan has historically been tiny and remains small despite recent increases. At the same time, the country cannot rely on existing corporates to re-allocate capital internally to create the next unicorn and spin it out.

Mercari's experience is not one that can be used as a template for other wannabe tech start-ups. The company is exceptional for a number of reasons, not least of which is that it already had a fully functioning business model before it began trading on Japan's Mothers market for start-ups. It had been able to develop before it came to market because its business required very little capital. Other companies are likely to need much more VC nurturing before they come to market, experts say. Many of the companies that list on Mothers, whose "wild west" reputation is beloved by retail investors, are so much less prepared that they have helped endow the market with its notorious volatility. Breakthroughs in biotech, AI or robotics tend to flash into the spotlight and then fail to materialise. Kabutan, a website for retail investors, tracks the investment themes and their daily cycle in and out of the market's attention. At the time of writing, the top slots were held by automated shop checkout technology, 5G and QR codes.

There are positive signs, however: "Compared to five years ago," says Kabutan analyst Hideyuki Okari, "investor interest in start-ups [is] very high."

But with the buzz of its unicorn trailblazing now worn off, Mercari's shares have followed a familiar pattern to other Mothers names: the shares surged 77 per cent on their opening day, but fell sharply immediately afterwards and have never recovered those highs. That decline comes against a background where Mothers itself is suffering one of its periodical crises of confidence. The index that tracks a basket of its representative stocks has fallen more than 40 per cent since June 2017.

The problem is that, while Japan's still fledgling VC market attempts to grow, the Mothers market is being forced to perform the function that venture capital would be doing elsewhere, but with much less patience. It may be a while before the gap is filled. According to Japan's Venture Enterprise Center, Japanese venture investment in fiscal 2017 amounted to 135.4bn ($1.2bn)   a significant 24 per cent increase from the previous year but still minuscule compared with the US or China.

As analysts at Morgan Stanley highlighted in a recent report. Japan's spending on research and development and venture capital may be increasing, but investment amounts are still small compared to international counterparts such as the US and China. They also say Japanese funding tends to be geared to final product manufacturing processes and components, an area where it is much harder to create unicorns. Nevertheless, the same analysts presented a research paper in September in which they named 100 Japanese companies, listed and unlisted, that are turning disruption and innovation into opportunities. "Life sciences and healthcare are the largest categories for [Japanese start-up] selections," said the report: "companies involved in AI, IoT, robotics and big data account for about a third."

Having set concrete targets, the government is now trying to speed things up. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry established the J-Start-up programme in June this year to help support promising young companies with its vision of creating 20 unicorns.

The top-down approach has not impressed some observers, who think the government may not be the best judge of where the next unicorns will come from. For example, a public-private sector forum is planned for launch later this year with the aim of making Japan the first country in the world to create flying cars. "This is probably not very realistic," Mizuho Securities chief strategist Masatoshi Kikuchi said in a research note.
