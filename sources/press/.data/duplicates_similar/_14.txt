AJAY AGARWAL, managing director, Bain Capital Ventures

What surprised you the most in 2016?

The resiliency of the [software-as-a-service] market. After some of the top names like LinkedIn [a Bain Capital Ventures investment] and Tableau saw their market caps cut in half in February, the best companies all roared back, followed up by some very strong back half of 2016 IPOs such as Twilio.

What do you think will be the biggest challenge your corner of the industry will face in 2017?

Way too many software companies got funded in 2013 to 2015, given easy access to capital and the lower time and cost required to start a company. As a result, every space is crowded with thousands of startups: [human resource] software, sales software, security software. A wave of consolidation needs to occur as the strongest players in each space build out true platforms and suites.

Will business-to-business investments yield solid returns despite the cloud investment frenzy and overheated valuations?

Yes we are still at low penetration percentages for cloud software overall and especially in specific verticals. Big segments of the economy such as logistics, supply chain and transportation have yet to fully leverage the power of cloud and machine learning. We are just getting started!

IPO Outlook Might Not Be All Rainbows and Unicorns; Investors will be watching how things go for Spotify and Dropbox

Here's the billion-dollar question: Will Wall Street discount Sand Hill's once-hot startups in initial public offerings?

For investors in billion-dollar "unicorn" startups companies facing cash burns and liquidity demands from all directions the question looms as pressure for some to go public runs high.

Spotify AB raised convertible debt in March, agreeing to terms that set the clock ticking on an IPO in return for the $1 billion in financing that enabled the $8.5 billion-valued company to take money without a valuation reset.

"It's not only huge, but it had some terms that they had to go public," said Matt Murphy, a managing director at Menlo Ventures.

About 151 companies are valued at a billion dollars or more, according to The Wall Street Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club, and many that raised late-stage funding in a frothy investing environment over the past several years now face cash concerns and potential lowered valuations.

Investors will be closely watching Spotify and other highly valued startups to move forward with IPOs for whether their share pricings come in below their last private financing prices. Many face this splash of cold water as a hangover sets in following recent venture investor euphoria.

"There's a disconnect between the private venture capital-type markets and the public markets," said Martin Wellington, a managing partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP in Palo Alto, Calif.

Dropbox Inc., the 10-year old cloud storage startup, is another company with a heady valuation, raising $500 million in debt financing in 2014. Dropbox was valued at $10 billion in its last funding round, but publicly traded private-equity investor BlackRock Inc. has since written it down 45%.

Amid renewed market skepticism, flat and down private financing rounds are more in vogue these days, reflecting the desire by venture investors to come to grips with valuation compression.

Still, the 2017 IPO market is expected to see offerings from highly valued startups including Snap Inc., Blue Apron Inc. and Bloom Energy Corp. Many more likely have filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission under a provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and remain under the radar.

But the IPO market remains a concern. The 37 U.S. venture-backed IPOs through Dec. 14 put 2016 on pace for the lowest level of public offerings since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, according to data from VentureSource, a unit of Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co.

Many investors remain unworried about how heated valuations play out in public markets, saying that those who invested earlier made money. But the late-stage investors who helped fuel the valuations frenzy for startups in 2014 and 2015 are the ones positioned for less stellar gains.

"If the unicorn valuation is disconnected from what the market valuation will be and it's too high, then somebody is gonna get hurt," said Mr. Wellington.

Mutual funds and other institutions who bought in at rich valuations might see their shares underwater on the public markets, triggering ratchet protections to be made whole if written into the investing terms. Venture investors say the institutional set of investors has become more selective on backing companies recently in the wake of valuation concerns.

That factor already has been borne out on investments in startups. The median premoney valuation for late-stage rounds fell to $148.6 million in the first half of 2016 from $269.3 million in 2015, according to VentureSource. The median premoney valuation for Series D or higher rounds dropped to less than $200 million in the second quarter of 2016 from a peak of about $400 million in the third quarter of 2015, according to law firm Cooley LLP.

Megavaluation startups have fallen out of favor in IPO markets. The U.S. median postmoney valuation of startups at IPO plummeted to $139.6 million in 2016 as of Dec. 14, 69.3% lower than the 10-year high of $455.2 million in 2011, according to VentureSource.

Indeed, venture-capital investors have throttled back on late-stage funding. In the third quarter of last year, the median size of later-stage rounds declined to $8.45 million, the lowest since the third quarter of 2010, according to VentureSource. In the same period in 2015, the median amount invested was pushed up to $18 million in the clamor to give cash to companies with valuations of $1 billion or more.

Crossover investors aren't the only ones chasing unicorns. Venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, whose megahits include the likes of Airbnb Inc. and Dropbox, holds the title for the largest stable of unicorns, according to data from the Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club. Sequoia is trailed by the likes of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Accel Partners and Andreessen Horowitz in billion-dollar startup stakes.

To be sure, many investors see the megavaluations of startups such as Uber Technologies Inc., Snap and Airbnb and plenty of others as the next big ticket. Some of the late-stage investors who picked up golden lottery tickets in these companies could expect to see rewards at the end of the rainbow.

The question is whether 2017 will be more receptive for tech IPOs. A handful of IPOs went out in recent months that have done well, offering hopes for the return of the public markets. Shares of Crispr Therapeutics AG, Coupa Software Inc. and Nutanix Inc. have stayed aloft in post-IPO trading, up 39.4%, 46.6% and 79.6%, respectively, as of Dec. 16, according to data from the WSJ Pro Venture-Backed Post-IPO Index.

"Hopefully, your private valuation is not completely out of line with how the public markets might view your company," said Eric Paley, a managing partner at Founder Collective.

Private markets are showing some signs of IPO-related interest in shares, too. On the secondary market for private shares, demand has soared for companies thought to be planning an IPO. "The companies that are being discussed as potential near-term IPO companies are seeing increased interest on our platform," said Greg Brogger, chief executive of private securities broker SharesPost Inc.

But even when unicorns see a strong public pop, gains don't always hold. The 21 U.S. unicorns that went public between 2011 and 2015 saw their shares close an average of 45% above the offer price on the first day of trading. Six months after the IPO, their shares traded only 33% above the offer price on average, according to data provider Dealogic Ltd.

"The question is what happens when a private investor wants to get out," said Kathleen Smith, co-founder of IPO researcher Renaissance Capital.

Venture firms, often mandated to get liquidity soon after a company goes public, hope those gains will hold through the six-month lock-up period after an IPO or at least long enough for them to cash out in an authorized secondary public offering before the lock-up ends. Some recent highly valued companies have seen a big drop when they announce that venture-capital firms plan to sell.

When Twilio Inc. hit the market in May as the first large tech IPO in months, its stock surged in part because it attracted interest from retail investors. In October, the company announced plans to let private investors sell shares in a secondary offering, and its share price fell 12% in one day, then continued to slide. Four weeks later, the stock traded 45% below its price before it announced the secondary offering.

Who can make it to an IPO is the question. IPO veterans expect only those unicorns with the strongest business fundamentals will take chances in the first few months of 2017.

"It's much harder to market a growth-at-any-cost kind of deal [since 2016] than it would have been in 2015 or 2014," said Mike Tuchen, chief executive of Talend Inc., a big-data integration company that went public in July with positive cash flow.

Two unicorns known to be waiting in the wings Snap and Blue Apron are expected to have numbers in line for Wall Street. Snap told investors last year it expected revenue between $250 million and $350 million in 2016. Blue Apron says it ships 8 million meal kits per month. At $10 each, that's nearly $1 billion in annual revenue.

Some unicorns are dropping IPO hints, saying their business is sound. In June, Dropbox Chief Executive Drew Houston announced the company was cash-flow positive. With that news, Dropbox signaled to the markets that its business was working, said Menlo Ventures' Mr. Murphy, who is not an investor in the company.

"There's going to be more pressure for them to go public. The question is can they get comfortable with going out with a down value?" he said.

More Relief for Consumers --- Penalties for two big European banks carve out a bigger portion for loan modifications

Billions of dollars of relief may be on the way for borrowers who got mortgages before the housing bust.

Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG agreed to pay consumers $4.1 billion and about $2.8 billion, respectively, as part of settlements they struck with the federal government this past week over their handling of mortgage-backed securities before the housing meltdown.

The two settlements, totaling $12.5 billion, are the latest penalties in a long-running series between the Justice Department and large banks over their role in deceptively selling billions of dollars of subprime mortgages as safe securities, exacerbating losses for investors nearly a decade ago. The settlements are notable in part because consumer relief accounts for a greater share of the total fines compared with many previous agreements, and consumer advocacy and other nonprofit groups aren't expected to get a piece of the funds.

The relief funds will go toward loan modifications, similar to the framework in the settlement reached between Goldman Sachs and the Justice Department in April, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Loan modifications in that accord included forgiveness of certain unpaid mortgage balances and forbearance to struggling borrowers, including those who owed more on their mortgage than their home is worth.

Payments to nonprofits and community groups -- a staple in many of the U.S. government's early mortgage settlements and a sticking point for many Republicans -- aren't expected to be included in these settlements, according to the people.

Justice Department settlements over toxic mortgage securities with Bank of America Corp. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., among others, included provisions that require the banks to turn over unpaid consumer-relief funds to consumer-advocacy nonprofits that focus on affordable housing, legal aid help to low-income borrowers and other groups. That provision was excluded from the Justice Department's settlement announcement with Goldman Sachs.

The exclusions could mark a turning point for how the consumer-relief portion of mortgage settlements are structured.

The settlements could also be a hot spot for the incoming administration. In September, the House voted almost entirely along party lines to restrict payments to third-party groups as part of Justice Department settlements, saying the arrangement subverts Congress's spending power and gives money to left-leaning activist groups with little oversight.

The Obama administration threatened to veto the bill, saying it "seeks to address a problem that does not exist," and the Senate didn't take it up. Republicans plan to move forward with new legislation on the issue early next year, a House Judiciary Committee aide said.

Consumer payouts have been a signature piece of most of the crisis-era mortgage settlements. The terms of these deals and how successful they have been at actually getting money to borrowers, however, have come under fire from some consumer advocates and Republicans.

Billions of dollars have been allocated to help borrowers in Justice Department settlements over toxic mortgage securities. Goldman Sachs agreed to pay out $1.8 billion to consumers earlier this year, Bank of America agreed to $7 billion in 2014 and Citigroup agreed to $2.5 billion the same year. J.P. Morgan agreed to pay out $4 billion in 2013.

"Everybody is focused on the big number but where the money actually lands and how it lands and if it is really hard money or not is something very different," said Basil Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics.

A Trumpian Clash Between Activists and Big Business

A common assumption about Donald Trump is that he'll run one of the most pro-business administrations in recent memory. But what if, instead, he hews to more of a pro-investor agenda that clashes with big business?

That is certainly an increasingly likely outcome after Wednesday's announcement that the president-elect has tapped billionaire investor Carl Icahn for an unpaid advisory role on overhauling financial regulations. Mr. Icahn, who has already played a part in selecting Mr. Trump's head of the Environmental Protection Agency , is also vetting candidates to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission , The Wall Street Journal reported.

The appointment suggests the president-elect will select policy makers more in the mold of Mr. Icahn, who has spent the past four decades battling big companies as an activist investor, than those favored by the pro-business wing of the Republican Party. While it's true that Mr. Icahn generally supports rolling back regulations that he believes crimp the U.S. economy, he is also an outspoken advocate of corporate-governance changes loathed by the business community.

Among these changes, the most controversial involves so-called universal ballots, proposed by the SEC in October. These would significantly ease how investors choose between board candidates offered by activist investors and those offered by a company's management. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says the measure would turn director elections into political-style campaigns and further discourage companies from going public.

Though the measure was widely panned by Republicans and the business lobby, Mr. Icahn applauded the move at the time, releasing a statement saying universal ballots would "eliminate needless voter confusion in contested elections, give shareholders greater freedom of choice, and hopefully end some of the gamesmanship employed by incumbent boards to keep shareholder-nominated directors out of the boardroom."

He also criticized the Chamber, saying he hoped it would fail in its effort to defeat the initiative. In 2011, the business group successfully challenged a related proxy measure in court.

(The dig at the U.S. Chamber wasn't totally out of character from a Trump confidant. Mr. Trump himself derided the Chamber as "totally controlled by the special interest groups" this summer, a day after the federation criticized his trade proposals.)

Mr. Icahn backs other initiatives that would likely meet resistance from the business community, such as steps to reduce corporate stock buybacks. He says such buybacks are driven by short-term thinking that weakens corporate balance sheets. "You could incentivize a company to invest in their own businesses rather than buy back stock," he said Thursday on CNBC. The billionaire also has warned about risky high-yield bond investments, suggesting he may support tougher restrictions on the funds' sales to mom-and-pop retail investors.

If Mr. Icahn's views prevail in shaping the next administration's approach to Wall Street, gear up for a big clash with big business.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Deutsche Bank , Credit Suisse Reach Multibillion Settlements Over Toxic Securities

By Jenny Strasburg and Max Colchester in London and Devlin Barrett in Washington

The Obama administration scrambled to resolve its remaining crisis-era megabank mortgage cases, striking multibillion-dollar settlements with Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG over toxic securities while separately filing a lawsuit against Barclays PLC alleging more than $30 billion in fraud-tainted sales.

U.S. authorities settled with Deutsche Bank for $7.2 billion Thursday. Early Friday, Credit Suisse said it had agreed to pay about $5.3 billion to close the matter.

Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse shares rose 4% and 2%, respectively, on Friday morning. Shares in Barclays dropped less than 1% as investors digested the potential uncertainty of a protracted legal battle with the Justice Department.

The dramatic back-to-back announcements show the urgency among senior Obama appointees in the Justice Department to resolve the outstanding probes of precrisis conduct at major banks before those officials leave office in mid-January. Part of the rush stems from a great deal of uncertainty about how a Trump administration might pursue, settle or drop the remaining probes, according to people familiar with the discussions.

The Deutsche Bank settlement is likely to bring some relief for the German bank's shareholders, who earlier in the year worried about a much bigger penalty. The Justice Department had originally sought $14 billion from Deutsche Bank , The Wall Street Journal reported in September, raising concerns about whether the institution would be able to negotiate that down.

Less than half the settlement requires a cash payment that would have an immediate impact on Deutsche Bank 's bottom line. The settlement was divided into a $3.1 billion penalty and a pledge to pay $4.1 billion over time to a "consumer relief" fund to be distributed by the government.

The terms of that relief including loan modifications to help consumers still must be finalized between the bank and the government.

Deutsche Bank announced the pact Thursday evening in the U.S., saying it had reached an agreement "in principle" with the Justice Department.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In major corporate settlements, particularly when the deal isn't yet finalized, it isn't uncommon for firms to announce the framework of a deal before the government, often in the hopes of a garnering a positive reaction from shareholders.

Credit Suisse said it would take a $2 billion charge to cover its settlement. The Swiss bank's deal includes a penalty from the Justice Department of $2.48 billion, and consumer-relief payments of about $2.8 billion, to be paid over five years. Again, the deal remains subject to "final documentation."

The settlements follow similar multibillion-dollar agreements reached over the past three years with other big banks, like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., Citigroup Inc . and Goldman Sachs Group . Inc.

The decision to sue Barclays is more unusual but not unheard of. The Justice Department filed two lawsuits against Bank of America Corp . related to precrisis sales of mortgage-backed securities in 2012 and 2013. One of those was thrown out earlier this year on appeal. The damages sought against Barclays weren't quantified.

Barclays said in a statement that it would seek the suit's "dismissal at the earliest opportunity," and that it considers the claims "disconnected from the facts." Bank officials declined to elaborate on why the talks broke down, but one person familiar with the matter said that continuing the talks under "a fresh pair of eyes" in a new presidential administration might be more beneficial.

A prolonged legal battle would be handled by Justice Department officials appointed by President-elect Donald Trump . Neither Mr. Trump nor his aides have indicated how they might handle legacy financial-crisis fallout inherited from President Barack Obama. But Mr. Trump in 2013 criticized J.P. Morgan CEO James Dimon that year as "the worst banker in the United States" for reaching a $13 billion settlement in a similar case. "What happened to the days when you actually go to trial?" Mr. Trump said at the time.

The Deutsche Bank settlement and Barclays suit come as the Justice Department still has probes outstanding with two other big European banks  Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and UBS Group AG .

The Justice negotiations this year have been a big cloud hanging over an already-fragile European banking industry, weighing on several major lenders' stock prices. Investors have worried about whether those institutions' capital is sufficient to cover any possible U.S. fines.

The Deutsche Bank settlement came together quickly in the latter part of this week following intense negotiations between lawyers representing the bank and the government, a person familiar with the matter said. Going into the week, the two sides still had significant differences to overcome, people close to the discussions said.

Deutsche Bank and the government were steadily closing in on terms, including the government's statement of facts about alleged wrongdoing, each day this week, according to a person close to the talks. The final main issue boiled down to money, the person said.

A Deutsche Bank settlement was appearing more promising earlier Thursday even without the Barclays lawsuit, but the government's move to sue the U.K. bank added incentive to close a deal, the person said.

The German bank said it will take a roughly $1.17 billion pretax charge this quarter as a result of the $3.1 billion penalty. The additional consumer relief has less immediate and less solid consequences, because it is to be paid out over at least five years, the bank said, adding that the settlement isn't expected to have a material impact on its 2016 financial results.

Hours before the Deutsche Bank settlement was announced, the Barclays talks broke down as executives at the U.K.'s second-largest bank made clear they were wary of being pressured to make a big payout.

Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley had told people in recent months that the bank wouldn't give U.S. authorities a blank check, and wouldn't settle if he felt the price was too high, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Government officials had discussed with Barclays lawyers the possibility of suing, but the bank only learned Thursday that a lawsuit was arriving the same day, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The impasse between the two sides was still big: They remained multiple billions of dollars apart, with Barclays unwilling to pay $5 billion an amount the government had said was in the range of possibilities, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The 198-page lawsuit by the U.S. government says the bank "engaged in a fraudulent scheme to sell tens of billions of dollars of residential mortgage-backed securities, in which it repeatedly deceived investors about the characteristics of the loans backing those trusts."

Barclays sold the securities to a wide range of investors, including financial institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , federal home-loan banks, credit unions, pension plans, charitable and religious organizations, and university endowments.

"Many of these investors suffered devastating losses,'' according to the suit, which was filed in a U.S. District Court in New York. The suit singles out two former New York-based Barclays executives, Paul Menefee and John Carroll, who had been hired in 2003 to help run the bank's asset-securitization team, according to an announcement at the time. Both were previously at Morgan Stanley and left Barclays in 2008.

The complaint is filled with expletive-laced conversations involving those men and others familiar with the loans, taken from transcripts of recorded phone calls and emails. In one, the complaint says that Mr. Menefee, who was in charge of due diligence on the subprime deals at issue, allegedly said that one loan pool "scares the sh*t out of me.'' At another point, that same executive said about a Wells Fargo & Co . pool, according to the complaint: "We have to eat their sh*t loans."

Mr. Menefee's lawyer called the complaint "a misguided attempt'' to blame his client and others for losses incurred by sophisticated institutional investors after an industrywide housing market collapse.

Mr. Carroll's lawyer called the decision to sue "extremely disappointing" and said his client "expects to be fully vindicated."

The suit also alleges that companies hired to conduct due-diligence checks on the mortgages warned the bank, and those warnings were essentially ignored. "These vendors described some of these securitized loans as  craptacular,' others as  scariest collateral,' and others as having the  distinct aroma of default,'" the suit says.

The allegations relate to activities and employees at Barclays , before the bank's 2008 buy of the collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers .

During Barclays 's settlement negotiations, one of the key arguments the bank made to Justice Department lawyers was that Barclays was the most-exposed investor in the securities in question, and had already taken a big write-down during the financial crisis as a result of losses.

Barclays also insisted that losses from the securities were related to broad market events, not its own practices, and argued that its due diligence on the deals was deemed at or above industry standards, including by government-backed entities that approved of Barclays 's methodology at the time.

In recent days, government lawyers were scheduling calls with Barclays lawyers, pushing for progress in the talks, a person familiar with the matter said.

On Thursday, the government gave the bank a brief heads-up before filing the complaint about 3 p.m. ET.

Lawyers for the bank could respond to the lawsuit as early as next month, people close the matter said.

U.S. Sues Barclays Over Mortgage Securities in Rare Step

By Max Colchester, Devlin Barrett and Jenny Strasburg

The U.S. Justice Department took the unusual step of suing Barclays PLC , alleging the bank fraudulently sold more than $30 billion of mortgage securities that helped fuel the financial crisis, after long-running settlement negotiations broke down.

The complaint filed Thursday against the U.K.'s second-largest bank shows the urgency among senior Obama appointees in the Justice Department to resolve the outstanding probes of precrisis conduct at major banks before those officials leave office in mid-January. Part of the urgency stems from a great deal of uncertainty about how a Trump administration might pursue, settle or drop the remaining probes, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Many of the banks caught up in the multibillion-dollar inquiries have reached settlements over the past three years without going to court. The Justice Department did file two lawsuits against Bank of America Corp . related to precrisis sales of mortgage-backed securities in 2012 and 2013, one of which was thrown out earlier this year on appeal.

The government complaint didn't quantify the damages it is seeking from Barclays .

Barclays said in a statement that it would seek the suit's "dismissal at the earliest opportunity," and that it considers the claims "disconnected from the facts." Bank officials declined to elaborate on why the talks broke down, but one person familiar with the matter said that continuing the talks under "a fresh pair of eyes" in a new presidential administration might be more beneficial.

A prolonged legal battle would be handled by Justice Department officials appointed by President-elect Donald Trump . Neither Mr. Trump nor his aides have indicated how they might handle legacy financial-crisis fallout inherited from Mr. Obama. But Mr. Trump in 2013 criticized J.P. Morgan CEO James Dimon that year as "the worst banker in the United States" for reaching a $13 billion settlement in a similar case. "What happened to the days when you actually go to trial?" Mr. Trump said at the time.

The Barclays suit comes as the Justice Department is deep in negotiations over mortgage securities with two other big European banks  Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG  it aims to wrap up by next month. While those talks are progressing, they have yet to reach a point that suggests a settlement is certain, according to people familiar with the discussions.

The Justice negotiations this year have been a big cloud hanging over an already-fragile European banking industry, weighing on several major lenders' stock prices. Investors have worried about whether those institutions' capital is sufficient to cover any possible U.S. fines. As of this summer, Barclays had set aside about $3.1 billion to cover fines and litigation, and has been selling assets in Europe and Africa to bolster its balance sheet.

The 198-page lawsuit by the U.S. government says the bank "engaged in a fraudulent scheme to sell tens of billions of dollars of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), in which it repeatedly deceived investors about the characteristics of the loans backing those trusts."

Barclays sold the securities to a wide range of investors, including financial institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , federal home-loan banks, credit unions, pension plans, charitable and religious organizations, and university endowments.

"Many of these investors suffered devastating losses,'' according to the suit, which was filed in a U.S. District Court in New York. The suit singles out two former New York-based Barclays executives, Paul Menefee and John Carroll, who had been hired in 2003 to help run the bank's asset-securitization team, according to an announcement at the time. Both were previously at Morgan Stanley and left Barclays in 2008.

The complaint is filled with expletive-laced conversations involving those men and others familiar with the loans, taken from transcripts of recorded phone calls and emails. In one, the complaint says that Mr. Menefee, who was charge of due diligence on the subprime deals at issue, allegedly said that one loan pool "scares the sh*t out of me.'' At another point, that same executive said about a Wells Fargo & Co . pool, according to the complaint: "We have to eat their sh*t loans."

Mr. Menefee's lawyer called the complaint "a misguided attempt'' to blame his client and others for losses incurred by sophisticated institutional investors after an industrywide housing market collapse.

Mr. Menefee, the lawyer said, plans to refute the accusations in court "where it will be shown why the government's own witness described Mr. Menefee as  honest',  careful', and  the fairest person he ever dealt with.'''

Mr. Carroll's lawyer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

The suit also alleges that companies hired to conduct due-diligence checks on the mortgages warned the bank, and those warnings were essentially ignored. "These vendors described some of these securitized loans as  craptacular,' others as  scariest collateral,' and others as having the  distinct aroma of default,'" the suit says.

The allegations relate to activities and employees at Barclays , before the bank's 2008 buy of the collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers .

The breakdown in the talks between the government and the bank came as Barclays executives made clear they were wary of being pressured to make a big payout.

Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley had told people in recent months that the bank wouldn't give U.S. authorities a blank check, and wouldn't settle if he felt the price was too high, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Government officials had discussed with Barclays lawyers numerous times the possibility of suing, but the bank only learned Thursday that a lawsuit was arriving the same day, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The impasse between the two sides was still big: They remained multiple billions of dollars apart, with Barclays unwilling to pay $5 billion an amount the government had said was in the range of possibilities, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Lawyers for the bank could respond to the lawsuit as early as next month, people close the matter said.

One of the key arguments Barclays made to Justice Department lawyers during the negotiations was that Barclays was the most-exposed investor in the securities in question, and had already taken a big write-down during the financial crisis as a result of losses.

Barclays also insisted that losses from the securities were related to broad market events, not its own practices, and argued that its due diligence on the deals was deemed at or above industry standards, including by government-backed entities that approved of Barclays 's methodology at the time.

In recent days, government lawyers were scheduling calls with Barclays lawyers, pushing for progress in the talks, a person familiar with the matter said.

On Thursday, the government gave the bank a brief heads-up before filing the complaint about 3 p.m. ET.

Italy Sets Up Fund to Help Troubled Banks

By Giovanni Legorano

Italy's government has set up a backstop fund to shore up troubled banks, setting the stage for the rescue of troubled Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA .

At a cabinet meeting in the early hours of Friday, the government of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni approved the creation of a  ¬20 billion ($20.9 billion) fund to help troubled banks. Shortly afterward, Monte dei Paschi said it will apply to tap this fund for fresh equity to shore up its balance sheet.

Following the move, the Italian market regulator suspended trading in Monte dei Paschi's ordinary shares, related derivatives and 10 types of bonds for the entirety of Friday's session.

The government's decision came just hours after the Tuscan bank declared that a last-ditch effort to raise capital from private investors had failed. The bank, Italy's No. 3 lender, attempted to raise  ¬5 billion to stay afloat and avert a government bailout.

The government said that if a bank taps the newly created fund, its outstanding junior bonds will be forcibly converted into shares. European rules on bank rescues require that investors suffer at least some losses.

However, under the terms attached to the Italian government's new fund, the losses suffered by holders of Monte dei Paschi's junior bonds appear to be fairly limited.

The government said that for the Tuscan bank, some junior bonds held mainly by institutional investors will take a 25% haircut on their face value when converted into shares when the bank taps the fund.

In the case of those held by retail investors, however, their bond holdings will also be forcibly converted into shares, but at their full value. MPS will swap the shares obtained by retail investors from the forced conversion of their junior bonds with senior bonds and then the government will buy those shares from the bank.

A Treasury official said the government believes the mechanism to rescue Monte dei Paschi which other troubled banks can also tap abides by European rules, even though the government hasn't received a specific green light by the European Commission .

The Volcker Rule and Other Regulations Carl Icahn Likes

By Ryan Tracy

Carl Icahn , President-elect Donald Trump 's new regulatory adviser, might not favor financial deregulation the way many on Wall Street expect.

The billionaire investor, tapped for a new post called "special adviser to the president on regulatory reform," has said positive things about the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and one of its signature initiatives, the Volcker rule bank-trading ban. On the other hand, he has raised concerns about risks in the asset-management industry and accountability on corporate boards.

"I'm not against regulations at all," Mr. Icahn said Thursday on CNBC. "I sort of believe that you need a rule of law."

In 2015, he praised the Volcker rule for getting banks out of the proprietary trading business, even though other financial-market participants say that banks' decreased trading has hurt market functioning.

A representative of Mr. Icahn didn't respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Icahn has already been involved in personnel decisions, such as helping choose the next head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , according to people familiar with the matter.

To be sure, Mr. Icahn is striking a deregulatory tone, suggesting in particular that bank regulations and environmental regulations need to be rolled back. He called the regulatory policies of the Obama administration "literally absurd" in the CNBC interview.

"There is too much regulation on the banks," he said without offering specifics. He even suggested that he would give bankers a role in rewriting regulations, adding that "the great experts" on bank rules include the chief executives of Bank of America Corp . and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., two of the largest U.S. banks.

But past comments suggest he won't be advocating the kind of wholesale regulatory rollback that many Republicans and business executives or even Mr. Trump himself would want to see.

"In fact, I think you need Dodd-Frank, to some extent, more than even Donald does," Mr. Icahn said in an interview with Fox News last month.

Mr. Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, the investor and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Steven Mnuchin , has criticized the Volcker rule, a Dodd-Frank provision that bans banks from trading with their own funds.

Mr. Icahn, at a conference in 2015 where he publicly debated BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Laurence Fink , said he thought the Volcker rule "is very important and it is good."

"Banks should not be a last resort to sell" securities, and should not have their proprietary trading desks buying them, Mr. Icahn said at the time.

He went on to say that he thought the rule had diminished banks' role in securities markets, which could mean there are fewer buyers and sellers in the market during a crisis. But rather than pointing the finger at regulations for this perceived market fragility, he blamed large asset managers like BlackRock for playing an outsize role in markets and creating risky investment funds that would have trouble meeting investor redemptions in a crisis.

Mr. Icahn's perspective is colored by his many years as an activist investor. He has supported a recent SEC "universal ballot" proposal that would make it easier for shareholders to vote on board candidates nominated by investors a rule that many Republicans and big businesses oppose.

In the CNBC appearance Thursday, he said regulators could finds ways to deter companies from borrowing to buy back their own stock money he said would be better spent investing in the company, including brick-and-mortar infrastructure.

"There would be ways, and I'm not going to go into it, where you could incentivize a company to invest in their own businesses rather than buy back stock," he said.

Indeed, Mr. Icahn may have benefited from some provisions of Dodd-Frank. He invests out of a family office, which the law exempts from rules that apply to hedge funds and private-equity funds.

SEC Watchdog Details Rare Probe Into Worker's  Attendance Fraud'

By Dave Michaels

The internal watchdog for the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the rare step of accusing an employee of committing "attendance fraud," saying the public official was paid $125,000 for more than 1,200 hours of work "that he did not work or account for."

The claim is included in separate reports published this year by the inspector general for the securities regulator, most recently in the agency's semiannual report issued Nov. 14.

The report doesn't name the employee facing the accusation, but several people familiar with the matter said it is Erozan Kurtas, who was a star quant at the agency tasked with helping examiners parse hedge funds' complex trading strategies.

Mr. Kurtas left the SEC in 2015 to join the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , an industry-funded monitor of U.S. brokerages, as the inspector general's probe was still under way. Finra named him head of the office of advanced data analytics, reporting directly to its chief executive.

Judith Germano, an attorney for Mr. Kurtas, didn't respond to repeated requests to address whether Mr. Kurtas was the employee named in the SEC report. But in an email statement in response to questions from the Journal, she said any claim that Mr. Kurtas "abused his position at the SEC is false and without merit."

"Erozan Kurtas was a top performer at the SEC who received outstanding written and verbal performance reviews from his supervisors and helped develop advanced software tools that saved taxpayers millions of dollars and helped move the SEC's exam program into the technological age," Ms. Germano wrote.

Federal inspectors general are independent watchdogs tasked with finding waste, fraud or abuse in the government. They routinely publish their findings to inform Congress about their work and to prod agencies to fix problems that they find.

Inspectors general can't file criminal or civil charges against an investigative target, but they sometimes refer their findings to federal prosecutors if they believe a law has been broken. The inspector general referred this investigation to a prosecutor, who "declined prosecution based on insufficient dollar loss and potential venue challenges," the report states.

It is unusual for the SEC's inspector general to probe attendance fraud because routine complaints about employees are usually handled by their managers. Since taking office in 2013, SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker reported opening only two other similar cases. Investigators dismissed one claim outright, saying there was no evidence to support it. In another, they found an employee who logged over 200 hours of overtime didn't seek proper approval for additional time at the office.

Mr. Kurtas arrived at the SEC in 2010 after working at data-storage company Seagate Technology and credit-rating firm S&P Global Inc ., part of a recent wave of hires from outside the bureaucratic ranks to infuse the agency with more Wall Street expertise. His supervisors in Washington quickly promoted him as their in-house expert on the complex mathematical and statistical models that hedge funds and algorithmic trading firms use, the people said.

Mr. Kurtas preached that old-fashioned compliance experts "do not have the background to understand, monitor or test the models," according to a presentation to investment-firm compliance officers that he delivered in 2012.

Leaders at the SEC credited Mr. Kurtas with developing the National Exam Analytics Tool, known as NEAT, which allows the agency to absorb huge data sets from money managers and mutual funds and uses algorithms to look for signs of insider trading, cherry-picking or mispriced securities. The program is loaded on the desktop and laptop of every SEC inspector, according to other people familiar with the exam program's operations.

"With NEAT, our examiners are able to access and systematically analyze massive amounts of trading data from firms in a fraction of the time it has taken in years past," SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said in a 2014 speech.

The inspector general's office began investigating Mr. Kurtas after some employees reported that he wasn't seen as much as expected in the office, the people said.

The investigators checked the attendance of the investigated individual by measuring how often the person used a badge to enter the New York regional office, used a computer workstation at an SEC building, or remotely logged onto the SEC's computer networks, one of the people said. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office used similar methods to examine potential payroll fraud by federal patent examiners as part of an investigation made public in August.

A person familiar with the accusation said one possible explanation that might exonerate Mr. Kurtas was that he often accompanied SEC inspectors on exams. That could have taken him outside of the office for long periods, during which he might not have logged onto an SEC computer network.

An earlier summary of the investigation, published in April, also didn't name Mr. Kurtas but said the subject of the probe "routinely arrived late for work and was frequently absent, in both cases failing to request or obtain authorized leave."

Justice Officials Support Rehearing of Case on CFPB's Constitutionality

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTON Justice Department attorneys said Thursday a federal appeals court should convene a larger panel of judges to reconsider an earlier ruling that found the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's structure unconstitutional.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the coming weeks is expected to decide whether to have the case heard by the entire court. An October ruling by a panel of its three judges said the agency's single-director structure violated the Constitution.

The Justice Department, in a friend-of-the-court brief, said a full panel of judges should hear the matter "in view of the importance of the case, the significance of the constitutional question."

The ruling, which could make it possible for the president to fire the CFPB director at will, has deepened the predicament for the CFPB. Republicans have been critical of the bureau, and in January will assume the White House and continue to control Congress. Citing the appeals court, some in the GOP have called on President-elect Donald Trump to fire Richard Cordray , the current CFPB director, and replace him with someone more friendly to the financial industry.

The CFPB was created by the Obama administration as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.

The appeals court took an unusual step in requesting a brief on rehearing the case from the U.S. Solicitor General's office, which represents the government on many appellate matters but wasn't previously involved in the CFPB case.

PHH on Thursday said in its brief the court should reject the request.

The appeals judges who ruled against the CFPB were Republican appointees, though they didn't all agree on the same reasoning in their decision. A majority of the judges on the appeals court are Democratic appointees and could be more sympathetic to the bureau.

In the case, PHH challenged Mr. Cordray's decision to impose a steep fine for allegedly accepting kickbacks from mortgage insurers.

Senate Democrats Press Wells Fargo Board for Answers on Sales Practices

By Emily Glazer

Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee demanded Wells Fargo & Co .'s board respond to questions the bank has yet to answer related to its sales practices scandal, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The senators asked the board for more information about its continuing independent investigation of the alleged fraud that caused the bank to pay a $185 million settlement in September over opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information.

The senators in this latest letter also asked the board for a timeline of when its members learned of the questionable sales tactics, actions the board took to address the problem and reasons why it didn't investigate sooner, according to the letter. It asked for answers to its 10 questions by Jan. 7.

"Continued failure to answer questions especially basic questions about the causes and consequences of the fraud that Wells Fargo permitted for many years does nothing to restore the trust of Wells Fargo 's customers and shareholders, many of whom are our constituents," according to the letter.

Wells Fargo 's board in late September announced its independent investigation alongside moves to rescind a collective $61 million in pay from now-former Chief Executive John Stumpf and former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt .

The board's independent directors "will take such other actions as they collectively deem appropriate," according to a statement at the time. The bank neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the settlement Sept. 8.

The 10 Democratic senators, led by ranking member Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), submitted 58 questions to Wells Fargo management on Sept. 29 that they said weren't answered by Mr. Stumpf in two congressional hearings. The bank responded on Nov. 15, but cited the board's continuing independent investigation as a reason it couldn't fully answer some questions.

A bank spokeswoman at the time said Wells Fargo appreciates Congress's role and will continue to be responsive to lawmakers as the bank's board investigation progresses.

A person familiar with the board said Thursday that it previously responded to earlier letters from some of the Democratic senators that included some of the same questions.

A spokesman for the board reiterated Thursday that the board would make the findings of the investigation public upon its conclusion.

In addition to Sen. Brown, the latest letter was jointly submitted by Sens. Jack Reed (D., R.I.), Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), Jon Tester (D., Mont.), Mark Warner (D., Va.), Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (D., Ind.).

They asked the board to identify members of the special committee who are leading the investigation and the criteria to select them, why the board didn't launch an independent investigation earlier, and the probe's scope.

The senators also sought details on how the board will provide "sufficient transparency into and details of" the investigation to stakeholders and the public, among other questions relating to the sales practices issues.

WSJ Pro: Democrats Add Fresh Faces to Senate Banking Committee

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTON Senate Democrats are reshuffling the makeup of the Banking Committee, with two veteran senators leaving the panel and three freshmen including two first elected in November joining.

Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Jeff Merkley of Oregon will be leaving the committee. Both are joining the Senate Democratic leadership, Mr. Schumer as the new minority leader and Mr. Merkley as chief deputy whip.

New to the banking committee will be Sen. Brian Schatz, a first-termer from Hawaii, and Sens.-elect Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.

While Democrats are increasing their numbers on the committee to 11 from 10, Republicans will still have a majority on the panel once their assignments are announced.

Assignments will be finalized when the Senate reconvenes for the 115th Congress early next year. Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) is likely to succeed Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) as committee chairman. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio will remain the committee's top Democrat.

The arrival of three strongly liberal Democrats will mark a shift leftward for the panel's Democratic contingent, despite the departure of Mr. Merkley, the only senator to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), arguably the Democrats' strongest voice on financial regulation, will keep her seat on the committee. Without Mr. Schumer, who some liberals view warily due to his relationships in the financial industry, New York will lack its traditional presence on the Banking Committee.

Kurt Walters, the campaign director for the liberal group Demand Progress, hailed the changes on the committee and gave Mr. Schumer, often a target for criticism, credit for listening to the left flank of the party.

"[Mr. Schumer's] absence as a vote on the committee makes a small difference, but what's far more important is that he is showing that he has a willingness to listen to progressives and respond to the energy in the party's base," Mr. Walters said in an interview. "With Democrats trying to regain their footing as the party of economic populism, it's important to have strong voices in favor of Wall Street reform," he added.

Representatives for Mr. Schumer didn't respond to requests for comment.

Fed Finds Continued Growth in Noncash Payments

By Robin Sidel

Americans are pulling out their credit cards, but also hanging onto their checkbooks.

Those are some of the findings from a Federal Reserve study released Thursday that analyzes payment trends over the past three years and tracks the unrelenting march of electronic transactions.

In its sixth rendition of the study, the Fed said the number of U.S. noncash payments continued to gain ground between 2012 and 2015, rising 5.3% annually to 144 billion. The noncash payments, which include debit cards, credit cards and checks, had a value of nearly $178 trillion in 2015, up about 13% since 2012.

Debit cards helped lead the way as the number of those payments rose to 69.5 billion in 2015, up 23% from 2012.

The value of the debit-card payments rose by a smaller amount, however, reflecting the fact that debit transactions typically are of lesser value than those made on credit cards.

The number of credit-card payments reached 33.8 billion in 2015 with a value of $3.16 trillion, representing increases of roughly 25% from 2012. The growth was led by general-purpose cards that can be used everywhere compared with private-label cards that can only be used in specific stores.

The average value of general-purpose credit-card payments dropped to $90 from $93 between 2012 and 2015, the Fed said.

The surge in online shopping led to a growth in remote card payments, also called card-not-present transactions, the Fed said. Those transactions represented 19% of all card payments in 2015, up from 16% in 2012.

Check usage continued to fall among Americans, but the decline appears to be leveling off.

The number of check payments fell to 17.3 billion with a value of $26.83 trillion between 2012 and 2015, down 17% and 1.4%, respectively. Check payments fell at an annual rate of 4.4%, representing a slowdown in the rate of decline for the first time since the descent began in the mid-1990s, the Fed said.

The study, which is conducted every three years, is considered to be among the most comprehensive reports that track payments usage in the U.S. Starting in 2017, the Fed said it would collect some of the survey data annually, rather than every three years.

Platinum Partners Fraud Case Has Investigators Casting Wide Net

By Rob Copeland, Erica Orden and Nicole Hong

Federal investigators are asking questions about a billionaire New York hedge-fund manager and a Bermuda reinsurer as they examine the alleged fraud by hedge fund Platinum Partners .

On Monday, six Platinum executives, including chief investment officer Mark Nordlicht, were arrested and charged with faking the firm's investment performance. The allegations against Platinum, which had more than $1 billion under management, outline what would be one of the largest investment frauds since Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme.

As part of the Platinum probe, prosecutors are casting a wide net.

Investigators have interviewed potential witnesses about the relationship between Platinum co-founder Murray Huberfeld and billionaire hedge-fund manager Israel Englander , people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Englander, head of $34 billion Millennium Management LLC and one of the most emulated traders in the hedge-fund industry, hasn't been accused of wrongdoing.

A spokesman for Mr. Englander said he was unaware of any investigation into him personally and hadn't received any inquiries from prosecutors.

Mr. Huberfeld and Mr. Englander, who have been friends for decades, are members of the Orthodox Jewish community from Brooklyn, people close to them said. Mr. Huberfeld sought Mr. Englander's advice before helping start Platinum in 2003, one of the people said.

Mr. Huberfeld himself was arrested in June when he was charged with playing a role in the alleged bribery of a New York union official in exchange for investments in Platinum. He pleaded not guilty. He wasn't named in Monday's complaint but is the unnamed "Co-Conspirator 1" in the criminal indictment, said a person familiar with matter.

Federal investigators are probing the actions of Bermuda reinsurer Beechwood Re, people familiar with the matter said. Beechwood's investment adviser arm was two-thirds owned by Platinum's executives and close associates, according to regulators. Beechwood repeatedly directed its clients to invest in Platinum and related deals over the past three years, according to filings and people familiar with the matter.

Beechwood didn't disclose its Platinum ties to clients before telling them to invest with the firm, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported. A former Beechwood executive who was Mr. Huberfeld's nephew and later returned to Platinum was among those arrested Monday.

A Beechwood spokesman said: "Beechwood did not engage in wrongdoing and intends to cooperate fully with any investigation." Beechwood's chief executive has previously said he didn't tell clients about his firm's ties to Platinum because the ownership stakes were passive.

Representatives for the two U.S. Attorney's offices handling the Platinum investigations declined to comment.

Platinum's flagship fund, which has filed for bankruptcy protection, specialized in esoteric assets like loans tied to life insurance policies, which the firm was largely permitted to value itself, investor documents show. Launched in 2003, the firm reported some of the best performance in the hedge-fund world, with no down years and few down months for any of its funds.

Prosecutors said the men arrested on Monday made up the performance figures to collect their cut of any unrealized investment gains. All of the executives pleaded not guilty and declined further comment.

Platinum's investors, whom authorities say may total more than 600, include the families of New York real-estate executives Ralph Herzka and Rubin Schron and philanthropist Gordon Diamond, people familiar with the investments said.

Mr. Schron said in an interview that his investments were selected by a money manager. "I'm not really familiar with the investments we invest in," he said. "Maybe I've heard the name."

The money manager, Jack Bojman, said Platinum was in the portfolio before he was hired. "We just hoped it performed," he said.

Over the past year, Platinum restricted redemptions and then suspended them entirely. At the same time, its executives told investors they would eventually be paid back in full, perhaps even with further investment gains, investors said.

Shlomo Rechnitz, a billionaire California nursing-home magnate, had tens of millions of dollars tied up in Platinum and related deals, a person familiar with the matter said. He told friends he has cut back his charitable giving following Platinum's woes, in one instance slashing his annual donation to Jerusalem's Mir Yeshiva to $1 million from $5 million in years past.

Torah Umesorah, an Orthodox Jewish education charity which provides teacher training for more than 800 schools, had millions invested in Platinum. That is because when developer Richard Stadtmauer made a 2008 donation to the organization he recommended that it be invested solely in Platinum, according to three people familiar with the matter. Mr. Stadtmauer had an apartment in the same Manhattan building as Mr. Huberfeld and Mr. Nordlicht, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Torah Umesorah asked for the money back last year and was rebuffed, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Stadtmauer then threatened to sue Platinum if it didn't give the money back, the people said.

Instead, Platinum agreed to treat the redemption as a loan, bearing interest. It hasn't yet been repaid, the people said.

Arrangements like that were flagged in Monday's indictment, which prosecutors termed "preferential redemptions, often for arbitrary reasons."

WSJ Pro: FDIC Seeks Input on Handbook for Creating New Banks

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . sought feedback on a new handbook for investors looking to start a bank, a response to criticism that the agency hasn't approved enough new charters since the financial crisis.

The handbook, the first of its kind in recent history, describes the new charter application process and outlines hurdles that applicants for new bank charters have to clear. The FDIC also asked several questions about the handbook Thursday, seeking advice on how the agency could provide more information.

New bank charters have slowed significantly since 2008, when 90 so-called de novo banks were formed, according to the FDIC. Since 2011, the FDIC says it has approved five new charter applications.

The agency also says it received five applications in 2016.

The FDIC said it welcomes new bank applications and has attributed the dearth of new banks to market conditions, such as low interest rates, which are making it less attractive to start a bank. The banking industry and its allies in Congress have said a larger factor is increased regulation on banks and, in particular, increased scrutiny of new bank charters by the FDIC.

"This handbook is the latest in a series of steps we have taken to support the establishment of de novo institutions," FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said in a statement Thursday. "Our goal is to increase transparency about the application approval process and resources available to assist potential organizers."

Lawmakers Ask SEC to Block Chinese Group's Plan to Buy Chicago Stock Exchange

By Alexander Osipovich

A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers has urged regulators to block the proposed acquisition of the Chicago Stock Exchange by a Chinese-led investment group, warning the deal could threaten national security.

The lawmakers' appeal, sent in a letter on Thursday to departing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White and her two fellow commissioners, was a last-ditch effort to block the sale after it was approved earlier this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S . The CFIUS review was regarded as the bigger hurdle to the sale, since the committee has probed some deals so deeply that Chinese investors have walked away.

"Allowing a Chinese owned and possibly government-affiliated firm direct access to manipulate our $22 trillion U.S. equity marketplace is unprecedented and poses an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to American companies and to the financial security of this country," said the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Five members of the House of Representatives, including three Republicans and two Democrats, signed the letter, which also urged the SEC to provide more time for public feedback on the proposed deal. The SEC's deadline for responses is Jan. 3.

"Holding the public comment period for a brief duration during the holiday season clearly indicates an effort to avoid negative response," the letter said. The signatories are Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.), Rep. Earl L. "Buddy" Carter (R., Ga.), Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.), Collin Peterson (D., Minn.) and David Joyce (R., Ohio).

An SEC spokesman said the regulator was aware of the letter but declined to comment further.

Mr. Pittenger, one the signers of the letter, said he expected the incoming team of President-elect Donald J. Trump to be warier of the deal than the Obama administration.

"I think he understands the great concerns we have with China," Mr. Pittenger said in a telephone interview with The Wall Street Journal.

The Chicago Stock Exchange has less than 1% of U.S. equities volume, and its parent company had revenue of just $19.5 million last year. But its license remains valuable because new exchanges face a gantlet of regulatory barriers before they can launch.

If the proposed acquisition goes through, Chinese investors would own 49.5% of the exchange's parent company, according to a filing released by the Chicago bourse in late November.

According to the filing, the new owners would include a Chinese company, Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group Co., which would own 20% of the exchange's parent company. The filing said other proposed owners include Chongqing Jintian Industrial Co. Ltd., Chongqing Longshang Decoration Co. Ltd. and Raptor Group, the family office of former hedge-fund manager Jim Pallotta .

The filing said none of the firms that would acquire an ownership interest in the Chicago exchange through the deal was directly or indirectly controlled by a governmental entity.

Advocates of the deal say the possibility of seeing the exchange turned into a spy outpost is remote and the risks have been overstated by politicians who don't understand trading.

A spokesman for the Chicago Stock Exchange declined to comment. A U.S.-based lawyer for Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group, Peter Rooney of law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP , didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Fitch Cuts Portugal Banking Sector to Negative

Fitch changes outlook for Portuguese banking sector to negative from stable to reflect "the intensified pressure on capital from the weak profitability and asset quality, amid a highly indebted economy with low growth prospects." Adds that with a phase-in total capital ratio of 13.1% at end-June 2016, Portugal's banking system is expected to try to increase their buffers in 2017, including by tapping the subordinated debt market.

Majority of Trump Voters Want to Keep or Expand CFPB

Republican lawmakers are pushing the incoming administration to significantly limit the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , a watchdog agency crated by the Obama administration after the financial crisis. According to a poll, that goes against the wishes of a majority of Trump voters. The survey released by Morning Consult showed 41% of Trump voters said they wanted the new administration to leave the CFPB alone, while 14% said they wanted its power expanded. Only 7% want to get rid of the agency, while 21% want to see its power curbed. Trump has called for repealing the post-crisis financial regulations broadly but hasn't said anything specific about the CFPB. The survey was conducted by Morning Consult and Glover Park Group , a Washington communications firm founded by Michael Feldman , a former Democratic staffer. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com; @TokyoWoods)

What Trump's Cabinet Picks Mean for Markets

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-trumps-cabinet-picks-mean-for-markets-1482422691", the people that President-elect Donald Trump is slotting for his administration have emphasized that he aims to be extremely shareholder friendly. The question facing investors is what sort of value to place on that friendship.

Never before has a U.S. president stocked his cabinet with as many businessmen as Mr. Trump is aiming to. While putting up a Goldman Sachs Group alum like Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary counts as almost status quo, tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, and fast-food chain executive Andy Puzder as labor secretary shows how highly Mr. Trump values business experience and how focused he is on reshaping the regulatory environment in businesses' favor.

The Impact of Prudential Policies on Credit Supply

How do prudential policies affect the supply of credit in the  U.S.? "https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/ifdp/2016/files/ifdp1186.pdf"by Richard Correa and Seung Jung Lee of the Federal Reserve, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review had a negative effect on jumbo mortgage originations and approval rates at stress-tested banks when it was first applied in 2011. They also found Supervisory Guidance on Leveraged Lending led to a notable decrease in "speculative-grade term-loan originations" at regulated banks in 2014. Their analysis shows that banks with worse capital positions were  affected more negatively by prudential policies.

How Trump and Republicans Can Repeal CFTC Regulations

The transition to the presidency of Donald Trump provides the right environment for Congress to use its powers under the Congressional Review Act to strip back recent Obama administration regulations, "http://www.cadwalader.com/resources/clients-friends-memos/the-trump-administration-potential-levers-of-regulatory-change-affecting-the-commodities-markets", a law firm. The review act, which allows Congress to effectively overturn "major" new rules before they become effective, could apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 's "new position aggregation rule and re-proposed rules addressing the imposition of capital requirements for non-prudentially regulated swap dealers and the regulation of automated trading in the commodities markets," the firm says.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fixed-income-boosts-battered-european-banks-1482489001" The question for European investment banks is just how much they can cash in. Earlier this year, investors feared that Brexit and a Donald Trump election victory would buffet struggling investment banks with more uncertainty. Instead, the political shocks of 2016 spurred wild rides in currencies and interest rates, a boon for lenders with big trading operations.

Latest Bank Mortgage Settlements Aim to Get More Relief to Consumers; Expected Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse penalties carve out a bigger portion for loan modifications

Billions of dollars of relief may be on the way for borrowers who got mortgages before the housing bust.

Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse agreed to pay consumers $4.1 billion and about $2.8 billion, respectively, as part of "http://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-agrees-to-settlement-over-residential-mortgage-backed-securities-1482458858" this week over their handling of mortgage-backed securities before the housing meltdown.

The two settlements, totaling $12.5 billion, are the latest penalties in a long-running series between the Justice Department and large banks over their role in deceptively selling billions of dollars of subprime mortgages as safe securities, exacerbating losses for investors nearly a decade ago. The settlements are notable in part because consumer relief accounts for a greater share of the total fines compared with many previous agreements and consumer advocacy and other nonprofit groups aren't expected to get a piece of the funds.

The relief funds will go toward loan modifications, similar to the framework in the settlement reached between Goldman Sachs and the Justice Department in April, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Loan modifications in that agreement included forgiveness of certain unpaid mortgage balances and forbearance to struggling borrowers, including those who owed more on their mortgage than their home is worth.

Payments to nonprofits and community groups a staple in many of the U.S. government's early mortgage settlements and a sticking point for many Republicans aren't expected to be included in these settlements, according to the people.

Justice Department settlements over toxic mortgage securities with Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Citigroup Inc., among others, included provisions that require the banks to turn over unpaid consumer relief funds to consumer advocacy nonprofits that focus on affordable housing, legal aid help to low-income borrowers and other groups. That provision was excluded from the Justice Department's settlement announcement with Goldman Sachs.

The exclusions could mark a turning point for how the consumer-relief portion of mortgage settlements are structured.

The settlements could also be a hot spot for the incoming administration. In September, the House voted almost entirely along party lines to restrict payments to third-party groups as part of Justice Department settlements, saying the arrangement subverts Congress's spending power and gives money to left-leaning activist groups with little oversight. The Obama administration threatened to veto the bill, saying it "seeks to address a problem that does not exist," and the Senate didn't take it up. Republicans plan to move forward with new legislation on the issue early next year, a House Judiciary Committee aide said.

Consumer payouts have been a signature piece of most of the crisis-era mortgage settlements. The terms of these deals and how successful they have been at actually getting money to borrowers, however, have come under fire from some consumer advocates and Republicans.

Billions of dollars have been allocated to help borrowers in Justice Department settlements over toxic mortgage securities. Goldman Sachs agreed to pay out $1.8 billion to consumers earlier this year, Bank of America agreed to $7 billion in 2014 and Citigroup agreed to $2.5 billion the same year. J.P. Morgan agreed to pay out $4 billion in 2013.

"Everybody is focused on the big number but where the money actually lands and how it lands and if it is really hard money or not is something very different," said Basil Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics. Both Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are still ironing out the details of their settlements with the U.S. government.

The relief from many mortgage settlements often ends up being a bookkeeping item for the banks. One common tactic has been for the banks to deduct the amount of unpaid balances for mortgages tied to homes that went into foreclosure from the relief fund, said Geoff Walsh, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.

Loan modifications get doled out, though those rarely are offered to the borrowers who need it the most, he said, but rather focused on areas where property values have yet to stabilize. That can help banks lessen the chances of borrowers walking away from the house. "We've never seen rhyme or reason why [certain] borrowers get chosen and others don't," he said.

President-elect Donald Trump hasn't weighed in on the issue of how bank fines are doled out, though he has noted his antipathy for bank settlements in the past. "What happened to the days when you actually go to trial?" he said in a 2013 interview.

Giant Hedge Fund Builds a Management Machine --- Bridgewater is designing software to automate routine operations

Deep inside Bridgewater Associates LP, the world's largest hedge-fund firm, software engineers are at work on a secret project that founder Ray Dalio has sometimes called "The Book of the Future."

The goal is technology that would automate most of the firm's management. It would represent a culmination of Mr. Dalio's life work to build Bridgewater into an altar to radical openness -- and a place that can endure without him.

At Bridgewater, most meetings are recorded, employees are expected to criticize one another continually, people are subject to frequent probes of their weaknesses, and personal performance is assessed on a host of data points, all under Mr. Dalio's gaze.

Bridgewater's new technology would enshrine his unorthodox management approach in a software system. It could dole out GPS-style directions for how staff members should spend every aspect of their days, down to whether an employee should make a particular phone call.

The system remains under development, and the exact details of its operations are still being debated inside the firm. One employee familiar with the project described it as "like trying to make Ray's brain into a computer."

Bridgewater manages $160 billion, the most of any hedge-fund firm. It has earned clients twice as much total profit as any rival, says LCH Investments NV, a firm that puts client money into hedge funds. Mr. Dalio personally earned $1.4 billion last year, according to research firm Institutional Investor's Alpha.

Bridgewater's flagship fund, however, was down about 12% on the year at one point in 2016, causing alarm inside the firm. The fund has since recovered to being up 3.9% in mid-December. A lower-fee fund was up 8.1%.

Rules for Bridgewater's staff are laid out in a 123-page public manifesto known as the "Principles," which every employee is expected to know and diligently apply. Along with maxims such as "By and large, you will get what you deserve over time," the Principles are filled with advice from Mr. Dalio such as "Don't 'pick your battles.' Fight them all."

Bridgewater says about one-fifth of new hires leave within the first year. The pressure is such that those who stay sometimes are seen crying in the bathrooms, said five current and former staff members. This article is based on interviews with them and more than a dozen other past and present Bridgewater employees and others close to the firm.

Mr. Dalio returned to run Bridgewater earlier this year after stepping back to a mentor role six years ago. Within a few weeks, he gathered managers under a tent and said the firm had grown bloated and inefficient. The fix, he said, would be a "renovation," in which weak employees were let go.

Staff cuts began almost immediately. Since his return, head count is down by about 150, or 10%. Hundreds more may be cut in coming months, though some are expected to be replaced eventually. The budget for the holiday party, which in the past has had elaborate decorations, such as Christmas trees hanging inverted from the ceiling, has been trimmed by 20% this year.

Stung by public disclosures early this year of internal tumult, Mr. Dalio changed a decades-old system of making all high-level deliberations and decisions known to every member of staff. Instead, he decided to let only around 10% have the full measure of what he calls "radical transparency."

He wrote a new principle, not yet public, that says, "Expect those who receive the radical transparency to handle it responsibly and don't give it to them if they can't."

When an employee challenged Mr. Dalio in an open meeting on whether the response was proportionate to the leaks, he replied that as the inventor of the firm's management system, he determined it was.

Mr. Dalio founded Bridgewater in 1975 as a research shop based in his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment. He earned attention for his ability to predict macroeconomic trends.

At the core of the technology project now under way is a walled-off group called the Systematized Intelligence Lab, headed by David Ferrucci, who led development of the artificial-intelligence system Watson at International Business Machines Corp. before joining Bridgewater in 2013.

Though outsiders expected Mr. Ferrucci would use his talents to help find hidden signals in the financial markets, his job has focused more narrowly on analyzing the torrent of data the firm gathers about its employees. The data include ratings employees give each other through the day, called "dots."

The underpinning to his success, Mr. Dalio often says, is his belief that markets reflect the workings of a misunderstood economic machine, and interpreting its mechanics requires a relentless and often painful dedication to getting to the truth through "thoughtful disagreement." That's why employees are encouraged to challenge each other repeatedly and without reservation.

The economy, Mr. Dalio has written, is "really just a zillion simple things working together." Decades before computer-driven trading came into vogue, Bridgewater began tracking relations among what are now 100 million separate data points, such as international interest rates and retail sales, and creating investment algorithms.

The main hedge fund embodying these algorithms, Pure Alpha, uses the data to buy and sell stocks, bonds, currencies and other assets. The fund has long anticipated booms and busts around the world, including the looming financial crisis as early as 2006, the firm has told investors.

Mr. Dalio also believes humans work like machines, a word that appears 84 times in the Principles. The problem, he has often said, is that people are prevented from achieving their best performance by emotional interference. It is something he thinks can be overcome through systematic practice.

That applies to managing, too. Successful managers "design a 'machine' consisting of the right people doing the right things to get what they want," he wrote in the Principles.

The "Book of the Future" software to automate management, a project Mr. Dalio has also sometimes referred to as "The One Thing," later gained the more formal name of Principles Operating System. Abbreviated PriOS, it is an attempt to make management nearly as systematic as the firm's investing process.

Data are incorporated from a phalanx of personality tests that Mr. Dalio requires of his employees. In one, managers undergo written exams to determine their "stratum," an unconventional score for conceptual skills developed by the late Canadian-born psychoanalyst Elliott Jaques.

As applied at the firm, questions include "What is the biggest problem Bridgewater faces today?" The highest marks go to those found to have an innate ability to spot long-term trends. Mr. Dalio has the highest score at Bridgewater, and the firm has told employees he has one of the highest in the world.

Likewise, Bridgewater's software judges Mr. Dalio the firm's most "believable" employee in matters such as investing and leadership, which means his opinions carry more weight.

Mr. Dalio is always in search of new data with which to measure his staff. He once raised the idea of using head bands to track people's brain waves, according to one former employee. The idea wasn't adopted.

The push to automate management addresses a larger challenge, which is how this culture would survive without Mr. Dalio, who is 67 years old.

When he temporarily retreated from day-to-day management, the Mr. Dalio spent weeks at a time away from the firm's Westport, Conn., campus indulging pursuits such as scuba diving and, until he gave it up, bow hunting. He bought a submarine-equipped yacht, MV Alucia, for research expeditions in the open ocean.

To run Bridgewater in his absence, he brought in a collection of big-name outsiders.

Before long, he was expressing frustration with some in senior roles. There was James Comey, whom Mr. Dalio hired as general counsel in 2010, saying he would act as a "godfather" figure to improve justice at the firm.

Within three years, according to two former employees, Mr. Dalio had taken to calling Mr. Comey something else, a "chirper" who repeats stale ideas, as opposed to a "shaper," the Bridgewater ideal of a visionary leader.

Mr. Comey left in 2013, telling colleagues his personality didn't fit. Now director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he declined to comment.

An executive long seen as Mr. Dalio's heir apparent, Greg Jensen, ran afoul of his boss a year ago for allegedly talking about him beyond his back, which at Bridgewater is a sin second only to dishonesty. In a tribunal the firm convened, Mr. Jensen was found to have broken the rules. He lost his co-CEO title but remains co-chief investment officer. Mr. Jensen declined to comment.

"These types of interactions go on in any workplace in America," Bridgewater said in a written statement for this article. "The difference here is that instead of pretending it doesn't exist we address it openly and deal with it honestly. We show them to everyone and if necessary conflicts are decided by a vote."

Mr. Dalio frequently develops new ways to enforce his philosophy. He recently created a job category called Overseer, whose roughly dozen members are spread through the firm and act as the eyes and ears of the top leadership.

The Systematized Intelligence Lab is involved in several iPad applications that are part of employees' everyday lives, among them the "Dot Collector." It allows employees to rate each other on dozens of attributes and to hold snap polls on issues during meetings, including asking blunt questions such as whether a current conversation is a waste of time.

The data blend with others to produce "Baseball Cards" that show people's strengths and weaknesses in various categories, such as "touching the nerve," a prized attribute.

A job advertisement for the Systematized Intelligence Lab said it sought to "extract meaning and domain understanding from the wealth of text-based data our innovative applications generate." Several employees said they have felt that working at Bridgewater was as much experimental research into human decision-making as investing.

New apps in recent months shed light on Mr. Dalio's expanding technological vision. Software called "The Contract," loaded on staff iPads, instructs employees to formalize goals to be achieved over time and tracks how they follow through.

An app called "The Coach" lets people input a question and directs them to the relevant passage in Mr. Dalio's Principles document. The goal is an evolution of The Coach into an intelligent system that can assist in decision-making.

Those are initial uses of PriOS, the management software Mr. Dalio is developing. Future uses would include the ability to scan open positions at the company and have PriOS sort through the staff to find people with particular talents and strengths to fill jobs.

In other instances, employees at loggerheads over decisions wouldn't have to hash out each debate out loud. They would key their opinions into PriOS, and the software would rank their perspectives, consult with Mr. Dalio's Principles, and spit out the best way to proceed.

The ultimate vision is that PriOS would be able to predict outcomes of meetings before they are completed, and to guide people to take certain actions throughout the day. Within five years, Mr. Dalio aims for nearly three-quarters of management decisions to be determined by PriOS.

The role of many remaining humans wouldn't be to make individual choices but to design the criteria by which the system makes decisions, intervening when something isn't working.

Mr. Dalio's original written manifesto nods to the goal of automating decision-making. With greater use of the Principles, it says, "not only will they be understood, but they will evolve from 'Ray's principles' to 'our principles' and Ray will fade out of the picture."

That applies to managing, too. Successful managers "design a  machine' consisting of the right people doing the right things to get what they want," he wrote in the Principles.

The "Book of the Future" software to automate management, a project Mr. Dalio has also sometimes referred to as "The One Thing," later gained the more formal name of Principles Operating System. Abbreviated PriOS, it is an attempt to make management nearly as systematic as the firm's investing process.

Data are incorporated from a phalanx of personality tests that Mr. Dalio requires of his employees. In one, managers undergo written exams to determine their "stratum," an unconventional score for conceptual skills developed by the late Canadian-born psychoanalyst Elliott Jaques.

As applied at the firm, questions include "What is the biggest problem Bridgewater faces today?" The highest marks go to those found to have an innate ability to spot long-term trends.

Mr. Dalio has the highest stratum score at Bridgewater, and the firm has told employees he has one of the highest in the world.

Likewise, Bridgewater's software judges Mr. Dalio the firm's most "believable" employee in matters such as investing and leadership, which means his opinions carry more weight.

Mr. Dalio is always in search of new data with which to measure his staff. He once raised the idea of using head bands to track people's brain waves, according to one former employee. The idea wasn't adopted.

The push to automate management addresses a larger challenge, which is how this culture would survive without Mr. Dalio, who is 67 years old.

When he temporarily retreated from day-to-day management, Mr. Dalio spent weeks at a time away from the firm's Westport, Conn., campus indulging pursuits such as scuba diving and, until he gave it up, bow hunting. He bought a submarine-equipped yacht, MV Alucia, for research expeditions in the open ocean.

To run Bridgewater in his absence, he brought in a collection of big-name outsiders.

Before long, he was expressing frustration with some in senior roles. There was James Comey, whom Mr. Dalio hired as general counsel in 2010, saying he would act as a "godfather" figure to improve justice at the firm.

Within three years, according to two former employees, Mr. Dalio had taken to calling Mr. Comey something else, a "chirper" who repeats stale ideas, as opposed to a "shaper," the Bridgewater ideal of a visionary leader.

Mr. Comey left in 2013, telling colleagues his personality didn't fit. Now director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, he declined to comment.

An executive long seen as Mr. Dalio's heir apparent, Greg Jensen, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/schism-at-the-top-of-worlds-largest-hedge-fund-1454695374", which at Bridgewater is a sin second only to dishonesty. In a tribunal the firm convened, Mr. Jensen was found to have broken the rules. He lost his co-CEO title but remains co-chief investment officer. Mr. Jensen declined to comment.

"These types of interactions go on in any workplace in America," Bridgewater said in a written statement for this article. "The difference here is that instead of pretending it doesn't exist we address it openly and deal with it honestly. We show them to everyone and if necessary conflicts are decided by a vote."

Mr. Dalio frequently develops new ways to enforce his philosophy. He recently created a job category called Overseer, whose roughly dozen members are spread through the firm and act as the eyes and ears of the top leadership.

At the core of the technology project now under way is a walled-off group called the Systematized Intelligence Lab, headed by David Ferrucci, who led development of the artificial-intelligence system Watson at International Business Machines Corp. before joining Bridgewater in 2013.

Though outsiders expected Mr. Ferrucci would use his talents to help find hidden signals in the financial markets, his job has focused more narrowly on analyzing the torrent of data the firm gathers about its employees. The data include ratings employees give each other throughout the work day, called "dots."

The Systematized Intelligence Lab is involved in several iPad applications that are part of employees' everyday lives, among them the "Dot Collector." It allows employees to rate each other on dozens of attributes and to hold snap polls on issues during meetings, including asking blunt questions such as whether a current conversation is a waste of time.

The data blend with others to produce "Baseball Cards" that show people's strengths and weaknesses in various categories, such as "touching the nerve," a prized attribute.

A job advertisement for the Systematized Intelligence Lab said it sought to "extract meaning and domain understanding from the wealth of text-based data our innovative applications generate." Several employees said they have felt that working at Bridgewater was as much experimental research into human decision-making as it was investing.

New apps in recent months shed light on Mr. Dalio's expanding technological vision. Software called "The Contract," loaded on staff iPads, instructs employees to formalize goals to be achieved over time and tracks how reliably they follow through.

An app called "The Coach" lets people input a question and directs them to the relevant passage in Mr. Dalio's Principles document. The goal is an evolution of The Coach into an intelligent system that can assist in decision-making.

Those are initial uses of PriOS, the management software Mr. Dalio is developing. Future uses would include the ability to scan open positions at the company and have PriOS sort through the staff to find people with particular talents and strengths to fill jobs.

In other instances, employees at loggerheads over decisions wouldn't have to hash out each debate out loud. They would key their opinions into PriOS, and the software would rank their perspectives, consult with Mr. Dalio's Principles, and spit out the best way to proceed.

The ultimate vision is that PriOS would be able to predict outcomes of meetings before they are completed, and to guide people to take certain actions throughout the day. Within five years, Mr. Dalio aims for nearly three-quarters of management decisions to be determined by PriOS.

The role of many remaining humans at the firm wouldn't be to make individual choices but to design the criteria by which the system makes decisions, intervening when something isn't working.

Mr. Dalio's original written manifesto nods to the goal of automating decision-making. With greater use of the Principles, it says, "not only will they be understood, but they will evolve from  Ray's principles' to  our principles' and Ray will fade out of the picture."

(The following is a roundup of selected companies that have revealed securities sales in recent Form D regulatory filings. These companies are required to file a Form D notification within 15 days after the first sale of securities in an offering, which could indicate fundraising, acquisitions or other securities activity. The filings don't list the recipients of the securities being offered. However, they do list board members, so in cases where new investors have surfaced, we'll report them below.)

Awarepoint Corp., San Diego, a provider of tracking technology for managing workflow and assets in the health-care industry, has issued almost half of a $1.6 million round of debt, warrants and securities. In 2012, the company raised a $14 million round from Avalon Ventures, Cardinal Partners, Heritage Group, Icon Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, New Leaf Venture Partners, Top Tier Capital Partners and Venrock.

Bay Labs Inc., San Francisco, which uses deep learning to help medical professionals in developing countries interpret ultrasounds so they can better treat heart disease, has sold all but $400,000 of a $5.7 million equity round. In January, the company secured a $2.5 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures with participation from investors including Eleven Two Capital and the National Science Foundation.

CodeHS Inc., San Francisco, which runs programs for teaching coding to high-school students, has sold $2 million in equity. In January 2015, the company received $1.8 million in funding from investors including Chmod Ventures, Kapor Capital, Learn Capital, NewSchools Venture Fund, Seven Peaks Ventures and Stanford StartX Fund.

Healthsense Inc., Mendota Heights, Minn., which provides a range of remote monitoring, emergency response and wellness management products and services that focus on senior care, has added $400,000 to a debt offering, bringing the round total to $2.9 million. A February filing showed the company issuing the first $2.5 million of the round. Mansa Capital, Merck Global Health Innovation Fund and Radius Ventures are backers.

HNI Healthcare, Austin, Texas, which provides hospital medicine technology, has issued $7.4 million through an offering of debt and rights. An April 2015 filing showed the company issuing $8.4 million in equity, rights and securities. The company previously secured financing from Sante Ventures and Square 1 Bank. HNI Healthcare was formerly known as Hospitalists Now Inc.

Hayashi's Take: Who Might Trump Choose as CFPB Chief?

Two Republicans Look to Write the Next Dodd-Frank

Wells Fargo Scrambles to Deal With a New Crisis

CFPB Backs Away From Pursuing Auto Lenders Over Alleged Discrimination

Platinum Partners ' Executives Charged With $1 Billion Securities Fraud

Who Might Trump Choose as CFPB Chief?

Donald Trump's victory has thrown the future of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intso huge uncertainty, raising questions about its structure, budget and rules in the pipeline. But industry experts are increasingly focusing on a potential change at the agency's helm as the most logical first step.

Director Richard Cordray intends to stay in the role, said Jen Howard, the CFPB's communications chief. Mr. Cordray "was confirmed by a bipartisan group of 66 senators to serve a term until July 2018 and has no plans to step down," she said in a statement.

Still, experts say Mr. Trump could decide to remove him (an option some say is available to the president-elect) or Mr. Cordray might choose to pursue a new opportunity, such as seeking public office in his home state of Ohio.

Mr. Trump hasn't commented on the CFPB's future and representatives of his transition team have been mum about a personnel change at the agency. But a few names have been frequently mentioned among industry experts as potential picks for the top job.

Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R., Texas)

Mr. Neugebauer is retiring this month from the House, where he led his party's attack on the CFPB as chairman of the Financial Services Committee's subcommittee on financial institutions. He was closely involved in drafting of the Financial Choice Act, committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling's broad financial deregulation package. The proposal includes a raft of steps to transform the CFPB, including turning it into a five-person commission and putting its budget under congressional oversight.

In an interview last week, Mr. Neugebauer said that change at the CFPB will initially come not from the legislative process, but from Mr. Trump's "putting in people that will bring change to the process." He added that Mr. Trump would look at Mr. Cordray's performance to determine whether he could be relieved of his position for cause, such as malfeasance, neglect and inefficiency.

Is Mr. Neugebauer himself interested in leading the CFPB? "I really don't want to speculate on something I might or I might not do when the said opportunity really hasn't availed itself so far," he said.

Speculation over Mr. Neugebauer's interest in the job stems in part from comment he made during a house hearing in June 2015, remarking that if the next administration were to be run by the Republicans, the CFPB would be headed by a commission and that its director could be "Randy Neugebauer." He said in the interview he was using his name as an example rather than lobbying for the job.

Todd Zywicki

Mr. Zywicki is a law professor at George Mason University and a former policy-planning director at the Federal Trade Commission. A well-known critic of consumer financial regulation with strong ties to Republican lawmakers, he has made frequent appearances at congressional hearings. At one hearing earlier this year, he called the CFPB a "super-bureaucracy wielding an unprecedented combination of vast, vaguely defined substantive powers with no democratic accountability."

Mr. Zywicki didn't respond to repeated requests for comment.

Besides his deep knowledge of consumer financial laws, Mr. Zywicki would bring a unique experience as a change agent at the CFPB: his longtime association with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a leading proponent of the agency. In the early 2000s, the two law professors sparred at congressional hearings and in the media over revamping bankruptcy laws, with Ms. Warren advocating for consumers and Mr. Zywicki siding with industry.

Other names mentioned as possible candidates include Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute ; Alex Pollock, distinguished senior fellow at R Street Institute, another libertarian think tank; and J. Howard Beales, a George Washington University professor and former senior official at the Federal Trade Commission .

Mr. Pollock declined to comment and Mr. Beales couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Calabria said he hadn't talked to anyone on the transition team about the job, but "given the importance of having quality individuals willing to serve, I'd certainly have to give the position some consideration if asked to serve."

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Two Republicans Look to Write the Next Dodd-Frank

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo is a rare dealmaker who has negotiated across the Capitol's partisan divide. Texas GOP Rep. Jeb Hensarling's record has been defined more by trying to cut government than cutting deals with Democrats.

The fate and shape of the sweeping financial deregulation promised by President-elect Donald Trump and eagerly anticipated by investors pushing up bank stocks hangs on these two lawmakers, the point men in their respective chambers on financial policy. Mr. Crapo needs to win over enough pro-regulation Democrats to steer a bill through the closely divided Senate, without losing House Republicans, led by Mr. Hensarling, hungry for a wholesale rollback of postcrisis rules they believe stifle the economy.

The two conservatives share a desire to attack the landmark 2010 law named for their liberal Democratic predecessors, Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd and Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank. But they may not agree on the means to do it, or just how far to go.

Mr. Hensarling, embarking on his third and final two-year term chairing the House Financial Services Committee , has subscribed to the academic journal of the libertarian Cato Institute since age 18, and he got his political start as an aide to Texas conservative Sen. Phil Gramm. A die-hard Beatles fan, he has peppered wonky speeches with references to Kanye West and the Dalai Lama.

Mr. Hensarling borrows a mantra from Margaret Thatcher: "First you win the debate, then you win the vote." His staff pens strategies for congressional hearings with questions to cajole witnesses, such as Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, into statements that align with Mr. Hensarling's agenda.

The Texas congressman made Mr. Trump's shortlist for treasury secretary before the job was offered elsewhere. He turned down a chance to run the White House budget office to stay in Congress and navigate the deregulation push.

Mr. Crapo, expected to become chairman next year of the Senate Banking Committee, is a lawyer whose brother was a prominent Idaho state senator. He is a hunter favoring waterfowl and over roughly the past two years held meetings in each of Idaho's 208 towns.

In hearings, Mr. Crapo has highlighted common ground with Ms. Yellen and other witnesses on regulatory issues. "Mike's one of those guys that is a realist and understands that in legislation you don't get everything you want, but the good outweighs the bad," said Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.), one of a bloc of centrist banking panel Democrats who have negotiated with Mr. Crapo.

Messrs. Hensarling and Crapo share many views. Mr. Crapo toted to those town meetings a chart showing the federal deficit, while Mr. Hensarling keeps a running tally of the national debt on his committee's hearing room wall. Both took positions seen as far right even by some in their party by voting against the 2008 bank bailouts and to kill the U.S. Export-Import Bank . Both advocate curbs on the consumer-finance watchdog created by Dodd-Frank.

But the two men have sometimes taken different paths toward achieving their goals.

In 2011, Mr. Crapo joined the bipartisan "Gang of 6" senators proposing a 10-year deficit reduction plan.

Mr. Hensarling that year was GOP co-chair of a bipartisan "Super Committee" charged with striking a deficit-reduction deal. They failed amid finger-pointing by both parties.

In 2014, the two men joined an unsuccessful effort to overhaul the U.S. housing finance system.

Mr. Crapo struck a deal with some Democrats that would have narrowed, but not eliminated, a government backstop for the mortgage market. He directed staff to revise proposals if they couldn't win support from stakeholders, including the financial industry and Democrats.

Mr. Hensarling proposed to remove the government mortgage backstop. It served as a conservative baseline on the issue but didn't draw broad support.

When Mr. Crapo was lead Republican on the Senate banking committee two years ago, the atmosphere was relaxed enough that when staffers from either party inadvertently dressed alike, they shared a laugh and pinned a picture of the coincidence to an office bulletin board. That has been replaced by a chillier partisan climate the past two years under the tenure of Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), which has been marked by tensions over not just polices but small logistical matters like office space.

Republican and Democratic staffers have a similarly cool relationship on Mr. Hensarling's panel, and he clashes regularly with the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters of California, herself seen as a strong-willed partisan. She has regularly accused him of cutting out Democrats in launching investigations, calling one subpoena round "characteristically undemocratic."

Mr. Hensarling and his defenders say he works with Democrats when he has a willing partner, such as a 2015 pact with Sen. Charles Schumer of New York extending a terrorism insurance program.

They also note that the minority party's votes are needed to pass legislation in the Senate, but not in the House. Compromising with House Democrats before talks begin with the Senate, they say, can be counterproductive. "Why do I want to negotiate with myself?" Mr. Hensarling asked rhetorically in an interview. But he said he is "always willing to compromise policies to advance principles," adding: "At the end of the day we are going to be measured not by our speeches and our bills but the progress we made in actually making laws."

Mr. Crapo declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article.

The big challenge for both men in 2017 will be how they handle Dodd-Frank. Mr. Hensarling earlier this year proposed a bill that would scrap major parts of the law. It passed his committee without any Democratic support.

Mr. Crapo has worked on Dodd-Frank changes as well, and last year he joined a bipartisan group of eight lawmakers who agreed on more modest changes. The informal deal included giving small and regional banks relief from some of the law's regulatory obligations.

That deal could form the basis of a new law altering Dodd-Frank if Mr. Crapo can keep both Senate Democrats and Mr. Hensarling on board.

Pro First: Wells Fargo Scrambles to Deal With a New Crisis

By Emily Glazer and Ryan Tracy

Wells Fargo & Co. chief Timothy Sloan received a terse call last Tuesday from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .: That afternoon the regulators would publicly announce the bank had flunked a vital test and would be slapped with first-of-their-kind penalties.

The failure of the bank's so-called living will test, even as four other big banks passed, kicked off the latest crisis for Wells Fargo , which is still reeling from its sales-tactics scandal. And it poses yet another challenge for Mr. Sloan, who only took the bank's helm in October after the abrupt retirement of former CEO John Stumpf.

Within hours of the call, Wells Fargo finance chief John Shrewsberry was on a plane to Washington, D.C. to meet with regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Sloan jetted across the country the next day, the people added.

They left the talks believing regulators were concerned with the type of blueprint the bank was using to show how it would address a cataclysmic failure, the people said. At Wells Fargo , this involves multiple units of the bank being placed under bankruptcy protection or kept running on their own.

That differs from the models of the other large banks. These call for the bankruptcy of a firm's holding company, while individual units are kept running or sold off piecemeal.

Citigroup Inc . had success when outlining such a strategy to regulators this year. Bank of New York Mellon Corp . previously had a strategy similar to that of Wells Fargo , but switched to the latter approach. It passed regulatory muster last week.

Fed and FDIC officials previously have said they don't care what approach a bank chooses, so long as the firm meets legal requirements. And the failure letter the agencies sent to Wells Fargo didn't order it to change its bankruptcy approach.

Even so, Wells Fargo is now scrambling to address regulators' concerns. As a first step, it likely will move toward the model used by other banks, according to people familiar with the matter.

Another takeaway from the meetings for Wells Fargo : regulators thought the bank didn't devote enough resources to the test, or make enough changes to its approach when compared with other banks, some of these people said.

The living wills are a requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which sought to prevent bailouts partly by forcing big banks to develop a plan for how they could go through bankruptcy without taxpayer assistance. The law directed regulators to judge whether plans are credible and gave them power to sanction, or even break up, firms that are found lacking.

So the failure has big repercussions for Wells Fargo . It is a fresh blow as the bank is trying to restore its reputation following a September regulatory settlement that alleged the bank opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers' knowledge.

More immediately, the failure marked the first time the Fed and FDIC have imposed penalties on a bank under the living-wills process. As a result, Wells Fargo is now barred from creating new international banking units or acquiring any nonbank subsidiaries. If regulators aren't happy with the response to be submitted by March 2017, they could cap growth at the bank and, in two years, force it to divest certain assets or businesses.

The rebuff was also a blow to Messrs. Sloan and Shrewsberry. The bank had said in a disclosure in October that Mr. Sloan, who was then president, would take a "more prominent role" in overseeing all recovery and resolution planning initiatives. Mr. Shrewsberry meanwhile leads the management governance committee related to living wills.

In their letter last week to the bank, the Fed and FDIC were highly critical of Wells Fargo 's efforts. They said the firm "has not even completed an assessment" related to how it would keep operating critical services during a bankruptcy, for example. The regulators added that when it came to the bank's plan for potentially reorganizing legal entities it owns, "it is unclear whether or under what circumstances [Wells Fargo ] would take action or what type of actions it would consider taking."

Even areas that Wells Fargo had said previously it was focusing on came up short. In October, the bank said it adopted a policy to monitor, oversee and govern its subsidiaries. But its legal entities planning ended up being a sore spot in its assessment.

It isn't that Wells Fargo has failed to focus on its living-wills process. In 2014, it was the sole big bank to receive a passing grade. But Wells Fargo didn't receive a perfect score. Regulators said the blueprint had shortcomings that needed to be addressed in its revised plan for 2015.

In early 2016 regulators failed that plan. One problem: it contained inaccurate information that later had to be corrected. Wells Fargo , along with four other banks, was told to resubmit the plan.

Wells Fargo spent millions of dollars on consultants and reassigned employees to different groups across the firm to work on this, people familiar with the matter said. And in October Wells Fargo disclosed information on its progress, saying it reorganized the office related to living wills and expected to double that staff over the next six to 12 months.

Less than two months later, regulators told Wells Fargo it was the only bank whose makeup test didn't merit a passing grade.

WSJ Pro: CFPB Backs Away From Pursuing Auto Lenders Over Alleged Discrimination

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTON The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is quietly moving away from going after auto lenders over alleged discrimination against minority borrowers, one of the bureau's most controversial programs sharply criticized by industry executives and Republican lawmakers.

The shift in strategy was briefly noted in a blog post Friday by Patrice Ficklin, the CFPB's fair lending director. The post listed three "fair lending priorities in the new year": redlining, or intentionally avoiding mortgage lending in minority neighborhoods; mortgage and student-loan servicing; and small business lending.

To prioritize these areas, the bureau will be "shifting our focus from" auto lenders and credit cards, Ms. Ficklin wrote.

"We have examined over a dozen of the nation's largest auto lenders and achieved important market awareness and movement," she wrote, adding that the bureau plans to protect consumers through supervisory compliance programs tailored to each lender rather than enforcement actions.

Over the past three years, the CFPB has brought enforcement actions against four indirect auto lenders, meaning lenders that aren't auto dealers. The agency alleged their loan pricing systems, which gave discretion to auto dealers in setting loan rates, resulted in minority borrowers paying more than white customers.

In the most high-profile case, involving Ally Financial Inc ., the CFPB's methodology for determining racial bias raised questions, with Republicans accusing the bureau for overstepping the authority awarded to it by Congress.

One focus of a probe by GOP lawmakers was the CFPB's reliance on educated guesses to identify minority borrowers, using their last names and addresses. Critics say that may have resulted in white borrowers receiving checks from the government's settlement with Ally, often for hundreds of dollars. Auto lenders are prohibited by law from collecting data on the borrowers' race or ethnicity.

Some in the industry interpreted the latest development as the CFPB's recognition that it has gone too far in the auto-lender program and that its aggressive stance gave the bureau's opponents opportunities to attack it.

"It's pretty clear that the indirect auto initiative was a bad mistake and undermined the credibility of a lot of the other very valuable things that they have been doing," said Andrew Sandler, chairman and executive partner of BuckleySandler LLP.

The American Financial Services Association , a trade group that represents auto lenders, praised the CFPB's latest statement, saying the companies are regulated by states as well as several federal agencies.

A CFPB spokesman declined to comment.

EU Assesses Financial Industry Regulation in Era of Big Data

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine

BRUSSELS European authorities are considering regulating the use of consumer data tied to insurance and other financial products, as social media and technology ranging from the Apple Watch to fitness-tracking devices increase the amount of personal information that is available online.

In a bid to avoid unfair customer treatment and exploitation by insurers and lenders, the European Union 's top financial watchdogs launched a three-month period to consult stakeholders and the public.

"Internet and mobile devices have become a core part of our lifestyle, and the ways in which data is generated, collected, stored, processed and used have evolved at unprecedented rates," said Gabriel Bernardino, chairman of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority.

As a result, the continent's supervisors are trying to grasp what the "big-data phenomenon" means for consumers and the financial industry as a whole.

A sharp drop in the cost of storing data has helped foster so-called big data, initially fueled by the use of cellphones tracking everything from location and purchasing habits to self-expression via photos shared on Instagram .

Wearable devices tracking health and fitness provide insurers with details on how often an individual exercises, while telematic boxes in cars monitor the habits of drivers. Coupled with sophisticated algorithms, insurers and lenders can detect patterns in a process known as predictive analytics.

EU rules covering consumer and data protection haven't been revisited to incorporate such technological advances. While steps are being taken to address cybersecurity and protect sensitive data from hackers, rules tailored to information stemming from social media are lacking, officials say.

Statistics show that 81% of Europeans feel they don't have control over their personal data online, according to a survey conducted by Eurobarometer in 2015, and users often don't realize what social-media information is publicly available.

Regulators worry that new data-collection processes could encourage insurers and banks to change their pricing practices to the detriment of consumers. For instance, data showing that a client was loyal to a brand or brands could prompt companies to increase their prices.

Rates for household insurance, which is a legal requirement for renters or property owners in several EU countries, could rise as satellite imagery pinpoints which properties are more prone to flooding, earthquakes or elevated crime.

On the flip side, big data could help decrease regulatory and compliance costs for global investment banks required under new postcrisis rules to extensively report internal risk.

EU supervisors are also looking into how investment funds are using nonfinancial information such as social-media news and satellite images to develop trading strategies.

The Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities which includes the European Banking Authority , the European Securities and Markets Authority , and EIOPA said officials would decide next year whether to propose action to regulate data collection.

Donald Trump Selects Trading Firm Founder Vincent Viola as Army Secretary

By Alexander Osipovich, Damian Paletta and Bradley Hope

Vincent Viola, a West Point graduate who rose from trading gasoline futures on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange to build one of the world's largest high-speed trading firms, was tapped by President-elect Donald Trump as the next secretary of the Army.

Mr. Viola, who goes by "Vinnie," is well connected in both financial markets and national security circles. He is the billionaire founder and executive chairman of Virtu Financial Inc., a trading firm active on more than 200 exchanges world-wide. A U.S. Army veteran, he also helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point and is on West Point's Army Cyber Institute Advisory Board.

"Anyone who knows him can quickly see the military-style leadership that he brings to his business," said Jim Newsome, a former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission who has been friends with Mr. Viola for nearly two decades.

The son of a truck driver, Mr. Viola grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, N.Y., and has told friends he originally envisioned a career in the military but was thwarted by his father's sudden illness. After spending several years in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., he went to law school but never completed the bar exam.

Instead he became a Nymex trader in 1982. Using $10,000 culled from his Army pay, family and friends to buy a seat on the exchange, he developed a reputation as a brash and aggressive trader. He made millions of dollars betting on oil prices before and after the first Gulf war. In 2001, he became the exchange's chairman.

Mr. Viola's Army-style approach was in evidence when the Nymex was shut down for several days following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to Mr. Newsome. Mr. Viola had generators airlifted to the Nymex building in lower Manhattan and traders ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey so trading could resume less than a week after the attacks, Mr. Newsome said.

In 2002 Mr. Viola and his partners started the trading firm that would morph into Virtu. The company, which went public in 2015, is active in markets ranging from stocks to currencies to government bonds. Its market capitalization was $2.2 billion at the close of trading on Monday.

Mr. Viola isn't the only former Nymex trader set to take a job in the new administration. Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump's choice to lead the National Economic Council, and Mr. Viola both worked at the Nymex in the 1980s and the two are friends, according to people close to Mr. Viola and Virtu.

Mr. Cohn was most recently president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

A Virtu spokesman said Mr. Viola was unavailable for comment.

Former colleagues said Mr. Viola saw the opportunities in electronic trading earlier than many. He urged early employees to apply their technical know-how to new markets and spearheaded deals to gain scale, said Peter Kovacs, a former executive at Madison Tyler Holdings LLC. Madison was co-founded by Mr. Viola in 2002 and then merged with Virtu in 2011.

"Vinnie consistently pushed the firm to think bigger," Mr. Kovacs said.

Virtu specializes in market-making, the no-frills trading strategy where a firm buys and sells the same securities and collects a small profit based on the difference between the two prices. It is a strategy Mr. Viola first learned at the Nymex, said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill + Partners .

"He took the market-making skills he learned on the Nymex floor and automated them," said Mr. Repetto, a fellow West Point graduate and friend of Mr. Viola's.

Mr. Viola retained close ties to the Army at Virtu. Senior traders and executives at the firm have gone on team-building trips to historic battlegrounds such as Little Bighorn and Gettysburg, according to people close to Virtu. Retired Army Gen. John Abizaid sits on Virtu's board.

In 2013, Mr. Viola and Virtu Chief Executive Doug Cifu bought the Florida Panthers , a struggling professional hockey team. The new owners have sought to turn around the fortunes of the National Hockey League franchise by applying a focus on analytics. The strategy, which has become increasingly popular across sports, was made famous in Michael Lewis's best-seller "Moneyball."

Mr. Viola was a financial supporter of Mr. Trump during the campaign.

"The American people, whether civilian or military, should have great confidence that Vinnie Viola has what it takes to keep America safe and oversee issues of concern to our troops in the Army," Mr. Trump said in a statement.

Mr. Viola's selection fills another slot on Mr. Trump's national security and military team. He has already announced appointments for secretary of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. One key slot he still hasn't filled is director of National Intelligence.

Mr. Viola would be one of several billionaires put into key roles by Mr. Trump. The president-elect has rejected criticism of these selections by saying at recent rallies that he likes surrounding himself with successful business people with proven track records.

FSB Weighs In on Decline in Correspondent Banking

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine

BRUSSELS Stronger supervision and tough, transparent anti-money-laundering rules across the globe are necessary to rectify a decline in correspondent banking, according to international financial standards setter the Financial Stability Board .

The FSB, chaired by Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, has been assessing the decline in so-called correspondent banking relationships which allow money to move domestically or across borders between senders and recipients using different banks since 2015.

In a report Monday, the Swiss-based regulator said it planned to publish the results of an industrywide survey that garnered responses from more than 300 banks by April 2017, followed by final guidance in June.

A decline in correspondent banking relationships has piqued concern among the international banking community since it could impair the ability to send and receive overseas payments, reducing the ability to carry out cross-border business with smaller jurisdictions.

"A well-functioning correspondent banking system is essential for ensuring international payments," said Alexander Karrer, deputy state secretary at the Swiss Federal Department of Finance .

Mr. Karrer, who oversees the FSB's working group on correspondent banking, said the decline in correspondent banking relationships could adversely affect growth as well as the stability and integrity of the global financial system.

According to the FSB, the withdrawal from correspondent banking stems from heightened concerns around risks of money laundering or terrorism financing, particularly after banks such as BNP Paribas paid billions in fines over sanctions violations in recent years.

A World Bank survey conducted in 2015 showed that European banks suffered from the sharpest decline in relationships with banks abroad. The FSB said it was working closely with the World Bank , which will carry out studies in 2017 focused on emerging-market countries that could be suffering from severed ties with Western banks.

SEC Punishes Company Over Restricting Would-Be Whistleblowers

By Samuel Rubenfeld

The Securities and Exchange Commission penalized a company for impeding outgoing employees from communicating with the agency, the latest violation of a rule protecting would-be whistleblowers.

Virginia-based NeuStar, which last week agreed to go private, violated the rule by routinely entering into severance agreements that contained a non-disparagement clause forbidding former employees from engaging with the SEC, the agency said. The company, according to the SEC, voluntarily revised its severance agreements after the SEC began investigating.

"Public companies cannot use severance agreements to impede whistleblowers from communicating with the SEC about a possible securities law violation," said Antonia Chion, associate director of the SEC's enforcement division, in a statement.

NeuStar, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings, agreed to pay a $180,000 penalty, the SEC said. The company agreed to make reasonable efforts to tell those who signed the agreements that the company doesn't prohibit former employees from discussing potential violations of law to the SEC, it said.

Representatives from NeuStar didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

NeuStar is the latest company to face a penalty for muzzling would-be whistleblowers with restrictive employment agreements. It's the fourth company since August to be cited for such violations by the SEC, which had sent letters to a number of companies, asking them for years of non-disclosure agreements, employment contracts and other documents.

It was unclear whether NeuStar was a recipient of one of the letters.

NeuStar, a technology company that helps telephone carriers route calls and text messages, and has a compliance consultancy arm, last week agreed to be acquired by a private investment group led by Golden Gate Capital in a transaction valued at approximately $2.9 billion, including debt.

Platinum Partners ' Executives Charged With $1 Billion Securities Fraud

By Rob Copeland and Erica Orden

In June 2014, the founder of hedge fund Platinum Partners sent a panicked email to his partner.

"It can't go on like this," wrote Mark Nordlicht, fretting about mounting requests from investors for their money back. "This is code red."

For two more years Platinum pressed on, until federal prosecutors Monday filed a criminal indictment alleging that Mr. Nordlicht and others operated perhaps the largest fraud since Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Authorities estimated that $1 billion from more than 600 Platinum investors may have been swindled.

Mr. Nordlicht was arrested Monday, along with Platinum's former president, and four others, accused of faking the firm's performance figures to collect a hefty cut of all investment gains and project a veneer of financial stability. All pleaded not guilty Monday and declined to comment.

Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers described the scheme as "Ponzi-esque."

"Platinum Partners held no more value than a tarnished piece of cheap metal," Mr. Capers said.

Platinum's collapse caps a stunning fall for a hedge fund that had once boasted of one of the most superlative track records in the hedge-fund world. Its main funds reported no down years and virtually no down months. Mr. Madoff had made similar claims.

Paradoxically, Platinum struggled to attract money from skeptical, deep-pocketed professional investors, instead turning time and again to a tightknit group of fellow observant Jewish businesspeople with whom Platinum's founders were acquainted socially.

Little did the investors know, however, that Platinum's business, which the firm said involved making eclectic investments like loans to bankrupt companies and in thinly traded pharmaceutical stocks, was under fire.

In the spring of 2015, Mr. Nordlicht and other Platinum officials "schemed to meet a sudden wave of over $70 million in redemptions," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission , which Monday filed a parallel civil lawsuit against Mr. Nordlicht and others.

Platinum's then-president, Uri Landesman, who was arrested Monday, coined a phrase for the moment. As he urged investors to stay put, he sent a note to Mr. Nordlicht, saying "Hail Mary time," according to the SEC.

Platinum was desperate to keep its investors calm, because Mr. Nordlicht was doubling down on hard-to-sell energy investments despite a steep drop in the price of oil, according to investor documents and people close to the firm. The federal complaint described how Platinum kept the valuation of some such holdings steady in face of evidence that they were close to worthless.

Jeffrey Shulse, a former executive for one of those investments, Black Elk Energy, separately turned himself into authorities in Houston on Monday. An attorney for Mr. Shulse said his client planned to plead not guilty and called the charges "a clear case of overreaching."

Platinum was launched in 2003 by Mr. Nordlicht, 48 years old, a second-generation commodities-options trader who once had a seat on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

The firm launched with $25 million raised partly by Murray Huberfeld, the 55-year-old son of a kosher restaurateur in the working-class neighborhood of Canarsie in Brooklyn.

Mr. Huberfeld was arrested and charged earlier this year by federal prosecutors in Manhattan in an alleged scheme to bribe the president of the New York City correction officers' union to funnel $20 million of union money into Platinum. The union declined to comment, and the now-former president has pleaded not guilty and said he didn't accept bribes.

Mr. Huberfeld also pleaded not guilty to those charges, which stem from a sprawling public-corruption investigation into the union, the New York Police Department, and the fundraising activities of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.

Mr. Huberfeld wasn't named in Monday's indictment, but a person familiar with the matter said he was the anonymous "Co-Conspirator 1" in the document. His nephew, David Levy, is one of the Platinum executives arrested Monday.

Mr. Levy also worked for a period at Beechwood Re, an investment adviser that Platinum used to "essentially steal investor money," the SEC said Monday. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Platinum's principals owned a sizable stake of Beechwood, which wasn't disclosed to Beechwood clients even as the firm directed their money into Platinum's funds and overlapping investment.

"The complaint makes clear that Beechwood was kept in the dark about what Platinum has been accused of doing," a Beechwood spokesman said.

Late last year, Platinum formally told investors it wouldn't be able to cash out all of their money, alarming some of them, said people close to the firm. Messrs. Nordlicht and Huberfeld went on an investor relations blitz, calling up some personally to profess their optimism about Platinum's financial health, the people said.

Mr. Nordlicht told some that he himself was lending money to Platinum personally, one of the people said.

Concurrently, the finances of Platinum's flagship fund was becoming dire, according to the SEC complaint.

In July 2015, the fund's master bank account was overdrawn by $1.5 million, according to the SEC complaint. A principal wired $1.65 million into Platinum's bank account. That money was then allegedly used to fund $50,000 in payments to two investors.

Platinum also used its second-largest fund to provide cash to the flagship, even though both entities prohibited borrowing from each other for anything other than investments, the SEC complaint said. Investors who put money into the second fund had their money diverted to pay off the flagship's short-term loans, without their knowledge or consent, the SEC said.

Near year-end, Messrs. Huberfeld and Nordlicht discussed fleeing the U.S. for Israel, according to the indictment.

"Don't forget books," Mr. Huberfeld wrote to his partner in an email, the indictment said. "Assume we are not coming back to ny &Take passport."

They didn't move there permanently.

In court Monday, Mr. Nordlicht appeared unshaven in a green checkered shirt and jeans. Directed to post a $500,000 bond, Mr. Nordlicht asked his retired father and wife to vouch for it.

The judge asked his wife whether she was now supporting the family. She answered, "I suppose." The bond was posted.

Companies Face Delays Getting Cash Out of China

By Vipal Monga and Nina Trentmann

French construction-materials company Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA , is finding it harder to take its money out of China.

The conglomerate like all multinationals operating there faces new delays in recent weeks as Chinese regulators impose tougher restrictions on the movement of capital out of the country to slow the yuan's decline.

"The process of authorization is going to become longer now," said Javier Gimeno, who heads Saint-Gobain 's China operations. "The procedures will be controlled more strictly."

Nearly 7% of Saint-Gobain 's world-wide group sales come from Asia and Oceania, a large part of that from China. The new rules are adding confusion and anxiety to a process that had been getting much easier over the past year, he said. The shift could cause some multinationals to rethink future investments in a country where once-sure payoffs are suddenly facing an uncertain return, analysts say.

As of late November, firms that want to exchange yuan into dollars in China now need approval for any transaction greater than $5 million. They also face tighter limits on amounts they can transfer in and out of bank accounts in China to affiliates in other countries, in a practice known as "cross-border sweeping."

"We hear a lot questions from corporates about whether they will be able to repatriate their money in the future," said Alexander Tietze, managing director at Acon Actienbank AG, a German bank that advises companies on Chinese investments. He expects foreign investments in China to slow, and cautioned that foreign takeovers or plans for new joint ventures could fail because of the controls.

With the Chinese economy struggling, multinationals have fewer opportunities to reinvest there, which makes it more difficult for them to do much with money trapped in China.

"A majority of clients are currently consolidating and restructuring their China business," said Bernd-Uwe Stucken, a lawyer with Pinsent Masons LLP in Shanghai. Some clients are closing down their business, with new investments being the exception to the rule, Mr. Stucken said.

Adding to the confusion: it is unclear where the limits are, because regulators haven't published official rule changes, but instead have given only informal guidance to banks, according to Daniel Blumen, partner at Treasury Alliance Group, a consulting firm.

Calls to the People's Bank of China weren't returned.

One official at a large multinational said that companies can now only sweep amounts out of the country equal to 30% of their Chinese assets. That is down from 100% under previous guidance, but those figures couldn't be independently confirmed.

One banker at a large European bank said transfers that once took between one to three days can now take more than a week to complete.

The European Chamber of Commerce in China, which represents more than 1,600 European companies, is aware of several cases in which payments by multinational firms are stuck in China awaiting new approvals, said Joerg Wuttke, president of the chamber. The new regulatory scrutiny is disruptive to company operations, and "exacerbates uncertainties regarding the predictability of China's investment environment," he said.

China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange , known as SAFE, and the People's Bank of China , are reacting to worrisome indicators for investment in the economy. In 2015, foreign firms and individuals poured roughly $250 billion into China, according to the World Bank . While that is almost double the amount in 2009, the recent trends have been negative. Last year marked a second-consecutive foreign-investment decline, and a 14% drop from 2013.

Meanwhile, the yuan has been weakening, and many multinationals have decided they would rather convert their funds to dollars and transfer them out in anticipation of further weakening, said Ker Gibbs, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

China's currency is down roughly 7% so far this year and the capital flight has diminished the country's stockpile of foreign currency to $3.05 trillion at the end of November, from $3.23 trillion in January, according to the People's Bank of China .

The new measures affect small and medium-size firms more severely, as they usually operate with limited amounts of cash. Nevertheless, the new regulation is also hurting bigger firms, said Mikko Huotari, head of the China foreign relations research program at Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think-tank.

The recent clampdown has whipsawed corporate expectations, said Caroline Owen, founder of RMB Global Advisors, a firm that advises companies on using the yuan.

"China said it is making all these changes to open up the border, but the message companies are now getting is that it's conditional," she said "When things get tough, China will just roll things back."

Lloyds Buys Bank of America's Credit Card Unit MBNA for $2.4 Billion

By Max Colchester

LONDON  Lloyds Banking Group PLC said Tuesday it is buying Bank of America Corp .'s U.K. credit-card business MBNA Ltd., for 1.9 billion ($2.35 billion), the British bank's first major acquisition since its bailout during the financial crisis.

Lloyds, which is still partly owned by the U.K. government , has been trying to expand its credit-card business as it looks to diversify away from its main mortgage business and boost its bottom line.

Bank of America decided to sell the unit, which has about five million customers and a loan book of around 7 billion, in 2011 as it ditched several international credit-card businesses to bolster its balance sheet.

The deal is a further testament to Lloyds's return to health. The bank had been banned from acquisitions following its 20 billion taxpayer bailout during the financial crisis. The U.K. government is in the process of slowly selling off its remaining 6.9% stake in the bank.

But some analysts questioned whether it makes sense to buy a large credit-card portfolio when uncertainty over Brexit looms over the U.K. economy. "The risk cannot be ignored," said Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood, adding that the deal will likely boost Lloyds's share of the U.K. credit-card market from around 15% to 26%.

Lloyds said it expects the acquisition to increase group revenue by 650 million a year and enhance its net interest margin by 0.1 percentage point. Despite the cost of the deal, Lloyds said it expects to be able to continue paying a progressive dividend.

The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2017, subject to competition and regulatory approval, the bank said. Lloyds is also looking at other potential acquisitions, including in insurance.

The Quicken Loans Signal

Faster than a Rocket Mortgage, Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions can send a message that the Obama era of arbitrary, political prosecutions of business is over. Soon after confirmation, he and his new team should review and then kill the government's dubious civil case against Quicken Loans.

The Justice Department last year sued the Detroit-based mortgage lender on charges that it knowingly approved loans that violated Federal Housing Administration rules for government mortgage insurance. The charges didn't make Quicken Loans unique, as the Obama Administration has spent years wringing settlements out of lenders without having to prove its charges in court.

Last week Justice issued a press release celebrating that since January 2009 it has extracted more than $7 billion using a single legal technique False Claims Act cases related to federally insured mortgages. In the larger campaign to blame the 2008 financial crisis entirely on private business rather than federal housing and monetary policy the government has raided banks for more than $100 billion.

So it was no surprise that Justice wanted a bite of Quicken's earnings. What may have surprised the feds, given the normal corporate desire to write a check and make Washington go away, is that Quicken founder Dan Gilbert had no desire to settle.

Mr. Gilbert tells us that "it would lack integrity and ring hollow to our 17,000 employees to pay some large, unwarranted settlement and admit things we did not do just because a young lawyer walks in with a business card that says  DOJ' on it." Mr. Gilbert, who owns the National Basketball Association 's Cleveland Cavaliers , seems ready to compete in the courtroom, too.

The government's case is built on a handful of internal Quicken emails with disparaging comments about particular loans. But if some great offense has been committed, it's hard to find it in the records kept by the alleged victim.

A critical metric the FHA uses to judge lenders is known as the "compare ratio." Specifically, it compares the rate of early defaults and claims generated by one lender with the rate generated by other lenders who cover the same area. A lender that never originates a bad loan would have a ratio of 0% and a lender with an average rate of defaults would be marked at 100%. According to the government's own data, Quicken's compare ratio is 35% not merely better than average but the best score among all large national lenders.

Mr. Gilbert says his company offered to "step in to FHA's shoes and take over providing insurance on our FHA loans; meaning we would collect the premiums on the loans and pay out any claims. Not surprisingly, they weren't interested."

Federal Judge Reggie Walton recently rejected the government's attempt to hold a trial in Washington instead of Quicken's home state of Michigan. But not holding a trial at all would be the wisest course, not least because Justice is likely to lose in court. By dropping the case, Mr. Sessions can show that the Justice Department is done extorting business for political show. All Trump cabinet officers should send similar tidings to ring in a new era of growth.

CFPB Director Cordray Has No Plans to Step Down

There have been speculations in Washington that Richard Cordray, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, may be stepping down in the new year. That could happen if Donald Trump fires him once he takes office, or Cordray himself resigns to avoid confrontation with the new Republican government. Don't count it, says CFPB Communications Director Jen Howard. "Director Cordray was confirmed by a bipartisan group of 66 senators to serve a term until July 2018 and has no plans to step down," she said, responding to a question from the Wall Street Journal.

Fed OK's Rule Requiring Liquidity Disclosures

The Federal Reserve on Monday approved a rule requiring large U.S. banks to publicly disclose specific liquidity metrics, offering markets a clear view into a firm's financial strength and resiliency. A 2014 rule adopted by regulators required banks with $50 billion or more in assets to hold a minimum amount of high-quality liquid assets that can be converted to cash quickly over a 30-day period. The central bank has now issued a separate rule on specific disclosures those large banks will have to make under the regulation, including providing their average consolidated liquidity coverage ratios every quarter.

Another Assault on Cash? Australia Cracks Down on Black Economy

The Australian government has announced a Black Economy Taskforce that might recommend taking steps to limit the circulation of higher denomination bank notes, such as the Australian $100 bill. The Taskforce, announced on Monday in the government's mid-year budget update, will examine "whether new responses to the black economy are required in light of technological and economic changes." The Taskforce will include representatives from the Reserve Bank of Australia and the local bank regulator, ARRA, and will provide interim recommendations in March. "Black economy activities disadvantage honest taxpayers, undermine the integrity of our tax and welfare systems and reduce the amount of revenue collected by governments," the government said. A week ago the RBA said Australian currency in circulation had risen to the highest level "in several decades", while transactional use of cash had been declining. (adam.creighton@dowjones.com)

Promoting Productive Lending Through Regulation

What should regulators do when they face the trade off of instituting bank regulations that would reduce the supply of credit but would promote the allocation of credit to its best uses? Using U.S. credit data, "http://www.bis.org/publ/work596.pdf" find that high liquidity and capital requirements are needed to produce a regulated economy that supports "productive lending."

Quick Hits: Central Banks of Thailand and Taiwan Expected to Hold Rates; Turkey's central bank is seen raising rates substantially next year, after standing pat Tuesday

The central banks of Thailand and Taiwan are expected to leave their policy interest rates unchanged at meetings this week, and the Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ won't reduce its ETF purchases even as stock prices in Tokyo have seen strong gains. Here are quick hits on central banking from around the world.

Thailand's Central Bank Expected to Keep Policy Rate Stable

Thailand's central bank is expected to maintain its policy interest rate at 1.5% for the 13th straight meeting, according to 15 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. "Concerns about private debt levels will prevent further easing," Moody's Analytics says, "unless serious downside risks materialize." Says Amonthep Chawla, head of research at CIMB Thai Bank: "Thailand's economy is recovering at a slow pace, which is seen to require low interest rate and high liquidity to support growth." The Bank of Thailand's latest decision on its benchmark interest rate is due at 0705 GMT Wednesday.

Taiwan's Central Bank Likely to Keep Rates on Hold

Taiwan's central bank is expected to hold fire at its policy meeting Thursday. Economists say recent economic data ranging from export figures to industrial production point to positive growth momentum in the fourth quarter, relieving pressure on the central bank to take further action to support the economy at this stage, though they disagree on what the bank's next step might be. Citi says the central bank has done enough to support the economy and it is now down to the government to pull its weight. Ma Tieying, an economist at DBS Group Research, sees the benchmark discount rate remaining at 1.375% over the next four quarters, though she expects the next move to be upward. Capital Economics takes a dimmer view. "We think the recovery is likely to tail off early next year," the research firm says. If the economy slows as Capital expects, the bank's easing cycle will resume, it says.

Bank of Japan's ETF Purchases Encounter X-Factor: Trump

The Bank of Japan's 6-trillion-a-year ($51 billion) purchases of stock funds known as ETFs is coming under scrutiny, thanks to Donald Trump. At a post-policy meeting press conference Tuesday, BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda was asked several times about whether he will proceed with the aggressive purchases even after recent big gains in Tokyo shares, driven by expectations for Mr. Trump's promised high-spending policies. Mr. Kuroda denied the possibility of any reduction and reiterated that the measure wasn't stock-price manipulation but was aimed at generating inflation. But the news conference suggests such grilling could only intensify should stocks rise more.

Kuroda Briefly Slips in Explaining BOJ Policy

Investors aren't the only ones who sometimes get confused about the Bank of Japan's policies: Even Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda slips up. At a news conference Tuesday, Mr. Kuroda started answering a question about interest rates by saying the central bank sought to keep the yield of the 10-year government bond around 0.1%. If true, that would be a big policy shift, but he quickly corrected himself and affirmed, in line with current policy, that the yield target is zero. At a previous news conference, Mr. Kuroda said his five-year term would expire in March 2018, only to correct himself a few minutes later and confirm that his term ends in April 2018.

EUR/SEK Moving Lower Ahead of Riksbank Meeting

EUR/SEK is moving lower as market participants don't believe the Riksbank will cut rates on Wednesday, says Danske Bank. Danske expects the Riksbank to prolong the current quantitative-easing program by six months and to cut the repo rate by an additional 10 basis points to minus 0.60%. "We stress that the Riksbank will, at least, be very dovish, which should put a floor under EUR/SEK into the monetary policy decision."

Substantial Rate Rises by Turkey Likely in 2017

Turkey's central bank interest rate decision is only likely to be a pause in the tightening cycle, says Capital Economics, adding that it expects substantial interest-rate increases next year. The central bank Tuesday held all interest rates steady, surprising economists who had expected a rate increase. "The accompanying statement didn't give much away, although it did suggest that economic weakness GDP contracted by 1.8% y/y in Q3 meant another rate hike wasn't warranted today," says Capital Economics.

The risk of inflation would dramatically rise if the Fed were "http://www.fedfin.com/images/stories/client_reports/FedFin, which enables policy makers to put a floor under short-term interest rates, according to a new research paper commissioned by the American Bankers Association. Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics writes that without paying interest on reserves or using overnight reverse repurchase agreements, the Fed wouldn't be able to put a floor under rates, because other policy tools no longer function as they used to. Eliminating those tools would create a shadow monetary-policy transmission, forcing the Fed to rely on nonbanks and government-sponsored enterprises for its short-term floor, Ms. Petrou argues.

 The Fed could also try to sell assets, but that could be destabilizing and cause it to lose a lot of money, she writes.

Hayashi's Take: Who Might Trump Choose as CFPB Chief?

Two Republicans Look to Write the Next Dodd-Frank

Wells Fargo Scrambles to Deal With a New Crisis

CFPB Backs Away From Pursuing Auto Lenders Over Alleged Discrimination

Platinum Partners' Executives Charged With $1 Billion Securities Fraud

Who Might Trump Choose as CFPB Chief?

Donald Trump's victory has thrown the future of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intso huge uncertainty, raising questions about its structure, budget and rules in the pipeline. But industry experts are increasingly focusing on a potential change at the agency's helm as the most logical first step.

Director Richard Cordray intends to stay in the role, said Jen Howard, the CFPB's communications chief. Mr. Cordray "was confirmed by a bipartisan group of 66 senators to serve a term until July 2018 and has no plans to step down," she said in a statement.

Still, experts say Mr. Trump could decide to remove him (an option "http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-versus-cordray-can-new-president-fire-cfpb-chief-on-day-one-1480719515" to the president-elect) or Mr. Cordray might choose to pursue a new opportunity, such as seeking public office in his home state of Ohio.

Mr. Trump hasn't commented on the CFPB's future and representatives of his transition team have been mum about a personnel change at the agency. But a few names have been frequently mentioned among industry experts as potential picks for the top job.

Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R., Texas)

Mr. Neugebauer is retiring this month from the House, where he led his party's attack on the CFPB as chairman of the Financial Services Committee's subcommittee on financial institutions. He was closely involved in drafting of the "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/understanding-the-financial-choice-act/", committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling's broad financial deregulation package. The proposal includes a raft of steps to transform the CFPB, including turning it into a five-person commission and putting its budget under congressional oversight.

In an interview last week, Mr. Neugebauer said that change at the CFPB will initially come not from the legislative process, but from Mr. Trump's "putting in people that will bring change to the process." He added that Mr. Trump would look at Mr. Cordray's performance to determine whether he could be relieved of his position for cause, such as malfeasance, neglect and inefficiency.

Is Mr. Neugebauer himself interested in leading the CFPB? "I really don't want to speculate on something I might or I might not do when the said opportunity really hasn't availed itself so far," he said.

Speculation over Mr. Neugebauer's interest in the job stems in part from comment he made during a house hearing in June 2015, remarking that if the next administration were to be run by the Republicans, the CFPB would be headed by a commission and that its director could be "Randy Neugebauer." He said in the interview he was using his name as an example rather than lobbying for the job.

Todd Zywicki

Mr. Zywicki is a law professor at "http://www.wsj.com/articles/creightons-take-free-market-thinkers-eye-trump-era-as-their-renaissance-1479212303" and a former policy-planning director at the Federal Trade Commission. A well-known critic of consumer financial regulation with strong ties to Republican lawmakers, he has made frequent appearances at congressional hearings. At one hearing earlier this year, he called the CFPB a "super-bureaucracy wielding an unprecedented combination of vast, vaguely defined substantive powers with no democratic accountability."

Mr. Zywicki didn't respond to repeated requests for comment.

Besides his deep knowledge of consumer financial laws, Mr. Zywicki would bring a unique experience as a change agent at the CFPB: his longtime association with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a leading proponent of the agency. In the early 2000s, the two law professors sparred at congressional hearings and in the media over revamping bankruptcy laws, with Ms. Warren advocating for consumers and Mr. Zywicki siding with industry.

Other names mentioned as possible candidates include "http://www.wsj.com/articles/dodd-frank-should-be-repealed-1475096111" , director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute; "http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-names-fed-critic-others-to-treasury-landing-team-1479823288" , distinguished senior fellow at R Street Institute, another libertarian think tank; and J. Howard Beales, a George Washington University professor and former senior official at the Federal Trade Commission.

Mr. Pollock declined to comment and Mr. Beales couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Calabria said he hadn't talked to anyone on the transition team about the job, but "given the importance of having quality individuals willing to serve, I'd certainly have to give the position some consideration if asked to serve."

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Two Republicans Look to Write the Next Dodd-Frank

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/two-republicans-look-to-write-the-next-dodd-frank-1482164782" is a rare dealmaker who has negotiated across the Capitol's partisan divide. Texas GOP Rep. Jeb Hensarling's record has been defined more by trying to cut government than cutting deals with Democrats.

The fate and shape of the sweeping financial deregulation promised by President-elect Donald Trump and eagerly anticipated by investors pushing up bank stocks hangs on these two lawmakers, the point men in their respective chambers on financial policy. Mr. Crapo needs to win over enough pro-regulation Democrats to steer a bill through the closely divided Senate, without losing House Republicans, led by Mr. Hensarling, hungry for a wholesale rollback of postcrisis rules they believe stifle the economy.

Pro First: Wells Fargo Scrambles to Deal With a New Crisis

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-scrambles-to-deal-with-new-crisis-1482233400", even as four of its rivals passed, kicked off the latest crisis for the bank, which is still reeling from its sales-tactics scandal.

The development poses yet another challenge for chief Timothy Sloan, who took the bank's helm in October after the abrupt retirement of former CEO John Stumpf. Wells Fargo is now scrambling to address regulators' concerns. As a first step, it likely will move toward a different model used by other banks, according to people familiar with the matter.

WSJ Pro: CFPB Backs Away From Pursuing Auto Lenders Over Alleged Discrimination

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-backs-away-from-pursuing-auto-lenders-over-alleged-discrimination-1482197054" is quietly moving away from going after auto lenders over alleged discrimination against minority borrowers, one of the bureau's most controversial programs sharply criticized by industry executives and Republican lawmakers.

The shift in strategy was briefly noted in a blog post Friday by Patrice Ficklin, the CFPB's fair lending director. The post listed three "fair lending priorities in the new year": redlining, or intentionally avoiding mortgage lending in minority neighborhoods; mortgage and student-loan servicing; and small business lending. To prioritize these areas, the bureau will be "shifting our focus from" auto lenders and credit cards, Ms. Ficklin wrote.

Virginia-based NeuStar, which last week agreed to go private, violated the rule by routinely entering into severance agreements that contained a non-disparagement clause forbidding former employees from engaging with the SEC, the agency said. The company, according to the SEC, voluntarily revised its severance agreements after the SEC began investigating.

Platinum Partners' Executives Charged With $1 Billion Securities Fraud

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/platinum-partners-executives-charged-with-1-billion-securities-fraud-1482154926" Partners were arrested Monday morning and charged with defrauding investors in one of the biggest such cases since Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme.

As recently as this fall, Platinum told investors it oversaw more than $1 billion scattered in eclectic investments like loans to bankrupt companies and thinly-traded pharmaceutical stocks.

The conglomerate like all multinationals operating there faces new delays in recent weeks as Chinese regulators impose tougher restrictions on the movement of capital out of the country to slow the yuan's decline. As of late November, firms that want to exchange yuan into dollars in China now need approval for any transaction greater than $5 million. They also face tighter limits on amounts they can transfer in and out of bank accounts in China to affiliates in other countries, in a practice known as "cross-border sweeping."

Promoting Productive Lending Through Regulation

What should regulators do when they face the trade off of instituting bank regulations that would reduce the supply of credit but would promote the allocation of credit to its best uses? Using U.S. credit data, "http://www.bis.org/publ/work596.pdf" find that high liquidity and capital requirements are needed to produce a regulated economy that supports "productive lending." They conclude: "Our analysis thus provides broad support for Basel III's  multiple metrics' framework."

The Fed Should Take a Stress Test

The Federal Reserve "enjoys" imposing stress tests on "everybody else," so why doesn't it undergo its own, asks Alex Pollock of the conservative R Street Institute.

Finance & Markets: EU to Scrutinize Data Use

BRUSSELS -- European authorities are considering regulating the use of consumer data tied to insurance and other financial products, as social media and technology ranging from the Apple Watch to fitness-tracking devices increase the amount of personal information that is available online.

In a bid to avoid unfair customer treatment and exploitation by insurers and lenders, the European Union's top financial watchdogs launched a three-month period to consult stakeholders and the public.

"Internet and mobile devices have become a core part of our lifestyle, and the ways in which data is generated, collected, stored, processed and used have evolved at unprecedented rates," said Gabriel Bernardino, chairman of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority.

As a result, the continent's supervisors are trying to grasp what the "big-data phenomenon" means for consumers and the financial industry as a whole.

A sharp drop in the cost of storing data has helped foster so-called big data, initially fueled by the use of cellphones tracking everything from location and purchasing habits to self-expression via photos shared on Instagram.

Wearable devices tracking health and fitness provide insurers with details on how often an individual exercises, while telematic boxes in cars monitor the habits of drivers. Coupled with sophisticated algorithms, insurers and lenders can detect patterns in a process known as predictive analytics.

EU rules covering consumer and data protection haven't been revisited to incorporate such technological advances. While steps are being taken to address cybersecurity and protect sensitive data from hackers, rules tailored to information stemming from social media are lacking, officials say.

Statistics show that 81% of Europeans feel they don't have control over their personal data online, according to a survey conducted by Eurobarometer in 2015, and users often don't realize what social-media information is publicly available.

Regulators worry that new data-collection processes could encourage insurers and banks to change their pricing practices to the detriment of consumers. For instance, data showing that a client was loyal to a brand or brands could prompt companies to increase their prices.

Rates for household insurance, which is a legal requirement for renters or property owners in several EU countries, could rise as satellite imagery pinpoints which properties are more prone to flooding, earthquakes or elevated crime.

On the flip side, big data could help decrease regulatory and compliance costs for global investment banks required under new postcrisis rules to extensively report internal risk.

EU authorities are also looking into how investment funds are using nonfinancial information such as social-media news and satellite images to develop trading strategies.

The Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities -- which includes the European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority, and EIOPA -- said officials would decide next year whether to propose action to regulate data collection.

Breach Adds to Hunger for Insurance

Cyberinsurance is the fastest-growing insurance product in America, fueled by a slate of recent corporate and government hackings.

Yahoo Inc. on Wednesday disclosed that an unauthorized third party stole data associated with more than 1 billion user accounts in 2013, the company's second disclosure of a data theft this year. In October,a distributed denial-of-service attack left hundreds of websites unreachable, including Twitter Inc. and Netflix Inc.

PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts that the now roughly $3 billion corporate cyberinsurance market will grow to $7.5 billion in premiums by 2020, driven partly by rising prices. The growth would be in contrast to flat or falling prices in most othertypes of insurance.

"Nothing else is growing as quickly as cyber," said Bob Parisi, cyberproduct leader for brokerage Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan Cos. "Some of the leading carriers are telling us they are doubling their book every year."

Rising demand will allow insurance firms to raise prices between 5% and 10% in 2017, with larger increases for retailers and health-care companies, said insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. For most other types of commercial insurance, the broker predicted price declines.

But such rapid growth for a young product could leave insurance companies exposed to risks that they don't fully understand and unexpected costs.

Unlike with natural disasters or car accidents, insurers don't have years of actuarial data to rely upon when pricing cyberinsurance plans.And while insurers can spread out their property risk by insuring cars or buildings in multiple states or countries, it is hard to do the same with cyberinsurance. A single cyberattack could affect many companies around the world.

"Risk used to have some sort of geographic boundary," but cyberrisk "knows no boundary," said Inga Beale, chief executive officer at Lloyd's of London, an insurance and reinsurance market.

For example, October's attack was aimed at web-technology provider Dynamic Network Services Inc., known as Dyn, which helps direct traffic across the internet. Before the attack, some insurance companies might not have known which of their customers used Dyn, making it difficult to predict how exposed they might be to a Dyn outage, said Scott Stransky, assistant vice president at AIR Worldwide, a risk-modeling firm.

"Because of how competitive the cyberinsurance world is, there are fewer and fewer questions being asked" before policies are priced and sold, he said.

The need for experts has meant competition to hire experienced cyberinsurance underwriters is fierce. Marsh joined this year with analytics firm Cyence to help its clients assess their cyberrisk, and broker Aon PLC agreed in October to acquire cybersecurity specialist Stroz Friedberg Inc.

Stroz Friedberg is working with Yahoo on its two reported data breaches, people familiar with the matter said.

Insurers including American International Group Inc. have invested in or joined with firms that focus on cyberrisk in recent years.

Most companies with cyberinsurance policies have payout limits of $10 million to $25 million, according to a survey by Aon.

The average payout from an insurance company for a data breach is $665,000, according to an October study by cyberrisk assessment company NetDiligence.

Data entry may not be sexy, but a startup sees opportunity.

New York-based HyperScience, an artificial-intelligence upstart, sees potential business for eliminating data entry and paper-based back office work.

Started in 2014, the company has been developing its AI software that can read handwritten documents and convert those into a digital form.

"One of the things it does very well is data entry," said Chief Executive and founder Peter Brodsky. "It will achieve super-human accuracy."

HyperScience on Wednesday said it has completed an $18 million Series A round of funding led by Felicis Ventures, with participation from FirstMark Capital, SV Angel BoxGroup and Shana Fisher.

The AI startup has about 30 employees, half based in New York and the others in Bulgaria.

HyperScience's software is an on-premises program that the company installs and charges a flat annual fee for use.

Yahoo and Other Breaches Drive Surge in Corporate Hacking Insurance; Cyberinsurance is the fastest-growing insurance product in America

Cyberinsurance is the fastest-growing insurance product in America, fueled by a slate of recent corporate and government hackings.

Yahoo Inc. on Wednesday "http://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-discloses-new-breach-of-1-billion-user-accounts-1481753131" associated with more than one billion user accounts in 2013, the company's second disclosure of a data theft this year. In October, a distributed denial-of-service attack left hundreds of websites unreachable, including Twitter Inc. and Netflix Inc.

PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts that the now roughly $3 billion corporate cyberinsurance market will grow to $7.5 billion in premiums by 2020, driven partly by rising prices. The growth would be in contrast to flat or falling prices in most other types of insurance due to a lack of major catastrophes in recent years.

"Nothing else is growing as quickly as cyber," said Bob Parisi, cyber product leader for brokerage Marsh, a unit of Marsh & McLennan Cos. "Some of the leading carriers are telling us they are doubling their book every year."

Cyberinsurance plans are typically narrow and only apply to data breaches, including the cost of notifying customers and complying with state regulations.

Rising demand will allow insurance firms to raise prices between 5% and 10% in 2017, with larger increases for retailers and health-care companies, said insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. For most other types of commercial insurance, the broker predicted price declines.

But such rapid growth for a young product could leave insurance companies exposed to risks that they don't fully understand and unexpected costs.

Unlike with natural disasters or car accidents, insurers don't have years of actuarial data to rely upon when pricing cyberinsurance plans. And while insurers can spread out their property risk by insuring cars or buildings in multiple states or countries, it is hard to do the same with cyberinsurance. A single cyberattack could affect many companies around the world.

"Risk used to have some sort of geographic boundary," but cyberrisk "knows no boundary," said Inga Beale, chief executive officer at Lloyd's of London, an insurance and reinsurance market.

For example, October's attack was aimed at web-technology provider Dynamic Network Services Inc., known as Dyn, which helps direct traffic across the internet.

Stroz Friedberg is working with Yahoo on its two reported data breaches, people familiar with the matter said.

Insurers including American International Group Inc. have invested in or joined with firms that focus on cyberrisk in recent years.

Most companies with cyberinsurance policies have payout limits of $10 million to $25 million, according to a survey by Aon. Large companies can buy policies with limits above $100 million, to as high as about $500 million. While most big U.S. companies have purchased cyberinsurance, coverage remains scant among small businesses and outside the U.S.

Companies are increasingly worried about hacks that cause website outages or damage physical infrastructure, and some insurers offer coverage for lost revenue due to a cyberattack. The growth of internet-connected household devices, from thermostats to watches to videogame consoles, also raises concerns that hackers could use those devices to store malicious software or conduct attacks.

The average payout from an insurance company for a data breach is $665,000, according to an October study by cyberrisk assessment company NetDiligence. Business-interruption losses could be much larger, experts say.

Insurance executives say the October attack probably didn't cause insurance losses because cyberinsurance for business interruption usually only kicks in after a website has been down for several hours. But it raised alarms among insurers and their clients.

"That was one of the first events where I was like,  Holy hell, we're going to have an aggregation problem in the industry,'" said Emy Donavan, North American head of cyber for Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty.

Flight-Tracking App Hopper Raises $62 Million in Expansion Bid; A year after offering ticket bookings, the Canadian startup seeks wider international profile

Hopper Inc. has raised 82 million Canadian dollars (US $61.7 million) as it moves to expand its flight price-tracking mobile app to more countries and gain more airline partners abroad.

Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec, a large Canadian pension fund, was the lead investor and invested C$40 million. The remainder of the Series C financing came from existing investors Brightspeak Ventures, Accomplice, OMERS, Investissement Quebec and BDC Capital IT Venture Fund.

The app has raised C$104 million to date. Hopper Chief Executive and co-founder Frederic Lalonde said the company wouldn't disclose valuation, but added, "We're growing substantially."

In addition to tracking flight prices, Hopper began booking tickets through its app last year and is selling about $1 million a day in tickets, according to the company. Its app, available in iTunes and the Google Play store, has been downloaded more than 10 million times.

Hopper is a mobile-only price tracker, and Mr. Lalonde said people's purchasing habits are very different on their phones compared with what they do online. He said about 90% of Hopper's sales come as a result of people receiving push notifications.

He said Hopper, whose logo is a running rabbit, has the ability to compete because of its massive data set.

"Underneath the cute running bunny there's a massive big-data play," said Mr. Lalonde.

He said Hopper is able to predict flight prices because it tracks data around travel bookings throughout the Web, not just its own data.

The company has also seen some success in suggesting flight purchases to customers. If a customer is tracking flights from New York to Rome, Hopper may suggest a flight deal for the same dates from New York to Milan, even if the customer wasn't tracking those locations.

"People are buying a trip that a machine told them to look at rather than what they asked for," he said.

Mr. Lalonde said he believes the future of e-commerce is in predicting consumer behavior.

As Hopper seeks to expand internationally, the company will use the funding to shore up its infrastructure and develop payment systems and partnerships abroad, Mr. Lalonde said. The company plans to ramp up its staff in the next year, from 40 employees to 120.

Databricks Raises $60 Million to Provide Big-Data  Platform; Open-source specialist looking to expand overseas

Databricks Inc. wants to help companies that don't have the same engineering might as a Google or a Facebook to leverage big data, in industries ranging from health care to media.

"The rest of the Fortune 500 are struggling," Databricks Chief Executive Ali Ghodsi said.

The company announced on Thursday it raised $60 million in new capital from existing investors New Enterprise Associates and Andreessen Horowitz. Valuation wasn't disclosed for the round, and the company has raised $107.5 million to date.

Databricks launched in 2013 to commercialize Apache Spark, an open-source data-processing engine. Databricks has about 400 customers, including Capital One, Riot Games, Under Armor's MyFitnessPal, Viacom, NBC Universal and Chegg.

Mr. Ghodsi said the company will use the funding to expand both in the U.S. market, where it already has a strong foothold, and in Asia and Europe.

He said the company continues to see growth in health care. In one instance, the technology is being used to compare patients' electronic medical records to DNA sequences and seek for correlations between genes and particular diseases.

Additionally the company has made inroads among financial institutions as they use more cloud services. It can be used to detect fraudulent transactions.

The company is also used widely in media companies, the industrial internet and among federal agencies.

In addition to its data platform, Databricks also provides Spark training. In 2015, the company trained more than 22,000 people.

Major Surgery Needed for Health-Care Reform

The proposal of James C. Capretta and Scott Gottlieb does little more than tweak the current market for individual coverage ("The Four Legs of a New Health-Care System," op-ed, Dec. 1). No one has been bold enough to address the fundamental failure -- the exchanges aren't markets in any meaningful sense. They function more like regulated utilities with severe limits on price and product differentiation. If insurance is priced based on the expected average cost of all potential applicants (i.e., community rated), only those who are less healthy than average will be willing to purchase insurance. Behavior termed "adverse selection" lies at the heart of the rapidly deteriorating Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.

Perhaps there is a big-data approach to address the incomplete information problem. Unlike the rigid community rating in the exchanges, each policy could be priced to reflect its expected costs. This would largely eliminate the incentives underlying adverse selection and could increase voluntary participation by healthier individuals.

Insurance companies could decline to insure individuals who they deem uninsurable. A "residual market," an industry-supported insurer of last resort, an alternative to a medical high-risk pool, would be available at an affordable premium to anyone who is unable to obtain coverage in the competitive "voluntary" market.

This describes the existing state-based markets for workers' compensation insurance. Republicans say they want the states to play the lead role in individual health-insurance markets. The states already know how to do this. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has a model act in its files. Enough with tweaks, it's time to be bold.

Republicans should take control of the dialogue and make health care the primary issue, dismissing ObamaCare as a failed partisan attempt addressing the wrong problem, i.e., the cost of insurance rather than the cost of health care. The primary focus should be on reducing the cost of health care and making it available. Both would be served by strengthening the authors' suggestions to deregulate the market for medical services by going further to open up the medical delivery system to various paramedical professionals like physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, midwives, pharmacists, etc. Doing so would free up the upper-tier skills of M.D.s for services where they're really required.

Tim Mahar

Rockledge, Fla.

What is missing is a recommendation to increase price transparency and thereby promote competition in the provision of medical services based on price. After all, should the retail cost of an MRI, what a person with a high-deductible plan is asked to pay, really exceed what the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays by more than a factor of 10? What if medical-service providers had to compete for customers? Do you think there would be that large a spread for any medical service?

James Patek

Fripp Island, S.C.

---

The four-legged health-care plan collapses because it doesn't address the essential issue of the individual mandate. It's unfair that some people opt to go uninsured and then show up in the emergency room where care must be delivered, while others pay their premiums, whether they use medical services or not, and are essentially subsidizing the uninsured. The individual mandate must be continued to maintain fairness for all and for the four-legged system to remain standing.

Michael Mayer, M.D.

Westfield, N.J.

---

A fifth principle should be included: a change in the medical tort system. Defensive medicine contributes huge costs to the current system. Indeed, no true estimate can be made as the pervasive climate of defensive medicine works in ways that even the practicing physician cannot accurately quantify. This is because much of the most modern medicine still includes enormous expert opinion differences, often unique to the individual case. Therefore physicians trained in this litigious environment order far too many expensive tests in an effort to protect themselves from lawsuits in the event of a poor outcome. My educated guess is that 25%-30% of medical costs are generated for this sole reason.

Technology
Apple , SoftBank Held Talks on Tech Fund

Apple Inc . has held talks about investing in a $100 billion fund being raised by Japanese internet and telecommunications company SoftBank Group Corp ., a move that would provide Silicon Valley cash -- and cachet -- to what would be the world's largest technology fund.

Apple and SoftBank have discussed an investment of as much as $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who cautioned that an agreement hasn't been completed. The status of the talks couldn't be learned.

An Apple investment would connect the world's most valuable company -- Apple 's market value is nearly $600 billion -- with one of the world's largest pools of investment capital.

The SoftBank Vision Fund, which aims for a launch next year, is targeting $100 billion and is seeded by SoftBank, one of Japan's largest mobile-phone providers and owner of Sprint Corp . It marks an ambitious effort by SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to position his company as a leader in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, in which everyday objects such as thermostats, watches and cars are connected online.

By investing, Apple also would hope to gain insight on emerging technologies, the people familiar with the matter said. Such a move also would reflect a shift in Apple 's investment strategy, which until recently focused on small stakes in young technology companies.

Earlier this year, Apple invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing Technology Co ., China's homegrown ride-sharing competitor to Uber Technologies Inc . SoftBank is also an investor in Didi. "We're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property," Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on a conference call in July.

SoftBank itself is investing at least $25 billion in the fund and is completing an investment of as much as $45 billion from Saudi Arabia's government fund. The sovereign-wealth fund of Abu Dhabi also is considering a large investment, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Son said last week after a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump that he plans to invest as much as $50 billion of the fund in the U.S.

Apple and SoftBank have business ties stretching back nearly a decade. In 2008, the companies struck a deal to make SoftBank the exclusive iPhone seller in Japan. The partnership drove record sales, helping to make SoftBank Japan's third-largest cellular carrier by 2011.

Mr. Son has praised late Apple CEO Steve Jobs , whom he once compared to Leonardo da Vinci, and remains close with Mr. Cook.

SoftBank distributes iPhones and iPads to its roughly 20,000 employees, and Mr. Son has said he rarely touches a personal computer.

Mr. Son also is close to Terry Gou , the head of Foxconn Technology Group , the Taiwan-based iPhone assembler formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co . After his meeting with Mr. Trump last Tuesday, Mr. Son was photographed carrying a piece of paper with Foxconn's logo next to SoftBank's. Earlier this year, SoftBank bought U.K.-based microchip manufacturer ARM Holdings PLC , a supplier of microprocessors for the iPhone.

S. African group snaps up 30% stake in UK insurer Hastings

Rand Merchant, a South African investment group, has snapped up a 30 per cent stake in UK motor insurer Hastings.

Hastings said on Wednesday that RMI would spend around 490m on the shares, buying most of them from the insurer s largest shareholder, Goldman Sachs. It will pay between 248p and 255p per share, a premium to Tuesday s closing price of 221p, reports Oliver Ralph in London.

Hastings floated last year at 170p. The shares jumped 5 per cent on news of RMI s investment.

RMI will have the right to nominate a board member, and a standstill agreement restricts its ability to buy more shares. This is not the group s first foray into insurance. RMI also owns stakes in South African insurers Discovery, MMI and Outsurance.

The deal, which is due to complete by next May, is subject to regulatory approval in the UK and South Africa.

Gary Hoffman, Hastings chief executive, said:

RMI has a number of investments in insurance businesses in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Given this experience, Hastings will look to explore potential areas of cooperation with RMI and OUTsurance in the future that would accelerate execution of our existing strategy including in the areas of home, data analytics, mobile propositions and operational efficiencies.

Neustar Inc., an advertising-technology company that provides data and analytics to marketers, on Wednesday said it agreed to be bought by a private investment group led by Golden Gate Capital for about $1.8 billion.

Stockholders will receive $33.50 per share in cash, a 21% premium to Tuesday's closing price and a 45% premium to Neustar's closing stock price on Nov. 11 the day before private-equity firm Golden Gate Capital's disclosure of an equity position in the company.

The deal is valued at $2.9 billion including debt and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2017.

"We believe this transaction will enable us to continue to execute against our strategy and strengthen our market position as a leader in marketing, risk, security and communication solutions," said Lisa Hook, Neustar's president and chief executive, in a statement.

Over the past few years, Neustar has aggressively moved into the marketing technology space with the help of several acquisitions, as it seeks to become a major player in the information services market and compete with the likes of Oracle, Adobe and Salesforce.

Last year, it bought MarketShare, a marketing analytics company that helps advertisers plan and analyze their ad spending and figure out which channels will drive the most sales, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ad-tech-company-neustar-agrees-to-buy-marketshare-for-450-million-1446757618".

Neustar has also hired several high-profile advertising executives including Steven Wolfe Pereira, who was named chief marketing officer of the firm earlier this year.

Earlier this year, Neustar had announced it was seeking to split its company to separate its number portability business, which helps carriers and businesses switch customer phone numbers between companies, from its information management and marketing businesses. That split is now off the table, according to a person familiar with matter.

Neustar said it has "built a robust market position around unique, hard-to-replicate data sets and the data science that provides authoritative identities, updated in real time."

The transaction is another sign of the consolidation taking place in the marketing and ad tech space. Last month, for example, Adobe acquired video ad buying software company TubeMogul for about $450 million.

Neustar's shares jumped 20% to $33.08 in morning trading. Before the offer was made public, the shares were down 43% from three years ago but were up 12% in the past year.

The terms of the deal to be taken private include a 30-day period for Neustar to solicit alternative proposals.

Conversica Raises $34 Million Series B for Business-Focused AI Chat; Software firm has been developing an artificially intelligent sales assistant and will soon make assistants to tackle other business problems

In 2016, chatbots and virtual assistants attracted interest from investors chasing a future where most interactions with businesses will happen through an artificially intelligent machine.

But Conversica has been working toward that vision for six years. The Foster City, Calif.-based company has been selling an artificially intelligent sales assistant, and with new funding in hand, is planning to tackle other business problems.

"Most other companies are really very early on," said Conversica Chief Executive Alex Terry. "It's helpful to see the rest of world coming around to the view Conversica has had for several years."

Mr. Terry said the company has $18 million in annually recurring revenue, while many comparable companies have yet to generate income.

Conversica was expected to announce Wednesday that it has raised an additional $34 million in Series B funding. Providence Strategic Growth Capital Partners LLC led the round, with participation from Toba Capital, Wellington Financial LP and Recruit Holdings Co. Ltd. Existing investor Kennet Partners and founder Ben Brigham also invested.

PSG Managing Director Gopi Vaddi and Toba Capital Partner Wilder Ramsey has joined Conversica's board.

Conversica has used conversational artificial intelligence to develop an assistant that it says can make sales teams more efficient. The technology works with email and SMS texting, and it can help minimize the time salespeople spend sending emails and following up with potential clients.

Mr. Terry said that although there are fears about the impact artificial intelligence will have on jobs, most customers using Conversica have actually hired more salespeople because they are seeing higher closing rates.

He compared the shift to what happened at banks when they launched ATMs. He said that despite fears there would be fewer bank tellers, the technology helped lead to creating more bank locations. Although there weren't as many bank tellers at each location, there was still an overall increase in bank tellers.

"Like any technological evolution, there are short-term changes and long-term changes," he said.

Conversica says customers include IBM and Epson and other technology companies. The company has also worked with auto dealers like Fiat Chrysler.

Mr. Terry said other Conversica assistants are still under development, but the company has already began to try to solve other business problems. For example, Conversica has helped auto companies schedule appointments for tuneups at the dealership.

Business News: Apple , SoftBank Held Fund Talks

Apple Inc . has held talks about investing in a $100 billion fund being raised by Japanese internet and telecommunications company SoftBank Group Corp ., a move that would put Silicon Valley cash -- and cachet -- into what would be the world's largest technology fund.

Apple and SoftBank have discussed an investment of as much as $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who cautioned that an agreement hasn't been completed. The status of the talks couldn't be learned.

An Apple investment would connect the world's most valuable company -- Apple 's market value is nearly $600 billion -- with one of the world's largest pools of investment capital.

The SoftBank Vision Fund, which aims for a launch next year, is targeting $100 billion and is seeded by SoftBank, one of Japan's largest mobile-phone providers and owner of Sprint Corp . It marks an ambitious effort by SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to position his company as a leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, in which everyday objects such as thermostats, watches and cars are connected online.

By investing, Apple also would hope to gain insight on emerging technologies, the people familiar with the matter said.

Such a move also would reflect a shift in Apple 's investment strategy, which until recently focused on small stakes in young technology companies. Earlier this year, Apple invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing Technology Co ., China's homegrown ride-sharing competitor to Uber Technologies Inc . SoftBank is also an investor in Didi.

"We're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property," Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on a conference call in July.

SoftBank itself is investing at least $25 billion in the fund and is completing an investment of as much as $45 billion from Saudi Arabia's government fund. The sovereign-wealth fund of Abu Dhabi also is weighing a large investment, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Son said last week after a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump that he plans to invest as much as $50 billion of the fund in the U.S.

Apple and SoftBank have business ties stretching back nearly a decade. In 2008, the companies struck a deal to make SoftBank the exclusive iPhone seller in Japan. The partnership drove record sales, helping to make SoftBank Japan's third-largest cellular carrier by 2011.

Mr. Son has praised late Apple CEO Steve Jobs , whom he once compared to Leonardo da Vinci, and remains close with Mr. Cook.

SoftBank distributes iPhones and iPads to its roughly 20,000 employees.

Mr. Son also is close to Terry Gou , the head of Foxconn Technology Group , the Taiwan-based iPhone assembler formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co . After his meeting with Mr. Trump last Tuesday, Mr. Son was photographed carrying a piece of paper with Foxconn's logo next to SoftBank's. Earlier this year, SoftBank bought U.K.-based microchip manufacturer ARM Holdings PLC , a supplier of microprocessors for the iPhone.

Funds eye alternative data to gain alpha edge; Analysis: Asset management

Managers' push to uncover 'tradable signals' using digital fingerprints raises privacy fears

A money manager might once have dispatched a junior grunt to the local Sears department store to gauge how sales were doing. This year a hedge fund could be peering into your emails for hints on how Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, will do in the critical Christmas quarter.

One of the latest technological weapons deployed by the most sophisticated asset managers desperate for an investment edge involves doing just that, albeit in a roundabout way.

There are technology firms that offer companies the ability to scan incoming emails. Software "cookies" can also look for emails sent from the likes of Amazon, Walmart or Best Buy, check for sales receipts and then log that data in a database. That data then lands in the lap of hedge funds via a third-party vendor.

Scouring emails for such nuggets of information is just the tip of the " alternative data " iceberg. Almost everything we do leaves a digital fingerprint, which can be scraped, aggregated and sold to investment firms looking for tradable signals, or to use the jargon - market-beating "alpha".

"The buyside is struggling more and more to find alpha, but data is alpha, and more and more of it is becoming available every day," says Tammer Kamel, co-founder and chief executive of Quandl, a US alternative data provider. "The demand is there, the supply is now there as well, and we want to sit in the middle of this."

Supply is certainly swelling. The world's annual data generation will more than double each year for the foreseeable future, and reach 44 zettabytes (trillions of gigabytes) by 2020, according to IDC .

Luckily, computing power has kept pace. Today's high-end Nvidia video cards are so powerful they would have been classified as the world's most powerful supercomputer before 2002, Goldman Sachs analysts noted.

Coupled with huge strides in artificial intelligence - particularly in areas such as "deep learning" - this is allowing investment groups to mine enormous data sets to unearth insights they hope will keep their returns ahead of rivals.

Take scanned email receipts. Earlier this autumn, GoPro, the action camera maker loved by daredevils, reported a terrible quarter of sinking sales , sending its shares tumbling. Yet by using a database of electronic receipts extracted from more than 3m email inboxes, Quandl says it could see ahead of time that revenues would disappoint.

The potential of alternative data has long been known to hedge funds, but traditional asset managers, looking for ways to improve performance, are now employing it too. For example, UK asset manager Schroders has set up a "Data Insights" team to "enhance and complement the existing skills of our fund managers and analysts".

"Global trends in digitalisation, social media, open data and technology are all creating vast streams of alternative data that are often highly unstructured and extremely obscure. However, they contain valuable and often unique insights," the investment group's latest annual report said.

The investment industry's push into alternative data raises some awkward questions. First, some money managers are concerned the personal data are not always scrubbed completely from the data sets they are sold. The majority of vendors do a good job, but standards are far from uniform, they say.

"We talk about it all the time," said Wesley Chan, director of stock selection research at Acadian Asset Management. "On one hand, we're excited about the potential; on the other, we're racing to delete apps on our phone. The data vendors claim to anonymise the data through aggregation, but it doesn't always work perfectly."

Mr Kamel stresses Quandl , one of the companies with a better reputation, is obsessed about scrubbing off personal information and says there is a "healthy paranoia" among the company's clients about the issue.

"No one wants to be on the wrong side of this," he says. "We make it our mission to mitigate 100 per cent of those risks. One fiasco in this space and the consequences for a fund would be dire."

Scraping, selling and buying data are perfectly legal in most countries, as long as safeguards are taken. Even so, Mr Chan warns mishaps are probable. "Six months ago I would have said we just have to live with it, nothing is private any more anyway. But at some point there will have to be some sort of bill of rights to control it," he says. "This will continue until there's a scandal, which is likely to happen."

If fund managers begin to lean more on alternative data to help make investment decisions, some believe it ultimately has the potential to dislodge quarterly corporate earnings reports and monthly economic data from the centre of investors' radars.

So far big data can only offer clues on what these market-moving releases will show. But in time, it is conceivable that our digital fingerprints will provide an accurate, instantaneous gauge that will render traditional investment information obsolete.

"As this perfect storm of technological sophistication comes together, we have never been closer to charting out a real-time map of consumer behaviour in both the real and digital world," Tabb Group, a research firm, notes.

The Political Fallout From Wells Fargo's Latest Penalty; Democrats seize on latest slap at Wells Fargo to defend postcrisis rules

Democrats seized on "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-sanction-wells-fargo-declaring-living-will-deficiencies-1481664744" at Wells Fargo & Co. to defend postcrisis rules against an anticipated attack from President-elect Donald Trump.

The news "is a reminder that Wall Street reform is working to rein in the megabanks that crashed our economy and got bailed out by taxpayers," Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. "Even one too big to fail bank is too many, and we need watchdogs that will continue to impose tough rules and strong penalties to make banks simpler and safer, not the opposite."

Wells Fargo said in a statement that while it is disappointed by the regulators' latest decision it will work closely with the agencies to better understand their concerns and took early regulator feedback "very seriously and took several steps to address it," including creating a special office assigned to deal with the living wills process.

Some policy analysts said they expect Tuesday's announcement by the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to stoke further pressure from some politicians to use this process to break up the biggest banks repeating arguments made in recent months that Wells Fargo is "too complex to manage."

"I fully expect Democrats to begin pounding the table once again on big bank break up bills and even Glass-Steagall, if only to call President-elect Donald Trump out on his campaign proposal" to reinstate the Depression-era law that separates commercial banking from investment activities, said Issac Boltansky, an analyst for Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, an investment firm.

Even though Tuesday's decision was unrelated to the earlier scandal, "this appears to be a clear case where the legal and reputational risk of one politically potent problem creates franchise-value risk for a large bank," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

Wells Fargo's failure of the living wills regulatory test is "the latest in a series of embarrassments for Wells, which was once viewed as the Main Street good guy in contrast with its slicker Wall Street competitors," banking analyst Ian Katz wrote in a Tuesday evening note. Mr. Katz of Capital Alpha Partners wrote that while the "pain" from the sales tactics scandal this fall had largely slowed down in headlines, recent reported actions by other agencies indicate "regulators and lawmakers haven't let up."

Still, the penalties "could have been worse," wrote Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen and Co. He said that "this could have been far more consequential if Hillary Clinton had won the White House," noting that she had "said she could demand that any bank that failed its living will submission be broken up." Mr. Trump, he added "did not make a similar pledge, which suggests the risk of a structural change is minimal."

Startups Cautiously Prep for Health-Care Law Change; Some customers are expected to hold off on new investments until there is more clarity to Trump's promised revamp of Obamacare

Count Paul Magelli among the entrepreneurs already preparing for a repeal of the federal health-care law.

President-elect Donald Trump has promised to scrap the Affordable Care Act, which affects companies throughout health care. That has startups readying for a period of uncertainty about the law's replacement and the possibility that some customers will hold off on new investments until there is more clarity.

Mr. Magelli, chief executive of Apervita Inc., a Chicago-based supplier of data analytics to health-care providers, has been making more customer calls since the election to see if clients' budgets and timelines are changing.

"We are literally doing a bottom-up review and re-planning around likely time scales for those projects," Mr. Magelli said.

He added that he expects potential customers like the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been developing a digital-health initiative, will be among those whose plans change.

The health-care law has encouraged the use of medical products and services by widening health-insurance coverage and other provisions. Mr. Trump's choice of Affordable Care Act critic Tom Price (R., Ga.) to serve as secretary of the Health and Human Services Department makes the likelihood of major changes even higher.

Expecting a shift, health systems, self-insured employers and other groups that buy medical technologies will ask if specific purchases will help them today and in a post-repeal era, said Mohamad Makhzoumi, general partner of New Enterprise Associates. They probably won't freeze new purchases but startups should expect longer sales cycles, he said.

"It's fair to say we are taking a wait-and-see approach and have not made any decisions to change our 2017 plans at this time," said Bryce Williams, vice president at Blue Shield of California, a nonprofit health plan.

Businesses that have passed the startup phase and are looking to land large sales could face delays because of health systems evaluating major capital investments more carefully, said Sarah Krevans, CEO of Sutter Health, a health system in Northern California. But technologies that improve outcomes and delight patients are sure to attract buyers.

"As a not-for-profit system, we're going to be interested in that in any environment," Ms. Krevans said.

In case purchasing behaviors do change, startups like New York-based Wellth Inc. are diversifying. Wellth, whose app helps chronically ill patients comply with their treatment plan, began by piloting with university hospitals. But it is now making a push to sell its services to life insurance and pharmaceutical companies as well.

Wellth Chief Executive Matt Loper recently met with drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S to discuss how his technology could increase adherence to medication regimens.

"That's a completely new segment for us," Mr. Loper said. "We came up with the strategy right after the election."

A repeal of the health-care law would have varied effects on venture-backed medical insurers such as Oscar Insurance Corp., which is already diversifying its business. Oscar formed after the law's passage to sell insurance to consumers through exchanges, but it has struggled to meet revenue goals, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

In August, $2.7 billion-valued Oscar said it would withdraw from individual insurance markets in Dallas-Fort Worth and New Jersey. Should the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, be repealed, there would be fewer compelling reasons for healthier people to buy insurance on health exchanges, which has potential to hurt a company like Oscar even more.

But the startup could benefit if the law were revamped to eliminate caps on insurance profits, which could allow the company to make more money down the line. Should the law be changed to lift requirements on what health plans must offer, that could also enable Oscar to offer more types of plans and tailor them to specific groups.

New York-based Oscar, co-founded by Joshua Kushner, whose brother is Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, is also expanding by setting up a business to sell health plans to corporations.

Many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs say their technologies will find large markets regardless of regulatory changes under consideration.

"Costs have to be lowered. Outcomes have to be improved and clearly measurable," said Bill Geary, general partner of Flare Capital Partners. "The shift from fee-for-service to value-based care is unstoppable it's a train that has left the station."

Phoenix-based startup Solera Health Inc., which matches consumers to diabetes-prevention programs, likely wouldn't be threatened by a repeal of the law, founder and CEO Brenda Schmidt said.

"Preventing diabetes is a more cost-effective way of addressing health-care costs than waiting until someone is diabetic," Ms. Schmidt said.

Insurers recognize this and will likely support effective prevention programs whether the federal government requires them to or not, she said.

For many in the industry, periods of change pose targets for entrepreneurs who spot ways to profit from new rules and regulations.

Repealing Obamacare would "reset the entire industry," said George Kalogeropoulos, CEO of San Francisco-based HealthSherpa, which helps consumers find medical insurance. "We get the opportunity to go big."

When Obamacare was initially being implemented, various states and insurers spent billions of dollars building software that was compliant with the law, he said. HealthSherpa, founded in 2013, hadn't launched at the time. Now it has relationships with many insurers and sees a potential overhaul as an opening.

All insurers, said Mr. Kalogeropoulos, "will be looking for  Trumpcare' software."

Microsoft Ventures said it launched a new fund to invest in artificial-intelligence startups.

The Microsoft Corp. venture unit also said the new fund had made its first investment, in Element AI, a Montreal-based incubator that helps organizations embrace an AI-first strategy.

Microsoft Ventures didn't say how much it would deploy through the new fund. The unit, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020130626e96qsatqf", initially concentrated on cloud-computing startups selling to businesses.

Nagraj Kashyap, corporate vice president of Microsoft Ventures, in a blog post described the AI fund as an expansion of the venture unit's mission to fund startups that assist enterprises. Its investments will be around the same size those made in the past by Microsoft Ventures, according to the post.

In 2016 Microsoft Ventures made 12 venture-capital investments with a median sum of about $13 million apiece, according to PitchBook Data Inc.

Crowdsourced DIY algo funds swell coffers; Financials

Two "crowdsourced" hedge funds that harness the work of amateur algorithmic traders have raised more money from investors, underlining the swelling interest in the latest development in quantitative finance.

Silicon Valley-based Numerai and Quantiacs collect submissions from freelance data scientists, computer engineers, physicists and mathematicians by offering regular prizes for the best stock market predictions or automated trading strategies. Although many hedge fund veterans scoff at the chances of DIY algo traders succeeding over time, some investors are taken with the potential of this model.

Numerai has raised $6m at a $30m valuation from a batch of investors led by Union Square Ventures, a venture capital firm that also invested in Twitter, Zynga and Tumblr. Howard Morgan , one of the founders of Renaissance Technologies, reinvested after joining the initial fundraising earlier this year, which was done at a $10m valuation.

The future of hedge funds is going to be quantitative and based on artificial intelligence rather than traditional fundamental analysis, argues Richard Craib , Numerai's founder.

Numerai's members download encrypted data and use AI techniques like "deep learning" to detect patterns, and then submit predictions to the company, which then uses them for its hedge fund. There are now 7,500 participants registered on its platform and submitting predictions, up from 4,500 three months ago, and the best ones win prize money. The money raised will be ploughed mainly into new data for computer scientists to experiment with.

"We were intrigued by the fact that Numerai is at its core about a community of scientists, that just happens to have a hedge fund bolted on to it," said Andy Weissman, a partner at USV.

Quantiacs' model focuses more on being a platform for computer scientists to submit fully-formed trading algorithms, which outside investors invest in individually. Quantiacs has raised "single-digit" millions of dollars since opening up to external investors this autumn, and is in talks with a handful more investors at the moment, according to its founder, Martin Froehler .

"We want to democratise quantitative finance, opening up to everyone what has only been reserved to the elites," he said.

Last month Quantopian, one of the more high-profile DIY quant platforms, raised $25m from a clutch of venture capitalists led by Andreessen Horowitz.

 Big data  sellers fail to hide delicate details; Technology

Hedge funds claim vendors are not adequately erasing personal information

The " alternative data " industry, which sells information such as app downloads and credit card purchases to investment groups, is failing to adequately erase personal details before sharing the material, according to several hedge funds.

The rapidly growing world of big data is seen as an increasingly attractive source of information for asset managers seeking a vital investment edge, with data providers selling everything from social media chatter and emailed receipts to federal lobbying information and even satellite images from space.

But several hedge funds say some vendors are selling information that still contains sensitive personal details that could be used to identify individuals.

"The vendors claim to strip out all the personal information, but we occasionally find phone numbers, zip codes and so on," said Matthew Granade, chief market intelligence officer at Steven Cohen's Point72.

"It's a big enough deal that we have a couple of full-time tech people wash the data ourselves."

The head of another big hedge fund said that even when personal information had been scrubbed from a data set, it was far too easy to restore.

"We were shocked at how easy it was to de-anonymise the data," he said.

"It took one of my analysts 30 minutes to discover someone who was probably having an affair."

Sophisticated algorithms such as " machine learning " allow money managers to sift through enormous data sets for profitable patterns.

Tabb Group, a consultancy, estimates that in the US alone, spending on big data will double in the next five years to $400m, while CB Insights, a data provider, has counted at least 30 start-ups in the field.

But the sensitivity of some of the information being offered has raised concerns.

Robert Schoshinski, assistant director in the Federal Trade Commission's division of privacy and identity protection, said the issue was "on the FTC's radar" but he refused to say if there were any open investigations into misuse of data.

Tammer Kamel, chief executive of Quandl , a well reputed alternative data vendor, said that his company was "super zealous" about scrubbing any personal information out of its aggregated data.

"No one wants to be on the wrong side of this," he said.

Another hedge fund manager pointed out that if there were legal issues, the litigation axe would be more likely to fall on them than the data vendors.

"We are incredibly careful about licensing and privacy issues because when things go wrong legally, the plaintiffs go after the people with the money," he said.

But there is no overarching US privacy law to protect consumers, with standards set individually by different states, industries and even companies, according to Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society .

'Alternative data' sellers fail to remove personal information, say hedge funds

The " alternative data " industry, which sells information such as app downloads and credit card purchases to investment groups, is failing to adequately erase personal details before sharing the material, according to several hedge funds.

The rapidly growing world of big data is seen as an increasingly attractive source of information for asset managers seeking a vital investment edge, with data providers selling everything from social media chatter and emailed receipts to federal lobbying data and even satellite images from space. But several hedge funds say some vendors are selling information that still contains sensitive personal information that could be used to identify individuals.

"The vendors claim to strip out all the personal information, but we occasionally find phone numbers, zip codes and so on," said Matthew Granade, chief market intelligence officer at Steven Cohen's Point72. "It's a big enough deal that we have a couple of full-time tech people wash the data ourselves."

The head of another big hedge fund said that even when personal information had been scrubbed from a data set, it was far too easy to restore.

"We were shocked at how easy it was to de-anonymise the data," he said. "It took one of my analysts 30 minutes to discover someone who was probably having an affair."

Sophisticated algorithms such as " machine learning " allow money managers to sift through enormous data sets for profitable patterns. But the sensitivity of some of the information being offered has raised concerns. Robert Schoshinski, assistant director in the Federal Trade Commission's division of privacy and identity protection, said the issue was "on the FTC's radar" but he refused to say if there were any open investigations into misuse of data.

Tammer Kamel, chief executive of Quandl , a well-reputed alternative data vendor, said his company was "super zealous" about scrubbing any personal information out of its aggregated data. "No one wants to be on the wrong side of this," he said.

Another hedge fund manager pointed out that if there were legal issues, the litigation axe would be more likely to fall on them than the data vendors. "We are incredibly careful about licensing and privacy issues because when things go wrong legally, the plaintiffs go after the people with the money," he said.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT: INDEX INVESTING
Bond market sell-off fails to upset fixed income ETFs

Credit Regulators are trying to reduce conflicts of interest among indexers, reports Paul Amery

There may have been a mass sell-off of US bonds since Donald Trump's election as president, but the exchange traded funds tracking global debt markets are on course for a record year.

Between July and November yields on 10-year US Treasury notes - which move inversely to prices - rose by a full percentage point as investors sold government bonds. Yet the use of fixed income in the fast-growing ETF market has accelerated rapidly in 2016. Assets in ETFs tracking bond indices reached $594bn worldwide by November, a tenfold increase since 2007, according to BlackRock. Equity ETF sales total $186bn so far this year, while bond ETFs have attracted a record $109bn of inflows, despite representing only a fifth of the global ETF market by assets.

"Fixed income ETFs are increasingly being used as a gateway to the overall bond markets, especially in corporate bonds and especially in the US," says Sophia Dancygier, managing director at index provider IHS Markit.

But the indices that underlie bond ETFs differ from those tracked by equity funds. Compared to equity indices, fixed income indices are more complex, requiring more individual data on prices and features such as bond call dates and seniority.

"In fixed income, most securities don't trade daily and you are forced to use an evaluation process to determine prices," says Matt Tucker, head of fixed income strategy at BlackRock's ETF unit iShares. "A single security can have three different prices attributed to it by three different index firms, all of which may be plausible. All this makes indexing a much greater challenge."

Recent regulatory changes have shaken up the business of providing benchmarks. The Libor and foreign exchange rate-rigging scandals have led to a wholesale review of the framework for index production. Iosco, the international securities regulator, issued a new set of principles for benchmarks in 2013. Meanwhile, new EU benchmark regulations will come into force in January 2018.

Both initiatives are designed to reduce conflicts of interest at index providers and, in practical terms, to separate index management and administration from trading.

In response to the heavier compliance burden, several banks have exited the fixed income index business in the past two years, most notably Barclays, which sold its benchmarking unit to Bloomberg for 520m last December. Analysts expect more banks to sell their index units.

Yet other banks, such as Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan and Nomura, continue to produce and disseminate bond indices.

Another important regulatory development is Europe's updated Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), due to take effect in 2018.

One of Mifid II's aims is to increase transparency in fixed income trading by requiring greater price disclosure before and after trades. In parallel, it also aims to push more bond trades on to central trading venues. The data collected at these venues are expected to prove valuable for index designers.

Banks that stay in the fixed income index business will be under pressure to end the practice of offering data at low cost or even for free to clients to win business due to the potential for conflicts of interest.

"We have to charge independently for the indices and the services we provide, independently from what the trading desk might or might not receive in terms of execution flow," says Arom Pathammavong, head of Citi's fixed income index business.

Srikant Dash, formerly head of Bloomberg's index business and now an independent adviser and board member, notes that being offered index data is only one of the services bond investors require from information providers.

"Compared to equity indexing, which is a brand-based business, the fixed income index business is a three-legged stool," he says. "One part is the index itself, the second is pricing and the third is analytics. They all have to work together."

Financial technology provider Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is making a push into bond indexing. This year it launched indices on US government and corporate bonds.

Meanwhile, index providers that have traditionally seemed focused on equity benchmarks are investing heavily in their fixed income operations. In November London Stock Exchange Group bought data and analytics provider Mergent, increasing its capabilities in the corporate bond market.

"Customers are clamouring for more fixed income index providers, especially independent firms," says Waqas Samad, head of LSE's fixed income indices.

In October, provider S&P Dow Jones Indices teamed up with fixed income trading platform MarketAxess to launch US corporate bond indices. "We're using the data from the platform to help identify the most liquid corporate bonds for the index selection process," says James Rieger, global head of fixed income at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Despite increased competition among benchmark providers, some bond index users say they now face sharply rising costs as a result of the indexing boom.

"The fixed income index firms have gained substantial pricing power," says an executive at the Information Provider User Group, a non-profit body representing the purchasers of market data. "The cost of one fixed income index product data licence we've looked at has risen fourfold since 2008, from $50,000 a year to $200,000."

Dutch Firm Tops Private-Equity Performance Rankings

If you're looking for more bang for your buck, the midmarket has traditionally been the place to find it.

It is harder to double your money on 20 billion ($25.32 billion) than 100 million, said Oliver Gottschalg, the founder and head of private-equity analytics firm Peracs, who for the past seven years has compiled an annual performance ranking of the top private-equity funds in Europe and the U.S. based on how much money they have returned to investors over a decade.

That balance is slowly shifting, however, as the magnifying glass focuses on performance through the global financial crisis of 2008. Four out of 10 of the top performers in this year's ranking were in the large-cap space, up from two last year, following a year in which strong historical performance enabled the asset class to deliver record distributions to investors of $443 billion, up from $45 billion in 2003, according to data provider Preqin Ltd.

Resilience

The highest-ranking firms in 2016 were those that demonstrated resilience through turbulent times, as the influence of more recent vintages (that matured past the performance lag known as the J-curve) came to the fore. Big buyout shops Apollo Global Management LLC, Advent International Corp., Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Hellman & Friedman all featured in the top 10 best-performing firms, showing they weathered the crisis as safe places to put investor money.

For the first time in five years, a European firm rose to the top of the leaderboard, hosting a smorgasbord of boom-era vintages mixed with superior unripened funds. Dutch midmarket firm Waterland Private Equity Investments knocked U.S. middleweight Vista Equity Partners off the top spot, which the San Francisco firm had held for last two years.

Like a fine Gouda,  ¬4 billion ($4.24 billion) firm Waterland Private Equity unboxed the value of a 2008 fund that has ripened since the global financial crisis and emerged full of flavor despite the rotten performance of many funds during the period. Its younger fund of 2011 also had the nose on runner-up Vista's latest fund from the period, pushing the Dutch firm to top place, up from third last year.

If you were an investor in one of Waterland's funds, you would have made nearly twice the amount of money as you would have done if you had invested in the average private-equity firm over the past decade.

However, overall performance is shrinking, as last year's top performer Vista Equity performed better against the industry average than the top ranking firms did this year. The difference between this year's ranking and the 2015 list is that some of the older funds from pre-2003 wouldn't have been considered and newer funds from 2011 would have been included.

Waterland took the top spot because its 2008 fund, which raised  ¬800 million within the three months following March 2008, was able to "navigate the crisis" much better than other funds, said Mr. Gottschalg. Another factor was the strong performance of its 2011 vehicle, which he said fared better than Vista's fund of the same vintage. According to data provider Preqin's 2016 list of consistent performers in alternative assets, four of Waterland's funds had a top-quartile ranking.

Realizations

The Gottschalg ranking looked at Waterland's Funds 2, 3, 4 and 5. The Dutch firm has made two significant exits over the past couple of years, including the sale of a majority stake in Swiss nursing home operator Seniocare AG to strategic investor Tertianum in August 2015; and the sale of a majority stake in Belgian air conditioning company P. Lemmens Co. in mid-2014.

"They all have their magic, but all are stellar at what they're doing," Mr. Gottschalg said.

Another firm that ranked highly was New York firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, which has been consistently rising in the ranking, scoring third place in the 2016 list, according to Mr. Gottschalg. "They've been able to sell at high rates over the past year or two," he said.

Swedish firm Altor Equity Partners, which Preqin said in the autumn was one of the most consistently top-performing fund manager by implementation skill, meanwhile came fourth on the Gottschalg ranking.

Love getting automated emails from vendors reminding what you left in your cart on their website? Or messages declaring how much they miss you?

As marketers place more emphasis on homing in on the individual consumer, automated marketing tools, including those for managing email campaigns, have become popular with both marketers and venture capitalists.

Index Ventures has led a $23 million Series B in Iterable Inc., a startup making subscription software that companies use to manage and personalize automated marketing campaigns to consumers.

Iterable faces a competitive market for such services, with a number of venture-funded rivals. New York-based Sailthru has raised over $40 million from investors including RRE Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures and Benchmark. Boston-based HubSpot raised over $100 million from private investors and then went public in October 2014.

Iterable's customers include Zillow, Yelp and jewelry subscription service Rocksbox. The company offers integrations with a number of other customer engagement tools, including Google Analytics and Mixpanel.

With the new round, the San Francisco-based startup has raised a total of $32.2 million. Charles River Ventures and other returning investors also participated. The new funds will go toward expanding the company's engineering, sales and customer success teams, said co-founder and Chief Executive Justin Zhu.

CRV led the company's $8 million "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160121ec1lb3c09?mod=undefined" in January.

Solvvy's Machine Learning  Helps Answer Customer Support Questions; Software ingests prior interactions with customers from support forums, private chats

For companies managing customer service and other support, it's often a repetitive process of answering many of the same questions over and over again.

Solvvy, a new startup, is using machine learning to answer many of these questions automatically.

Now the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company has $4.5 million in seed funding to back its ambitions, led by True Ventures. Pear Ventures, Carnegie Mellon University and Signatures Capital participated, along with Investment Group of Santa Barbara, Dan Rose and Hamid Barkhordar.

The company's technology is based on research conducted by two of the co-founders, Mehdi Samadi and Justin Betteridge, who were Ph.D. students in artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University.

Customers include Upwork, DoubleDutch, TaskRabbit and Amazon's Alexa.com.

When clients sign up with Solvvy, the software ingests prior interactions with customers from support forums, private chats with support or other forms. Solvvy says it differs from other services such as chat bots because it uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to answer questions even if they're long and complicated or phrased in different ways.

Then the software can answer questions immediately from customers using natural language processing--to answer questions even if they're misspelled or phrased in different ways. This eliminates the wait time for customers. If a question deals with a specific customer issue that needs a human, it's routed to a person.

Solvvy integrates with a client's existing customer support tool, from companies such as such as Zendesk, Salesforce, Oracle or Atlassian--and looks virtually the same once installed.

For customer service representatives, Solvvy enables them to focus on more important customer issues, said Solvvy Chief Executive Mahesh Ram.

The software learns from interactions with customers to determine if data is missing and questions aren't being answered. "It's learning from both sides," said Mr. Ram. "It helps our algorithm get smarter, learning which can't get answered today, but ought to be. So we'd tell the client,  You don't have these answers in your knowledge base. Perhaps you ought to create this new knowledge.' "

Eventually, Solvvy could potentially hook into other software, such as customer-relationship management tools, to automatically take actions for a customer. "We're able to build technology in the near future to not just provide information but that can actually map a question to an action," Mr. Samadi said. "That's really the future we see."

Solvvy reduces the number of tickets that its customer service agents get by about 10% to 15% by automatically answering them, Mr. Ram said.

"We see a lot of companies that say they're  AI for X,' but they're really just veneers," said Puneet Agarwal, partner at True Ventures and Solvvy board member. "But when we met Justin, Mehdi and Mahesh we saw they had real depth around their technology. It wasn't a veneer it's really core to what they're doing."

NFX Guild Lands Trulia Founder for Software-Focused Investing Team; The firm is adding a software veteran as it sets sights on a roughly $100 million fund

NFX Guild has completed its band of software investors, and it aims to load up on cash next.

Palo Alto, Calif.-based NFX Guild, a growth-focused accelerator for startups, has brought in Trulia founder Pete Flint to complete a four-member investing team.

Mr. Flint joins James Currier, Gigi Levy Weiss and Stan Chudnovsky as a managing partner in the accelerator and venture fund. The former Trulia chief executive, like the others on the team, has spent his career working on software-related startups.

The firm is set up so each partner can jump in to work with any of the companies at any time, and they take no board seats with investments. The intention is to bring the wisdom of a tight-knit team of software entrepreneurs to each company.

"We're four successful software CEOs, and we're all now doing a startup together," said Mr. Currier of the firm's approach.

NFX Guild plans to raise a second fund of about $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Guild accelerator is an invitation-only program for classes of 20 to 25 startups. Entrepreneurs learn a core of fundamentals to build their businesses. The program includes business strategies for tapping into network effects, sales and growth, and it helps with equity programs and to find capital connections.

The firm is also developing its own software to help Guild members to fundraise, manage mentors, recruit employees, share private and public data, and connect with each other on building their businesses.

"We're going to apply software to everything we do," Mr. Currier said of the firm's tool set under development.

Amid a crush of capital-chasing startup founders, NFX Guild's growth-minded accelerator and member-focused software differentiate the firm, Mr. Currier said.

If that sounds familiar, it is. YCombinator has a behemoth startup accelerator, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-incubator-y-combinator-takes-new-tack-with-venture-capital-fund-1444938590" and software platform, dubbed Bookface Forum. YC's alumni network counts mega hits, including Airbnb Inc. and Dropbox Inc.

Meanwhile, Tim Draper's Draper University has taken its crash course in entrepreneurship to the masses, last year launching a Startup U reality show on ABC Family, and has access to the iconic billionaire's family of funds.

Whether NFX Guild can capture a subset of startups for its smaller network with an exclusive aura remains to be seen. Its pitch is that it is a smaller, more intimate affair offering personalized focus on companies.

NFX Guild, which launched in April 2015, runs a three-month accelerator program intended to jump-start growth in seed to post-Series A companies. NFX Guild has been investing out of a $15 million fund, and it hasn't previously disclosed its capital.

Investments from NFX Guild range $40,000 to $120,000 for equity in startups, depending on the stage of the company's development.

The firm looks for investments in companies that work with augmented or virtual reality, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 3-D printing, blockchain 2.0, robotics and synthetic biology.

"NFX Guild is unique and is applying software and network effects to the ecosystem," said Mr. Flint, who recently began working at the firm.

The partners declined to disclose the compensation economics of the firm for the four-person team.

Limited partners who invested in NFX Guild's first fund include Greylock Partners, Shasta Ventures and Mayfield Fund.

Mr. Levy Weiss is based in Herzliya, Israel, where he is offering advice to area entrepreneurs. He makes frequent trips to the U.S. and selects startup founders for the NFX Guild accelerator program in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Investing partner Mr. Chudnovsky is also the product chief for Messaging at Facebook and is a limited partner in the fund.

The NFX Guild has a conference and demo day at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., on March 2 for its current class and investors to attend.

Tact Raises $15 Million for AI Assistant for Salespeople; Tools for connecting to a rep's Salesforce and LinkedIn accounts

Salespeople today work from their mobile devices more than ever before, but most customer relationship management applications were built during the web era.

Startup Tact enables salespeople to do their work on a mobile device, using artificial intelligence to assist in various tasks.

Tact has raised $15 million in Series B financing led by Upfront Ventures. New investor Microsoft Ventures participated, along with existing investors Accel Partners and Redpoint Ventures. The company has raised about $30 million in total.

Tact connects to a salesperson's Salesforce and LinkedIn accounts, as well as email and calendar.

Using Tact, after a sales meeting or call, salespeople get an automated mobile notification to record a voice note on the app, with next steps or follow up, and Tact routes the notes to Salesforce or other apps. Using Tact quickly can raise the likelihood of salespeople putting data into apps like Salesforce, said Chuck Ganapathi, founder and chief executive of Tact.

"(Salespeople) need mobile applications designed for mobile first," said Mark Suster, managing partner at Upfront, who is joining Tact's board. "They need voice interaction in cars. They don't want to have to log into a heavy database."

Salespeople can also ask the app a question, such as "What's my forecast this quarter?" and Tact will pull up the data on the app. They can also communicate with Tact via text by asking, "Find Jerry Smith on LinkedIn," and Tact will ask if they want to connect on LinkedIn.

While there are several personal assistant apps for consumer such as X.ai, Tact focuses on business, which makes it easier to focus on helping with the tasks that workers need to get done, said Mr. Ganapathi, who previously worked at Salesforce and Siebel.

"I wouldn't be surprised if bots and AI have a lot more success in the enterprise for that reason," he said. "You know the objectives of the human very clearly."

U.S. News: Rising Mortgage Rates Could Threaten Housing Demand

Rising interest rates pose a dilemma for people who love their mortgage more than they hate their house.

A sustained period of rising rates could freeze homeowners with rock-bottom mortgages who otherwise might want to trade up for bigger or better properties.

Such situations, which economists call "rate lock," could weigh on housing demand in 2017, economists said.

A seven-year run of historically low mortgage rates has encouraged home buying, helping increase prices sharply after the housing crash. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index reached a record in September.

But mortgage rates have jumped more than half a percentage point since the election, and economists are bracing for higher rates in 2017.

Rising rates make mortgage payments more expensive. That gives homeowners incentive to remain in place rather than trade up, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage firm Redfin.

"It doesn't take much to turn off the faucet in this market because inventory is so low and prices have gone up so quickly," she said.

The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.13% last Thursday, according to mortgage company Freddie Mac, up from 3.54% before the election. That was the highest level since October 2014.

The latest bump boosts the monthly cost of owning the typical U.S. home by more than $70 a month, or about $26,000 over the life of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to Black Knight Financial Services, a mortgage and real estate technology and data provider.

"I suspect it's already having an impact at the margin. Another half a percent and the impact will be substantial," said Lou Barnes, a capital markets analyst at Premier Mortgage Group, based in Boulder, Colo. Homeowners in pricey coastal markets, where affordability is already strained, could feel the pinch sooner. In California, where the median-priced home is closer to $500,000, homeowners already are looking at paying about $170 more a month based on the recent rate rise.

According to Zillow, a typical household in Los Angeles already spends 38% of its income on mortgage payments -- greater than the recommended 30%.

In all, about 66% of U.S. homeowners with mortgages have rates of less than 4.5%, according to real estate analytics firm CoreLogic Inc. Economists said rates would likely need to rise above 5% for a large number of homeowners across the U.S. to face the rate lock dilemma.

As the economy strengthens, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates when it meets this month. Mortgage rates are tied more closely to Treasury bond yields, which also tend to rise during periods of inflation.

Many economists expect mortgage rates to continue rising gradually from here, though such predictions have been wrong before.

Rates have risen because the economy is strengthening and investors are betting that tax cuts and increased government spending on infrastructure will spur more growth. Higher wage growth could offset the effect of higher mortgage rates.

But the fact that so many homeowners enjoy such low rates could also prove an economic brake, creating a disincentive for homeowners to move to a new city in pursuit of a new job if it means their mortgage might be more expensive, said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.

Recent history suggests the impact of rising rates can be swift and substantial. In 2013 mortgage rates surged to 4.5% from 3.6% as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve would pull back from its bond-buying program. The pace of sales of previously owned homes declined 8% from July to December of that year, according to the National Association of Realtors.

The rate of home-price rises around that time was cut essentially in half, to 5% from 9%, according to Black Knight.

"If 2013 is any guide, we could expect to see a slowdown in [price] appreciation," said Ben Graboske, vice president of Black Knight's data and analytics division. "We still think house prices will grow, just more meekly."

There may have been a mass sell-off of US bonds since Donald Trump s election as president, but the exchange traded funds tracking global debt markets are on course for a record year.

Between July and November yields on 10-year US Treasury notes   which move inversely to prices   rose by a full percentage point as investors sold government bonds. Yet the use of fixed income in the fast-growing ETF market has accelerated rapidly in 2016. Assets in ETFs tracking bond indices reached $594bn worldwide by November, a tenfold increase since 2007, according to BlackRock. Equity ETF sales total $186bn so far this year, while bond ETFs have attracted a record $109bn of inflows, despite representing only a fifth of the global ETF market by assets.

 Fixed income ETFs are increasingly being used as a gateway to the overall bond markets, especially in corporate bonds and especially in the US,  says Sophia Dancygier, managing director at index provider IHS Markit.

But the indices that underlie bond ETFs differ from those tracked by equity funds. Compared to equity indices, fixed income indices are more complex, requiring more individual data on prices and features such as bond call dates and seniority.

 In fixed income, most securities don t trade daily and you are forced to use an evaluation process to determine prices,  says Matt Tucker, head of fixed income strategy at BlackRock s ETF unit iShares.  A single security can have three different prices attributed to it by three different index firms, all of which may be plausible. All this makes indexing a much greater challenge. 

Recent regulatory changes have shaken up the business of providing benchmarks. The Libor and "http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Forex_trading_probes" have led to a wholesale review of the framework for index production. Iosco, the international securities regulator, issued a new set of principles for benchmarks in 2013. Meanwhile, new EU benchmark regulations will come into force in January 2018.

Both initiatives are designed to reduce conflicts of interest at index providers and, in practical terms, to separate index management and administration from trading.

In response to the heavier compliance burden, several banks have exited the fixed income index business in the past two years, most notably Barclays, which sold its benchmarking unit to Bloomberg for 520m last December. Analysts expect more banks to sell their index units.

Yet other banks, such as Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan and Nomura, continue to produce and disseminate bond indices.

Another important regulatory development is Europe s updated Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), due to take effect in 2018.

One of Mifid II s aims is to increase transparency in fixed income trading by requiring greater price disclosure before and after trades. In parallel, it also aims to push more bond trades on to central trading venues. The data collected at these venues are expected to prove valuable for index designers.

Banks that stay in the fixed income index business will be under pressure to end the practice of offering data at low cost or even for free to clients to win business due to the potential for conflicts of interest.

 We have to charge independently for the indices and the services we provide, independently from what the trading desk might or might not receive in terms of execution flow,  says Arom Pathammavong, head of Citi s fixed income index business.

Srikant Dash, formerly head of Bloomberg s index business and now an independent adviser and board member, notes that being offered index data is only one of the services bond investors require from information providers.

 Compared to equity indexing, which is a brand-based business, the fixed income index business is a three-legged stool,  he says.  One part is the index itself, the second is pricing and the third is analytics. They all have to work together. 

Financial technology provider Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is making a push into bond indexing. This year it launched indices on US government and corporate bonds.

Meanwhile, index providers that have traditionally seemed focused on equity benchmarks are investing heavily in their fixed income operations. In November London Stock Exchange Group bought data and analytics provider Mergent, increasing its capabilities in the corporate bond market.

 Customers are clamouring for more fixed income index providers, especially independent firms,  says Waqas Samad, head of LSE s fixed income indices.

In October, provider S&P Dow Jones Indices teamed up with fixed income trading platform MarketAxess to launch US corporate bond indices.  We re using the data from the platform to help identify the most liquid corporate bonds for the index selection process,  says James Rieger, global head of fixed income at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Despite increased competition among benchmark providers, some bond index users say they now face sharply rising costs as a result of the indexing boom.

 The fixed income index firms have gained substantial pricing power,  says an executive at the Information Provider User Group, a non-profit body representing the purchasers of market data.  The cost of one fixed income index product data licence we ve looked at has risen fourfold since 2008, from $50,000 a year to $200,000.

Rising Mortgage Rates Could Threaten Housing Demand in 2017; Sustained increases could lead to  rate lock,' leaving some homeowners reluctant to trade up or down

Rising interest rates pose a dilemma for people who love their mortgage more than they hate their house.

A sustained period of rising rates could freeze homeowners with rock-bottom mortgages who otherwise might want to trade up for bigger or better properties.

Such situations, which economists call "rate lock," could weigh on housing demand in 2017, economists said.

A seven-year run of historically low mortgage rates has encouraged home buying, helping increase prices sharply after the housing crash. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index reached a record in September.

But mortgage rates have jumped more than half a percentage point since the election, and economists are bracing for higher rates in 2017.

Rising rates make mortgage payments more expensive. That gives homeowners incentive to remain in place rather than trade up, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage firm Redfin.

"It doesn't take much to turn off the faucet in this market because inventory is so low and prices have gone up so quickly," she said.

The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.13% last Thursday, according to mortgage company Freddie Mac, up from 3.54% before the election. That was the highest level since October 2014.

The latest bump boosts the monthly cost of owning the typical U.S. home by more than $70 a month, or about $26,000 over the life of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to Black Knight Financial Services, a mortgage and real estate technology and data provider.

"I suspect it's already having an impact at the margin. Another half a percent and the impact will be substantial," said Lou Barnes, a capital markets analyst at Boulder-based Premier Mortgage Group.

Homeowners in pricey coastal markets, where affordability is already strained, could feel the pinch sooner. In California, where the median-priced home is closer to $500,000, homeowners already are looking at paying about $170 more a month based on the recent rate rise.

According to Zillow, a typical household in Los Angeles already spends 38% of its income on mortgage payments greater than the recommended 30%. In the Bay Area, about 5% fewer households will fall under the recommended 33% debt-to-income ratio to afford a $1 million mortgage if interest rates rise from 4% to 5%, according to Selma Hepp, chief economist at Pacific Union International, a real-estate firm.

In all, about 66% of U.S. homeowners with mortgages have rates of less than 4.5%, according to real estate analytics firm CoreLogic Inc. Economists said rates would likely need to rise above 5% for a large number of homeowners across the U.S. to face the rate lock dilemma.

As the economy strengthens, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates when it meets this month. Mortgage rates are tied more closely to Treasury bond yields, which also tend to rise during periods of inflation.

Many economists expect mortgage rates to continue rising gradually from here, though such predictions have been wrong before.

Rates have risen because the economy is strengthening and investors are betting that tax cuts and increased government spending on infrastructure will spur more growth. Higher wage growth could offset the effect of higher mortgage rates.

But the fact that so many homeowners enjoy such low rates could also prove an economic brake, creating a disincentive for homeowners to move to a new city in pursuit of a new job if it means their mortgage might be more expensive, said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.

Recent history suggests the impact of rising rates can be swift and substantial. In 2013 mortgage rates surged to 4.5% from 3.6% as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve would pull back from its bond-buying program. The pace of sales of previously owned homes declined 8% from July to December of that year, according to the National Association of Realtors.

The rate of home-price increases around that time was cut essentially in half, to 5% from 9%, according to Black Knight.

"If 2013 is any guide, we could expect to see a slowdown in [price] appreciation," said Ben Graboske, vice president of Black Knight's data and analytics division. "We still think house prices will grow, just more meekly."

Jeanette Mateo, a 41-year-old health-care project coordinator in Sacramento, Calif., said if rates rise it could affect her decision to sell. She and her partner already agreed once to sell their house but pulled out of the deal "10 or 15 minutes later" because they were nervous about being able to find another one they could afford.

They pay about $900 a month on their mortgage, which they refinanced in 2009 when rates were around 5%. Now they are eyeing a home in a new development, which would give them a bigger kitchen and an extra garage.

Ms. Mateo said if rates rise significantly they might not be able to afford to trade up, and they worry that it would be more difficult to sell if some buyers are scared off.

Hedge funds begin to venture beyond costly Mayfair enclave

Hedge funds have become as synonymous with Mayfair as bespoke tailoring and luxury shopping in recent decades. But times are changing.

Some of the biggest names in the industry are leaving the confines of the narrow grid of streets sandwiched between Oxford and Regent Streets, Piccadilly and Hyde Park, put off by sky-high rents and searching for larger office space as the industry matures.

With returns dwindling at some hedge funds, and investors pushing back over fee structures, firms are also under pressure to cut costs elsewhere. Lavishly ostentatious offices that made sense in the boomtime are no longer a priority.

It once made sense for hedge funds to be based in Mayfair and St James s. Their investor base was initially high-net worth individuals, many of whom lived in the area and would meet in one of the Michelin-starred restaurants. But the money flowing into hedge funds has become more institutional, with pension funds, endowments, fund of funds and sovereign wealth funds dominating the investor list.

Larger hedge fund firms, including most recently Sir Michael Hintze s CQS, Marshall Wace and Systematica, have all found bases outside Mayfair, while some of the biggest groups, including Winton Capital and Man Group s AHL funds, have always been elsewhere. Winton, a $32bn quantitative investing firm, looked for office space in Mayfair before opting to build new headquarters in Hammersmith several years ago because of the cost.

Andrew Barnes, head of tenant representation for the West End at JLL, the property advisers, says:  What we have seen is a real desire not to pay top dollar any more. Pre the financial crisis, hedge funds were always the rent setters and they paid whatever it took to get the best space. 

 There was a kind of one-upmanship   who drives the nicest car, who s got the nicest office. That changed in 2008 in a big way. People are far more cost-conscious and concerned about the profile and the image they are portraying to their clients and investors. 

Mr Barnes says hedge funds were more comfortable looking for offices outside the traditional locations around Berkeley Square or St James s Square such as Knightsbridge, or areas north of Oxford Street such as Portman Square and Cavendish Square.

An overhaul of business rates from 2017 will see buildings in Mayfair face extra rates bills as high as 60 per square foot, he says, adding to the premium that tenants must pay for space in that area.

New fund managers are also finding that their money goes farther elsewhere   and that they no longer need to be in Mayfair to prove that they are serious players in the industry.

James Holloway, the founder of Piquant Technologies, a quantitative hedge fund that uses artificial intelligence, says being in Mayfair was more of a detriment than a benefit for him when looking for office space.

The three-year old fund, which now manages about $200m, started out in the West London neighbourhood Turnham Green,  in someone s attic, effectively,  he recalled. That was followed by a space in Waterloo,  with 40-watt bulbs in the staircase and paint peeling off the walls,  he says.  We realised after a while we couldn t really bring investors here. 

They settled in Marylebone, just north of Mayfair and already home to the hedge funds Brevan Howard, Arrowgrass, Cevian and Aspect Capital, for nearly half the price.

 Being a quant fund, we just need desk space,  he says.  So if you could be anywhere in the world, why would you want to be in Mayfair, which is one of the most expensive places in the world? We ve heard very uniformly from investors, thank god you re not in Mayfair. It s quite a bad sign for managers, especially new ones who should be frugal, to be spending so much on rent. 

Many hedge funds continue to sign office leases in the most prestigious locations at eye-watering rents   and Mayfair and St James remain a draw. For example, Silver Ridge Asset Management, a macro hedge fund set up by Anil Prasad, the former head of foreign exchange at Citigroup, took a floor of 3 St James s Square for 160 per square foot per year in the first quarter of this year   more than double the average office rent in the City of London.

 There s a lot of signalling in this business,  says one hedge fund seed investor.  Now there s getting to be less of that. But location is really critical when you re starting something so it s harder to not be there. 

Mr Barnes adds:  To have SW1 on your letterhead is a very prestigious thing to have. 

By contrast, the quant fund Quadrature Capital in January leased new offices in the Leadenhall Building skyscraper, known as the Cheesegrater, in the City of London, where the highest reported rents are about 100 per sq ft; CQS leased space on the Strand in Covent Garden last year for 85 per sq ft.

Jones Lang LaSalle says that further headline-making Mayfair deals will be  few and far between  and tend to occur only where the spaces involved are relatively small.

Two investment managers, Orbis and Oaktree Capital Management, have both in the past year hunted for offices in Mayfair and nearby areas, only to settle for better value elsewhere   Orbis on a sublease in Marylebone, Oaktree in Victoria.

The Brexit vote is also adding to caution among office tenants, including hedge funds. One fund manager, GAM, scrapped plans to move to new offices in the Victoria area after the vote.

Andy Tyler, head of West End office agency at Cushman & Wakefield, says that companies have generally become  more footloose and less wedded to the heartland area for their particular industry .

 The market is getting tougher,  Mr Tyler says.  Tenants are being more discerning and taking more time to make decisions on relocations.

Injection of 230m boosts Oxford university start-up fund; Technology

Oxford Sciences Innovation, which commercialises science and technology from Oxford university, has expanded its coffers to 580m in a new funding round, making it the largest private university fund in the UK.

The 230m injection of capital has come primarily from Asian investors, including large tech companies that wished to remain anonymous, and sovereign wealth funds, such as Singapore's Temasek and Oman Investment Fund.

The fund has backed approximately 20 start-ups spun out from the university's labs, including Oxford Nanoimaging, Vaccitech and Oxford Flow - double the planned number a year ago.

The UK has five of the world's top 10 medical research universities, according to Times Higher Education, and Oxford has been number one for the past five years.

The burst of funding highlights the increasing flow of private capital into the UK's academic sector to help spin out research breakthroughs.

The 50m UCL Technology Fund was set up in January to invest in intellectual property from University College London. In the same month, the 40m Apollo Therapeutics Fund was created in collaboration with Cambridge, Imperial College London and UCL, with backing from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson.

These have joined others such as Imperial Innovations, IP Group and Cambridge Innovation Capital which were already active on UK campuses.

Cambridge Innovation Capital recently added 75m to its fund ahead of a planned flotation, while Neil Woodford, Britain's best-known fund manager, spent 11.6m to take a 22 per cent stake in Imperial College's offshoot fund, Imperial Innovations.

"Raising this capital reflects our confidence in the breadth and quality of opportunity available to investors to help the University of Oxford develop a world-class commercial ecosystem around its unmatched intellectual capital and heritage," said Peter Davies, chair of OSI. "We are also very excited to be working with new shareholders from across the world, notably from Asia and continental Europe."

Deep technology start-ups have been attractive targets for Asian investors: telecommunications, media and technology accounted for almost a third of Chinese investment last year, according to consultants Grant Thornton.

Tencent, the Chinese internet group, for instance, invested in two British companies in 2015, mapping start-up Sensewhere and gaming company Miniclip. In October, Chinese state-backed fund CSC Group helped fund a multimillion pound artificial intelligence incubator in London.

"This funding is a further vote of confidence in Britain's world-class research sector and will provide a real boost to local businesses as they develop new technologies," said Jo Johnson, the minister of state for universities, science, research and innovation.

Viswanatha's Take: Democratic AGs See Role to Play in Trump Era

Trump's Labor Pick Spells Potential Trouble for Retirement Rule

Orrin Hatch May Prove a Crucial Ally for Trump

SEC Enforcement Chief to Step Down

Federal Bank Watchdogs Say They're Not Forcing Banks From Payday

Democratic AGs See Role to Play in Trump Era

As the direction of financial regulation under the Trump administration continues to take shape, one group is gearing up for an uptick in activity: state attorneys general who are Democrats.

Over the past eight years, states with a Republican top law-enforcement official took an aggressive approach to fighting Obama administration efforts on everything from immigration to environmental rules to overtime pay. Texas has filed "https://www.texastribune.org/2016/07/27/texas-federal-government-lawsuits/", according to the Texas Tribune.

Just last week, state banking regulators pushed back against the decision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulator-will-start-issuing-bank-charters-for-fintech-firms-1480691712/", saying the move "represents an historic expansion of the role of the federal government, one that will permeate into the economies in all 50 states and distort the financial system with unwelcome consequences."

The next few years are unlikely to be an exact mirror image of the Obama administration, given that it's easier to litigate against new federal regulations imposed on states than against any potential rollback. But a strategy appears to be taking shape among Democratic state regulators, particularly when it comes to financial services.

Experts point to two potential paths. One is similar to the Republican playbook, which directly challenges federal government decisions. States could intervene, for example, in the continuing litigation over the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if the Trump administration declines to pursue the appeal to defend the current setup, experts said.

A second effort involves more enforcement of both state consumer-protection laws, as well as the authority granted to states under the federal Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law. Under the 2010 law, state attorneys general can, in some instances, enforce the federal ban on unfair, deceptive or abusive financial practices, as well as some mortgage provisions included in the legislation. Illinois and a few other states have brought a handful of such actions, but experts expect that activity to pick up, especially if enforcement activity at the federal level drops.

Twenty-two states have Democratic attorneys general. The ones most likely to take on an outsize role are those who have been active over the past few years, including the AGs of New York, Massachusetts and Illinois.

A spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he has "never shied away from rooting out fraud in financial markets...that work will continue and accelerate when the new administration takes office."

Mr. Schneiderman has already started taking on the role, issuing press releases criticizing President-elect Donald Trump's reported selections for the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-expected-to-name-fast-food-executive-andy-puzder-as-labor-secretary-1481210445" and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-taps-oklahoma-attorney-general-scott-pruitt-to-lead-epa-1481143068". The EPA pick, Scott Pruitt, is himself a Republican AG who has fought Obama administration environmental regulations.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said: "My office will continue to enforce important state laws to protect consumers and investors from financial fraud and abuses in Massachusetts. We know from our experience in the mortgage lending crisis that these critical regulatory safeguards need to remain in place." A spokeswoman for Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan declined to comment.

"If the SEC is weakened under the Trump administration...it will be all the more important that state attorneys general and other state regulators are able to step up their deterrence of fraud," said Chad Johnson, who ran the investor protection group at the New York attorney general's office until earlier this year.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Trump's Labor Pick Spells Potential Trouble for Retirement Rule

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTON The choice of Andy Puzder, a fast-food-chain executive with strong antiregulation views, for labor secretary has fueled expectations among financial-industry experts that the Labor Department's new retirement-savings rule faces delays or even a rollback.

While Republican lawmakers have renewed their pledge to block the rule in recent weeks, President-elect Donald Trump's stance is unknown. And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Puzder now chief executive of CKE Restaurants Holdings Inc., the parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's hasn't publicly discussed his views on the so-called fiduciary rule, or on retirement savings in general. Mr. Puzder declined to comment for this article through a representative of CKE.

After a long battle with the financial industry and Republican lawmakers, the Obama administration finalized the Labor Department rule in April. The rule holds brokers and advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings to a "fiduciary" standard, meaning they must work in the best interest of their clients and generally avoid conflicts, which can come about with commission-based compensation. Previously, they were required to offer only "suitable" guidance, a less-rigorous standard.

Mr. Puzder did at least once take the side of retirees challenging the financial industry. As a private-sector lawyer in St. Louis in the 1980s, he represented the city's police pension fund as it sued investment firms for what it called poor investment and bilking of the fund.

But analysts have said his handling of the fiduciary rule will be more likely driven by his well-chronicled staunch dislike of government regulations, which he believes stifle entrepreneurship and growth. As an adviser and contributor to Mr. Trump's campaign, he has criticized the Affordable Care Act and has fought against raising the federal minimum wage.

"More government is not the solution to every problem; it's the problem to every solution," Mr. Puzder he said in an interview with Franchise Times last month. "You can't order businesses to be profitable, or place restrictions on them and expect them to grow."

Mr. Puzder's remarks, along with his close dealings with financial companies during his career, are enough to make some experts believe the new administration will kill or significantly weaken the investment-advice rule, which is set to take effect in April 2017.

"The likelihood of seeing a delay or [it] being altered is certainly increasing," said Alois Pirker, research director at Aite Group. "I have my doubts they'll just call it off right away," Mr. Pirker said, adding that he instead expects a delay in implementing the rule, possibly until the end of next year. "That gives enough time to review or revise" the rule, he said.

Edward Mills, an analyst at FBR & Co., wrote in a research note Thursday that he predicts the new administration will first delay the implementation of the rule through an administrative action and then repeal or overhaul it. "His public comments show that he is largely opposed to Obama-era regulation in the labor and health-care arenas," Mr. Mills said of Mr. Puzder.

Besides the fiduciary rule, the Obama administration finalized a rule in August to encourage states to set up retirement-savings plans with automatic enrollment features for private-sector employees who don't have access to corporate-sponsored retirement savings plans, such as part-time workers.

Since Mr. Trump's victory, Republican lawmakers have given a high priority to blocking the fiduciary rule in their broader efforts to roll back Obama-era financial regulations. Among them is Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who in June proposed blocking the fiduciary rule until after the Securities Exchange Commission has had a chance to study the issue closely.

Among Mr. Trump's advisers, Anthony Scaramucci, who runs hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, is the only one known to have commented on the rule. At an October conference, he said the rule would be repealed, calling it possibly "the dumbest decision to come out of the U.S. government in the last 50 to 60 years," according to Investment News. Mr. Scaramucci also criticized the rule in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last month.

Proponents have said repealing the rule won't be easy. Since it has already been finalized, changes will require the new administration to go through an onerous process of public notice and comments as well as cost-benefit analysis. And legislative effort to scrap the rule would face strong opposition from Democrats in the Senate, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.)

Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), another strong backer of the fiduciary rule, said in an interview Thursday that if the Trump administration wants to fight the regulation, "I'm willing to take that fight to the American people."

The Congressional Review Act, a legislative weapon the Republicans are likely to use to kill some Obama-era rules, can't be used for the fiduciary rule as Mr. Obama has already vetoed a resolution approved by Congress in June.

"What we are anticipating is there is going to be numerous attempts to change and modify the rule and add more exemptions," said Cristina Martin Firvida, director of financial security at AARP, which has supported the rule. "But it's not going to be quick, and it's not going to be easy."

Still, the rule will be more vulnerable after January with the departure of two officials who have defended them forcefully. Mr. Puzder will succeed Thomas Perez, a progressive civil-rights lawyer. Phyllis Borzi, the chief architect of the rule who heads the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration, is expected to leave soon.

In a speech on Dec. 1, Ms. Borzi said the fiduciary rule has already had an effect. Investment companies such as BlackRock Inc. and Charles Schwab Corp have slashed fees on their exchange-traded funds. Betterment, an automated investment advice firm, bought a full-page newspaper ad this week, asking Mr. Trump to keep the rule intact.

"We are really not going back to the old ways," Ms. Borzi said.

Orrin Hatch May Prove a Crucial Ally for Trump

By Brody Mullins and Rebecca Ballhaus

WASHINGTON In the weeks since Donald Trump was elected, a senior member of Congress has emerged as an important source of counsel: Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), the longest-serving Senate Republican and the chairman of a committee that will handle much of Mr. Trump's agenda.

Mr. Hatch was one of the first senators to endorse Mr. Trump for president and campaigned for him in Utah and other states where many residents share Mr. Hatch's Mormon faith.

Since the election, the two have spoken regularly about potential nominations for the Supreme Court and the Trump administration, as well as about Mr. Trump's legislative agenda, according to people familiar with the conversations.

As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Hatch heads the panel charged with confirming many of Mr. Trump's top nominees, including Treasury secretary. The committee will handle several other priorities for Mr. Trump, including replacing President Barack Obama's health-care law and overhauling the tax system.

Mr. Trump doesn't have close ties with many members of Congress, so Mr. Hatch has become an important middleman between Mr. Trump and the Senate. A few weeks ago, Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Hatch's chief of staff, Robert Porter, to assist with his transition process.

Mr. Hatch has also forged a close relationship beginning this summer with Reince Priebus, who has been chairman of the Republican National Committee and is Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff. Mr. Hatch donated a total of $75,000 from his political-action committee to the RNC and Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, one of the few senators to do so.

Mr. Hatch first endorsed Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, for president. He switched to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio after Mr. Bush dropped out. Later, he appeared open to the idea of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney a vocal critic of Mr. Trump running again.

Mr. Hatch endorsed Mr. Trump in May, when the nomination was all but sewn up. Still, he was among the first senators to do so. Mr. Hatch, a Mormon, campaigned for Mr. Trump in Utah and Nevada and held steady as prominent Utah and Mormon figures turned against Mr. Trump.

When Mr. Trump suggested a federal judge's Mexican heritage should disqualify him from overseeing a case involving Trump University, the now defunct real-estate school, Mr. Hatch told the Los Angeles Times: "Be nice to him. He's a poor first-time candidate."

At the summer's Republican convention, Mr. Hatch sat in the Trump family's box on occasion, where he spoke frequently with Donald Trump Jr. In the fall, he traveled with Mr. Trump's son while they campaigned together for several days in Arizona, Utah and Nevada. Mr. Trump won Arizona and Utah.

In October, after the release of a tape of Mr. Trump making lewd comments about groping women, Mr. Hatch was steadfast in his support, though he called Mr. Trump's comments "offensive and disgusting." Several other Utah Republicans, by contrast, withdrew their endorsements and called for Mr. Trump to quit the race.

"Hatch was up against more political winds than anyone else, but he held firm like a rock, because he really believed in Trump," said Rick Hohlt, a Republican consultant and friend of Mr. Hatch.

A few days after the campaign, Messrs. Trump and Hatch had an initial conversation about Mr. Trump's vision for his presidency. They have since exchanged cellphone numbers and have spoken roughly a dozen times, people familiar with the conversations say.

Mr. Trump has called to get the senator's thoughts on possible candidates for the Supreme Court and other administration posts, these people say. Last month, the two had several conversations about potential nominees for secretary of state, including former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Trump has since broadened his search.

Mr. Hatch is a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which must approve Mr. Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court. By reaching out to Mr. Hatch for his guidance on nominations, Mr. Trump is signaling that he is taking a practical approach by considering whether potential nominations could win approval in the committee and the Senate.

The two have also discussed plans to replace the Affordable Care Act, enact tax reform and reduce federal regulations.

Mr. Hatch's committee must approve Mr. Trump's nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.) as secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. Mr. Hatch has meetings scheduled for later this week with both Messrs. Mnuchin and Price.

Earlier this week, Mr. Hatch met with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who has been tapped to serve as attorney general.

SEC Enforcement Chief to Step Down

By Aruna Viswanatha

WASHINGTON The enforcement director for the Securities and Exchange Commission will leave the agency in the coming weeks, the agency said Thursday, the latest in a series of departures as the SEC prepares for a new administration that could take a more lenient approach.

Andrew Ceresney, who came to the agency with Chairman Mary Jo White in early 2013, has overseen a unit that brought a record number of cases in the past three years using a strategy that targeted small infractions in addition to bigger frauds.

"We really have brought important cases across the whole securities realm, in every priority area," Mr. Ceresney said in an interview, citing areas including financial reporting and insider trading, and cases addressing conduct at dark pools, private-equity firms and in municipal offerings.

The SEC said Mr. Ceresney's deputy, Stephanie Avakian, will become the acting director of the unit.

While the contours of the SEC's objectives in the Donald Trump administration are still taking shape, Mr. Trump and his advisers have said repeatedly they would try to roll back landmark financial regulations imposed during President Barack Obama's administration. On Monday, Mr. Trump met with former U.S. Attorney Debra Wong Yang and is considering her for the SEC chairmanship, which might signal a less-radical shift from the current regime since she would bring a background more in common with Ms. White.

In the interview, Mr. Ceresney said he didn't expect much to change in the near term since many cases remain in the pipeline and investigations can take years. He said he expected more insider trading cases that involve hacked information, cases targeting manipulative trading activity, and those against auditors over allegedly improper audits.

"Enforcement will always be a high priority, it's a bipartisan issue," Mr. Ceresney said. "Any enforcement director should be encouraging their people to be creative and aggressive but also fair."

After Ms. White's said last month that she planned to leave the agency at the end of the Obama administration, the SEC has announced many departures including the corporate finance director, the agency's chief economist, its chief accountant, its trading and markets director, and chief litigation counsel. The positions aren't technically political appointees, but the next chairman is expected to install new people in top posts.

When Ms. White came to the agency, she brought Mr. Ceresney, who had worked with her for more than a decade at her former law firm and at the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Together they pursued handpicked priorities, including the policing of financial-reporting fraud and punishing even the smallest violations on the theory that it would deter a culture of misconduct.

Under Mr. Ceresney's watch, the enforcement division filed 143 cases under an initiative targeting inaccurate municipal bond disclosures and dozens of cases alleging short selling violations in advance of public offerings. It also brought several major insider trading cases, including against hedge-fund manager Leon Cooperman and sports-bettor William "Billy" Walters, and reached settlements of hundreds of millions of dollars with Och-Ziff Capital Management Group for foreign bribery and Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit for misusing customer funds.

After years of commuting between New York and Washington, Mr. Ceresney said he doesn't know yet what he will do next but plans to take some time off, reflect on his time in government, and see his family more.

He said his wife is happy about the change but said she mentioned she would lose full access to the television remote on weekday evenings: "Well, it's not all good. Now I gotta debate with you what to watch," he said, relating what his wife told him.

Stifel, Former Executive to Pay $25 Million for Selling  Unsuitably Risky' CDOs

By Imani Moise

Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and a former executive will pay about $25 million after admitting to wrongdoing in case where the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged it sold "unsuitably risky and complex" financial instruments to five school districts in Wisconsin.

The SEC alleged in 2011 that the financial-services firm and a former senior vice president, David Noack, knowingly sold the CDOs to the districts in 2006, causing them to suffer a complete loss of their cash investments.

Analysis: EU Sees Limits to  Bespoke' Post-Brexit Deal With U.K.

By Laurence Norman and Stephen Fidler

Prime Minister Theresa May insists the agreement setting out the U.K.'s future relationship with the European Union won't be an off-the-shelf affair. Britain will get a "bespoke" arrangement exclusively tailored to its own interests, she has said.

That may be true. It is unlikely a future agreement will look like the EU's close economic relations with Norway, which has membership in the bloc's single market and puts no caps on EU migration. Nor will it simply mirror the EU's new trade agreement with Canada, for example.

Officials in Brussels appear to agree. If the U.K. wants a tailor-made deal, they say, there is no reason why it can't have one.

But the apparent accord on this point masks a fundamental difference between the two sides. British politicians and officials argue the U.K. brings things to the EU that no other partner does. They cite security and foreign-policy assistance, counterterrorism and intelligence sharing as well as the size and proximity of its economy. They see those assets as justifying a special deal that reflects the U.K.'s singular pattern of EU cooperation, which no other country has.

Yet for now a time when with opening positions still being formed that argument isn't carrying weight in Brussels and other EU capitals.

For the EU, a bespoke agreement means Britain would end up in a unique place on the spectrum of rights and obligations Brussels has long used to map out ties with non-EU countries.

Such an agreement could be narrow or broad, addressing any or all of the following, and more: tariff levels and nontariff barriers, trade in services, capital- and labor-market issues, business regulation, agriculture, fisheries, and noneconomic issues such as database-sharing to help fight terrorism.

But EU officials insist the U.K.'s access to the EU market will depend on the obligations it is willing to undertake.

Until now, Mrs. May has only given hints about her vision of the future relationship. She is expected to set out more details before the end of March, when she triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and starts a two-year time period for the two sides to agree on Britain's exit terms.

She has said she wants the U.K. to control immigration from EU countries and end the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction over U.K. affairs. She has also said she wants Britain to enjoy free trade in goods and services and for British companies to have maximum freedom to operate in the single market.

European governments say restricting free movement of labor and ignoring the ECJ are incompatible with membership in the EU's single market. For one thing, the ECJ polices the single market; if the British aren't subject to its rulings, how can they be part of that market?

British government ministers have openly disagreed about whether the country should keep making payments to the EU, as Norway, Switzerland and even Israel do. EU officials say Britain will have to pay into the budget if it wants access to EU programs on science and research, education and security. In other words, Britain can't have its cake and eat it, too.

Vicky Ford, a member of the European Parliament from Mrs. May's own Conservative Party, said in a speech this week that Mrs. May had outlined three priorities: immigration control, market access and control over regulation. She urged both sides to remain flexible and said the U.K. should steer clear of maximalist demands, especially on immigration.

"Like a three-legged stool, if one is prioritized more than the others, it can all become unbalanced," she said.

Yet, so far, no dice. On Tuesday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier gave the clearest indications yet that Britain will have to base its choices on a largely predetermined set of benefits and costs that already apply in other EU agreements.

"When you examine different options for future relations naturally, you don't need me to do it you can look at the different models that exist," he said, in his first public remarks since taking up his post. He cited as an example Norway, whose close access to the single market is secured by large payments to the EU.

Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head for the Eurasia Group consulting firm, said Mr. Barnier has made "implied and assumed" thinking "an explicit part of the EU's red lines."

Federal Bank Watchdogs Say They're Not Forcing Banks From Payday

By Annamaria Andriotis and Telis Demos

Federal regulators in court filings Thursday pushed back against claims that they are forcing banks to cut off payday lenders.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve disputed the payday-loan industry's assertion that regulators are forcing banks to shut down lenders' accounts and cutting off access to banking services, saying that the theory is based "on erroneous and unsupported speculation," according to a court filing.

Advance America, one of the largest payday lenders, and the Community Financial Services Association of America, which represents payday lenders, filed an emergency motion last month that seeks a preliminary injunction against the regulators in an attempt to block what they allege is arm twisting of the banks to drop payday customers.

Advance America said in its legal filing that U.S. Bancorp and four other banks had notified the company they were ending their relationships with it in recent weeks. They said the banks pulled the plug under pressure from regulators the main basis for last month's court filing.

The three regulators disputed that allegation on Thursday. OCC official Serena Christenson, who oversees the team of examiners who work onsite at U.S. Bank's Minneapolis headquarters, said no one on her team "directed or otherwise pressured U.S. Bank's management or U.S. Bank's Board of Directors or any other bank employee to terminate the Bank's relationship with Advance America or any other customer," in a declaration filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A U.S. Bank spokesman declined to comment.

The payday industry is standing by its claims. "The government's protestations of innocence cannot be squared with the extensive factual record demonstrating its illegal conduct," said David Thompson, the CFSA's legal counsel.

Payday loans are high-cost, small-dollar loans that are mostly targeted at low-income borrowers as well as those with low credit scores. Interest rates on these loans are generally in triple-digit territory and borrowers often get stuck in a cycle of debt when they sign up for them.

Tensions between the payday industry and regulators came to a head back in 2014 when the payday-lending association and Advance America filed a suit after a first wave of banks canceled their relationships with payday lenders. Last month's action and Thursday's response by regulators is part of the litigation.

WSJ Pro Analysis: Fed Critics Favor Reversing Central Bank Mission Creep

By Adam Creighton

Nobel Prize-winning economist Jan Tinbergen once immortalized the idea that central bankers needed as many policy tools as they have policy targets.

They haven't let him down. Policy tool kits have grown since the financial crisis   to include acronyms WSJPro readers know well: ZIRP, NIRP, QE   to achieve price stability and the more nebulous goal of financial stability.

In the U.S., congressional Republicans aren't happy about this, advocating for a Federal Reserve that is "more predictable in its conduct of monetary policy and more transparent about its decision-making", taking particular aim at "vague and improvisational" forward guidance.

Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, an adviser to the president-elect on financial matters, along with other Republican-leaning academics put some flesh on this potential "back to basics" approach to monetary policy at a policy conference in Washington, D.C. this week.

They called for a diminished Fed role in macroprudential regulation and a formal accord between the Treasury and the Fed.

They are going to have an uphill battle, though. The history of the Fed is one of continual mission creep. In 1977 the Federal Reserve Act was amended to give a then much less high-profile Fed a specific mandate to conduct policy "so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates".

In 2012 the Board formalized that goal into a 2% inflation target over the medium term.

While a desire to promote financial stability underpinned the Fed's creation in 1913, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act expanded the Fed's powers still further, via enhanced supervisory powers of bank and nonbank institutions through the Fed chair's membership of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

"If you subjected macroprudential regulation to a Google search you'd find a paucity of literature before 2010," said Mr. Warsh, who served on the Fed board between 2006 and 2011, contrasting the emerging policy area--which involves using financial regulations to promote financial stability--with the voluminous analysis of monetary policy since World War II. Stanford University economist John Taylor, sometimes touted as a potential Fed chairman, said at the same conference that the central bank should gradually reduce its huge holdings of securities.

Former Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Hoover Institution fellow John Cochrane both advocated for an accord between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to clarify responsibilities and powers.

Mr. Plosser argued that the Treasury should be able to instruct the Fed to purchase securities in a financial crisis, but plan to later shift those securities onto its own balance sheet so profits and losses become more transparent.

"Fed-funds rate changes have become like Papal elections," added Mr. Cochrane, who said the accord should give Treasury pre-eminent say over the maturity structure of public debt. "We've lived through this crazy world where the Treasury sells long and the Fed buys them all back up again," he said.

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

U.S. Daily Payment, Clearing Flows Valued at $7.1T

The Payments Risk Committee, a private sector group of senior managers from U.S. banks sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, put out a new report Thursday calculating the value of aggregate daily U.S. dollar flows through all payment and clearing utilities or banks as $7.1T. The Committee said currently there was ample liquidity in the system to meet those obligations, but changes under way since the financial crisis meant that regulators should keep a close eye on the risk of any disruptions. "Notwithstanding the availability of sufficient liquidity, a number of changes that can affect liquidity are already under way and should be monitored to identify potential bottlenecks," the Fed's payments committee said. "It is critical that the industry look for continuous improvement and refinement of liquidity management processes." (Katy.Burne@wsj.com)

Analyst: BNY Mellon's Payment Failures Pose Systemic Risk

BNY Mellon's payment-clearing problem reported in WSJ Wednesday poses various policy problems and should "reignite discussions of how to regulate financial-market utilities," writes Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics in a client note Thursday. The bank failed to process some payments on Monday because it lost access to the Swift funds-transfer network. BK's problems "will exacerbate industry and [prudential regulator] fears that critical markets could be disrupted with far-reaching systemic effect," she wrote. The Fed became concerned about BK's concentrated role in payments and at one point considered making the bank separate its Treasury and repo clearing arm into a utility. That idea never materialized.

Moody's: Federal Charter Could Be Good for Fintech

Moody's says a bank regulator's proposal for fintech companies to obtain a federal charter would be a "credit positive" for bonds backed by loans from certain online lenders. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released details last Friday of a new regulatory structure in which fintech companies could receive a license that would allow them to, among other things, make loans above state usury limits. That could protect loans from online lenders that got a charter from legal rulings that have called into question whether their prior loans are enforceable in certain states. Moody's analysts also say it could be more expensive for fintech companies to operate under such a charter since it would come with minimum capital requirements, among other restrictions.

Credit-Union Suit May Kick Up Tax-Exempt Status

A brewing legal fight between bankers and credit unions on the latter's membership rules has the potential to draw more attention to a debate about credit unions' tax-exempt status, says Cowen. The American Bankers Association today sued the National Credit Union Administration alleging the industry regulator illegally expanded credit-union-membership rules. But Cowen thinks "this lawsuit is designed to draw attention to the tax status of credit unions just as Congress appears ready to address corporate-tax reform." DC changing the tax status of politically popular credit unions is a long shot, but the issue could generate "headline risk." (ryan.tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

Repo Data May Help Libor-Alternatives Search

The Office of Financial Research says it's uniquely positioned to help regulators come up with the best alternatives to Libor because it's collecting data other agencies haven't yet been able to. Director Richard Berner says the office has been working on gathering data for short-term loans called repos, struck directly between two banks and not routed to a third-party processor. The majority of repos collected already by regulators are cleared by an intermediary, but he notes the majority of trades making up Libor "are still based on judgment" instead of real-life transactions. As such, the one-to-one, or "bilateral," repos the OFR are collecting will help select an alternative reference rate. Says Berner: "The OFR is uniquely situated to collect such data that may lie beyond the reach of other regulators." (katy.burne@wsj.com)

Fed Schedules Final Vote on TLAC Bailout-Prevention Rule

The Federal Reserve's governing board will meet Thursday, December 15, at 11 am to consider a final rule mandating "total loss absorbing capacity" for big banks, the Fed says. The bailout prevention rule, first proposed last year, would mandate that banks issue debt that could be converted into equity in a crisis. The industry and regulators in other countries will be looking to see if the Fed made changes that address concerns raised since the proposal. (Ryan.Tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

Mixing Lending and Collateralized Loan Obligations

Firms that both lend and manage collateralized loan obligations can "reap information advantages" from their "originate to distribute" activities. Does the commingling of the lending and collateral management roles by these firms compel them to trade differently? "http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/12/are-all-clos-equal.html" explore that question in a new research brief. "A closer manager-arranger relationship may provide the manager with access to soft information because the arranger monitors and certifies the borrower's financial performance and compliance with loan covenants," they write.

A paper published by the "https://www.bis.org/publ/work594.pdf" makes the case for monetary policies that take into account the potential for financial risks, known as "leaning against the wind."

Their findings support a shift from a narrow focus on price stability "to a joint consideration of price and financial stability."

Italy's Crisis Situation

KKR, the US-based buyout group, has offered to buy a large minority stake in Germany s GfK, a market research company that publishes data on consumer confidence and products.

KKR has offered to pay a  ¬43.50 per share for the Frankfurt listed business, a 44 per cent premium to Gfk s three-month average price, report Javier Espinoza and Arash Massoudi in London.

The offer has received the full support of GfK Verein, a foundation that controls 56.5 per cent of GfK s shares. The foundation will remain a partner following the KKR investment and will not be reducing its stake.

KKR said the tender offer is conditional to at least 18.5 per cent of GfK s other shareholders beyond the foundation taking up the bid.

GfK analyses big data to help major advertisers and consumer goods manufacturers enrich their consumer experience through advertisement.

In August GfK s stock dropped by more than 20 per cent following the sudden resignations of both its chief executive and chairman after falling out with GfK Verein.

The German company has also struggle to retain market share following delays in contracts and other initiatives.

It is also lacking innovation to properly compete with rivals in its local market.

KKR said it will help the Nuremberg-based group retain its market share as new entrants challenge the business as it looks to turn the business around.

The buyout group, which has already worked with similar companies, including Nielsen, the digital ad ratings service, said it sees potential to turn GfK into a global company as it looks to boost its digital ventures worldwide.

KKR beat off a number of suitors for the business, including TPG, another buyout group, people close to the matter said.

Billionaire investor Buffett is among those sceptical that active strategies can fight back

Legions of investors make a pilgrimage each year to Omaha, Nebraska, to listen to Warren Buffett at the annual shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway.

Few, however, would have anticipated the advice the billionaire delivered in 2014 when he declared that 90 per cent of the cash that he would bequeath to his wife should go to a low-cost S&P 500 index tracker fund.

As well as highlighting the benefit of cheap tracker funds, Mr Buffett also attacked active investing, saying that non-professional investors should avoid trying to pick winning stocks.

A swath of academic evidence supports Mr Buffett, demonstrating that most active managers do not consistently outperform their benchmark once fees have been taken into account.

Among investors, a growing understanding of the importance of fees and charges on long-term returns is driving a huge shift into passively managed strategies, particularly among exchange traded funds that have attracted more than $1.5tn in net cash inflows since 2010.

Momentum in this direction looks set to intensify in the US. The government has proposed that a rule , due to come into force next April, will require financial professionals who provide retirement savings advice to uphold a fiduciary standard that puts clients' interests above their own.

"The new US rule will accelerate the demand for passive strategies and ETFs," says Ju-Hon Kwek of McKinsey. The consultancy believes the asset management industry stands on the brink of a "once-in-a-generation shift" as the result of weaker investment returns, tougher regulations and rising competitive pressures.

McKinsey predicts $8tn of traditional actively managed assets will be "up for grabs" over the next decade, creating a battleground for index fund providers and alternative managers including hedge funds , private equity , real estate and infrastructure.

But Mr Kwek warns it would be wrong to assume that passive funds will be the "sole beneficiary" of this shake-up. Innovative active managers will be able to use new tools, such as big data, to capitalise on their asset allocation expertise and to exploit illiquid investment opportunities.

Support for that view is provided by data from PwC, which show that holdings in passively managed funds and institutional mandates stood at about $7.3tn at the end of 2012, about 11.4 per cent of managed assets globally.

PwC forecasts that passively managed funds and mandates will more than triple to about $23.2bn by 2020, accounting for 21 per cent of the $112tn in globally managed assets.

This means the absolute increase in actively managed assets of $23.8bn by 2020 will outstrip the $15.9bn rise in passively managed assets.

Defenders of active management say that a long era of extraordinary interest rate policy by central banks which boosted the value of both equities and bonds since 2009 may have reached the end of the line. As financial markets respond to the prospect of greater fiscal stimulus led by the incoming administration of Donald Trump , the passive industry for its part is also ready for a return to the type of investment climate seen before the crisis.

Passive fund managers are developing increasingly sophisticated strategies that will present fresh challenges to traditional active managers. Smart beta - index-based strategies that can exploit the mispricing of assets - can be used as a low-cost substitute for some hedge fund strategies. Low-cost automated investment services, known as robo-advice , are being rolled out by fund managers and banks globally.

Anil Sharma, analyst with Morgan Stanley in London, concedes the post-crisis deterioration in the performance of hedge funds suggests that active managers could struggle to regain investors' confidence even as market conditions become more challenging.

Since Mr Buffett issued his advice in early 2014, Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF has returned 25.7 per cent while returns across the hedge fund industry have averaged just 4.6 per cent, according to HFR, the data provider.

The Federal Reserve's governing board will meet Thursday, December 15, at 11 am to consider a final rule mandating "total loss absorbing capacity" for big banks, the Fed says. The bailout prevention rule, first proposed last year, would mandate that banks issue debt that could be converted into equity in a crisis. The industry and regulators in other countries will be looking to see if the Fed made changes that address concerns raised since the proposal. (Ryan.Tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

Can the passive tailwind keep blowing for ETFs?

This is part of a "http://www.ft.com/etfage" on the global rise of exchange traded funds

Legions of investors make a pilgrimage each year to Omaha, Nebraska, to listen to Warren Buffett at the annual shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway.

Few, however, would have anticipated the advice that the billionaire delivered in 2014 when he declared that 90 per cent of the cash that he would bequeath to his wife should go to a low-cost S&P 500 index tracker fund.

As well as highlighting the benefit of cheap tracker funds, Mr Buffett also attacked active investing, arguing that non-professional investors should avoid trying to pick winning stocks.

A swath of academic evidence supports Mr Buffett, demonstrating that most active managers do not consistently outperform their benchmark once fees have been taken into account.

Among investors, a growing understanding of the importance of fees and charges on long-term returns is driving a massive shift into passively managed strategies, particularly among exchange traded funds that have attracted more than $1.5tn in net cash inflows since 2010.

Momentum in this direction looks set to intensify in the US. The government has proposed that a rule, due to come into force next April, will require financial professionals who provide retirement savings advice to uphold a fiduciary standard that puts clients  interests above their own.

 The new US rule will accelerate the demand for passive strategies and ETFs,  says Ju-Hon Kwek, a partner with McKinsey in New York.

The consultancy believes that the asset management industry stands on the brink of a  once-in-a-generation shift  as the result of weaker investment returns, tougher regulations and rising competitive pressures.

McKinsey predicts that $8tn of traditional actively managed assets would be  up for grabs  over the next decade, creating a battleground for index fund providers and alternative managers including "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Hedge_funds", "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Private_equity", "https://www.ft.com/companies/property" and infrastructure.

But Mr Kwek warns it would be wrong to assume that passive funds will be the  sole beneficiary  of this shake-up. Innovative active managers will be able to use new tools, such as big data, to capitalise on their asset allocation expertise and to exploit illiquid investment opportunities.

Anil Sharma, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in London, says more nimble active managers will be able to adapt by offering new products that answer growing demand for more environmentally and socially responsible investment strategies. More quantitatively-driven strategies that exploit big data will provide another avenue to resist the encroachment of passive ETFs, according to Mr Sharma, who says gloomy predictions of the death of active management are  exaggerated .

Support for that view is provided by data from PwC, the professional services company, which show that holdings in passively managed funds and institutional mandates stood at about $7.3tn at the end of 2012, about 11.4 per cent of managed assets globally.

PwC forecasts that passively managed funds and mandates will more than triple to about $23.2tn by 2020, accounting for 21 per cent of the $112tn in globally managed assets.

This means that the absolute increase in actively managed assets of $23.8tn by 2020 will outstrip the $15.9tn rise in passively managed assets.

Defenders of active management argue that a long era of extraordinary interest rate policy by central banks and which boosted the value of both equities and bonds since 2009 may have reached the end of the line.

Euan Munro, chief executive of Aviva Investors, says  this period is coming to an end , adding that investors will require active managers to help them navigate through the more volatile conditions that lie ahead.

 The journey towards a zero interest rate world provided a significant tailwind for all financial assets, making it relatively easy to secure healthy returns,  he says.

As financial markets respond to the prospect of greater fiscal stimulus led by the incoming administration of "https://www.ft.com/donald-trump", the passive industry for its part is also ready for a return to the type of investment climate seen before the crisis.

Passive fund managers are developing increasingly sophisticated strategies that will present fresh challenges to traditional active managers. Smart beta   index-based strategies that can exploit the mispricing of assets   can be used as a low-cost substitute for some hedge fund strategies.

Low-cost automated investment services, known as robo-advice, are being rolled out by fund managers and banks globally. Although some robo-advice services have started to incorporate actively managed funds, the vast majority of their assets are directed into passive ETFs to save costs. Citigroup, the US bank, has predicted robo-advice could develop into a $15tn market by the end of 2025.

Mr Sharma concedes that the post-crisis deterioration in the performance of hedge funds suggests that active managers could struggle to regain investors  confidence even as market conditions become more challenging.

Since Mr Buffett issued his advice in early 2014, Vanguard s S&P 500 ETF has returned 25.7 per cent while returns across the hedge fund industry   home to the most aggressive active managers   have averaged just 4.6 per cent, according to HFR, the data provider.

Turks urged to trust in lira as strong dollar takes toll; Emerging markets

Currency's weakness has raised fears companies will struggle to repay debt

Emerging markets across the globe are already suffering because of expectations of a US interest rate rise - and few are feeling the pain more than Turkey .

The country's currency has been plunging in the wake of the election of Donald Trump , who favours fiscal stimulus rather than ultra-low interest rates, and ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting next week that could raise benchmark rates for only the second time since the financial crisis.

In response, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on citizens' patriotism to alleviate the knock-on effect on the lira. He has exhorted them to break what he describes as the "tyranny of the dollar", asking people to stock up on the lira and gold instead and so defeat the "economic sabotage" perpetrated by the country's enemies.

Some businessmen have responded to the leader's call by offering free bus rides or haircuts to those who have sold dollars. Turkish officials add that capital controls have been discussed - but up to now rejected - as a means of arresting the slide of the lira, down more than 10 per cent against the dollar since Mr Trump's election on November 8.

"As long as our citizens don't abandon the lira, we will be OK," said one official, referring to the hope that Turkish nationals will respond to Mr Erdogan's calls by converting into lira some of the roughly $140bn held in the country's foreign currency accounts.

Other emerging markets leaders have been more restrained in their language and less imaginative in their solutions. But they face the same problem: a strengthening dollar and rising US interest rates threaten to hammer their currencies by sending overseas investors rushing for the exit.

Market movements highlight the interplay between low US interest rates and capital flows in and out of developing economies - and the high stakes for countries such as Turkey, whose companies took advantage of ultra-low monetary policy elsewhere to take out large amounts of foreign-denominated debt. According to the latest weekly data, foreign investors dumped $2.6bn-worth of Turkish bonds and equities in November. Turkish citizens ignored Mr Erdogan' s pleas and bought $1bn of foreign currency in the last week of the month, says Atilla Yesilada of Istanbul Analytics, a consultancy.

It is largely the same story across emerging markets. International investors ditched emerging market stocks and bonds in November on a scale not seen since their last great exodus in 2013, withdrawing more than $24bn from such assets, according to the Institute of International Finance.

Investors in emerging market assets fear that - after a false start a year ago - US monetary policy will now begin to tighten, partly because of Mr Trump's promises to reflate the economy through infrastructure spending.

While currencies such as the Mexican peso and the Indian rupee have also been battered, not all countries with weak currencies are burdened by high levels of foreign exchange debt.

But Turkey is particularly exposed. Some investors are concerned about political risk and Mr Erdogan's hostility to high interest rates. The principal worry, however, is the nearly $210bn in foreign currency liabilities owed by the nonbank corporate sector - debt that has expanded rapidly even as the Turkish state has cut back on its borrowing.

Continued weakness in the lira could make servicing those debts harder - particularly if the currency dips below TL3.70 to the dollar. It has already briefly hit TL3.59 but on Tuesday had strengthened to about TL3.50.

"Last week, all people could talk about was the lira," said one Europe-based analyst, who declined to be identified. "If everyone is heading out the door, nobody wants to be the last one."

Turkey has other problems, too - it relies on imported oil, which could further increase its current account deficit.

KKR Gathers $711 Million for Technology Growth Fund

KKR & Co. closed its first dedicated fund for taking stakes in fast-expanding technology, media and telecommunications companies at a time the sector has become a hot investment target for private equity.

The New York firm said its $711 million KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund LP exceeded its original target, which KKR declined to disclose.

The vehicle is expected to make equity investments of less than $100 million in sectors including software, information technology, security, digital media and the Internet of Things a phrase used to describe the addition of sensors, computing and communications to various consumer products.

The firm will make investments from the fund averaging $40 million to $50 million, said David Welsh, a KKR managing director who heads the firm's growth-equity program for technology, media and telecommunications.

Mr. Welsh formerly a partner at Adams Street Partners, where he focused on technology growth-equity investments joined KKR in October. He previously was an executive vice president of corporate development and strategy at antivirus company McAfee Inc.; and a general partner at Partech Ventures, which during his time at the venture firm invested in Five9 Inc., a provider of software for call centers.

KKR's new technology fund comes as the private-equity industry continues to raise ever larger piles of capital to put to work in the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-has-a-crush-on-tech-1467308434" both a sign of the promise the space offers and a possible red flag about whether the sector is becoming overheated.

Private-equity funds focused on technology have amassed close to $50 billion so far this year as of Nov. 15, according to data provider Preqin Ltd., putting it close to the six-year peak of $52.2 billion raised in 2015.

KKR's growth-capital deals will be done within a group led by Herald Chen, Richard Sarnoff and Philipp Freise.

KKR contributed to security company Ping Identity Corp.'s growth-equity round this year. The firm also has provided growth capital to companies such as big data business Optimal Plus Ltd., sightseeing booking site GetYourGuide GmbH, data-integration technology provider Jitterbit Inc. and cybersecurity company Darktrace Ltd.

KKR joins a number of large private-equity firms that have formed growth-focused funds.

Technology investor Thoma Bravo said this year it raised $1.07 billion for its stand-alone, lower midmarket software focused fund, Thoma Bravo Discover Fund LP. That vehicle aims to make equity investments of up to $150 million and targets companies with annual revenue of $30 million to $150 million.

Enterprise software-focused Vista Equity Partners is in the midst of fundraising for its sixth flagship fund and recently "http://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-seeks-to-raise-upper-limit-for-tech-buyout-fund-to-10-5-billion-1479474000" by $500 million to $10.5 billion.

The firm also asked investors to raise its Vista Foundation Fund III LP's maximum size to $2.75 billion. That vehicle makes investments in software companies valued between $100 million and $500 million.

Infogroup Inc., a CCMP Capital Advisors-backed provider of data, analytics and marketing services, is in the late stages of a sale process run by Bank of America Corp., said people familiar with the matter.

The people said a sale of Infogroup could bring in $700 million to $800 million if a deal is reached.

They added that the Papillion, Neb., company which has attracted interest from private-equity firms is projected to generate around $70 million in 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Infogroup provides data and software-as-a-service products to help companies increase sales and customer loyalty. The company's clients include large and small companies as well as government, academic and nonprofit entities.

The business includes five units: Infogroup Media Solutions; Infogroup Data Licensing; Infogroup Targeting Solutions; Infogroup Local Marketing Solutions; and Yes Lifecycle Marketing.

Infogroup's customers include large and small companies as well as government, academic and nonprofit entities.

CCMP in 2010 "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJLBO20100702211282"in a deal that was valued at $635 million, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported. Bank of America at the time committed debt financing and served as a financial adviser to CCMP on the transaction.

Since the company was taken private, it has sold a number of its divisions to private-equity firms and their portfolio companies. GTCR-backed Cannondale Investments in 2012 "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0020121002e8a2nc95n" (OneSource, a business information provider, changed its name to Avention Inc. in 2014.) In 2011, Infogroup "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJLBO20110707230721", ORC International Inc., to Lake Capital Management.

In addition to divesting assets, Infogroup also made at least one acquisition under CCMP's management. The company acquired Specialized Fundraising Services Inc., a provider of direct-marketing services to the nonprofit space, in 2014, according to a news release at the time.

Infogroup generated 2009 Ebitda of $85 million before it was taken private by CCMP, according to data provided by S&P Capital IQ. The company currently has debt totaling $334.5 million, according to data provided by FactSet.

CCMP, of New York, invests in the consumer, industrial and health-care sectors. The firm closed CCMP Capital Investors III LP in 2014, raising $3.6 billion.

When Billionaires Meet: $50 Billion Pledge From SoftBank to Trump; After meeting Donald Trump, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son puts sheds new light on existing investment plans

Masayoshi Son, the brash billionaire who controls Sprint Corp., said Tuesday he would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs, following a 45-minute private meeting with President-elect Donald Trump.

The telecom mogul, who made his fortune in Japan with SoftBank GroupCorp., announced his investment plans in the lobby of Trump Tower, though he didn't provide details. Mr. Trump took credit for the investment, saying his November victory spurred SoftBank's decision.

Mr. Son told reporters he planned to "invest into the new startup companies in the United States." It would be difficult to create 50,000 jobs entirely by investing in startups, which generally employ few workers. Sprint employs about 30,000 people and has cut jobs to combat losses.

In an interview, Mr. Son said the money will be "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-group-launches-investment-fund-1476398189" that he began setting up earlier this year with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners.

Mr. Son's plan to pour $50 billion is massive compared with the total amount of capital in venture circles. Venture-capital firms had $163 billion available to invest in new deals as of June 2016, according to research firm Preqin.

In addition to startups, Mr. Son also has his sights on acquisitions as large as $30 billion, a person familiar with his thinking said.

In addition to Kansas-based Sprint, which SoftBank acquired in 2013 for $22 billion, the company also led a $1 billion investment round last year in San Francisco-based online lender Social Finance Inc.

When he acquired Sprint, Mr. Son's initial plan was to merge the carrier with German-owned T-Mobile US Inc. to take on market leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., but he abandoned the effort after regulators signaled they would reject the plan. Some investors and analysts have said he could make another attempt after Mr. Trump's election and when a new chairman is appointed to the Federal Communications Commission.

Mr. Son planned to tell Mr. Trump about what happened with T-Mobile, and how he had wanted to invest in the U.S. but the regulatory climate was too harsh so he invested outside the U.S. instead, the person familiar with the matter said.

On Tuesday, Mr. Son declined to comment about his current interest in T-Mobile.

The 59-year-old is known as an ambitious investor who bets on tech and telecom ventures. His company has a large stake in China's Alibaba Group and most recently "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-buy-arm-holdings-for-more-than-32-billion-1468808434" ARM Holdings PLC for $32 billion.

Mr. Son has a history of going straight to national leaders to talk business. In September he met South Korean President Park Geun-hye, and said he intends to invest about five trillion won (about $4.5 billion) in the country's technology sector. He also has met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pledged to spend billions on the nation's tech startups and renewable energy projects.

With the new $100 billion fund dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund Mr. Son plans to spend heavily in fields including the so-called Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, deep learning and robotics. He has said he wants to become the Warren Buffett of the tech industry.

SoftBank plans to invest at least $25 billion during the next five years in the fund, while Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund may contribute an additional $45 billion over the same period as the fund's lead partner. Other investors are still being finalized. Investments are expected to be made over the next five years.

AT&T Inc. Chief Executive Randall Stephenson also spoke positively of the economic benefits of a Trump presidency Tuesday, largely because of lower taxes and less government oversight. He expressed hope that "a more moderate approach to some of these regulations is in the making under a Trump administration."

At a UBS AG conference in New York, he said, "If we achieve any kind of meaningful corporate tax reform I am quite convinced that it is going to change this trajectory in terms of capital investment." He added that the company's business plans for 2017 are incorporating scenarios for economics growth to be higher than expected, compared with recent years where the focus was on underperformance.

"I can't remember the last time I did an upside sensitivity in a business plan, but we are doing an upside sensitivity right now," he said.

Blackstone Is Taking Its Home Bet Public

By Ryan Dezember 
927 words
7 December 2016
The Wall Street Journal

English

Jonathan Gray of Blackstone Group LP went on the biggest home-buying spree in history after the U.S. foreclosure crisis, purchasing repossessed properties from courthouse steps and through online auctions.

Four years, $10 billion and roughly 50,000 homes later, he will find out whether his gambit will pay off. Invitation Homes LP, the Dallas-based company Blackstone formed to maintain and rent those homes, has filed confidentially for an initial public offering that could come as soon as January.

Though Blackstone is unlikely to sell much or even any of its stake in an IPO, the stock market debut will test investors' interest in the idea that the rental-home business can be institutionalized, just as apartments, shopping centers and office towers have been.

Blackstone and other investors saw the housing collapse as a rare opportunity to acquire homes for less than it cost to build them. Millions of foreclosures created a market large enough to justify investing in large systems to manage and maintain sprawling portfolios of rental homes.

Now, these new institutional landlords say the move toward rentals further supports their business model. They point to tight lending standards and a generation of renters who are outgrowing apartments but are too burdened by student debt to buy homes.

To generate the revenue growth that shareholders will demand, they must pace rent increases to avoid spooking tenants into becoming home buyers themselves. And now that foreclosure rates have returned to normal levels and prices have rebounded, they could find it difficult to add houses at attractive prices.

They also must convince investors that huge home-rental companies are viable long-term businesses, not just massive portfolios of properties that need to be sold off.

Estimated by investors at about $35 trillion, U.S. homes are one of the world's largest asset classes -- collectively worth more than the $20 trillion U.S. stock market. Since the housing meltdown, big investors have spent at least $32 billion buying and fixing up homes, and they own between 1% and 2% of all U.S. rental homes, analysts estimate.

Invitation Homes won't be the first Wall Street landlord to go public. American Homes 4 Rent, which was started in 2012 by self-storage magnate B. Wayne Hughes with cash from Alaska's state oil fund, made its stock-market debut in 2013. It owns about 48,000 rental houses in 22 states.

Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust began trading in early 2014. After merging earlier this year with the home portfolio of fellow real-estate mogul Thomas J. Barrack, it changed its name to Colony Starwood Homes and became the country's third-largest landlord.

After a slow start, American Homes and Colony shares took off this year, rising 27% and 33%, respectively, far exceeding the S&P 500's 7.9% gain.

"We're no longer trying to convince the investment world this is a legitimate business," Fred Tuomi, Colony Starwood's chief executive, said in an interview.

Though the chance has passed to acquire thousands of houses at steep discounts, Colony and its competitors are still buying individual homes here and there as well as groups of homes bundled by other investors during the crisis, Mr. Tuomi said. Colony, he said, could manage about 100,000 homes without having to invest much more in the systems it has built.

Economic factors have helped the stocks in the sector. Home prices have risen above their 2006 peaks in much of the country, boosting the value of these firms' holdings. That and rising interest rates have pushed homeownership out of reach for many. Lately, the homeownership rate has hovered around its lowest level in at least 50 years, according to U.S. Census data.

Meanwhile, rental vacancies, including apartments, are at their lowest level in at least a decade at 6.8% in the third quarter. Rents are up, particularly in single-family homes, where rents are growing faster than for apartments, according to Green Street Advisors LLC.

Some of the 14 metropolitan areas where Blackstone's Invitation Homes operates have had among the highest home-price appreciations in recent years. In Phoenix, where Blackstone bought its first house in 2012, prices have risen 57.5% since its home-buying binge began, according to Weiss Analytics.

Blackstone has said it focused on properties in top school districts that were suitable for families. Invitation Homes spent more money buying and fixing up its homes -- about $172,000, on average -- than any of its competitors, Amherst Capital Management estimated. Blackstone executives have said they spent about $25,000 repairing and updating each home.

The housing bet was one that Mr. Gray, who started Blackstone's real-estate business shortly after joining the firm in 1992, didn't have to make to ensure his status on Wall Street. But with a flood of cash from investors who flocked to Blackstone's funds after the financial crisis, the opportunity proved too tempting to pass up.

In interviews last year, Mr. Gray and Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said tighter lending standards, buyers with wrecked credit and banks loaded with repossessed homes presented an unprecedented investment opportunity.

Blackstone, whose executives declined to comment for this article, went on to spend as much as $150 million a week on houses, aiming to acquire enough in each market to make maintenance efficient enough to be profitable.

Thriving UK tech start-ups fear US squeeze on talent

A few months after Pakistani-born Azmat Yusuf left Google s London office in 2010, he founded "https://citymapper.com/london", an urban transit app now used in 29 cities around the world.

His move from an industry heavyweight to a British technology start-up is one example of a common trend in the sector. The top five past employers of workers in UK tech start-ups today are IBM, HP, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo, according to a new report from Balderton Capital, which surveyed 1,000 venture-backed companies.

 Firms like Google, Facebook and Microsoft are effectively training our local workforce to become entrepreneurs,  says James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital, the European venture capital firm.  Some of the most successful founders, including within our own portfolio, from Citymapper to TransferWise, came out of these large tech companies. 

So, the recent announcements from two of the largest US tech companies that they planned to create hundreds of new jobs in the UK should have been seen as a significant boost to the broader British tech industry.

Last month, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai announced that the group s new UK headquarters would have space for at least 3,000 new employees in London. When Facebook followed with its own announcement the following week, promising to boost its UK headcount by half to 1,500, it increased the confidence displayed by US groups in Britain s technical expertise.

But while many entrepreneurs and investors believe these moves will galvanise the local workforce, others worry the industry   and particularly smaller tech companies and start-ups   could be curtailed by a talent squeeze. Increased competition for skilled engineers, along with harsher immigration controls post-Brexit, are fuelling fears of an industry staffing crisis in the UK.

 There is a global war for talent, and our [UK] companies are absolutely competing for talent. It is a significant concern for us,  says Fred Destin, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners, who sits on the board of companies including Deliveroo.  Anybody who tells you we are not competing for resources is not telling the truth. 

Neither Google nor Facebook explicitly broke down where the UK jobs would be created but both indicated that many of the roles would be high-skilled engineering jobs, drawn from the UK s pool of talented computer scientists.

-----------------

European tech capitals: London stands on top

-----------------

Britain has the highest proportion of science, technology and maths graduates under 30 in Europe. It is also a magnet for coding talent: London is home to 300,345 developers   the most of any European city, according to the Balderton study.

But last year 32 per cent of developers in the UK switched jobs, according to the report.  Salaries have gone up markedly, especially for niche skills like machine learning and data science, because there are high levels of attrition,  Mr Wise says.

The prospect of rising pay packets is expected to be a bigger obstacle for start-ups than large tech groups such as Google and Facebook.

UK start-ups employ 31 per cent of those who work in small tech businesses across Europe, making it by far the continent s largest early-stage tech employer.

 Our companies know they can never compete with world-leading companies on salaries alone,  Mr Wise says.  On that front, the ability of start-ups to continue to attract talent is going to be harder. 

In particular, British tech companies warn that UK start-ups may lose out on graduates, although they could make up the numbers through more experienced hires looking for fresh challenges.

 [Google and Facebook] may increase the competition for talent: they are more likely to have more developed recruitment functions with closer ties to universities, for example, but they also attract more talent to London,  says Jo White, director of communications at London fintech firm TransferWise.  But big companies have a different appeal to start-ups. For many people it is about the experience they are looking for at different stages in their career. 

Given that the UK s tech sector relies heavily on pan-European recruitment   with company founders estimating that between a third and half of UK start-up engineers are foreign   there are fears in some quarters that a shortage of skilled people could hit companies, both large and small.

-----------------

UK tech start-up workers  most common backgrounds

-----------------

Dominic Jacquesson, head of talent at venture firm Index Ventures, who helps to hire across companies including Funding Circle and TransferWise, says he can already see a talent squeeze.  Any form of visa sponsorship required [when the UK leaves the EU] would be a massive blow to UK tech in terms of recruitment. That deep pool would really start to dry up,  he says.

Despite these misgivings, there is a consensus of positivity around the new jobs announcements.

Many believe Google and Facebook will attract more diversity to the sector, from university graduates to experienced managers from professional services, government and academia, resulting in an ever more skilled workforce.

 I think [the job announcements are] insanely good news for the entire ecosystem because technical skills will evolve, as kids think,  these are the jobs I want when I graduate ,  says David Buttress, chief executive of JustEat, an online takeaway platform.  We re investing tens of millions of pounds building engineering talent in Bristol, and this will attract even more people to the industry. 

Others who have invested in innovative British tech for several years say the announcements are a sign of maturity in the UK market.  [Google and Facebook s] expansion is a huge vote of confidence and has nothing to do with Brexit,  says Saul Klein, venture capitalist at Localglobe and a co-founder of European start-up incubator Seedcamp.  The benefits will spill over into the UK tech ecosystem, which has been about 15 years in the making.

Thriving start-ups fear a squeeze on talent; Technology: Recruitment

New UK jobs from Facebook and Google boost sector but intensify war for skilled staff

A few months after Pakistani-born Azmat Yusuf left Google's London office in 2010, he founded Citymapper, an urban transit app now used in 29 cities around the world.

His move from an industry heavyweight to a British technology start-up is one example of a common trend in the sector. The top five past employers of workers in UK tech start-ups today are IBM, HP, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo, according to a new report from Balderton Capital, which surveyed 1,000 venture-backed companies.

"Firms like Google, Facebook and Microsoft are effectively training our local workforce to become entrepreneurs," says James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital, the European venture capital firm. "Some of the most successful founders within our own portfolio, from Citymapper to TransferWise, came out of these large tech companies."

So, the recent announcements from two of the largest US tech companies that they planned to create hundreds of new jobs in the UK should have been seen as a significant boost to the broader British tech industry.

Last month, Sundar Pichai , Google's chief executive, announced that the group's new UK headquarters would have space for at least 3,000 new employees in London. When Facebook promised the following week to boost its UK headcount by half to 1,500, it increased the confidence displayed by US groups in Britain's technical expertise.

But while many entrepreneurs and investors believe these moves will galvanise the local workforce, others worry that the industry - and particularly smaller tech companies and start-ups - could be curtailed by a talent squeeze. Increased competition for skilled engineers, along with harsher immigration controls post-Brexit, are fuelling fears of an industry staffing crisis in the UK. "There is a global war for talent, and our [UK] companies are absolutely competing for talent. It is a significant concern for us," says Fred Destin, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners, who sits on the board of companies including Deliveroo. "Anybody who tells you we are not competing for resources is not telling the truth."

Google and Facebook did not detail what the new UK jobs were - but both indicated that many would be high-skilled engineering roles, drawn from the UK's pool of computer scientists.

Wall Street as Landlord: Blackstone Going Public with a $10 Billion Bet on Foreclosed Homes; Invitation Homes IPO will test investors' interest in the idea that the rental-home business can be institutionalized as apartments were before

Jonathan Gray of Blackstone Group LP went on the biggest homebuying spree in history after the U.S. foreclosure crisis, purchasing repossessed properties from the courthouse steps and through online auctions.

Four years, $10 billion and roughly 50,000 homes later, he will find out "http://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstones-latest-fund-raises-14-5-billion-in-institutional-capital-1427734491"off. Invitation Homes LP, the Dallas-based company Blackstone formed to maintain and rent those homes, has "http://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-groups-invitation-homes-files-confidentially-for-an-ipo-1480546946" that could come as soon as January.

Though Blackstone is unlikely to sell much or even any of its stake in an IPO, the stock market debut will test investors' interest in the idea that the rental-home business can be institutionalized as apartments, shopping centers and office towers were before.

Blackstone and others investors believed that the housing collapse presented a rare opportunity to acquire homes for less than it cost to build them. Millions of foreclosures created a market large enough to justify investing in large systems to manage and maintain sprawling portfolios of rental homes.

Now, these new institutional landlords say the move toward rentals further supports their business model. They point to tight lending standards and a generation of renters who are outgrowing apartments but are too burdened by student debt to buy homes.

Historically, mom-and-pop investors and regional players have owned nearly all the single-family homes for rent. Blackstone and other investors that emerged from the foreclosure crisis face unique challenges in joining them, beyond the chore of maintaining thousands of far-flung homes.

To generate the revenue growth that shareholders will demand, they must pace rent hikes to avoid spooking tenants into becoming home buyers themselves. And now that foreclosure rates have returned to normal levels and prices have rebounded, they could find it difficult to add new houses at attractive prices.

They also must convince investors that huge home-rental companies are viable long-term businesses, not just massive portfolios of properties that need to be sold off.

But if Blackstone and its rivals in the rental-home business succeed, they will have created a huge new field in which Wall Street can invest.

At about $35 trillion, U.S. homes are one of the world's largest asset classes collectively worth more than the $20 trillion U.S. stock market. Since the housing meltdown, big investors have spent at least $32 billion buying and fixing up homes, and they own between 1% and 2% of all U.S. rental homes, analysts estimate.

Invitation Homes won't be the first Wall Street landlord to go public.

American Homes 4 Rent, which was launched in 2012 by self-storage magnate B. Wayne Hughes with cash from Alaska's state oil fund, made its stock market debut in 2013. It owns about 48,000 rental houses in 22 states.

Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust began trading in early 2014. After merging earlier this year with the home portfolio of fellow real estate mogul Thomas J. Barrack, it changed its name to Colony Starwood Homes and became the country's third-largest landlord.

After a slow start, American Homes and Colony shares took off this year, rising 27% and 33%, respectively, far exceeding the S&P 500's 7.9% gain.

"We're no longer trying to convince the investment world this is a legitimate business," Fred Tuomi, Colony Starwood's chief executive, said in an interview. "We're not in this to simply fix and flip. We're in this for the long-term, steady and growing income stream."

Though the chance has passed to acquire thousands of houses at steep discounts, Colony and its competitors are still buying individual homes here and there as well as groups of homes bundled by other investors during the crisis, Mr. Tuomi said. Colony, he said, could manage about 100,000 homes without having to invest much more in the systems it built to manage them.

Economic factors have helped the stocks in the sector. Home prices have risen above their 2006 peaks in much of the country, boosting the value of these firms' holdings. That and rising interest rates have pushed homeownership out of reach for many. Lately, the homeownership rate has hovered around its lowest level in at least 50 years, according to U.S. Census data.

Meanwhile, rental vacancies, including apartments, are at their lowest level in at least a decade at 6.8% in the third quarter. Rents are up, particularly in single-family homes, where rents are growing faster than at apartments, according to Green Street Advisors LLC.

Some of the 14 metropolitan areas where Blackstone's Invitation Homes operates have had among the greatest home price appreciation in recent years. In Phoenix, where Blackstone bought its first house in 2012, prices have risen 57.5% since its homebuying binge began, according to Weiss Analytics. In Las Vegas, prices are up 60.3% since 2012.

Blackstone has said it focused on properties in top school districts that were suitable for families, a strategy shared by rivals who have told investors that tenants in such areas more readily accept rent hikes to avoid moving. Invitation Homes spent more money buying and fixing up its homes about $172,000, on average than any of its competitors, Amherst Capital Management estimated in a recent study. Blackstone executives have said they spent about $25,000 repairing and updating each home.

The housing bet was one Mr. Gray, who started Blackstone's real-estate business shortly after joining the firm in 1992, didn't have to make to ensure his status on Wall Street. But with a flood of cash from investors who flocked to Blackstone's funds after the financial crisis, the opportunity proved too tempting to pass.

In interviews with The Wall Street Journal last year, Mr. Gray and Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said tighter lending standards, buyers with wrecked credit and banks loaded with repossessed homes presented an unprecedented investment opportunity.

Blackstone, whose executives declined to comment for this article, went on to spend as much as $150 million a week on houses, aiming to acquire enough in each market to make maintenance efficient enough to profit.

Accompany Raises $20 Million, Led by Ignition Partners; Ex-Googlers want to build a platform that could make it possible for everyone to have a chief of staff

Chief Executive Amy Chang said she built Accompany out of "complete desperation."

After being caught in a meeting without access to data that was readily accessible in the news, she began to look for a tool that could save her from future embarrassment. But the former Google Analytics chief couldn't find one.

So she started Accompany, a tool that collects data from the Web, email, calendars and social feeds to provide relevant information about professional contacts. The company's vision is to one day make it possible for every employee to have their own digital chief of staff.

She said chiefs of staff are tasked with making sure people have access to all the information they "need to be armed with" going into big meetings. Accompany syncs with a calendar and then provides helpful biographical details, recent emails or news about a company relevant to specific meetings.

The three-year-old company announced on Monday it has raised $20 million in fresh funding, bringing its total to $40.6 million. The company launched its service in beta to select users in August, and it plans to launch out of beta in the coming months.

On Monday, Ms. Chang announced in London onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt that the beta version would launch. She said Accompany will initially focus on English-speaking markets as different languages pose challenges for its speech recognition technology.

The company has 40 employees and offices in both Los Altos, Calif., and Portland, Oregon. The company will also use the funds to expand its team.

Ms. Chang said the funding from Ignition Partners resulted out of conversations she had with partners at the firm who sit on the board of Splunk with her. She said it was a preemptive round, where the investors approached the company.

"We know we're damn lucky for that," she said.

BlackRock Names BuzzFeed Executive Frank Cooper as Chief Marketing Officer; Company working to bolster business from individual investors

BlackRock Inc. has hired a new global chief marketing officer from digital media company BuzzFeed as the world's largest money manager works to bolster its business from individual investors.

Frank Cooper, who spent the last 18 months as chief marketing officer and chief creative officer at BuzzFeed, plans to join the New York asset manager in January, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal.

He will report to Chief Executive Laurence Fink, who sent the internal memo and highlighted Mr. Cooper's experience using "new marketing technologies to help organizations from global consumer companies to technology startups to drive growth." Mr. Cooper is set to lead a marketing team that focuses on research and analytics, digital marketing and branding, the memo said.

At BuzzFeed Mr. Cooper "http://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-chief-marketing-officer-frank-cooper-to-exit-company-1480355112" and helped create sponsored content. He joined BuzzFeed after more than a decade at PepsiCo Inc. and worked previously at AOL, Warner Bros. and as an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles.

BlackRock started as an institutional money-management business and has tried in recent years to diversify its business mix and find new ways to sell funds to retail investors. The firm is currently focused on gathering more assets from these retail, or individual investors, in part by using its proprietary Aladdin investment and risk-management technology.

Retail assets represented 12% of assets under management at BlackRock at the end of the third quarter, but 34% of its traditional investment fees. Its iShares exchange-traded fund unit accounted for 26% of assets and 37% of fees with its institutional business representing the balance.

The firm has decentralized some of its reporting lines in recent months with heads of the firm's regional retail businesses reporting to local executives in Europe, Asia and the Americas, rather than one global head.

Mr. Cooper will join BlackRock's Global Executive Committee. He partly succeeds the company's longtime global head of marketing and communications, Linda Robinson, who is moving to a vice chairman role, the firm told employees in April.

Global Head of Corporate Communications Jim Badenhausen, who has also served as interim chief marketing officer for the last two years and previously reported to Ms. Robinson, will now report to Mr. Fink.

Fullerton Health Singapore IPO scuppered after complaints

A Singapore-based provider of corporate health services called off its initial public offering following a campaign of anonymous letters complaining about the company s fee structure.

Fullerton Health scrapped itsplanned listing on SGX last monthafter a series of letters to regulators that criticised the fact that its fees are a percentage of medical bills rather than a flat price, and complained of unexpected reductions when doctors were reimbursed for their services.

TheIPO was priced at S$1.52 a share   the bottom end of its marketed range   and would have raised S$213m ($149m).

People familiar with the IPO process say the case highlights the challenge that new entrants to a market can face from established businesses   in this case the letters targeting the healthcare company appear to have been written by doctors.

Like  managed care  companies in the US, Fullerton Health aims to lower corporate healthcare costs through scale, which increases its bargaining power with panels of subcontracted doctors.

The Singapore business also uses data analytics to detect fraudulent healthcare claims. Its clients include BP, Singapore Airlines and Marina Bay Sands.

The claims about unexpected deductions appear to relate to adjudicated claims, in which doctors  bills are adjusted downwards before payment.

The campaign seemed orchestrated, with a fresh letter at the end of every week, one person familiar with the IPO process said, adding that the company and its advisers began referring to 6pm on Friday as  the witching hour .

The  poison pen  campaign has raised questions about SGX s policy of accepting anonymous complaints relating to IPO prospectuses.

Other exchanges such as Hong Kong say that while anonymous complaints will be noted, they may not be acted on if the exchange is unable to contact a correspondent to substantiate a claim.

A banker in Singapore said, however, that the public airing of complaints underlined the disruptive potential of the company. The banker said:  To my mind, causing so much angst suggests some validation of their business model. 

In its statement to the Singapore exchange, Fullerton Health said it had decided against the listing on SGX  in light of current market uncertainty .

It added:  Fullerton Health believes they have satisfactorily answered all questions from [the Monetary Authority of Singapore] and SGX. 

The Fullerton Health spokesman said: There is an ongoing debate regarding percentage fees in our industry, with a range of opinions on the merits of this simple structure.  The company is in consultation with doctors about alternative fee structures, it said.

It added:  We do not expect our business model, the strength of our business plan and our expectations for revenue growth to be affected by how we charge our fees. 

Singapore Medical Association, the doctors  professional body, has publicly criticised  managed care  companies for charging fees that are percentages of medical bills   and may be large sums in the case of inpatient admissions.

The doctors  body says these  excessive  fees for major operations are disproportionate to the administrative work required.

SGX, Southeast Asia s biggest stock market by volume, has been facing a dearth of IPOs.

Tan Boon Gin, chief regulatory officer at SGX, said the exchange worked closely with companies involved in listings to resolve any issues raised after a prospectus is lodged.

 What is important is materiality and proof 	. 	. 	. 	we will not entertain feedback that is clearly frivolous or vexatious,  Mr Tan said.

What Italian Vote Means for Financial Regulation

BRUSSELS As the U.S. gears up for the possibility of new approaches to financial regulation under the Trump administration, potential changes are also brewing across the Atlantic.

Italians are set to vote Sunday on a constitutional referendum that could alter the country's political course and roil markets, testing the stability of its No. 3 lender, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA .

In the case of a "no" vote to overhauls that would limit the power of Italy's Senate, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he plans to step down, prompting the country to hold elections as soon as next year to form a new government. That would pave the way for anti-establishment forces such as the 5 Star Movement to gain influence.

The movement, founded in 2009 by Beppe Grillo, has a nearly 30% approval rating among Italian voters, according to a poll conducted in November by Demos & Pi. The group's take on financial regulation deviates from the current norm in Brussels and mainstream parties.

While an Italian "no" vote is unlikely to influence rules crafted in Brussels in the short term, it may well increase the influence of political movements seeking to increase regulation of financial institutions, including breaking them up.

"The 5 Star Movement supports an ambitious reform of the financial sector, based on a stringent regulation of shadow banking and complex financial systems as well as a sort of new European Glass-Steagall Act aimed at separating investment banking activities from the core commercial function," said 5 Star politician Marco Valli, a 31-year-old member of the European Parliament who sits on the economic and monetary affairs committee.

In a joint interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Valli and Marco Zanni, also a 5 Star member of the European Parliament , said a "no" vote in Italy would boost their group's momentum.

In terms of financial regulation, separating retail banking activities from trading and investment banking is at the top of the list for the 5 Star Movement, an idea that finds support among other alternative parties such as the Green Party.

Two prominent Greens on the European Parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee, Sven Giegold of Germany and Philippe Lamberts of Belgium, have both lamented the death of a bill put forward by the European Commission , the EU's executive arm, known as the "bank structural reform" proposal. The legislation was aimed at to breaking apart the bloc's largest banks.

"The atmosphere is, basically, the system is fixed," said Mr. Lamberts, who spearheaded a successful campaign to limit banker bonuses. "We see that the bank structural reform bill has been killed it has been kept artificially alive, but it is done."

The debate about whether or not postcrisis overhauls in the financial sector have safeguarded Europe from another too-big-to-fail scenario has been at the forefront of discussions as the EU continues to implement legislation written in the wake of 2008.

"The recent postcrisis regulation failed to address the main sources of instability in the financial sector," said the 30 year-old Mr. Zanni. "As a result, the system today appears more fragile than ever and exposed to problems related to systemic risks, high leverage, too-big-to-fail and interconnectedness."

Italians to Stress Test EU Financial Regulators With Referendum

By Todd Buell

FRANKFURT Italy's constitutional referendum Sunday looms as a potential stress-test for Europe's new financial-regulation regime.

Following the U.S. market turmoil of 2008 and the ensuing euro crisis, European Union officials expanded oversight of the bloc's finance sector. The alphabet soup of agencies has spent the past several years staffing up, implementing regulations and grilling banks, insurance companies and other industry players on their liquidity and capital health.

The goal has been to prevent financial institutions from collapsing and ensuring taxpayers don't have to foot the bill to save private financiers. Now Italian voters could show if it all works as planned, in the event any post-vote market turmoil shakes the nation's vulnerable banks.

Italy's vote on Sunday will decide on a constitutional change designed to facilitate reforms and limit the power of the Senate. Recent surveys favor the "no" camp. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said he would quit if the referendum loses, which could lead to political instability. Mr. Renzi's resignation could lead to a caretaker government that would ferry the country to elections as soon as next year. Such a prospect is spooking investors, given the recent surge in Italy's large antiestablishment 5 Star Movement.

Analysts warn that a "no" vote could bring political and financial instability, as market uncertainty and risk-averse investors could make funding conditions tougher for the country's ailing lenders.

That could trigger a showdown between Rome and EU officials over how to apply new rules and result in losses for small Italian investors. Financial pain for ordinary Italians could turn them further against mainstream politicians.

Italian banks have tested the patience of markets and regulators all year with their struggle to recapitalize. Now, a "no" vote would be a real shock to the system, say some economists. It wasn't supposed to play out like this.

The European Central Bank in 2014 became supervisor of the 19-country eurozone's largest banks, with the aim of harmonizing standards. The next year the eurozone imposed a unified system for winding down failing banks, the Single Resolution Board . This year, Europe started implementing new rules on bank rescues, known as the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive.

The new institutions follow the opening in 2011 of the European Banking Authority , which sets rules for banks across the whole 28-country EU. The EU also in 2011 established a market regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority , and an insurance regulator, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority .

Europe's new system was designed to make banks less reliant on governments if they get in trouble and force market discipline into decision-making. The new regime is working so far, "but it has not been violated openly," said Jan Pieter Krahnen, a finance professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt. "I think of Italy as the first country facing this issue."

A "no" vote entails "significant risk that depositors start to pull their money out" of banks, said Jack Allen, an economist at Capital Economics.

No bank faces more risk than Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , the world's oldest bank and Italy's third-largest. The only bank to effectively fail European stress tests last summer, it needs to raise 5 billion euros (about $5.3 billion) in new capital by year-end. Political and market instability would significantly complicate the task.

New EU rules would let Rome help the bank only if investors also take a hit, for example by converting subordinate bonds issued by Monte dei Paschi for a lower value of its battered shares to fill the  ¬5 billion hole in its balance sheet. Italian mom-and-pop investors hold  ¬2 billion in such bonds.

Forcing losses on voters is "not going to be very popular," said Mr. Allen.

Italian efforts to protect those small investors by circumventing new EU rules risk sparking a clash between Rome and Brussels. EU officials could then face a choice between enforcing their get-tough standards and worsening an Italian political crisis.

Mr. Allen predicted EU officials would reach a compromise rather than aggravate the situation following a "no" vote.

Other observers said markets might not react extremely if the referendum fails.

"There's an exaggeration of the disruptive nature of the  no' vote," said Nicolas Vron, of Brussels think tank Bruegel .

Even a "yes" vote wouldn't solve the problems in Italy's crowded banking sector. The country has "more bank branches than restaurants," said investor Alberto Gallo, manager of the Algebris Macro Credit Fund. Intense competition among Italian banks has hurt profits that were already weakened by years of recession and weak economic growth.

Analysts said that whatever the outcome of Sunday's vote, Italy will continue to present challenges for EU financial regulators.

House Passes Bill to Change Criteria for Labeling Banks as SIFIs

By Rachel Witkowski

House lawmakers approved a bill Thursday that would change the way federal regulators designate banks as being systemically important and thus subject to tougher oversight.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R., Mo.), passed 254-161. It would scrap the current threshold institutions with $50 billion or more in assets and instead let regulators determine whether a firm should be designated as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, based on the firm's riskiness and other factors, including its size.

Republicans have argued, among other things, that some regional banks are being unfairly categorized as SIFIs and therefore, come under stricter regulatory standards just like the nation's largest banks.

The legislation irked Democrats, who argued on the House floor Thursday that the bill would unwind some of the restrictions in the Dodd-Frank Act that were meant to keep banks from triggering a repetition of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailouts.

"We enacted Dodd-Frank...in response to the stunning greed and regulatory failures of our financial system, and yet, with this bill, the Republicans are displaying a staggering degree of historical amnesia," said Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee . "This bill is the epitome of that dangerous agenda...gutting our banking regulations' oversight."

The bill isn't expected to move forward in the Senate this year, and if it did, President Barack Obama has threatened to veto it. But the heated debate on the House floor foreshadows the fight that is likely to shape up into a battle next year as President-elect Donald Trump enters the White House and Republicans take control of the Senate, giving them leadership of both houses of Congress. Mr. Trump has said he would like to scale back, if not scrap, the Dodd-Frank law.

There is some bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to change the SIFI threshold, though many Democrats disagree with details in the House bill.

On Thursday, 20 Democrats joined 234 Republicans to pass the measure.

"It is clear that this is just the first act in a long, dangerous play that will continue well into next year" under Mr. Trump, Ms. Waters said on the House floor before the vote. "This is the first act in Trump's promise that he's going to deregulate, his promise that he's going to get rid of Dodd-Frank."

The House Financial Services Committee chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), responded by saying, "If the ranking member believes this is the first act in getting rid of Dodd-Frank, she ain't seen nothing yet."

Although the debate was heated, some Democrats in both the House and Senate have said they support the idea of changing the SIFI threshold because they see the $50 billion in assets as an arbitrary number that doesn't fully account for risk. Most Democrats, however, staunchly oppose parts of the House bill, including a provision that would leave the designation of SIFIs solely up to the Financial Stability Oversight Council , a group of top regulators led by the Treasury secretary.

Mr. Trump's choice of Mr. Mnuchin for Treasury secretary gives many Democrats further pause since he serves on the board of CIT Group, a SIFI-designated bank, and would be chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. If the House bill is enacted, the council would then have to re-examine the SIFI labels on dozens of banks.

"Mr. Mnuchin's bank is just one of 27 banks that stand to directly benefit from this legislation," Ms. Waters said. "Even if a potential Treasury Secretary Mnuchin decided to regulate his former employer, by the time he got around to it, the damage would have already been done."

China Escalates Efforts to Cool Down Financial System

By Shen Hong

SHANGHAI China's central bank has stepped up efforts to drain cash from the country's financial system in the past week, as it seeks to curb excessive borrowing and tame frothy markets.

The cost for banks to borrow from each other, measured by the so-called seven-day repo rate, rose to 3.49% this week a 19-month high from 2.92% on Monday. The surge followed the People's Bank of China 's withdrawal of a net 130 billion yuan ($18.85 billion) from China's money markets over the four trading days until Tuesday this week, which has been partially reversed.

At the same time, the PBOC has been guiding major state-owned banks to restrict their short-term lending to other financial institutions, according to market participants.

The scarcity of funds and sharp rise in borrowing costs has contributed to a selloff in China's domestic bond markets, which had thrived in recent months on an abundance of cheap funds available to investors. The yield on 10-year Chinese government bonds rose as high as 3.00% on Friday, its highest point since mid-June. Bond yields rise as their prices fall.

Analysts say the central bank could also be seeking to relieve the recent downward pressure on the yuan by raising domestic interest rates.

"It's all part of the government's broader deleveraging campaign that seeks to put China's high debt level under control. The message is clear: the days of easy money are over," said Suan Teck Kin, an economist at United Overseas Bank in Singapore.

Market participants say the PBOC's move to reduce the amount of cash in China's financial system was a surprise, in part, due to its timing.

"It was totally unexpected because we are talking about the month end, a period when banks need lots of cash to meet all kinds of capital requirements and so the PBOC would typically provide more funds to quench the thirst," a Shanghai-based head of money market trading at an Asian bank said.

The overnight repo, the most popular tool for speculators to access borrowed funds, has also surged to a 19-month-high of 2.60% from 2.36% on Monday.

Short-term loans, in the form of overnight and seven-day reverse repos, are typically used by financial institutions to meet their daily cash needs. However, in recent years, Chinese banks have channeled some of that money to investors, who have been able borrow it at cheap rates to plow into assets such as bonds.

The PBOC made a similar attempt in September to crack down on speculative investment behavior by artificially raising interbank interest rates via tighter supply of short-dated funds. However, the campaign lasted for just a few days, after signs of panic in markets forced the central bank to soothe investors with the resumption of large cash injections.

"They to want to manage expectations so that people will accept the new normal of more expensive funding costs but they don't want to let rates rise too fast either," said Mr. Suan.

PBOC officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The current tight funding conditions in China could last until the Lunar New Year in late January, analysts say, if the central bank takes no further action to inject more cash into the financial system.

"If the PBOC just relies on its routine money market operations to inject more liquidity, it will only solve the difficulty of funding access but not the problem of high funding costs," said Liu Dongliang, a senior analyst at China Merchants Bank .

Treasury Pick Steven Mnuchin Remained Tight With Goldman Circle

By Anupreeta Das

Steven Mnuchin left Goldman Sachs Group Inc . 15 years ago, but Donald Trump's Treasury pick was born into the Goldman orbit and remains there long after he quit.

Mr. Mnuchin joined Goldman in 1985, following in his father's footsteps. The elder Mr. Mnuchin, Robert, had started in 1957 and spent his entire Wall Street career at Goldman, where he was revered as one of the people who pioneered block trading, the buying and selling of a large number of shares at once. Steven's brother Alan also worked at Goldman and now runs his own fund.

While at Goldman, Mr. Mnuchin worked in the fixed income department where he oversaw trading in mortgages. municipal bonds and other securities. Having made partner in 1994, Mr. Mnuchin later grew more interested in technology and was the bank's chief information officer before leaving in 2002.

By then, he had made a fortune from Goldman's 1999 IPO. Bigger riches awaited him, including from deals that came about through personal relationships and connections Mr. Mnuchin made at the firm. After leaving Goldman, Mr. Mnuchin spent a year working for the hedge fund of his Yale University roommate Edward Lampert, who too had worked at the bank once.

In 2003, Mr. Mnuchin was hired to run a new credit fund set up by the billionaire George Soros. Mark Schwartz, a Goldman veteran who was chief executive of Soros Fund Management at the time, oversaw Mr. Mnuchin's hire as well as the spin-off, a year later, of the credit fund.

In 2004, Mr. Mnuchin thus became a co-founder, with former Goldman colleagues Daniel Neidich and Chip Seelig, of Dune Capital Management LP . With backing from Mr. Soros, the fund initially focused on real estate lending and properties. Mr. Neidich had run Goldman's real-estate focused Whitehall Funds.

Mr. Mnuchin had met Mr. Trump by then and were social acquaintances. In the mid-2000s, the two did business together when Dune Capital joined private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group in making a $130 million mezzanine loan to fund the construction of Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. Fortress co-founder Pete Briger happened to be a Goldman alum as well, having left the bank around the same time as Mr. Mnuchin.

In the mid-2000s, Messrs. Mnuchin and Seelig took Dune into the entertainment business, striking up a film-financing deal with Fox for over $500 million. Mr. Seelig struck out on his own in 2012, and Mr. Mnuchin has since found other partners for his film-financing activities.

Between 2008 and 2015, however, Mr. Mnuchin spent most of his time shepherding a turnaround at OneWest Bank . In the depths of the financial crisis, he had spotted a buying opportunity as lender IndyMac Bank failed and was taken over by regulators. There too, Mr. Mnuchin's old Goldman contacts came in handy.

IndyMac, based in Pasadena, Calif., collapsed in the summer of 2008 as customers grew concerned about its souring mortgages and withdrew deposits. Just months later, Mr. Mnuchin had corralled a group of seven investors, including several who had previously worked at Goldman, to buy IndyMac from the government for about $1.5 billion.

The group included funds run by some boldfaced Wall Street names including George Soros, Mr. Mnuchin's former employer; hedge-fund manager John Paulson; J. Christopher Flowers, a former Goldman mergers banker; and MSD Capital, the private investment firm of Michael Dell. In addition, Mr. Mnuchin brought in Silar Advisors LP, a fund run by former Goldman employee Robert Leeds and Stone Point Capital, another fund started by ex-Goldman executives.

In 2014, IndyMac, renamed OneWest, was sold to CIT Group Inc ., a larger bank that was run by John Thain, yet another former Goldman executive. Mr. Thain, the former CEO of Merrill Lynch & Co. was president of Goldman when Mr. Mnuchin was chief information officer. In fact, Goldman advised Mr. Mnuchin's side on the deal, which netted the sellers a more than $3 billion gain.

Soon after he became Mr. Trump's finance chair, Mr. Mnuchin negotiated a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee , easing the way for major Republican donors to give both to the party and to Mr. Trump. The committee's finance chairman, Lewis Eisenberg, is a Goldman veteran and contemporary of Mr. Mnuchin's father, who now runs an art gallery.

WSJ Pro: Sen. Brown Hopes Sen. Crapo Helps to Set Fannie and Freddie Free

By Rachel Witkowski

WASHINGTON Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said Thursday he is hopeful that major changes in housing could move forward under Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), the committee's incoming chairman.

"It will be a better day with Sen. Crapo," Mr. Brown said at a conference here for affordable housing lenders.

Taking a jab at the current committee chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), he added, "I say it's a better day because he actually realizes the name of our committee isn't  banking committee.'" The full name is the Senate Committee and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.

Mr. Brown said he's hopeful that under Mr. Crapo, who is seen as more amenable to bipartisan deals than is Mr. Shelby, a path could be cleared for an agreement on housing overhaul legislation that would take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out of conservatorship. Fannie and Freddie have been in conservatorship since 2008, when the housing market nose-dived and the federal government stepped in to rescue the two mortgage giants, which buy mortgage loans and package them into securities for sale to investors.

"We've not done one hearing on housing in the two years that Sen. Shelby's been chairman," Mr. Brown said. "Sen. Crapo is an honorable guy, way more conservative than I am. That's fine. The point is that he will work with us. I am optimistic that we can do things together."

The comments on housing legislation come a day after President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in an interview on Fox Business Network that the new administration would release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control "reasonably fast."

Mr. Brown said he is still not sure what steps Mr. Trump will take.

"Yesterday, the secretary-designee of the Treasury said some things about conservatorship, so I don't know if that's becoming a policy position or where they're going to go," Mr. Brown said. "I'm very open to figuring out how we do this."

WSJ Pro: Joe Biden to Make Last-Ditch Defense of Financial Regulations

By Gabriel T. Rubin

With the Obama administration's tougher financial regulations at risk of being rolled back by President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, Vice President Joe Biden plans to give a robust defense of those rules in a speech Monday.

Mr. Biden will appear with former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker at Georgetown University on Monday, where Mr. Biden will deliver remarks "on sound financial sector regulation," according to a university statement.

Mr. Biden's speech comes days after Mr. Trump announced his Treasury secretary nominee will be Steven Mnuchin , a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc . executive who has spoken critically of the Obama administration's signature financial regulation overhaul, the Dodd-Frank Act. The 2010 law was intended to strengthen the financial system in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, but many Republicans and some Democrats have said it went too far.

The White House didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

In an interview with CNBC after he was announced as Mr. Trump's Treasury nominee, Mr. Mnuchin said he wanted to "strip back" Dodd-Frank and criticized it for being "too complicated" and for having adverse effects on lending. Mr. Trump also sharply criticized the law on the campaign trail, though at times he also called for more financial regulation, like bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking.

He also criticized the Volcker rule, which restricts banks from making some kinds of speculative investments and was the brainchild of Mr. Volcker. "The No. 1 problem with the Volcker rule is it's way too complicated and people don't know how to interpret it," Mr. Mnuchin said. "So we're going to look at what do with it, as we are with all of Dodd-Frank."

Mr. Biden's speech comes as the Obama administration races to finish some of its outstanding financial regulations before the president's term expires next month. Republicans in Congress, however, have warned the administration against pushing through "midnight regulations," and many will likely be at risk once Mr. Trump has been inaugurated.

Top Bank Regulator Hints at Potential Fintech Charter

By Rachel Witkowski

WASHINGTON The comptroller of the currency gave some insight Thursday into his agency's consideration of whether to issue a groundbreaking federal charter for fintech firms.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , which regulates national banks, is publishing a paper on the issue on Friday.

Comptroller Thomas Curry said if the regulator decides to propose a new chartering system for fintech firms in Friday's paper, it could be in the form of a "limited-purpose" charter under which the agency can set "enforceable" conditions based on each firm's business model and risk.

"Let's assume, for argument's sake, you can charter a fintech firm under the limited-purpose authority. I think it's important to be clear about what we expect," Mr. Curry said in an interview after an affordable-housing conference.

"That's really what we're trying to do with &the paper that's released tomorrow," he added. "And then how we apply the principles in that paper to individual applications by firms with what we expect to be very unique business models."

The OCC has the authority to apply special conditions to both a traditional bank charter and a limited-purpose charter. Those conditions can include requirements that the firm's management structure or a change in business plan be approved by the regulator.

A major debate over the fintech charter involves whether the OCC will require nonbank fintech firms to meet the same community-investment standards as banks.

Under the Community Reinvestment Act, banks are graded based on their investments back into developing the communities they lend to. Consumer groups have strongly advocated that the OCC apply the same standards to nonbank fintech firms seeking a federal charter.

But some fintech firms that handle payment transfers, for example, rather than online lending, say the CRA isn't applicable to their business.

Mr. Curry, who was speaking more broadly about the CRA at Thursday's event, said that was an issue the agency has been working on within the paper coming Friday.

"Our own mission statement talks about financial inclusion and fair access. I think that goes part and parcel with the national bank charter," Mr. Curry said during the conference.

Mr. Curry plans to release the paper during a speech at Georgetown University Law School in Washington.

Pimco to Pay About $20 Million to Resolve SEC Investigation

By Justin Baer and Aruna Viswanatha

Pacific Investment Management Co . agreed to pay $20 million to resolve U.S. claims it misled investors and mismarked securities, ending a multiyear investigation into a fund formerly managed by Pimco co-founder Bill Gross.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday in an administrative order that Pimco wasn't clear with investors about the early success of its Pimco Total Return Active ETF, an exchange-traded fund for small investors.

Pimco created the ETF, which trades on an exchange like a stock, to mirror its flagship Total Return Fund. Mr. Gross ran Total Return and the ETF before he left in 2014.

The SEC's scrutiny of Pimco was part of a push by Wall Street's top cop to examine how money managers value certain assets. Its case against Pimco centered on the purchase of certain mortgage bonds at discounted prices during a four-month period following the ETF's February 2012 launch.

The SEC said Pimco valued the bonds using prices provided by a vendor that usually prices larger bonds and overvalued the portfolio. The fund attracted significant investor attention as it outperformed Pimco's flagship mutual fund in those four months, the SEC said, but the firm didn't tell investors that its performance was "not sustainable as the fund grew in size."

Pimco agreed to retain an "independent compliance consultant" in connection with the settlement, according to the SEC, but it neither admitted nor denied the findings. Pimco executives have said the firm ultimately sold those bonds at the higher prices, justifying their marks, and their actions were consistent with industry practice.

The agreement with the SEC included an $18 million penalty, disgorgement of $1.3 million in management fees Pimco received, and interest.

"Pimco is pleased to have resolved the &ETF matter with the SEC," a spokesman said in a statement. "The firm has enhanced its policies and procedures relating to valuation of smaller-sized positions and performance-attribution disclosure."

Pimco first acknowledged the investigation in 2014 and said in August 2015 that the SEC had sent it a Wells Notice indicating the regulator believed it had found securities-law violations. The SEC didn't issue a similar notice to Mr. Gross, who now works for Janus Capital Group Inc .

Mr. Gross, who wasn't named in the administrative order released Thursday, declined to comment on the SEC case. Mr. Gross's abrupt departure from the firm in 2014 accelerated client withdrawals from Pimco's Total Return Fund , yet it remains the world's largest actively managed bond fund.

Wells Fargo to Keep Commissions-Based Retirement Accounts Under Fiduciary Rule

By Michael Wursthorn

Wells Fargo & Co . will continue to allow retirement savers who work with its brokerage arm to pay commissions for trades, as Wall Street brokerages move ahead with plans to comply with new conflict-of-interest rules on retirement accounts despite uncertainty surrounding their fate.

The Labor Department's so-called fiduciary rule, which is set to take effect in April, aims to eliminate conflicts from retirement advice and requires brokers to act in the best interests of their clients. The rule's fate has become unclear as Republicans in Congress and the incoming Trump administration have made it clear that Obama-era regulations are under review for repeal or replacement.

The San Francisco bank said that while it is planning for a variety of different scenarios surrounding the fate of the rule, it is preparing as if the rule will be implemented in April as scheduled. "While there is a great deal of speculation in the media on how the election results will affect the DOL rule, none of us can say with certainty what will actually happen," Wells Fargo said in a memorandum, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, to its more than 15,000 brokers on Thursday.

Wells Fargo 's brokerage arm, Wells Fargo Advisors , which has more $1.5 trillion in total client assets, said it would allow its brokers to continue offering individual retirement accounts that charge investors per-transaction commissions, an approach toward compliance similar to some brokerages such as Morgan Stanley and Edward Jones.

However, Wells clients in those accounts after April will likely have a slimmer menu of investment products to choose from, people with knowledge of the matter said, although details weren't immediately available.

Firms still offering commission-based IRAs have had to drop some investment products from them to comply with some restrictions within the rule. Edward Jones, for example, won't allow retirement savers who pay a commission to buy mutual funds next year, while some alternative investments won't be immediately available in commission-based IRAs at Morgan Stanley .

The approach to allow commission offerings differs from rivals Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., among others. Merrill and J.P. Morgan said in recent months that they would ditch the industry's traditional commission-based sales model for retirement accounts and will effectively offer only IRAs that charge a fee based on a percentage of assets starting next year.

The retirement rules which researcher Morningstar Inc. predicts will affect about $3 trillion of commission-based retirement assets in the U.S. bring a host of changes, including how investors pay for retirement advice, the elimination of compensation incentives for brokers and higher investment minimums.

But since Republicans took the White House and retained control of Congress, firms now face the dizzying possibility of an outright dismantling of the rule.

Congressional Republicans opposing the rule have seized on Donald Trump's surprise presidential win as a chance to stop the regulations ahead of their implementation. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee , and Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.), who has been one of the most vocal opponents of the rule, have both said their party will renew the fight to halt it next year.

Republicans challenging the rule have said it would cut small retirement savers off from affordable financial advice. A recent survey by analytics firm CoreData Research of 552 financial advisers in the U.S. found that 71% plan to no longer service some smaller investors because of the rule.

Wells Fargo and other brokerages are moving ahead with implementation despite the uncertainty. But even if the rule is shelved, certain aspects of it, such as heightened oversight of retirement accounts, will continue to move forward at Wells Fargo , people familiar with the matter said.

For investors, the rule's halt may not be that apparent if firms choose to keep some of the changes they've already made or planned. Some companies will be able to implement the rule's higher standard of care without the costly compliance requirements, said Kent Mason, a partner at law firm Davis & Harman LLP who focuses on retirement.

"But people may have also lost the option of choice," Mr. Mason added, referring to some firms' decision to no longer offer commission-based IRAs. "The legacy of the rule may be less access [for small savers] and less choice."

Wells Fargo Formally Separates Chairman, CEO Roles

By Maria Armental

Wells Fargo & Co . has formally separated the roles of chairman and chief executive and will require its chairman to be independent as it tries to rebuild customers' trust, following a scandal over banking sales practices.

The bylaws revisions codify the changes put in place when chairman and CEO John Stumpf stepped down in October, as lead independent director Stephen Sanger succeeded Mr. Stumpf as chairman and president, and Operating Chief Timothy Sloan became CEO.

But some institutional shareholders called on the bank to take further steps to increase oversight and guarantee greater checks and balances.

"Like a house built on shifting sands, however, this good work will be for naught if we don't have a solid foundation and put a framework in place for the board that will prevent a repeat of Wells Fargo 's transgressions," said Connecticut State Treasurer Denise L. Nappier, who oversees the roughly $30 billion Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds.

So far, Citigroup Inc . is the only other large U.S. bank that keeps both roles separate, a change it made during the financial crisis. Bank of America Corp . split the roles under shareholder pressure during the crisis, but the board gave the chairman job to Chief Executive Brian Moynihan in 2014.

This week, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry called on regulators to consider requiring federally chartered banks to separate the roles, a move that would affect banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., which has successfully fended off several shareholders' proposals to split the positions.

San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has been under intense scrutiny over revelations that bank employees had opened as many as two million deposit and credit-card accounts without customers' consent or knowledge. In September, the bank agreed to pay a $185 million fine and submit to a consent order without admitting wrongdoing to settle civil claims brought by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Los Angeles City Attorney.

Under the changes approved by the bank's board this week, the board chairman will receive a $250,000 retainer a year and the independent vice chairman a $100,000 annual retainer.

FATF Praises U.S. Improvement in Combating Money Laundering

By Samuel Rubenfeld

The U.S. has made substantial improvements in its legal regime covering money laundering and terrorist financing over the past decade, but significant gaps still need to be addressed, according to a report from an international standards body.

The Financial Action Task Force , which assesses countries on their legal frameworks and issues standards on anti-money laundering and terrorism financing, said Thursday in its first evaluation of the U.S. since 2006 that the U.S. dollar's global dominance and its volume of transactions expose the U.S. to significant money laundering and terrorist financing risks, but that the government understands the risk and its legal regime is robust enough to handle the threat. However, the lack of "timely access" to corporate-ownership information and the lack of coverage of non-financial businesses remain issues to address, the FATF said.

"The U.S. has a very robust regime to tackle money laundering and terror financing," said Ashish Kumar, an FATF policy analyst, in an interview with Risk & Compliance Journal.

The U.S. anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime "has undergone significant progress" since the last assessment, conducted in 2006, the FATF report said. The FATF praised the U.S. approach of using inter-agency task-forces and coordination across bureaucracies as "particularly useful" for enhancing its work and helping authorities conduct effective investigations into money laundering and terrorism-financing cases.

Terrorism and its financing is the highest priority concern to U.S. officials, and the U.S. is "highly effective" at combating it, the report said, noting that it aggressively investigates, prosecutes and convicts individuals for terrorist financing. Moreover, the FATF report said, the U.S. has worked to keep terrorist funds out of its financial system by implementing and utilizing financial sanctions.

"The U.S. effectively approaches the threat of terrorism and its financing from both a global and domestic perspective," the report said, noting that the U.S. provided the FATF with multiple case examples.

On the money-laundering front, U.S. federal authorities achieve more than 1,200 convictions a year, many of which involve complex white-collar crime cases, the FATF report noted, saying authorities use criminal, civil and administrative tools to forfeit illicit assets.

"The U.S. authorities are very focused on  following the money,' both to develop leads which may initiate investigations, support ongoing investigations and prosecutions, and trace assets for confiscation," the report said.

However, the FATF report pointed to specific vulnerabilities in the U.S. regime, including minimal coverage under the regulatory and legal framework for investment advisers, lawyers, accountants, real-estate agents, and trust and company-service providers. In addition, the report said the U.S. fails to provide timely access to adequate, accurate and current information on the beneficial, or true, owners of companies, a potentially significant risk area.

Experts say lacking information on beneficial owners allows for the creation of "shell companies" that can be used for an array of financial crime, from hiding criminal assets, paying bribes or financing terrorism.

The FATF report called for the U.S. to introduce measures to require identification of the beneficial ownership of companies "as soon as possible," as well as bringing the non-financial businesses and professionals under the regulatory umbrella.

Senior U.S. Treasury Department officials talking to reporters about the report after seeing an embargoed copy said "our system is unmatched," while noting that there is still some work to do, specifically pointing to the beneficial-ownership question.

"We agree, and we have been working for some time" on the issue, an official said, noting that Treasury issued rules in May requiring banks to identify the beneficial owners of accounts starting in 2018.

The official noted that the FATF's findings, which resulted from a January on-site visit, came before the rules were issued, meaning that they will be addressed during the FATF follow-up process. She also said the Obama administration put forth legislation on beneficial owners, but Congress hasn't considered the bill.

"Without [the legislation], we will continue to lag behind on shell companies," the official said.

WSJ Pro: Credit-Default Swaps Still Pose a Threat, New Paper Says

By Adam Creighton

A sudden jump in credit spreads in the $6.4 trillion credit-default-swap market would cause the insolvency of at least one major financial institution, according to new research that questions the effectiveness of postcrisis overhaul efforts.

Since the financial crisis, regulators have focused on the safety of central counterparties, or CCPs, ignoring even greater risks lurking within the financial firms' balance sheets, according to new research by the Office of Financial Research published Thursday.

"The most important contributions to contagion under stress are not the CCP or its members, but certain firms that are peripheral to the network but are very large and have highly unbalanced CDS positions," the study found, referring to the more than 900 hedge funds, asset managers and insurance companies that trade in credit derivatives but aren't members of any CCP.

"Although the CCP is central according to various measures &it contributes significantly less to contagion than do several of its members and nonmember firms," it said.

Credit-default swaps were among the signature financial innovations that facilitated the financial crisis of 2008, allowing financial firms to bet on the failure of companies and reshuffle credit risks among financial firms to minimize capital levels, which amplified the impact of the collapse of the U.S. housing market.

The study examined the 2014 credit-default swap positions of the 26 participants of central counterparty clearinghouse ICE Clear Credit , which include all the biggest Wall Street banks. It found that many participants were "large net sellers of CDS," meaning they would be on the hook for variation margin payments in the event of a sizable credit shock.

The researchers used the Federal Reserve's "severely adverse" scenario from its 2015 bank stress tests which included sudden spikes in sovereign and corporate credit spreads finding groups of banks would need to pay out billions of dollars more than they would receive in such a scenario.

About 20% of CDS are now centrally cleared, according to the latest figures from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency . That share is expected to increase following a change in rules in September that penalizes CDS transactions that aren't centrally cleared.

The three authors of the OFR paper Mark Paddrik, Sriram Rajan and H. Peyton Young said their analysis was conservative because it ignored the far larger interlocking obligations of the interest-rate derivative market. "Firms may be subjected to simultaneous payment demands over multiple lines of business, increasing the stress on their resources," the study said.

WSJ Pro: Monetary Policy, Financial Stability Goals Can Be at Odds

By Donna Borak

WASHINGTON Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester on Thursday warned policy makers should remain vigilant of the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability goals, which at times may be at odds.

"Now most of the time these goals are complementary, but there may exist times when they are not at least in the short run," Ms. Mester said at a financial stability conference hosted by the Cleveland Fed and the Office of Financial Research. "Understanding how these goals relate to one another is an ongoing focus."

Policy makers are concerned that low short-term interest rates have spurred a reach for yield that could exacerbate financial stability risks. Fed officials are increasingly cognizant of the links between financial stability and monetary policy goals, an issue addressed during an April meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's interest-rate-setting body.

"Understanding the limitations of the tools we have for promoting financial stability and the appropriate timing of their application is still a work in progress," she said. "In a perfect world, we would use macroprudential tools to foster financial stability and monetary policy to foster price stability and maximum employment."

The central bank's ability to keep separate tracks is dependent on the effectiveness of macroprudential tools, such as higher capital requirements for the largest banks and a yearly stress-testing exercise, she said.

The Cleveland Fed president didn't address a coming decision by the central bank on whether to lift short-term rates. With the outcome of the presidential election settled and employment and inflation on the rise, most economists and market participants expect the Fed to raise its benchmark federal-funds rate later this month.

Singapore to Ban Former Goldman Banker in Connection With 1MDB Scandal

By Tom Wright and Jake Maxwell Watts

Singapore's probe into a multibillion-dollar financial scandal touched Goldman Sachs Group Inc . for the first time on Friday as its central bank said it was planning to ban the Wall Street firm's former top executive in Southeast Asia from operating in the city-state's financial system for 10 years.

The executive, Tim Leissner, was Goldman's point man on deals involving Malaysian state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd ., or 1MDB. The Monetary Authority of Singapore , the central bank, announced the proposed ban on Mr. Leissner after it found he had written a recommendation letter for a Malaysian financier, Jho Low, in June 2015. In it, Mr. Leissner claimed that Goldman had performed due diligence on Mr. Low.

"These statements were untrue and were made by Mr. Leissner without Goldman Sachs ' knowledge or consent," the MAS statement said.

Goldman Sachs said in a statement Friday that it had discovered the matter in January 2016 and reported it to Singapore authorities. Mr. Leissner left Goldman in February after Goldman put him on leave.

Attempts to reach Mr. Leissner, who is living in Los Angeles, weren't immediately successful. He has previously denied wrongdoing. A lawyer for Mr. Leissner on Friday said his client had not been aware of any planned regulatory action by Singapore against him. Mr. Leissner has now been invited by Singapore authorities to respond and looks forward to doing so, the lawyer added.

U.S. investigators claim Mr. Low was a mastermind of a massive alleged fraud at 1MDB that spread world-wide. Some investigators have described it as one of the world's largest-ever financial swindles.

Attempts to reach Mr. Low, who has denied wrongdoing, were unsuccessful. He's also being sought by authorities in Singapore, said a person with knowledge of the matter.

Goldman made around $600 million in fees in 2012 and 2013 selling a total of $6.5 billion in bonds for 1MDB, its largest payday anywhere in the world in those years. Much of the proceeds of the bonds were siphoned off immediately into offshore accounts and used to buy luxury real estate in the U.S., finance Hollywood movies and acquire other assets, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged in a lawsuit this summer.

The 1MDB fund and Goldman have denied wrongdoing. Malaysian authorities have also cleared 1MDB of wrongdoing.

The letter cited by the Singaporean announcement was written by Mr. Leissner to a Luxembourg bank to help Mr. Low open an account there, although he never did so, according to people familiar with the matter. The young Malaysian and his associates opened hundreds of accounts around the world, especially in Switzerland and Singapore, and used them to funnel money taken from 1MDB, according to investigations that are ongoing in the U.S., Singapore, Switzerland and elsewhere.

The use of Singapore's banking system to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars in allegedly stolen funds has embarrassed authorities here, who in the past few months have taken action to penalize banks involved in allegedly moving 1MDB money, including shuttering branches of two Swiss private banks.

Mr. Leissner, a German national who had been doing deals for Goldman in Malaysia since 2002, got to know Mr. Low a few years later, say people familiar with the matter. Mr. Low had been bringing Middle Eastern investment to Malaysia, and, in 2009, he persuaded the sultan of a Malaysian state to set up an oil-wealth fund, which Goldman was appointed to advise, according to those people. The state oil-wealth fund was soon taken over by Malaysia's federal government and named 1MDB. Mr. Low took no formal role at 1MDB but ran the fund behind the scenes, say people who worked there.

The fund was supposed to boost growth in Malaysia and its first deal was to invest $1 billion in an offshore oil venture. But $700 million was immediately stolen and sent into an account controlled by Mr. Low at Swiss bank Coutts & Co . in Zurich, the U.S. Justice Department suit alleges. From there the money flowed to numerous other accounts in Singapore and elsewhere, the first drips of at least $3.5 billion that the Justice Department claims was siphoned from 1MDB between 2009 and 2013.

Follow The Wall Street Journal's coverage of 1MDB

Some of the 1MDB money ended up in accounts owned by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and was used for political spending, according to the U.S. Justice Department and Malaysian investigation documents. The prime minister has denied wrongdoing. Malaysia's Attorney General has said the money Mr. Najib received was a gift from Saudi Arabia and most was returned. Mr. Najib has been cleared of any wrongdoing by Malaysian authorities.

On Friday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore also levied financial penalties of 5.2 million Singapore dollars ($3.65 million) on Standard Chartered Ltd. and 2.4 million Singapore dollars on Coutts for failures in their anti-money-laundering controls. The authority didn't mention 1MDB in relation to these fines, but both banks played a role in moving money taken from the Malaysian fund, according to the U.S. Justice Department lawsuit.

A request to Coutts for comment was referred to a spokesman at the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC., which owned Coutts during the period of alleged control failures and is winding down the remaining Coutts Singapore operations it still controls.

The RBS spokesman said the company regrets any failings and has sought to strengthen its policies. Standard Chartered said in a statement Friday it regrets that 1MDB-related transactions passed through the bank. It said it had reported the suspicious transactions, cooperated with authorities and had taken action to strengthen its controls.

In 2012, hundreds of millions of dollars in money originating with 1MDB was transferred to an account with Standard Chartered in Singapore controlled by an associate of Mr. Low, according to the U.S. Justice Department suit.

The money that ended up in Standard Chartered in Singapore came from billions in bonds that Goldman had sold for 1MDB in 2012 to finance the acquisition of power plants, the U.S. Justice Department said. The bonds were backed by an Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund on the suggestion of Mr. Low, said a person involved with the deal.

Earlier this year, Singapore also fined UBS Group AG 's local unit and the city-state's largest local bank DBS Bank Ltd . for money-laundering control failures related to 1MDB. UBS and DBS said they had voluntarily reported suspicious transactions and are committed to improving their own approaches to stopping money laundering.

SAC Capital to pay $135m to settle insider trading suit

SAC Capital will pay a group of investors $135m to resolve the last major outstanding charge related to insider trading, putting founder Steven Cohen one step closer to resuming business as usual.

 We are pleased to have resolved this matter and close the books on this chapter of SAC-era litigation,  said Mark Herr, a spokesman for Mr Cohen s family office, Point72 Asset Management.

The class-action lawsuit tied to Elan Corp "http://www.sac-elan.com/docs/Notice_of_Pendency.pdf" that SAC and Mr Cohen, along with money manager Mathew Martoma, traded on inside information related to a clinical trial of an Alzheimer s disease drug. The suit, filed in 2012, alleged that they generated more than $480m in profits and avoided losses from trading Elan securities and options. SAC and Mr Cohen denied the claims.

In December 2015, SAC paid $10m to investors in Wyeth in another class action.

SAC had caught the attention of US regulators after it ballooned from $25m in assets in 1992 to a $15bn enterprise, generating returns of 30 per cent a year. For a decade, regulators investigated allegations that its success was fuelled by an unfair advantage. In 2013, SAC pleaded guilty to insider trading, and paid $1.8bn in fines.

Mr Cohen was never charged with criminal wrongdoing. Instead, he was accused of the lesser allegation of failing to supervise Mr Martoma, who in 2014 was sentenced to nine years in prison.

Mr Cohen had faced the prospect of a lifetime ban from the industry, but the settlement only barred him from supervising funds that manage anyone else s money until 2018.

Earlier this year Mr Cohen registered a new vehicle called Stamford Harbor Capital with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will share the same management team as Point72.

That registration attracted the ire of Senator Elizabeth Warren. She wrote a strongly worded letter to the head of the SEC accusing it of making a  mockery  of its mission by approving Stamford Harbor Capital.

Meanwhile Point72 has worked to rebrand Mr Cohen s image. It has shifted incentives, shuffled management, and scrubbed up its culture to emphasise clean ethics. It has diversified its pursuits, adding units from venture capital to big data research, and started a  Point72 Academy  for fresh graduates and  Sophomore Summit  to recruit current college students.

Wells Fargo to Keep Commissions-Based Retirement Accounts Under Fiduciary Rule; Bank acknowledges political uncertainty around rule, but plots compliance

Wells Fargo & Co. will continue to allow retirement savers who work with its brokerage arm to pay commissions for trades, as Wall Street brokerages move ahead with plans to comply with new conflict-of-interest rules on retirement accounts despite uncertainty surrounding their fate.

The Labor Department's so-called "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fiduciary-rule-a-compliance-outline-1477409573", which is set to take effect in April, aims to eliminate conflicts from retirement advice and requires brokers to act in the best interests of their clients. The rule's fate has become unclear as Republicans in Congress and the incoming Trump administration have made it clear that Obama-era regulations are under review for repeal or replacement.

The San Francisco bank said that while it is planning for a variety of different scenarios surrounding the fate of the rule, it is preparing as if the rule will be implemented in April as scheduled. "While there is a great deal of speculation in the media on how the election results will affect the DOL rule, none of us can say with certainty what will actually happen," Wells Fargo said in a memorandum, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, to its more than 15,000 brokers on Thursday.

Wells Fargo's brokerage arm, Wells Fargo Advisors, which has more $1.5 trillion in total client assets, said it would allow its brokers to continue offering individual retirement accounts that charge investors per-transaction commissions, an approach toward compliance similar to some brokerages such as Morgan Stanley and Edward Jones.

However, Wells clients in those accounts after April will likely have a slimmer menu of investment products to choose from, people with knowledge of the matter said, although details weren't immediately available.

Firms still offering commission-based IRAs have had to drop some investment products from them to comply with some restrictions within the rule. Edward Jones, for example, won't allow retirement savers who pay a commission to buy mutual funds next year, while some alternative investments won't be immediately available in commission-based IRAs at Morgan Stanley.

The approach to allow commission offerings differs from rivals Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., among others. Merrill and J.P. Morgan said in recent months that they would ditch the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/merrill-lynch-to-end-commission-based-options-for-retirement-savers-1475784928" for retirement accounts and will effectively offer only IRAs that charge a fee based on a percentage of assets starting next year.

The retirement rules which researcher Morningstar Inc. predicts will affect about $3 trillion of commission-based retirement assets in the U.S. bring a host of changes, including how investors pay for retirement advice, the elimination of compensation incentives for brokers and higher investment minimums.

But since Republicans took the White House and retained control of Congress, firms now face the dizzying possibility of an outright dismantling of the rule.

Congressional Republicans opposing the rule have seized on Donald Trump's surprise presidential win as a chance to stop the regulations ahead of their implementation. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee, and Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.), who has been one of the most vocal opponents of the rule, have both said their party will renew the fight to halt it next year.

Republicans challenging the rule have said it would cut small retirement savers off from affordable financial advice. A recent survey by analytics firm CoreData Research of 552 financial advisers in the U.S. found that 71% plan to no longer service some smaller investors because of the rule.

Wells Fargo and other brokerages are moving ahead with implementation despite the uncertainty. But even if the rule is shelved, certain aspects of it, such as heightened oversight of retirement accounts, will continue to move forward at Wells Fargo, people familiar with the matter said.

For investors, the rule's halt may not be that apparent if firms choose to keep some of the changes they've already made or planned. Some companies will be able to implement the rule's higher standard of care without the costly compliance requirements, said Kent Mason, a partner at law firm Davis & Harman LLP who focuses on retirement.

"But people may have also lost the option of choice," Mr. Mason added, referring to some firms' decision to no longer offer commission-based IRAs. "The legacy of the rule may be less access [for small savers] and less choice."

Workplace training software startup WorkRamp has raised $1.8 million in seed funding.

The round was led by Susa Ventures, with participation from Initialized, Haystack Fund, Joe Montana's Liquid2 and angels including Elad Gil of Color Genomics and Adrian Aoun of Forward. The company went through Y Combinator this past summer.

WorkRamp provides interactive training software for employees that is designed to be much more advanced than the typical training videos that employees must watch on the job. This can be for onboarding new employees, or for training customer service teams, field operation engineers or programmers.

The software includes video but comes with interactive exercises for, say, sales people to practice leaving voice mails.

WorkRamp provides templates for companies that they can then customize. Customers include PayPal, Twilio, Square, Intercom and others.

WorkRamp's administrative tools give detailed information and analytics on how each employee is performing, then provides data on skills that need to be improved.

"The relationship between training development and performance is very closely linked," said Ted Blosser, co-founder and chief executive at WorkRamp and a former product manager at Box.

Cash Crunch Looms Over India's Growth Spurt; Impact of currency overhaul weighs on fastest-growing large economy

By Raymond Zhong

NEW DELHI India released economic data on Wednesday that confirmed its place as an outlier in a low-growth world, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised further steps to encourage investment and modernize bureaucracy.

But with his latest step, Mr. Modi has left India's star looking a lot dimmer, at least for the time being.

Three weeks after his government "http://www.wsj.com/articles/india-to-phase-out-current-500-and-1000-rupee-bank-notes-1478619693" to drill out ill-gotten wealth, companies big and small are reeling from the shock to cash sales, large numbers of the poor remain cut off from wages and the new rupee bills aren't reaching many corners of the country quickly enough.

While "http://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-economy-expanded-7-3-last-quarter-1480508608?tesla=y" for the July-through-September quarter, some economists have already cut their growth forecasts for the full fiscal year, which ends in March.

"Currency is like lubricant," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings. "Until the new currency replaces the old and circulation gets restored to the original levels, some loss of economic activity will definitely happen."

Mr. Modi has acknowledged that his move has brought "various new difficulties in our day-to-day lives," as he put it in a recent radio address. But he and other officials have said voiding big bills will ultimately benefit India's economic expansion by disciplining tax cheats and promoting digital payments.

The government's first estimate of annual growth will be released in January. "At this stage there is virtually no data" on which to base a prediction, said T.C.A. Anant, India's chief statistician, on Wednesday.

The cash transfusion is "an unprecedented thing, and it's never been done before on such a large scale," said Faraz Syed, an economist for Moody's Analytics. "In terms of quantifying it, I think it's very early stages."

Some economists have taken a stab at it, though. Their revised growth predictions vary widely, reflecting deep uncertainty about how Mr. Modi's experiment will play out.

If growth slows enough from the 7.6% clocked in the last financial year, India could lose the mantle of fastest-growing large economy. China is targeting growth of at least 6.5% this calendar year.

Analysts at Ambit Capital noted in a recent report that activity would only need to be squeezed by 10% or so between October and December for the quarter's real growth to end up negative. The Mumbai-based brokerage has slashed its growth estimate for the full financial year by nearly half, to 3.5%. India hasn't grown that slowly in more than two decades.

When Mr. Modi invalidated all 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee bills ($7.30 and $14.60) in early November, Indians were suddenly left to buy and transact with "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2016/11/18/barter-economy-is-reborn-in-villages-as-india-cancels-cash/". That crimped sales for everyone from roadside eateries and neighborhood five-and-dimes to auto makers and cosmetics companies.

The effects have rippled outward. Wholesale trade has cratered. Tens of thousands of truckers, short on cash for meals, repairs and other highway expenses, have sat idle.

Many laborers and construction workers have gone unpaid. The cash shortage has sent some of them back to the farming villages they left behind.

"I think Mr. Modi has done a good thing. But I'll tell you the truth: It's hurting the poor very much," said Santosh Kumar Kewat, who mixes cement at building sites in Noida, an industrial suburb of Delhi.

If work remains scarce and the pay unpredictable Mr. Kewat said a contractor shortchanged him this week, claiming to be low on small bills then he might hop a train back to his village, where neighbors grow peanuts, mung beans and wheat.

"At least I will be able to eat something," he said.

As many as one-third of the nation's roughly 40 million construction workers could end up making the same choice, said P.R. Swarup, director-general of the Delhi-based Construction Industry Development Council.

How soon the economy springs back depends on how quickly the government can replenish $200 billion in canceled currency in Indians' pocketbooks and cash registers.

Banks and ATMs had disbursed $37 billion in cash as of Nov. 27, largely in the form of newly created 2,000-rupee bills, which are too large for most everyday use. At what Credit Suisse estimates to have been the recent rate of production at India's four official presses, it could take months to print enough new 500-rupee notes to restore consumer spending.

With their earnings now under the taxman's scanner, wealthy Indians might shy away from big purchases for even longer. Rohit Poddar, managing director of Poddar Housing and Development Ltd. in Mumbai, said luxury-property prices could fall by up to 30% over the coming year, particularly in Delhi and northern India.

According to the World Bank's latest estimate, economic activity that is concealed from authorities to avoid taxes, skirt labor protections or dodge red tape made up nearly 21% of India's GDP in 2007. Assuming the share has held steady, that would make India's "shadow economy" bigger than the entire economies of Norway, South Africa or Thailand.

Tech Adviser Firms Agree to a Merger

Two technology startups that help commercial-real-estate owners and brokers manage their businesses are merging in a deal that will create one of the largest technology companies in the industry, valued at about $300 million.

VTS and Hightower Inc., both based in New York, are merging in an all-stock transaction, executives at both firms said. The deal was expected to be announced to employees Tuesday.

The merged firm, which will keep the name VTS and be led by VTS Chief Executive Nick Romito, will provide customer-management tools for owners of more than 5.5 billion square feet of commercial space in the U.S. and U.K.

Investors in VTS include Blackstone Group LP and Boston-based venture-capital firm OpenView. Among Hightower's major backers are Bessemer Venture Partners, Menlo Park, Calif., and Thrive Capital, a venture firm led by Joshua Kushner, whose brother, Jared Kushner, is married to Ivanka Trump, the president-elect's daughter.

VTS and Hightower executives declined to discuss the value of the two firms, which together employ about 275 people. People familiar with the matter said the merged company is worth about $300 million.

Mr. Romito compared the deal with last year's merger of Zillow and Trulia, two leading online firms in the residential-real-estate industry that competed against each other for a decade before joining forces.

"We just got to the decision a lot earlier," he said.

VTS and Hightower are both about three years old and have been fierce competitors as the commercial-real-estate industry has moved from spreadsheets and email to cloud computing and big data. Their main service is giving landlords and brokers a mobile-friendly dashboard that tracks tenants and prospective tenants from the time they first inquire about space to moving in.

The status quo would have meant continuing to build "duplicative features," said Brandon Weber, CEO of Hightower who will be chief product officer of the merged firm.

By joining forces, the two firms will be able to use their data troves to add analytic and forecasting services, executives said.

VTS plans to develop features -- both internally and through acquisitions -- that will track such things as rents and lease expirations in a particular neighborhood. Landlords will continue to keep certain data to themselves, like specific lease terms.

The real-estate industry increasingly is becoming more open-minded about sharing general information, said Adam Marcus, managing partner of OpenView. "Everyone is waking up and realizing it's better for everybody to have access to all the data," he said.

Executives at the two firms said the deal doesn't raise antitrust issues because there are a wide range of competitors, including such tech giants as Salesforce.com.

They also pointed out that most landlords -- especially smaller ones -- don't use either service.

IT Outsource Firms Retool

Elliott Management Corp.'s call to boost profitability at Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. highlights the shifting ground for many IT outsourcing firms as more companies move to the cloud, CIOs and industry analysts say.

Part of the broader issue is that spending is flattening in traditional IT departments while increasing across marketing, human resources and business units -- a trend that favors cloud-service providers over traditional IT outsourcing and services firms, according to Ted Ross, CIO of the City of Los Angeles.

That is prompting rapid changes in the IT outsourcing industry.

"The old style of outsourcing -- known as 'your mess for less' -- is definitively out of fashion at this point and enterprises will vote with their dollars for IT-service providers that reduce either complexity and time to achieve the desired outcome," 451 Research analyst Carl Brooks said.

Where IT outsourcing firms used to rely on low-cost labor overseas as a value proposition, Cognizant and others have begun focusing on digital automation by investing in artificial-intelligence technology to speed business processes and lower labor costs.

Just as cloud providers have shown that those with the highest levels of automation and better customer service are the ones bringing in new spending, Cognizant can increase its appeal and perhaps its profitability with a focus on "service delivery that can be automated to drive higher margins and remove manual processes for its customers," Mr. Brooks said.

Other large IT-outsourcing firms are facing similar headwinds. At Fujitsu Ltd., total revenue from its Technology Solutions division was roughly unchanged last year, at $29 billion. But revenue from an IT services sub-segment declined, in part on weakness in the U.S. market, the Tokyo-based company reported in April.

Fujitsu's chief technology officer, Joseph Reger, said the company is seeking ways to help enterprise customers get the most out of cloud, Internet of Things, data analytics, artificial intelligence and other technologies that are driving digital transformation.

Spending behaviors are changing as companies look to free up investment for digital transformation, Mr. Reger said.

"Fujitsu has altered its global corporate strategy and investment streams to realign to this dynamic," he said.

Online lending platforms yet to prove their worth; Financial services: Volumes decline

Industry takes pounding in US after years of rapid growth as sizeable losses spook investors

A new breed of online platforms was supposed to upend the banking industry by connecting creditworthy borrowers with investors hungry for yield.

It has not quite turned out like that. After years of rapid growth, the industry in the US has gone into reverse, as concerns over the quality of the assets pumped out by the likes of Lending Club, Prosper and Avant have spread a chill across the sector.

Losses have generally been greater than forecast, raising questions about the quality of underwriting and prompting many investors, both individual and institutional, to put buying programmes on hold.

New figures from Orchard, a technology and data provider based in New York, show that volumes across US consumer-loan platforms slipped for a third successive quarter between July and September, dropping 21 per cent to $1.86bn. That was less than half the peak in the fourth quarter last year.

Some think a big rebound is unlikely. Platforms such as Lending Club did well to grow quickly "but didn't come up with new schemes to underwrite and to judge creditworthiness", says Rick Yang, a fintech specialist at NEA, a venture fund in Menlo Park, California.

He says he has always steered clear of the online lenders. "The value creation was [in] gaining scale, rather than any kind of innovation."

Executives say they have tightened things. At Lending Club, for example, management has raised rates for borrowers several times this year to account for higher delinquencies and losses. It has improved its "skiptracing" processes, using e-mail and social media information to keep closer tabs on delinquent borrowers.

Meanwhile, it has bent over backwards to keep its big buyers happy in the wake of a governance scandal in May. Philip Bartow , portfolio manager of online lending strategies at RiverNorth Capital Management, which runs one of the big three US mutual funds dedicated to the sector, says he carried out "multiple days of on-site due diligence" at the San Francisco-based company.

Prosper, for its part, has raised the average credit score of its borrowers by 10 points since the turn of the year - a reflection, it says, of its "continued increase in loss-conservatism". It also removed its chief executive this month, replacing him with the former finance chief.

Both companies have become founder members of the Online Lending Network, a system designed to catch people signing up for multiple loans within a short space of time using old credit information - a phenomenon known as "stacking".

"There are two parts to growth: getting people to show up at the door, and deciding who to open the door for," says Patrick Reemts, vice-president of credit risk solutions at ID Analytics in San Diego, which supplies software to the network. "We want to prevent the bad people getting in."

Through measures such as these, Lending Club says it has lured back almost all the banks and hedge funds that were active earlier in the year.

But buyers, rather than sellers, still have the whip hand, says Matt Burton , chief executive of Orchard. He notes that platforms have been offering discounts for volume, and sometimes sweetening deals with warrants and preferential servicing fees.

"This time last year, there were 30 institutional investors lined up around Lending Club waiting to get in," says Mr Burton. "Now it's a much more difficult process; the bars investors are setting are much, much higher."

He says this year's credit glitches are a consequence of a headlong dash for growth in the latter half of last year, when platforms relaxed standards while lengthening loan terms. Executives are now chastened and running better businesses.

"Everyone you talk to feels good, like the worst is behind us," he says. "But until we start seeing it in the numbers you won't know that it's done."

Some investors may feel burnt by the year's performance, however. One, Nate Chenenko, says he is not hanging around to find out.

He opened a Lending Club account in January and within weeks regretted it. Two of the five-year loans he had invested in were charged off almost instantly, without a single interest payment. By the summer another couple had gone awry.

The 30-year-old consultant from Rochester, New York, was not invested in the riskiest loans, ranked F, G and H on the company's seven-point scale. His were ranked D and E, and he had picked out loans where the borrower had declared a debt-to-income ratio of less than 10 per cent.

Now he says he won't be buying any more loans and will reinvest his interest income elsewhere.

"The early indications are startling enough to me, enough outside my comfort zone, that I'm pulling out completely," he says.

Real Estate Tech Companies VTS and Hightower to Merge in $300 Million Deal; The firm plans to develop features that will track rents and lease expirations in a particular neighborhood

The deal comes at a time when valuations of startup firms have come under pressure. In the third quarter of 2015, the height of the most-recent tech boom, new financing rounds put higher valuations on startups 86% of the time and lower valuations 4% of the time, according to the Silicon Valley Venture Capital Survey published by law firm Fenwick & West LLP.

In the third quarter of this year, those figures had fallen to 71% and 14% respectively, the survey found.

"That's indicative of things slowing down," said Barry Kramer, a Fenwick & West partner.

VTS was named View The Space when it launched its service in 2013. Back then, it primarily provided prospective tenants virtual tours of commercial spaces and analytics. The firm changed its name to VTS as it morphed more into a service for owners and brokers for tracking tenants as they moved through the leasing pipeline.

VTS's investors also include Insight Venture Partners, of New York, and Trinity Ventures, of Menlo Park, Ca. RRE Ventures, of New York, is also a major investor in Hightower.

Cognizant Expands Into Digital Services

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. was founded in 1994 as the India-based technology unit of Dun & Bradstreet and spun off in a public offering in 1998. Since then, it has grown into a Fortune 500 company that provides information-technology services from labor outsourcing and systems integration to application development and consulting.

The company, with a market cap of $34.6 billion, is based in Teaneck, N.J., but most of its employees are in India.

Activist investor Elliott Management Corp. said Monday it held a 4% stake in Cognizant worth $1.4 billion and called for the company to increase profitability rather than focusing on revenue growth.

IT-services firms like Cognizant have struggled with a broader industry trend of companies looking beyond cheap labor and instead prioritizing technology-driven business models that can generate new revenue.

The shift has prompted outsourcing firms to focus less on traditional IT services and create new digital offerings that flow from cloud computing, data analytics and automation.

Cognizant has emphasized its own shift to digital services in recent years, and has invested in artificial intelligence technologies that help automate business processes. The firm has made astring of acquisitions in recent months aimed at boosting its digital services portfolio, such as Norwegian IT services firm Frontica Business Solutions. Cognizant also has worked on several projects focused on helping companies generate revenue. It said in October it would help Key Corp. subsidiary KeyBank deploy a digital banking platform.

Traditional lines of business grew by less than 1% over the past 12 months at the 20 largest publicly traded IT services providers, including Cognizant, according to research from Everest Group and DeepDive Equity Research. Cloud and digital-services revenue at those companies grew 22% during the same period.

Starburst Venture will be located in San Francisco, with its fund registered in Singapore. Francois Chopard, founder of Starburst, will be one of the general partners, along with another general partner and an expected staff of 15 people, Mr. Chopard said. The fund expects to start investing in the first quarter of 2017.

"We're just at the beginning of a new trend," Mr. Chopard said. "Aerospace is in a phase of maturity like biotech was 15 years ago."

Leonie Hill Capital, a Singapore-based private-equity firm, is the anchor investor in Starburst Venture, said Mr. Chopard, who declined the disclose the amount invested. Leonie Hill has invested as a fund of funds in other firms such as 500 Startups, Mr. Chopard said.

Starburst Venture will invest in Series A and B deals in anything space or aviation related as well as supporting technologies such as artificial intelligence or big data. Starburst will invest in companies not just in its accelerator but any in the sector.

Starburst is seeking additional limited partners mainly in high net worth family funds and sovereign-wealth funds, as well as potentially some of its existing corporate partners.

The fund will be fully allocated by year-end, but will stay open until early next year to give some investors an opportunity to use money they have earmarked for 2017, the person said. The midmarket firm will invest the capital in northern European businesses in the technology, media, communications, services and industrials sectors. HgCapital also is preparing to raise its next Mercury fund, which will make smaller investments in the telecommunications, media and technology sector. At 500 million, the fund will be larger than the previous Mercury fund, which closed on 380 million in 2013.

Permira, London

Permira is set to hit the hard cap on its latest fund, Permira VI LP, after less than 12 months in the market. The firm has stopped marketing its sixth fund after collecting  ¬7.25 billion ($7.87 billion) from investors, said people familiar with the matter. Permira didn't announce a close for the fund as of press time. The firm held a  ¬6.3 billion first close on the vehicle, which had a  ¬6.5 billion target, in July. Oregon Investment Council in June proposed to commit $250 million to the vehicle. Its predecessor amassed  ¬5.3 billion in 2014.

Tenzing Private Equity has begun discussions with investors to raise its maiden fund, said people familiar with the matter. The firm is aiming to raise 150 million ($186 million) for the vehicle, one person said. Investors have been invited to start to review the fund to consider whether they will invest, two people said. Tenzing aims to back high growth U.K.-based companies with enterprise values of 10 million to 50 million. The firm so far has invested from the fund in three companies: payroll software provider FMP Global, travel services company Fleetway Travel Ltd. and Media Business Insight Ltd.

Triton Partners, Frankfurt

Triton Partners has begun talks with existing investors about launching a lower midmarket fund that it will invest alongside a  ¬3.5 billion buyout fund that it raised in 2013, said people familiar with the matter. Triton is expected to raise  ¬300 million ($325.6 million) to  ¬500 million for the fund, one person said. The vehicle will invest in European companies with enterprise values of  ¬25 million to  ¬100 million. It will typically write equity tickets of  ¬20 million to  ¬40 million, one of the people said. Triton is setting up a new team, which will have a separate investment committee, led by Triton executive Andi Klein, who will be joined by colleague Per Frankling. The firm will make additional hires to bolster the team.

FUNDS OF FUNDS

European Commission, Brussels

The European Commission launched a venture-capital fund of funds with an anchor commitment of up to  ¬400 million ($441 million). The fund will invest in venture-capital funds across Europe and looks to draw at least  ¬1.2 billion in additional commitments from other sources. The program aims to attract large global investors, such as pension funds and insurers, into the market. The commission is willing to provide up to  ¬300 million of capital to a single venture fund. The European Union's investment will be capped at 25% of the vehicle's total investor commitments.

DISTRESSED/TURNAROUND

Valtegra, London

Valtegra is in talks with investors about raising up to 250 million ($305.9 million) for its second fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. The firm buys controlling stakes in companies with annual revenue of  ¬50 million ($54.4 million) to  ¬100 million that are facing operational challenges.

MEZZANINE & OTHER DEBT

AlbaCore Capital, London

AlbaCore Capital collected  ¬500 million ($552.3 million) from an affiliate of Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board for its debut private-credit fund. It is unclear how much AlbaCore plans to raise for its maiden vehicle, but the firm is expected to hold a second close in the first half of 2017, said a person familiar with the matter. The European debt fund will invest its capital across a range of debt strategies, including high-yield bonds, leveraged loans and direct lending.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Scottish Equity Partners, Glasgow

Scottish Equity Partners raised 260 million ($322 million) for its fifth fund to invest in technology companies, mainly in the U.K. and Ireland. SEP V closed above target, according to a statement from the firm. Investors in previous SEP funds accounted for almost 90% of commitments to the new vehicle. U.K. investors accounted for about 40% of commitments, with the remaining 60% contributed by investors based in Europe and the U.S. SEP V, which will follow a strategy similar to the firm's previous funds, will invest up to 20 million in growth-stage technology companies. Its previous fund reached a 200 million target in 2011.

Ysios Capital, Barcelona

Ysios Capital held a  ¬126.4 million ($147.4 million) final close on its second fund. The vehicle, Ysios BioFund II Innvierte FCR, exceeded its  ¬100 million target. Ysios said it now manages  ¬200 million across two funds. As with its predecessor, the fund will invest in biotechnology, medical-technology and diagnostics companies in Europe, with an emphasis on Spain. The firm intends to invest in 15 early-stage companies from the fund and so far has invested in five businesses. Investors in the vehicle include Spain's Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology; the European Investment Fund and the European Commission through InnovFin SME Venture Capital; pension funds such as Orza and Lagun Aro; Banc Sabadell; and private investors.

ASIA

BUYOUTS

Warburg Pincus, New York

Warburg Pincus is nearing a final close of its China fund, which has a $2 billion hard cap, said people familiar with the matter. The fund is expected to hold a first and final close by the end of the year, one person said, though the unexpected result of the U.S. election may hamper fundraising for North American managers. Warburg last year gathered $13.4 billion for its latest global flagship fund, Warburg Pincus Private Equity XII LP. One of the people said the firm's China fund would invest in tandem with its global fund, matching investments dollar for dollar. This strategy would give the firm about $4 billion of firepower to invest in China.

How a Stronger Dollar Made Three Big U.S. Banks Look Riskier

The strong dollar has some big U.S. banks looking a bit weak at least when it comes to one measure of risk.

The situation highlights the complexity of capital rules and shows how global and national bank rules can intersect in unexpected ways.

Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. all moved up in the rankings of global systemically important banks, the Financial Stability Board said last week. The banks won't see any immediate impact, but they could eventually face limits to their room for maneuver in terms of how much long-term debt they are required to hold.

The move, however, wasn't driven by fundamental changes in the banks' risk profiles. It was due to currency fluctuations.

In one sense, this shouldn't matter. While the Switzerland-based group of financial regulators and central bankers raised the level of additional capital buffers it would assign to the banks, those buffers aren't binding. That's because the U.S. banks are already subject to higher capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve. It calculates the capital buffer slightly differently than the Swiss body.

The board's figures do, though, affect U.S. banks through calculations of their minimum "total loss-absorbing capacity."

This relates to how much long-term unsecured debt banks have to hold to absorb losses that might eat through their equity buffers. The level of loss-absorption required under the Fed's rules depends, in part, on each bank's capital buffer as calculated under the Financial Stability Board's methodology.

And there's a catch, as Greg Baer, president of bank trade group the Clearing House, noted last week. Just how much of a capital surcharge the Financial Stability Board imposes on a bank depends on its so-called systemic indicator score. That is in part determined by the amount of each bank's share of the aggregate amount of assets held by the 75 largest global banks.

Under this, size and risk are relative. If, say, one big bank shrinks, that can make another appear larger as a part of the total, even if it that firm's balance sheet hasn't budged.

Currency moves also play a role. If the greenback is strong, banks with lots of dollar-denominated assets and liabilities see their shares of those global pools rise.

And the dollar's strength, along with contraction of the balance sheets of European banks, appears to be what drove Citigroup's ranking up by one notch. While Citigroup's balance sheet hasn't grown by much of late, the dollar appreciated 12% against the euro from December 2014 to December 2015, the period relevant for this year's systemic score.

Dollar strength also appears to have pushed up scores, and so capital requirements, at Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

The upshot? The three banks will likely need to meet higher total loss-absorbing capacity minimums. Citigroup had previously said its required ratio of equity and loss-absorbing debt would be 22.5% of risk-weighted assets. Now, it will likely have to meet a 23% ratio, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Last month, Citigroup told investors that it currently has a 23.4% ratio. So it won't have to do anything immediately. If Citigroup wanted to alter its funding mix in the future, though, it might be constrained in doing so.

And with the dollar again on the rise, it is possible big U.S. banks will face a similar challenge next year.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

How to Kill the Volcker Rule? Don't Enforce It

By Ryan Tracy and John Carney

Big banks spent years railing against the so-called Volcker rule, which bars them from making wagers with their own money. Now, with the imminent arrival of the Trump administration, some banks and lawyers are eyeing a new way to defang the rule: Simply stop enforcing it.

The rule, named for former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, was one of the most controversial pieces of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, passed in the wake of the financial crisis. The provision was intended to rein in reckless risk-taking by big banks, but critics complain that it is unduly burdensome to comply with and deprives them of a lucrative money-making opportunity.

The election of Donald Trump as president poses a threat to the rule, as his campaign promised to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law.

Getting rid of the Volcker rule would require an act of Congress. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Tex.) proposed to repeal the rule this year as part of a package of changes to Dodd-Frank. But repealing the rule could be difficult, likely encountering a roadblock in the Senate, where the support of some Democrats would be necessary to ensure passage.

But neutering the Volcker rule, which took effect in July 2015, would be comparatively easy.

While the rule is enshrined in the Dodd-Frank law, the provision instructed regulators to write the rule's fine print. That process required several years of negotiations among five independent regulatory agencies.

Even so, enforcing the rule remains subject to considerable interpretation. Financial firms are allowed to trade in stocks and bonds so long as their holdings do not exceed the "reasonably expected near-term demand" of their customers. But just how so-called RENT-D is calculated is subjective; there isn't one single formula.

That subjectivity has some industry officials optimistic that regulators appointed by the new Trump administration will change their agencies' interpretations of the rule or tell the officials charged with enforcing it to hold back.

"Once you have the heads of the executive agencies in place, at that point they can change enforcement priorities and guidance," said David Freeman, the head of the financial services practice at law firm Arnold & Porter. "A lot can be undone or rethought once you have fresh eyes looking at the issue."

Further complicating matters and empowering regulators to soften their approaches a hodgepodge of federal agencies are responsible for overseeing different trading desks within the same banks.

For example, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the Treasury Department, oversees trading within national banks. The Securities and Exchange Commission looks after broker-dealers. And the Commodity Futures Trading Commission monitors swaps dealers. A single bank holding company say, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. or Citigroup Inc. could have all three of those financial entities as subsidiaries.

Regulators have only begun to examine how banks are complying with the rule. Supporters and critics of the rule alike question whether, in practice, the agencies will agree about issues such as whether a particular trade violated the rule. The diffuse responsibility for enforcing the rule creates an opening for the Trump administration to hit the "pause" button.

"I would think that the administration might rein in the staff while they go in and kick the tires and decide what parts of Volcker need to be changed," said a person who has consulted with the Trump transition team.

A representative of the transition team didn't respond to a request for comment.

Even under the Obama administration, "we have our doubts about what's going on behind the scenes," said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of progressive groups that supports the rule and has pushed regulators to disclose more about how they enforce it. "If you appoint people who don't believe in the Volcker rule, it would be pretty easy for them to turn it into a kind of rubber stamp."

There is already evidence that the election result is affecting the debate around the Volcker rule. Some supporters of the rule in Washington, including within the Treasury Department, have questioned whether Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s recent $100 million-plus profit on a distressed debt trade complied with the trading ban, according to people familiar with the matter. Now there is little time before Mr. Trump's inauguration to probe the issue, and it is not clear whether Mr. Trump's Treasury Department appointees would make it a priority.

A Goldman spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. The bank previously said the firm is focused on meeting the needs of its clients.

Big banks' Washington trade groups initially lobbied against the rule, arguing in part that it would be difficult to enforce. J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon once quipped that in order to enforce the rule, regulators would need a lawyer and a psychiatrist assessing every trader's intent.

Banks have since given up trying to change the law and instead focused on trying to shape the rule's fine print. Earlier this year they successfully pushed regulators for extra time to divest certain investment funds.

It is possible, of course, that Mr. Trump will nominate regulators who favor the Volcker rule, such as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig. Mr. Trump himself has endorsed a modern version of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law, which is similar to the Volcker rule in that it is designed to keep traditional banks from engaging in risky trading.

Many big banks have also shed proprietary trading businesses since 2008, which could make it difficult for them to get back into the business. "Once it's gone into effect, it's hard to turn back the clock," said Oliver Ireland, partner at Morrison & Foerster LLP.

WSJ Pro: ECB Supervisor Says Disparate Insolvency Laws Hurt EU Banks

By Todd Buell

FRANKFURT The diversity of insolvency laws across Europe is hampering progress in cleaning up bad loans off the books of the continent's banks in a harmonized manner, one of the European Central Bank's top supervisors said Monday.

Speaking at a conference, Julie Dickson, a member of the ECB's Supervisory Board, compared treatment of non-performing loans in her home country, Canada, versus in Europe.

"In a country like Canada, where there is a single insolvency law and a single supervisor that has been enforcing global standards for a long time, one sees more homogeneity across banks in terms of NPL levels," she said.

In some European countries, however, "it can take years to collect a bad loan, while in others it takes much less time. The very fact that we are facing extremely diverse insolvency regimes means that we will not be able to make equally rapid progress in all Member States," she said.

Ms. Dickson also spoke out against differences in rules that govern who can serve in top positions at Europe's banks. In some countries, candidates must be approved before taking on their jobs, whereas in others they can begin before documents are presented to the supervisor, she explained.

"That does not constitute a level playing field for banks. We hope that politicians can commit to removing such unjustifiable differences, which would not only level the playing field, but also help to make European banking supervision more efficient," she said.

WSJ Pro: EU to Demand Clearinghouses Provide Plans on Avoiding Taxpayer Bailouts

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine

BRUSSELS The European Union proposed new rules on Monday that would force too-big-to-fail clearinghouses to draft detailed plans to avoid using taxpayer money at all costs, including options that place increased responsibility on banks and asset managers to foot the bill.

Central counterparties and clearinghouses, also known as CCPs, are platforms that stand between the buyers and sellers of financial instruments. They took on a more important role after the financial crisis, when regulators pushed derivatives trading through them to avoid a market collapse by ensuring that either party in a trade gets paid if the other side fails.

EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said the proposed legislation would further strengthen Europe's financial system. "That's important because central counterparties are a critical part our financial system, helping businesses manage their risks."

The share of global over-the-counter derivatives cleared through clearinghouses jumped from 12% in 2009 to 45% in 2015. According to the commission, CCP clearing is set to "increase substantially" in the coming years and will account for 70% of global derivatives traded.

The proposal comes as international regulators now completing the implementation of banking rules put in place after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 are turning toward future risks. Joint reports in August by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the world's biggest committee of markets regulators, and a Bank for International Settlements committee found that a number of clearinghouses still had shortcomings in their risk-management and recovery practices.

Under the proposed new rules, clearinghouses would have to draw up detailed plans outlining steps to be taken in the case of failure triggered by the default of a large bank or even a cyberattack. National authorities must approve each plan, and are also mandated to intervene before a CCP is likely to fail to avert a crisis.

"We must be prepared for the event however low the probability of a failure of a CCP and have the necessary rules in place," said European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen.

One option clearinghouses could use is known as a "cash call," which would require banks and asset managers that use clearinghouses to contribute funds in the case of default. Another is "tearing up" contracts, which would crystallize losses and gains. The use of state aid could be possible "should all other options be practically unavailable," the commission said in the proposal.

The plan, however, doesn't specify which tools must be used, leaving a certain amount of flexibility.

In light of Brexit, rules around how the commission treats so-called third countries countries located outside of the EU have received more attention. According to an EU official, rules written recently haven't changed or been amended to address the U.K.'s decision to leave the bloc. Under the proposal, recovery plans will be legally binding across jurisdictions.

Because of the international nature of CCPs, the commission rules establish so-called resolution colleges that would bring together national authorities alongside the European Securities and Markets Authorities and the European Banking Authority.

There are 17 CCPs in the European Union and nearly 500 trillion euros are currently held globally by such financial institutions.

The rules must be approved by the European Parliament and national governments before taking effect.

Donald Trump to Meet Monday With Potential Picks for Top Financial Policy Jobs

By Dave Michaels

President-elect Donald Trump will meet Monday with two men who could have a strong say in how his administration regulates Wall Street: John Allison, a former chief executive of BB&T Corp., and Paul Atkins, a former Republican member of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. Trump's transition team announced the meetings during a call with reporters on Friday. Both Mr. Allison and Mr. Atkins have kept their hands in financial policy matters since leaving their high-profile jobs. Mr. Allison wrote a book and became president and CEO of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, after retiring from Winston-Salem, N.C.-based BB&T. Mr. Atkins launched a regulatory consulting business, Patomak Global Partners LLC, and maintained strong links to leaders in the Republican Party.

It is unclear whether Messrs. Allison and Atkins are formally interviewing for roles in the Trump administration. Since winning the election, Mr. Trump has met with many people, some of whom were offered positions in his administration, including Education Secretary-nominee Betsy DeVos and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was selected to be the ambassador to the United Nations.

Mr. Atkins already has helped to oversee the Trump transition team's approach to financial regulation. He was appointed to teams that will meet with regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and gather information about pending policy matters that are important to the next administration.

Mr. Atkins has been linked to potential jobs such as chairman of the SEC or vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. The latter role encompasses regulation of the nation's largest bank holding companies.

Mr. Allison has written that he would "get rid of the Federal Reserve because the volatility in the economy is primarily caused by the Fed." He also advocated for raising bank capital standards but slashing many other "burdensome" regulations that came out of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

Investors Gun-Shy as China Pulls Trigger on Shenzhen Stock Link

By Anjie Zheng

HONG KONG With China set to give global investors greater access to shares listed in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, some remain wary of a stock market known for its rampant speculation.

A new trading link starting Dec. 5 will give international investors access to more than 800 stocks listed on the $3.3 trillion Shenzhen stock market via Hong Kong's stock exchange. The Shenzhen market, just across the border from the former British colony, is home to some of China's fastest-growing technology companies. It is also rife with speculative trading in small-cap stocks with little institutional research coverage.

The market is drawing interest from investors hunting for undiscovered gems, as some global stock indexes are hitting record highs. It is also forcing investors to do their homework on potential investments in different ways.

William Ma, chief investment officer at wealth manager Noah Holdings (Hong Kong), said fund managers should seek on-the-ground knowledge of a company before buying. "It's difficult to apply traditional metrics to something like tech firms, which have less business visibility. It's hard for management to make projections about earnings when the industry changes so fast," he said.

Fund managers have used creative methods to get such information, including visiting warehouses to see how much inventory has piled up and checking expiration dates on products in supermarkets to see how fast they are being sold, Mr. Ma said.

A few global investors already trade shares in Shenzhen through a quota system, but it is too cumbersome and expensive for many investors to access. As a result, foreign ownership of Shenzhen-listed shares is tiny, just 1.2% early this year, according to HSBC Holdings PLC.

Because foreign funds have had limited access to Shenzhen, few large global investment banks have provided research reports on companies trading there. The vacuum of institutional research, poor disclosure by some listed companies, and a flood of retail traders make Shenzhen one of the world's most volatile stock markets.

Shenzhen's benchmark stock index is down 7.7% this year, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is up 3.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 9.9% at a record high.

Trading in many of Shenzhen's small-cap stocks is driven by rumors or speculation. Retail traders call these "demon stocks," when shares mysteriously rise in the absence of news or any change in a company's fundamentals.

Chinese regulators hope the possible influx of foreign institutional investors from the new stock link with Hong Kong, called the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, will help damp volatility in the Shenzhen market and boost transparency.

Yet foreign investors may be wary of buying in now, as Shenzhen stocks are, on average, relatively expensive. Shenzhen's main index trades at 50.4 times expected earnings for next year, while the Nasdaq, to which it is often compared, trades at 28.18 times forward earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

As a result, stock pickers are looking at some of the bigger companies in Shenzhen, rather than to richly priced small caps. Many foreign investors and global investment banks suggest buying established companies with proven earnings and strong market positions, including top Chinese brewer Wuliangye Yibin Co. and video-surveillance-equipment maker Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co.

Still, it is difficult to sort promise from peril.

LeEco Holdings, a tech company that creates online content and sells smartphones and smart TVs, is one example. Acquisitive and attractive to investors, it has showed much promise. But it said recently that it faced a cash crunch after expanding too quickly. Its Shenzhen-listed subsidiary, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp., dropped nearly 5% on the news.

Sean Chen, director of strategy at Blackpeak, a firm that has done due-diligence research for those looking to get into the Shenzhen market, said investors often want a better understanding of how management plans to expand a business. They also ask about the background of management teams, their reputation and competency, style and track record, he said.

Anthony Ho, chief investment officer of Asia ex-Japan equities at asset manager Amundi, emphasizes the importance of channel checks or independent research on a company's business to verify the accuracy of company information. He said when earnings growth is taken into account, high valuations may be justified.

Dennis Lam, head of Hong Kong and China markets at PineBridge Investments, said, "In Shenzhen, it is even more important to know management. It takes many, many meetings."

He said the firm will also speak to a company's suppliers and factory line managers before investing.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends investors take a closer look at "new economy" companies trading below 30 times this year's expected earnings. Their list of names to buy in Shenzhen includes Han's Laser Technology Industry Group Co., a laser-machine manufacturer, and Sungrow Power Supply Co., a manufacturer of renewable-energy hardware.

Macquarie recommends Shenzhen Rapoo Technology Co., which boasts stable sales of its wireless-gaming software and is expanding into robotics and drones. Another favorite is GoerTek Inc., which sells a mix of digital consumer products and is expanding into virtual reality.

China Issuing  Strict Controls' on Overseas Investment

By Lingling Wei

BEIJING China plans to clamp tighter controls on Chinese companies seeking to invest overseas, intensifying efforts to slow a surge in capital fleeing offshore amid tepid growth and an uncertain economic outlook.

The State Council, China's cabinet, will soon announce new measures that subject many overseas deals to reviews of "strict control," according to people with direct knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Targeted for particular scrutiny by the pending measure are "extra-large" foreign acquisitions valued at $10 billion or more per deal, property investments by state-owned firms above $1 billion and investments of $1 billion or more by any Chinese company in an overseas entity unrelated to the investor's core business.

While the government has been plugging holes to keep more money at home in recent months, the new measures are the first to go after big deals by China Inc.

In doing so, the controls underscore Beijing concerns about capital flight and a weakening currency. They also come amid an overseas buying binge by Chinese companies. Total overseas direct investment rose more than 50% to $145.9 billion in the first nine months of this year from the same time a year earlier, according to official data.

Chinese companies have been moving to scoop up needed technology and management expertise much of it at Beijing's blessing. Headline-grabbing deals include petrochemical giant China National Chemical Corp.'s pending $43 billion acquisition of Swiss pesticide maker Syngenta AG, and a bevy of real estate, finance and other investments by Anbang Insurance Group Co., a recently obscure company that has emerged as global deal maker.

In all, Chinese buyers have announced $212.7 billion of overseas acquisitions in 2016, a year in which announced global deal volume has reached $3.28 trillion.

Concerns have grown among officials that the investment splurge may in some cases serve as a cover for getting around capital controls and sending money overseas. "Greater caution definitely is warranted when it comes to what kind of overseas direct investment is allowed and which ones aren't," said a senior government adviser in Beijing.

The State Council's information office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new measures. The new controls will apply to deals yet to receive approval from China's top economic planning agency, the people familiar with the matter say.

The new controls, once in place, are to remain in effect until the end of September and thus are intended as a temporary tool to stabilize outflows ahead of a major reshuffle of the top echelon of the ruling Communist Party late next year, the people familiar with the matter said. That's in keeping with other efforts by Beijing to try to keep the economy on an even keel before the leadership change.

China has been a magnet for foreign capital in recent decades, bolstering the economy. In the past couple of years, however, money has been flowing out as the long economic boom ebbs and the consumerism and services expected to drive new growth have yet to gather momentum.

A steady depreciation of the Chinese yuan, after years of overall strength, has ensued, and as businesses and individuals try to take more money out, the pressure for further weakening is piling on. In the past week the yuan has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in eight years.

The country's foreign-exchange reserves plunged $45.7 billion in October from September to $3.12 trillion. The Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based group of financial institutions world-wide, estimates that net outflows doubled to $207 billion in the third quarter from the previous three months. That figure is just shy of the estimated record $226 billion in outflows in the third quarter of last year.

Since then, authorities have sought to buttress the country's financial borders, mostly by curtailing options for individuals to invest overseas. Those measures included a suspension of a quota-based program intended to allow more Chinese to buy foreign stocks and bonds and a ban on purchasing most types of foreign insurance policies with domestically-issued credit cards.

Attention on outbound investments has broadened recently. Officials at China's foreign-exchange regulator warned in September that some companies as well as individuals may have fabricated deals as a way to circumvent capital controls and move money offshore.

Earlier this week, the central bank announced it will use a new risk-control system to monitor capital flows through Shanghai's much promoted free trade zone, which previously was hailed as a bold experiment to liberalize China's financial markets.

A five-page action plan released by the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China stresses efforts to ensure that currency inflows exceed outflows in the zone a backhanded suggestion that more money may be moving out of the zone than coming in.

The soon-to-be announced controls empower the Commerce Ministry and the top economic planning agency to take a closer look at larger deals, the people familiar with the matter said.

Under the current rules, companies trying to undertake many of the targeted transactions in foreign markets only need to register with the authorities and don't have to go through any lengthy approval process.

Aside from the major transactions, other deals covered by the pending rules are: overseas direct investments made by limited partnerships, investments in overseas-listed companies that are less than 10% of those firms' total equity, and Chinese capital trying to participate in the delisting of overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Mortgage Lenders Struggle to Adapt to Rapidly Rising Interest Rates

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

The rapid rise in interest rates since Election Day is taking a toll on the mortgage market, and lenders are scrambling to adjust.

Since Donald Trump's surprise victory, average rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage have leapt by more than half a point, to 4.18% on Wednesday. Rates still remain low by historical standards, but are now at their highest level since June 2015, according to MortgageNewsDaily.com.

The fast rise in rates has spurred homeowners to pull back from refinancing their mortgages. Applications dropped 3% in the week ended Nov. 18 from the prior one, the seventh consecutive weekly decline, and the second since Election Day, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The MBA estimates refinances will fall 46% next year, to $484 billion, which will hurt Americans' ability to free up cash by reducing the cost of their monthly mortgages. The fall in refinances also will hit an important area of consumer-loan growth for banks. To slow the possible damage, banks already are pitching riskier loans that come with adjustable interest rates or allow borrowers to pull more equity out of their homes.

"The increase in rate has shocked consumers &I didn't expect it either," said Dave Norris, chief revenue officer at LoanDepot, the 10th largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by loan volume.

The impact on home buying may be less clear-cut, but some buyers have rushed to lock in terms before rates rise further. In the week ended Nov. 18, applications for mortgages to purchase homes jumped 13% from a week earlier and were up 11% from a year ago, the MBA data showed.

Eventually, though, rising rates make houses less affordable, and that could lead to slowing sales, price growth and mortgage activity. Some analysts are now projecting home values will decline by the end of next year in many U.S. housing markets.

The MBA lowered its projections for next year's new mortgage loans by 3% last week, to $1.58 trillion. That would represent a 16% drop from the nearly $1.9 trillion in mortgages that lenders are on pace to originate this year, with refinancing accounting for all of the drop.

There is little reason to hope "the refi market will be large next year," said Greg Gwizdz, national sales manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co., the nation's largest mortgage lender by loan volume.

This month's rate increase has eliminated a large share of borrowers for whom refinancing would make financial sense. Before the election, 70% of all borrowers with a 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgage stood to incur at least a half a percentage point in savings by refinancing. Now only 35% of borrowers are eligible for such savings, said Walter Schmidt, who tracks mortgage-backed securities at FTN Financial.

In response, lenders are revising their strategies for drumming up mortgage demand.

LoanDepot's Mr. Norris said he has been overhearing more conversations about ARMs on the independent mortgage lender's sales floor. Should rates continue to rise, the company plans to ramp up advertising significantly early next year to grab more market share in refinancings, he said.

Wells Fargo said its loan officers began talking to borrowers during the last couple of weeks about the benefits of ARMs that have a low fixed-rate for the first few years before fluctuating with interest rates.

Buyers who plan to keep their home for around five years, for example, are being advised by Wells's loan officers to get ARMs with a seven-year fixed rate. The bank on Wednesday was charging 3.750% for this product versus 4.375% for its 30-year, fixed conforming mortgage.

Bank of America Corp. said some of its loan officers have been having more discussions about ARMs with borrowers who are applying for jumbo mortgages.

The bank also is increasing its marketing of home-equity lines of credit for the first quarter of 2017, in light of the rising rate environment. Home prices have risen substantially in several U.S. housing markets over the past two years, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices. That has allowed more borrowers to tap into that new equity to pay down credit-card debt or make home renovations.

"We're seeing some of the highest levels of cash-out [refis] &in the last six or seven years," said Jay Farner, president of Quicken Loans.

Interest rates have fluctuated wildly in recent years. As recently as July, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dropped to an all-time low of 1.36% after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. The drop had banks bracing for a new wave of refinance activity.

This time around, lenders and analysts say the size and speed of the mortgage-rate increase, combined with the new president's fiscal policies and signals from the Federal Reserve about another short-term rate increase, suggest the increase might not fade so quickly.

"This one feels different," says Pete Boomer, head of mortgage production at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. "This is going to be sustained."

Tensions Flare as Eurozone Bank Watchdog Tries to Bite

By Max Colchester, Patricia Kowsmann and Giovanni Legorano

This summer, Portugal's biggest bank received a letter from eurozone supervisors in Germany ordering it to send three top executives back to school.

The recently appointed executives at state-owned Caixa Geral de Depsitos SA were told to brush up on their finance knowledge and packed off to a course outside Paris entitled "Strategic management in banking," according to people familiar with the matter.

Two years after European authorities embarked on a radical overhaul to fix the continent's sickly banking system, a new watchdog is trying to bite. After a wave of bank bailouts, in 2014 the European Central Bank took charge of overseeing big lenders across 19 eurozone countries.

Danile Nouy, a French 66-year-old former bank regulator, was brought in to head the new European regulatory system, dubbed the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Whether she makes a success of this experiment in cross-border bank oversight will define the bloc's ability to shake off a banking crisis that has been slowly strangling the European economy for nearly a decade.

Over a thousand staff were hired by the ECB, and hundreds of supervisors fanned out across Europe to ensure rules are enforced evenly across the continent. But old problems persist.

Bank profits remain low and bad debt levels are high. Tensions have flared as the new watchdog looks to chop cozy ties between European banks and their local governments to force through painful restructuring.

In Italy mergers have been blocked, in Greece two bank chairmen with close political links were eased out, and in Portugal a failing bank was sold to a Spanish rival at a knockdown price sparking criticism from local officials.

The next few months could prove particularly challenging. The ECB is monitoring a deep restructuring at German lender Deutsche Bank AG and must oversee a teetering rescue plan at Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.

European authorities must stitch together the trading bloc's country-specific banking rules and build a eurozone-wide depositor protection system. "There is a huge amount of skepticism whether this going to work in the long term," said Scott Vincent, managing director of Parker Fitzgerald, a bank consultancy.

Ms. Nouy, who declined to comment, forged her career fixing a 1990s French banking crisis brought on by a series of mergers cheered on by ill-prepared board members. The experience marked her. Cleaning up crony boards has become a priority and she is reluctant to sign off on mergers between struggling lenders.

She has also batted away complaints from bankers that ultralow interest rates are squeezing profits, telling them to cut costs instead. "Banks need to rethink their business models in order to cope with the  new normal,'" she recently told a room full of German bankers.

The culture shock of the new Frankfurt-based supervisory regime is most felt at Europe's weak periphery banks. In Greece, for instance, bank executives are scrambling to meet new quarterly ECB targets to shed bad loans. The country's four biggest banks also had to ax dozens of nonexecutive directors to meet governance rules. Officials at one of Italy's largest banks recently grumbled because Ms. Nouy's team demanded they thicken their capital cushion before buying three smaller lenders.

When two small Italian banks, Banco Popolare SC and Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl wanted to merge in March, the ECB ordered them to cut their combined board from 47 directors to 19 and raise equity. "I realize it has a power and I would define it an arrogant power," Banco Popolare Chief Executive Pier Francesco Saviotti said at the time. "They rule and we'll do everything needed properly. I can't say that there is full collaboration."

Some local regulators have also chafed at the arrival of a new supervisor. After Portugal's Banco Internacional do Funchal SA collapsed last fall, a Portuguese central-bank official accused eurozone regulators of forcing a cut-price fire sale to Spain's Banco Santander SA in part because they didn't want to be stuck in Frankfurt over Christmas. "It's a custom among European institutions to have prolonged Christmas holidays," Antnio Varela, a former Bank of Portugal official, told a Portuguese parliamentary inquiry. An ECB spokesman declined to comment.

The supervisor "is seen as tougher than previous regulatory regimes," said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. "But it is still early days."

Cross-border European bank mergers have failed to materialize, in part because executives still deem them too risky. The ECB must also pass a key test: proving it can safely shut down a failed bank.

Some banks are resigned to take their medicine. After the executives at Caixa Geral de Depsitos were sent to study banking, Antnio Domingues, the bank's CEO, played down the issue. "Schooling is always positive," he said.

House Democrats Warn of Trump's Potential Conflicts Over Deutsche Bank

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON A group of top House Democrats are warning federal investigators that President-elect Donald Trump might give special favors to beleaguered Deutsche Bank AG, the only big Wall Street bank that lends to him.

The Democrats, led by Reps. Maxine Waters of California and Carolyn Maloney of New York, said in a letter this week to the internal watchdogs at federal financial agencies that Mr. Trump might seek to influence the German bank's settlement discussions with the Justice Department. The department sought $14 billion as its opening bid in talks with the bank to settle a set of high-profile mortgage-securities probes stemming from the financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

"Trump will have ample opportunity to make and influence policy decisions that benefit his personal business and financial interests," the lawmakers wrote in a letter dated Tuesday. "Deutsche has been the only major Wall Street bank to continue to lend to Donald Trump and his entities in the wake of six Trump-business bankruptcies."

The letter comes as Mr. Trump prepares to enter the White House with more potential conflicts of interest and less transparency about his finances than any recent president. Though Mr. Trump has said he would transfer control of his businesses to his children, he indicated Tuesday that he was unlikely to disentangle himself from his business empire as fully as he previously said.

Mr. Trump told the New York Times that "the law's totally on my side" and that "the president can't have a conflict of interest."

A spokesman for Mr. Trump didn't respond to requests for comment on the House Democrats' letter.

A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment. The bank in September confirmed the Justice Department has asked for $14 billion but said in a statement the bank has been invited to submit a counterproposal.

"The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts," the bank said at the time.

Deutsche Bank has been a steadfast financial backer of Mr. Trump's business interests. Since 1998, the bank has led or participated in loans of at least $2.5 billion to companies affiliated with the president-elect, according to a March analysis by The Wall Street Journal.

Other Wall Street banks, after doing extensive business with Mr. Trump in the 1980s and 1990s, pulled back in part due to frustration with his business practices but also because he moved away from real-estate projects that required financing, according to bank officials. Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are among the banks that don't currently work with him.

Ivanka Trump, who works with her father at the Trump Organization LLC, which holds the family's real-estate and other business interests, denied that Wall Street banks are wary of doing business with the family.

"The biggest banking institutions are constantly soliciting us," Ms. Trump said in an interview with the Journal earlier this year. "But we don't need a lot of financing because we have a great balance sheet and a tremendous amount of cash."

In Tuesday's letter, the House lawmakers asked the inspectors general of the Justice Department, Treasury Department and six other agencies to closely scrutinize Mr. Trump's personnel picks for the agencies.

"We ask you to take immediate and proactive steps to ensure that any new political appointees at your respective agencies are held to the highest possible ethical standards and that you commit to diligently and constantly monitoring the actions of such appointees and mitigating conflicts of interest when they inevitably arise," the lawmakers said.

How the  Fiduciary' Rule Could Live On

By Lisa Beilfuss

A landmark retirement-savings rule is widely expected to be watered down or repealed as Republicans look to roll back a series of Obama-era regulations. But the principles of the "fiduciary rule" could survive as the de facto industry standard, given the efforts financial firms have already made to adjust to it.

The rule, which holds brokers and others who give retirement advice to a fiduciary standard requiring they act in savers' best interests, was approved by the Labor Department this past spring and is due to take effect April 10. It stands to affect about $3 trillion of retirement assets in the U.S., according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

Following Donald Trump's presidential victory and Republicans retaining control over both houses of Congress, opponents of the rule have put it in their sights for repeal or replacement. They argue the rule will hurt retirement savers by limiting access to advice, among other things.

The Obama administration, in pressing for the rule amid the flood of regulations after the financial crisis, has said conflicted advice costs U.S. families $17 billion a year and pushes down annual returns on retirement savings by a percentage point.

Financial-industry leaders have said those figures are inflated and have fought against the regulation. Some brokerages, such as Merrill Lynch, have defended the rule's intent to hold brokers to a higher standard.

Some firms and brokers stand to benefit from this shift toward the fiduciary standard, which favors fee-based advice. Clients in fee-based accounts are charged a level fee based on a percentage of their assets, minimizing potential conflicts tied to specific investment products that can come with commission-based accounts. Brokerages like fee-based revenue because it tends to be more predictable and steady compared with commissions.

This past week, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee and is being considered to head the Treasury Department, said talks were being held with the president-elect about the fate of the fiduciary rule and other financial regulations. Before that, Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund investor, publicly called for the rule to be repealed.

Against this backdrop, Democrats and other proponents have limited options to beat back attempts to repeal or water down the rule.

Rep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.), a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he expects that an attempt by Republicans to halt or kill the rule through the legislative process would be met with a Senate filibuster, though he isn't confident the legislative-delay tactic would be successful. "I'm not optimistic, but I'm still determined," he said.

Mr. Sherman said proponents' best hope for the rule to survive may be in some sort of compromise. "I could see a much pared-down rule that at least limits the size of commissions," he said.

Another possibility is that the rule's implementation date, currently April 10, will be postponed. Michael Spellacy, head of global wealth management at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, said the Trump administration may seek to extend compliance deadlines and give "timeline relief" to the industry. He expects the rule will remain intact, calling "material constructive changes" to the rule unlikely.

Even if the rule is killed, some said compliance efforts that have already been under way and broader industry trends mean financial-advice givers will adhere to its requirements. Firms affected by the rule said speculation over the rule's fate hasn't altered changes they have already set in motion.

There are the "checks and balances of the rule-making process," said Rob Cirrotti, managing director at Pershing LLC, part of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. If the president or lawmakers don't abide by that process, a move to kill the rule opens up other challenges, he said, just as the current rule is being challenged in several court cases.

"The rule is final. So we are moving forward with the understanding that the rule is going into effect on April 10," said a spokesman for LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

Like LPL, many brokerages have been adapting their business models and updating internal controls to be compliant with the fiduciary rule by April, and some have spent money advertising their commitment to fiduciary responsibility. Merrill Lynch said last month that it would no longer give retirement savers the option of paying a commission for trades, a wholesale exit from the traditional Wall Street sales model, and has started an ad campaign highlighting the move.

Firms "have been making calls since September to clients," said Denise Valentine, senior analyst at consulting firm Aite Group LLC, informing them of changes on account of the rule and explaining that they are going to be adhering to a fiduciary standard if they aren't already. "You can't undo that sort of thing," she said.

Moreover, she said, there is an industry shift toward fee-based advice that predates the rule. The shift has been driven by customers' focus on fees an emphasis that has come amid lackluster market returns and it has underpinned a migration of advice-givers from broker-dealers to registered investment advisers, a type of adviser that is required to adhere to fiduciary standards.

WSJ Pro: Creighton's Analysis: The Fed's Portfolio Takes a Beating

By Adam Creighton

Bondholders were an unexpected casualty of Donald Trump's surprise election victory, and none more so than the Federal Reserve, which is sitting on at least a $115 billion paper loss almost triple its capital.

Central bank accounting rules mean the Fed doesn't have to update the market value of its assets as ordinary banks do, and losses ultimately matter less for institutions that can conjure up their own money.

But some Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump economic adviser David Malpass, want to see the Fed's giant balance sheet shrink. Any sales would crystallize losses and interrupt the Fed's hefty dividends to the Treasury, which have roughly tripled to around $90 billion a year since the financial crisis owing to highly profitable leveraged carry trade.

George Selgin, a monetary policy expert at the free-market Cato Institute, said the Fed doesn't want to sell down its portfolio because it doesn't want to book losses.

"The Fed isn't supposed to take risk, but they have broken that rule big time since the crisis. Now losses are happening at least in a mark-to-market sense the public are bearing them, and they are being swept under the rug," he said in an interview.

Fed economists put forward the conventional view: Sales might cause large losses and a few years of "zero" remittances to the Treasury, but fears would reflect an "irrational &misunderstanding of the mechanics of the economy."

The surge in the U.S. 10-year bond yield following Election Day, premised on expectations for fiscal stimulus-fueled increases in inflation and debt, has hit the market value of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, a legacy of three waves of quantitative easing.

Yields on 10-year U.S. government debt have increased by around 0.5 percentage point to almost 2.4% since Nov. 8, more than wiping out this year's downward drift.

Guggenheim Partners puts the Fed's loss since then at around $115 billion, or about 2.7% of the portfolio, from the day before the election to Friday. Jason Benowitz, at Roosevelt Investment Group, estimates the loss at $120 billion. "That's the largest two-week decline in the value of the Fed's balance sheet holdings ever," he said in an interview.

Prices move inversely to yields for fixed-income securities, which are more vulnerable to interest-rate changes the longer their repayment horizon and the smaller the coupon payment.

The Fed's $1.75 trillion pool of mortgage-backed securities has incurred more than half the paper losses. "The Fed has turned itself into one big bad bank as a result of swapping cash for doubtful assets. If it were an ordinary bank, it wouldn't pass the stress tests or the Basel rules and would be put into receivership," said Mr. Selgin.

Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in February 2011 congressional testimony said the Fed would only be "monetizing government debt" if it didn't reverse its purchases. The Fed's June 2011 "exit principles" undertook to "eliminate" MBS holdings within "three to five years" after an increase in the policy interest rate to minimize distortion to "the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy."

The Fed has been tiptoeing away from this, however. Since December last year, it has promised not to reduce its balance sheet until "normalization is well under way" and hold "no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively".

Goldman Sachs still expects the Fed to stop rolling over its securities from 2018, which would see the balance sheet shrink from 24% to 13% of gross domestic product by 2020. In light of the election, however, the risk of "smaller sooner" for the Fed's portfolio would seem to be eclipsing "larger for longer."

An Investment Bankers' Guide to Brexit

By Max Colchester

Brexit could prove a game changer for big investment banks based in London. With the start of negotiations to extract the U.K. from the European Union looming, banks are rushing to draw up contingency plans to ensure they can still do business across Europe.

Based on conversations with bankers, lawyers and consultants, here is a guide to post-Brexit investment banking.

What is at stake?

For years, international investment banks have chosen London for their European home in part because Britain's membership of the EU allows them to do business across the entire bloc. The main fear about Brexit is loss of access to the EU's single market for goods and services, otherwise known as "passporting."

What's that?

Passporting allows financial companies with subsidiaries in the EU to sell services or set up branches in each of the bloc's members with minimal regulatory hassle. Confusingly, there isn't one passport. Instead there are nine different European directives linked to passporting. Each one covers a different slice of financial activity, ranging from insurance to asset management and trading.

What are investment banks doing?

Most are working on a worst-case assumption that the U.K. financial system gets frozen out of the EU. This requires them to create an entity in the EU to deal with customers there. Lenders are going through their businesses line by line to work out which jobs have to be done where. Banks are also calculating profit margins on each product to see if it is worth continuing to provide it to EU clients. For cost reasons banks are looking at scaling up in European cities where they already have banking licenses and basic infrastructure.

So how could investment banks restructure?

The aim is to continue serving important European clients, while moving as few roles and as little capital as possible out of their existing U.K. operations. This won't be easy. Investment banks are broadly looking at four models:

The introductory model. Banks keep most of their traders and compliance teams in the U.K. Sales teams in the EU "introduce" clients to the U.K. entity. This is the dream model for banks as it wouldn't require a vast reshuffle of their activities or trapping a pool of capital in the EU. Lawyers say EU local regulators probably wouldn't sign off on this model because it doesn't give them enough oversight of the banks.

The European branch. In the 1990s, before the creation of the European common currency, banks had a series of licenses with different European countries. These could be re-activated. Instead of building fully capitalized subsidiaries, banks would "branch" from the U.K. or U.S. into specific countries where they already have licenses. Unlike a subsidiary, which is essentially a local bank, a branch functions as an outpost of the home office. The upside: they don't have to trap capital in EU subsidiaries. The downside: banks could only do business where they have a branch, so they wouldn't be able to access clients across the entire EU. Each country would need its own branch. This could work for smaller banks. But the EU is already discussing rules that would force big banks to create holding companies not just outposts inside the bloc.

The back-to-back model. This requires banks to build a compliance team and put a few traders into an EU entity. Deals would be booked in the EU and then flipped over to a bigger entity in the U.K. or even New York. The advantage of this model is that, because the risk is taken out of the EU entity, it probably wouldn't have to hold as much capital. It also requires less infrastructure build out. Again, it would require regulators to be comfortable with the set up.

The full blown bank. If all else fails, there's this. Lenders re-create a "mini-me" version of their U.K. investment bank in the EU. This would require substantial capital, trading infrastructure, compliance and top management to be in place in whatever country is chosen. This would be the most costly outcome for banks and given that investment-bank profit margins are less fat than they once were, some banks might decide it isn't worth it to preserve the business. Regulators are likely to be most comfortable with this model.

What jobs are affected?

Most bankers say they don't yet really know. There isn't an EU wide definition of what counts as doing cross-border business with a non-EU country. So it depends on which European country a bank bases itself in.

Banks broadly think the following:

Those very likely to move: Sales staff who do business with clients based in the EU. That covers a big swathe of products including the buying and selling of shares and derivatives, the ability to offer loans, and provision of services like custody and clearing.

Further along the chain the picture gets fuzzier. Regulators could demand on site compliance teams, and back-office and legal support to process those deals. They could also ask that key risk takers, such as traders, be present, along with senior managers. Business considerations will also come into play. Banks, for instance, may want to keep their trading and sales teams physically together even if regulators don't require it.

Unlikely to move: Merger advice, for instance, could be provided from outside the EU, because it isn't considered selling of a financial product. Other "ancillary" services such as accounting or investment research could also be done in a post-EU Britain.

The uncertainty is reflected in consultants' estimates of the impact of Brexit. Oliver Wyman, for instance, sees anything from 3,000 to 35,000 roles leaving London.

London is a pretty big financial prize. Is the rest of the EU keen to claim it?

Cities like Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin certainly want a piece. All would welcome at least some of London's finance business. But national politicians and regulators might not be so keen. With big investment banks come big investment-bank balance sheets. Countries such as Ireland, which went deep into debt to fund bank bailouts during the eurozone crisis, could be wary of taking on the risk.

Is a big, painful shakeup certain?

No. There are a few ways it could be avoided. The most straightforward would be for the U.K. to strike a fresh treaty with the EU that retains access for its banks to the single market. European leaders have made plain that such an arrangement is only palatable if Britain continues to allow their citizens to work and travel in the U.K. Since many Brexit proponents are keen to tighten borders, the politics of this option look difficult to square. But everything is a negotiation.

One option is for Britain to join the European Economic Area, a larger group that comprises the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Those extra countries abide by some but not all EU rules, and have access to some but not all of the passporting rights. This seems unlikely: EEA countries also have obligations to permit foreign workers to come.

Another option: On paper, at least, rules coming into force in 2018 permit non-EU companies to access the single market if their countries have adequate regulatory regimes. EU authorities would have to decide to grant this "equivalence" status to the U.K. and it only applies to some of the things banks do. What's more, the EU authorities could withdraw equivalence at their discretion. That makes it hard to form a business plan around.

If all else fails, European clients could come to London. Some corporations might simply choose to continue doing business with London-based banks. They could do that if their own financing arms were based in the U.K. That might be appealing to big companies keen to dip into London's massive capital markets. But it likely isn't an option for most smaller companies.

What happens next?

Bankers are hoping this all takes years to play out. Brexit negotiations are due to start by the end of March, but that might slip pending legal challenges to Brexit in the U.K. The two-year negotiations could be followed by a transition period, lasting several more years, allowing banks to re-organize their operations. Banks will continue to work on contingency plans, speeding them up if it looks as if things won't go in their favor. If jobs must move, it will likely be in drips.

That said, big banks don't turn on dimes. They'll need the path to be laid out with some certainty years in advance these decisions can't be made on the eve of Brexit. And for now, uncertainty reigns.

How a Trump Tax Cut Could Boost Banks

President-elect Donald Trump spoke on the campaign trail about wanting to reduce the corporate tax rate. The marginal rate is currently at 35% for the biggest companies, though the effective rate for individual companies can vary widely with some paying nothing. If the marginal rate were cut to 25%, the eight biggest universal banks would be poised to see additional median earnings per share growth of 9% in 2018, according to research by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Mortgage-Backed Securities and Prepayment Risk

"http://papers.nber.org/tmp/28538-w22851.pdf"for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Peter Diep,Andrea Eisfeldt and Scott Richardson create a pricing model of mortgage-backed security returns in order to measure risk. The model shows that prepayment risks appear to be priced by specialized mortgage-backed securities investors. "Our study provides new evidence of segmented markets for mortgage-backed securities, populated by specialized investors who price market-specific risks," they write.

Bank Subsidiaries Can Lead to Increase in Systemic Risk

Subsidiarization can create complex systemic risk by trapping capital in a bank's subsidiaries at the expense of its parent, "http://www.fedfin.com/blog/2236-karen-petrou-on-how-the-simple-subsidiary-solution-creates-complex-systemic-risk". Regulators tend to like subsidiarization, she writes, because they know "where the pieces for which it is responsible lie." The U.S.'s regulator strategy when it comes to subsidiarization "is intended as a way to ensure that U.S. operations are not suddenly endangered by a large foreign bank's home-country problems." While this strategy may have the effect of "creating clear piles of assets and liabilities for each resolution authority to clean up as it chooses," it may also lead to more systemic risk because it restricts a parent company's ability to quickly mobilize capital in the event of a crisis.

Consumer Financial Protection Rewrite

The big hurdle to killing it would be mustering 60 votes in the Senate, "and Democrats would be able to portray themselves as defending  consumer protection,' which sounds better than it has turned out. Reform options short of a death sentence could at least restrain some of the bureau's abuses."

How a Stronger Dollar Made Three Big U.S. Banks Look Riskier

The strong dollar has some big U.S. banks looking a bit weak at least when it comes to one measure of risk.

The situation highlights the complexity of capital rules and shows how global and national bank rules can intersect in unexpected ways.

Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. all moved up in the rankings of global systemically important banks, the "http://www.bis.org/press/p161121.htm" last week. The banks won't see any immediate impact, but they could eventually face limits to their room for maneuver in terms of how much long-term debt they are required to hold.

The move, however, wasn't driven by fundamental changes in the banks' risk profiles. It was due to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-banks-say-soaring-dollar-puts-them-at-disadvantage-1423442235".

In one sense, this shouldn't matter. While the Switzerland-based group of financial regulators and central bankers raised the level of additional capital buffers it would assign to the banks, those buffers aren't binding. That's because the U.S. banks are already subject to higher capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve. It calculates the capital buffer slightly differently than the Swiss body.

The board's figures do, though, affect U.S. banks through calculations of their minimum "total loss-absorbing capacity."

This relates to how much long-term unsecured debt banks have to hold to absorb losses that might eat through their equity buffers. The level of loss-absorption required under the Fed's rules depends, in part, on each bank's capital buffer as calculated under the Financial Stability Board's methodology.

And there's a catch, as Greg Baer, president of bank trade group the Clearing House, "https://www.theclearinghouse.org/eighteen53-blog/2016/november/22. Just how much of a capital surcharge the Financial Stability Board imposes on a bank depends on its so-called systemic indicator score. That is in part determined by the amount of each bank's share of the aggregate amount of assets held by the 75 largest global banks.

Under this, size and risk are relative. If, say, one big bank shrinks, that can make another appear larger as a part of the total, even if it that firm's balance sheet hasn't budged.

Currency moves also play a role. If the greenback is strong, banks with "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-strong-dollars-squeeze-on-wall-street-1423237824" see their shares of those global pools rise.

And the dollar's strength, along with contraction of the balance sheets of European banks, appears to be what drove Citigroup's ranking up by one notch. While Citigroup's balance sheet hasn't grown by much of late, the dollar appreciated 12% against the euro from December 2014 to December 2015, the period relevant for this year's systemic score.

Dollar strength also appears to have pushed up scores, and so capital requirements, at Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

The upshot? The three banks will likely need to meet higher total loss-absorbing capacity minimums. Citigroup had previously said its required ratio of equity and loss-absorbing debt would be 22.5% of risk-weighted assets. Now, it will likely have to meet a 23% ratio, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Last month, Citigroup told investors that it currently has a 23.4% ratio. So it won't have to do anything immediately. If Citigroup wanted to alter its funding mix in the future, though, it might be constrained in doing so.

And with the dollar again on the rise, it is possible big U.S. banks will face a similar challenge next year.

How to Kill the Volcker Rule? Don't Enforce It

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-kill-the-volcker-rule-dont-enforce-it-1480329002", which bars them from making wagers with their own money. Now, with the imminent arrival of the Trump administration, some banks and lawyers are eyeing a new way to defang the rule: Simply stop enforcing it.

The rule, named for former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, was one of the most controversial pieces of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, passed in the wake of the financial crisis. The provision was intended to rein in reckless risk-taking by big banks, but critics complain that it is unduly burdensome to comply with and deprives them of a lucrative money-making opportunity.

Central counterparties and clearinghouses, also known as CCPs, are platforms that stand between the buyers and sellers of financial instruments. They took on a more important role after the financial crisis, when regulators pushed derivatives trading through them to avoid a market collapse by ensuring that either party in a trade gets paid if the other side fails.

Mr. Trump's transition team announced the meetings during a call with reporters on Friday. Both Mr. Allison and Mr. Atkins have kept their hands in financial policy matters since leaving their high-profile jobs. Mr. Allison wrote a book and became president and CEO of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, after retiring from Winston-Salem, N.C.-based BB&T. Mr. Atkins launched a regulatory consulting business, Patomak Global Partners LLC, and maintained strong links to leaders in the Republican Party.

A new trading link starting Dec. 5 will give international investors access to more than 800 stocks listed on the $3.3 trillion Shenzhen stock market via Hong Kong's stock exchange. The Shenzhen market, just across the border from the former British colony, is home to some of China's fastest-growing technology companies. It is also rife with speculative trading in small-cap stocks with little institutional research coverage.

Since Donald Trump's surprise victory, average rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage have leapt by more than half a point, to 4.18% on Wednesday. Rates still remain low by historical standards, but are now at their highest level since June 2015, according to MortgageNewsDaily.com.

Whether she succeeds will define the bloc's ability to shake off its banking crisis.

The Democrats, led by Reps. Maxine Waters of California and Carolyn Maloney of New York, said in a letter this week to the internal watchdogs at federal financial agencies that Mr. Trump might seek to influence the German bank's settlement discussions with the Justice Department. The department sought $14 billion as its opening bid in talks with the bank to settle a set of high-profile mortgage-securities probes stemming from the financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

But the principles of the "fiduciary rule" could survive as the de facto industry standard, given the efforts financial firms have already made to adjust to it.

The rule, which holds brokers and others who give retirement advice to a fiduciary standard requiring they act in savers' best interests, was approved by the Labor Department this past spring and is due to take effect April 10. It stands to affect about $3 trillion of retirement assets in the U.S., according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

President-elect Donald Trump spoke on the campaign trail about wanting to reduce the corporate tax rate. The marginal rate is currently at 35% for the biggest companies, though the effective rate for individual companies can vary widely with some paying nothing. If the marginal rate were cut to 25%, the eight biggest universal banks would be poised to see additional median earnings per share growth of 9% in 2018, according to research by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Mortgage-Backed Securities and Prepayment Risk

"http://papers.nber.org/tmp/28538-w22851.pdf"for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Peter Diep,Andrea Eisfeldt and Scott Richardson create a pricing model of mortgage-backed security returns in order to measure risk. The model shows that prepayment risks appear to be priced by specialized mortgage-backed securities investors. "Our study provides new evidence of segmented markets for mortgage-backed securities, populated by specialized investors who price market-specific risks," they write.

Bank Subsidiaries Can Lead to Increase in Systemic Risk

Subsidiarization can create complex systemic risk by trapping capital in a bank's subsidiaries at the expense of its parent, "http://www.fedfin.com/blog/2236-karen-petrou-on-how-the-simple-subsidiary-solution-creates-complex-systemic-risk". Regulators tend to like subsidiarization, she writes, because they know "where the pieces for which it is responsible lie." The U.S.'s regulator strategy when it comes to subsidiarization "is intended as a way to ensure that U.S. operations are not suddenly endangered by a large foreign bank's home-country problems." While this strategy may have the effect of "creating clear piles of assets and liabilities for each resolution authority to clean up as it chooses," it may also lead to more systemic risk because it restricts a parent company's ability to quickly mobilize capital in the event of a crisis.

Consumer Financial Protection Rewrite

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau needs to be reined in if it can't be killed, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/consumer-financial-protection-rewrite-1480285636". "By all rights the bureau should be killed, and we're told the Trump transition team is considering this and other options," it says. The big hurdle to killing it would be mustering 60 votes in the Senate, "and Democrats would be able to portray themselves as defending  consumer protection,' which sounds better than it has turned out. Reform options short of a death sentence could at least restrain some of the bureau's abuses."

The "https://www.ft.com/content/1d87b580-aa42-11e6-a0bb-97f42551dbf4" between Hong Kong and Shenzhen will launch on December 5, the exchanges have confirmed.

The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect will offer foreign investors new access to the "https://www.ft.com/content/ea829cb8-a7f8-11e6-8b69-02899e8bd9d1", the world s ninth-largest stock exchange by market capitalisation and the favoured exchange of Chinese retail investors.

The much-anticipated link was previously "https://www.ft.com/content/6fe872fd-a7e1-33f3-853a-5325527d8715" to launch in late November, but an economist with the Hong Kong bourse said earlier this week that the project did not receive "https://www.ft.com/content/b607b407-6326-3a38-89df-d9730cbdb903" in time.

Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said:

We re ready for another milestone in our mutual market access initiative. Shenzhen Connect will open up another Mainland market for international investors, give investors on both sides of the boundary more choices and enhance access to the Mainland s stock market through our market and to our market through the mainland market.

Tony Cheung, head of Asia-Pacific quant analytics at Liquidnet, said:

The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Stock Connect comes at a time when the market could use a good vibe. Local Chinese investors are still disheartened by the fall from grace of their indices last year and that is being shown by substantially lower trading activity in China so far this year. The programme gives investors a reason to be excited about their markets again.

Draper Nexus Gets $175 Million for Two Funds; Tim Draper contributes as a limited partner and will help vet deals

The Draper family of venture funds is going deeper on early-stage bets.

Draper Nexus, backed by billionaire investor Tim Draper, has loaded up with $175 million in cash for two new funds.

The Draper Nexus funds are expected to unleash about two-thirds of the capital into U.S.-based startups and the other third into those based in Japan, said managing director Q Motiwala.

The iconic Mr. Draper, who stepped back from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, has kept busy with a flurry of investment vehicles bearing his brand. Draper Associates"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2016/04/12/tim-draper-puts-celebrity-to-test-with-190m-seed-fund/" a $190 million seed fund in April, and the Draper Venture Network "http://www.wsj.com/articles/draper-venture-network-to-offer-lps-direct-investments-in-its-growth-stage-companies-1478521801" DVN Select to give LPs access to investments in later rounds for some of its most-promising startups.

Mr. Draper is on the investment committee of Draper Nexus and continues to help vet all deals.

"Entrepreneurs everywhere can find capital with our extraordinary team," Mr. Draper said in an email.

Draper Nexus's investments span AI-driven driver network Nauto, security startup Cylance and drone developer CyPhy.

The Draper Nexus funds are named Draper Nexus Technology Partners II LP and Draper Nexus Technology Partners Japan II. About 80% to 85% of the limited partners from its previous Draper Nexus fund have returned to the two new vehicles, said Mr. Motiwala.

About 25 limited partners have invested in the new funds, mostly corporate investors. Draper Nexus's limited partners include brands such as Panasonic Corp., Fujitsu Ltd., Kyocera International Inc., Canon Inc. and Brother International Ltd.

Draper Nexus considers its corporate limited partners a competitive advantage for what it brings to the table for startup investments. The firm has made investments in companies who then plug into business development opportunities with its corporate limited partners, which many other venture firms tout as well.

"What we are really excited about are the whole AI space, transportation, robotics, drones and cybersecurity those are the big ones and also fintech," Mr. Motiwala said of the firm's U.S. focus.

Corporate limited partners will get access to entrepreneurs and next-generation technologies that have potential to upend their industries, said Mr. Motiwala.

Already Draper Nexus has set up about 50 partnerships between its corporate limited partners and portfolio companies.

The limited partners investing in Draper Nexus funds have business interests that include robotics, hardware, enterprise software, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and finance, according to Mr. Motiwala.

Draper Nexus also has limited partners from the insurance sector, including Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. who are trying to get ahead of industry changes.

"They are seeing their businesses change with autonomous vehicles and (Internet of Things)," Mr. Motiwala said of the insurance industry.

LPs such as Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho Bank must navigate ripples in their industry spurred by blockchain and bitcoin technology. Mr. Motiwala said they have contributed to Draper Nexus's funds for access to innovation as well.

(The following is a roundup of selected companies that have revealed securities sales in recent Form D regulatory filings. These companies are required to file a Form D notification within 15 days after the first sale of securities in an offering, which could indicate fundraising, acquisitions or other securities activity. The filings don't list the recipients of the securities being offered. However, they do list board members, so in cases where new investors have surfaced, we'll report them below.)

Acrobatiq, Pittsburgh, which provides student performance measurement software, has issued $5 million of a $6.5 million equity round. In July 2015, the company secured $9.75 million in Series A funding from Draper Triangle Ventures, Hearst Ventures and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

English Helper Inc., Dedham, Mass., an English-language learning provider to students and corporate employees in India, has sold $2.7 million of a $3.2 million equity round. Omidyar Network is a backer.

Fullbridge Inc., Boston, which offers professional development and education to students and young professionals, has issued almost half of a $7.5 million round of debt and rights. A March filing showed the company issuing $4 million toward a similar offering with a target of $5 million. In July 2015, the company raised a $15.4 million round led by GSV Capital.

GNS Healthcare Inc., Cambridge, Mass., which develops big-data analytics products for various players involved with health-care delivery, has sold $4 million in equity. In December 2015, the company received $10 million in Series C funding from investors including Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Cambia Health Solutions, Celgene Corp., Gi Global Health Fund LP and Heritage Provider Network.

Heal, Santa Monica, Calif., which dispatches pediatricians and primary-care physicians to patient homes or offices, has sold $14.6 million in equity.

The Four Companies That Sent the Dow to 19000; Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, UnitedHealth and Caterpillar have benefited from expectations of looser regulation and higher growth under a Trump administration

Shares of banks, industrials and health-care companies propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average to 19000 on Tuesday. The bets on those sectors largely reflect investors' expectations of looser regulation, and higher growth and interest rates under a Trump administration.

Here is a look at four companies that have benefited from those assumptions, contributing the most points to the blue-chip index's 1,135.59-point gain since the Dow last closed below 18000 on Nov. 4.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (contributed 240.99 points to the Dow industrials since Nov. 4) and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (73.76 points)

The two banks have been big factors in the blue-chip index's rally this month, largely because of the improved outlook for bank earnings and the rebound in long-term bond yields, which can make lending activity more profitable.

That has particularly helped J.P. Morgan, the largest bank in the nation by both assets and market value. Since the presidential election, bond yields have risen and the gap between long- and short-dated debt has widened. That should help banks' income because it increases the difference between what lenders charge on loans and pay out on deposits.

President-elect Donald Trump has also made comments about infrastructure projects to boost the economy. Banks and Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs are likely to be in the middle of these plans, either as advisers or lenders. Goldman, which derives more of its revenue from advising companies and trading their securities, also stands to benefit from increased volatility in recent weeks and widespread debate about the future of the global economy. Both factors increase investors' appetite to trade, which helps the firms' massive bond and stock-trading desks. Investors are also betting on reduced regulatory and tax costs under a Trump administration, which should help banks. Many of the prospective appointees for key economic posts in a Trump administration either have worked on Wall Street or have expressed sympathy with the idea that banks have been too heavily regulated.

Analysts at Credit Suisse expect earnings per share in 2017 could beat their pre-election base case forecast by 24% at Goldman and 30% at J.P. Morgan. However, it is an improvement from low expectations and conditions are still far from ideal for the big U.S. banks. For example, while there have been recent signs of health notably increased trading volumes long-term interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago and the so-called yield curve is slightly flatter which means interest income will likely remain under pressure.

John Carney

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (99.64 points)

The largest U.S. health insurer has struggled to eke out profitability from its Affordable Care Act plans. UnitedHealth Group has said it intends to withdraw from nearly all of the health-law marketplaces next year amid anticipated annual losses of about $850 million on ACA plans. Other insurers have also pulled back from their coverage areas under the law, leaving many counties with only one participating insurer and increased premiums. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act. Still, the law has also resulted in a Medicaid expansion, bringing new customers to the insurer. In its latest quarter, the company added 9% more Medicaid members. UnitedHealth also said medical spending was in line with its expectations, reassuring investors. The company has increasingly relied on its health-services unit, Optum, to drive growth. Optum is rapidly expanding its primary-care business and the unit, which also has analytics and pharmacy services divisions, is a differentiator for UnitedHealth compared with other insurers. In its latest quarter, revenue grew 12% to $46.29 billion.

Austen Hufford

Caterpillar Inc. (77.45 points)

The manufacturing giant has faced a tougher second half of the year than executives were expecting amid persistent weak demand for its construction, mining and oil equipment around the world. Revenue fell 16% in its latest quarter, and the company in October predicted another tough year in 2017 as the company deals with the fallout from the global commodities bust and prepares for a transition in top leadership. Caterpillar, whose sales hit an all-time high in 2012 under Chairman and Chief Executive Doug Oberhelman, has struggled since his move to drive the company deeper into mining equipment by pouring billions of dollars into factories. The move backfired when miners began shelving equipment-buying plans as commodity prices fell. Mr. Oberhelman will retire next year, earlier than expected, leaving company veteran Jim Umpleby to battle a historic sales slump after ill-timed bets on China and mining equipment.

UK COMPANIES
FCA warns over use of big data  to weed out customers; Insurance

The head of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority has warned insurers there should be limits to their use of big data so groups of customers are not unfairly penalised.

Speaking to the Association of British Insurers, Andrew Bailey said there had been "a revolution in our ability to capture and use information", but added that there had to be boundaries on the way that information was used.

Big data is an increasingly contentious area as insurers seek to use information to make more accurate pricing decisions. This month Facebook blocked Admiral, the car insurer, from using posts people had made on the social media site to make decisions about pricing. Admiral had hoped that the language used in the posts would provide clues about a person's driving style.

Mr Bailey said the use of big data could allow the industry to base its decisions on individual behaviour rather than assumptions about different groups of people. This could be useful in car insurance, he said, because it could encourage better driving.

But he added that in other cases there were dangers - for example in using data about which customers were likely to shop around for policies.

"Big data could be used to identify customers more likely to be inert, and insurers could use that information to differentiate pricing between those who shop around and those who do not. The latter pay more and thereby can cross- subsidise those who do shop around," he said. "We are . . . asked to exercise judgment on whether as a society we should or should not allow this type of behaviour. To simplify, our view is that we should not."

Mr Bailey also weighed in on the debate surrounding the use of genetic data to influence pricing for health and life insurance.

"The implications for life insurance are potentially profound . . . Now, maybe the reaction to improved identification is to say 'it is what it is' and we accept the implications for purchasing life insurance. Or, maybe we say that it creates unacceptable divisions within society - outcomes that are not acceptable for society in terms of access to insurance," he said. He added that the solution to the issue was something for the government, rather than just regulators, to decide.

Jamie Monck-Mason , an executive director at Willis Towers Watson, welcomed Mr Bailey's comments.

"It is encouraging to see that the FCA is open to - and indeed positive about - the use of big data by insurers, albeit in the context of wider public policy principles," he said.

"The use of big data opens up a world of commercial opportunities for the insurance sector - and it is clear that Mr Bailey welcomes those opportunities for the good of the sector - but it is refreshing to see the FCA inviting insurers to look at the longer term and the bigger picture."

Cautious Optimism as Conforming Mortgage Limit Raised

Analysts are somewhat upbeat on the mortgage market after the Federal Housing Finance Agency raises the ceiling on a "conforming" mortgage to $424,100 from $417,000, starting in 2017. That means Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be able to buy the larger loans, and package them with other mortgages for sale to investors. Analysts praised the increase but some raised concerns that Republicans will reverse the decision to reduce the government's role in the housing market. How President-elect Donald Trump's team "reacts to the higher loan limits may give us some insight into how the new president's administration will see housing policy," Cowen says.

Higher Limit for Fannie, Freddie Mortgage Purchases

The maximum size mortgage that Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac will buy from lenders has moved to $424,100 from $417,000 for most parts of the country starting in 2017, says the Federal Housing Finance Agency. This is the first increase in the baseline loan limit since 2006. In higher-cost areas, conforming mortgages will cap at $636,150, up from $625,500. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

Mortgage Rates at Highest Level Since June 2015

Average rates on 30-year fixed conforming mortgages jumped to 4.18% on Wednesday the highest since Sept 2014, according to MortgageNewsDaily.com. That is up 0.56 of a percentage point since Election Day and up 0.08 of a point from Tuesday. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

Fed Staff:  Moderate' Financial Sector Vulnerabilities

Federal Reserve staff saw only "moderate" risks stemming from the financial sector, according to minutes of the Fed's Nov. 1-2 meeting. Leverage remained low, staff said, and vulnerabilities associated with liquidity and maturity transformation "appeared to have been reduced." While Fed staff did say that commercial real estate prices had been rising, it noted that lending standards in that area had tightened, which should hold down vulnerabilities.

Promontory Chief: Not Backing Away From Core Services

Promontory Financial and IBM on Tuesday announced the closing of IBM's acquisition of the financial consultancy, less than two months after it was announced at the end of September. Eugene Ludwig, the founder of Promontory, told clients in an email that he would remain CEO of his firm "and we'll have the same people, advisory board, and expertise, and the same emphasis on high-quality work and hands-on personal service. We will keep the Promontory Financial Group name, just adding "an IBM company," and remain focused on our core risk management, regulation, and strategic advisory services." The consultancy is working with IBM on a new unit called Watson Financial Services applying artificial intelligence to the financial space. (ryan.tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

New EU Banking Rules Not Aimed at Brexit, Says EU's Dombrovskis

EU banking rules proposed Wednesday are in line with international standards, says EU financial services commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, and are not aimed at punishing the U.K. in light of its decision to leave the EU. Mr. Dombrovskis says EU rules will of course apply to countries outside of the EU "with a substantial presence in Europe" but that the rules aren't part of a "Brexit specific package." Mr. Dombrovskis's comments come as he unveils proposed legislation that will implement global capital requirements in the EU alongside initiatives to support small businesses and the finance sector.

New EC Banking Rules Set to Benefit Small Businesses, Says EU's Dombrovskis

The European Commission's latest proposals of post-financial-crisis bank regulation will benefit smaller banks and companies, says EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis Wednesday. "Europe needs a strong and diverse banking sector to finance the economy. We need bank lending for small companies to invest, remain competitive and sell into bigger markets," he says. The package would reduce reporting requirements for smaller financial institutions and aims to provide easier access to loans to finance SMEs. The proposed legislation comes as the EU attempts to boost growth across the bloc and implements global capital requirement rules (julia.verlaine@wsj.com; @JAVerlaine)

Bank Subsidiaries Can Lead to Increase in Systemic Risk; Bank units can trap capital at the expense of their parent, writes Karen Petrou.

Subsidiarization can create complex systemic risk by trapping capital in a bank's subsidiaries at the expense of its parent, "http://www.fedfin.com/blog/2236-karen-petrou-on-how-the-simple-subsidiary-solution-creates-complex-systemic-risk". Regulators tend to like subsidiarization, she writes, because they know "where the pieces for which it is responsible lie." The U.S.'s regulator strategy when it comes to subsidiarization "is intended as a way to ensure that U.S. operations are not suddenly endangered by a large foreign bank's home-country problems." While this strategy may have the effect of "creating clear piles of assets and liabilities for each resolution authority to clean up as it chooses," it may also lead to more systemic risk because it restricts a parent company's ability to quickly mobilize capital in the event of a crisis.
