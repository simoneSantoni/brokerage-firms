For Virgin Islands, Trouble in Paradise --- U.S. territory faces rising debt and pension obligations, and big budget gap

A U.S. territory famed for its white-sand beaches and azure waters is in a precarious financial position. This time, it isn't just Puerto Rico.

The U.S. Virgin Islands shares many of the same fiscal problems as its Caribbean neighbor 80 miles to the west: high levels of debt, mounting pension obligations and a declining population.

Local legislators on Tuesday are expected to consider a new round of taxes as a way to shore up the Virgin Islands' $110 million budget deficit. That follows an unsuccessful attempt this month to sell about $220 million in bonds, the second time in two months the territory has called off a planned bond sale.

Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp said the territory, with a population of some 105,000 people, has no problems making payments on its $2.2 billion in debt obligations. But he predicted widespread service cuts and layoffs if new bonds can't be sold.

Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded certain Virgin Islands bonds by three notches further into junk and cited "an increased possibility that the government may be forced to restructure its debt to address its financial problems."

"I think this is a critical juncture," said Nikolao Pula, director of the Office of Insular Affairs, which coordinates federal policy for several U.S. territories as part of the Interior Department.

Any failure by the Virgin Islands to pay back money owed to investors could intensify competition for limited government dollars inside the territory.

Virgin Islands bonds have traditionally appealed to mainland bondholders and U.S. mutual funds because they are exempt from state taxes. U.S. mutual funds hold nearly $1 billion in Virgin Islands bonds, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

The mutual fund with the highest percentage of its portfolio invested in Virgin Islands debt is made up largely of Wisconsin investors. Wells Fargo Asset Management, which oversees the Wells Fargo Wisconsin Tax Free C fund, said it is protecting itself from the Virgin Islands' financial situation by holding debt that is either insured or coming due within the next 18 months. More than 8% of its holdings is debt issued by the U.S. territory.

At Western Asset Management, based in Pasadena, Calif., which also holds Virgin Islands bonds, senior analyst Fred Poon said he expects the Virgin Islands legislature will eventually enact a "sin tax" on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as other revenue-raising measures. "Who wants to argue against taxes on sin?" Mr. Poon said.

Including the islands of St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix, the Virgin Islands has long struggled with budget deficits, but its problems accelerated after the 2008 economic downturn.

First, the economy, long dependent on tourism, took a hit. Annual expenditures by visitors fell 19% in the period from 2007 to 2013, a drop of $280 million. The territory's population shrank by almost 9% over that period.

Another blow came in 2012 when one of the territory's biggest employers shut down. The Hovensa oil refinery on the island of St. Croix employed 1,200 workers and 960 contractors, according to a report by Fitch Ratings at the time.

The closing was expected to deprive the government of an estimated $100 million in annual revenue, according to a 2012 report from the then-governor.

With less revenue, the territory has relied increasingly on bond proceeds to pay operating costs while contributing less to pension plans. That borrowing has increased its debt to a level similar to that of Puerto Rico, on a per capita basis.

The pension plan has only 27% of what it needs to pay future benefits, according to 2015 financial statements.

Some analysts expect the territory to eventually turn to Washington, D.C., for help, as Puerto Rico did in 2016. Congress last year passed legislation that provides Puerto Rico with a stay against creditor litigation in exchange for oversight from a seven-member board that controls the territory's finances and approves any court-supervised debt restructuring.

A similar solution for the Virgin Islands "is totally possible within the next five years," said Matt Fabian, a partner with research firm Municipal Market Analytics.

Job losses in compliance loom as banks harness power of automation; Financials

Thousands of jobs will be put at risk as the biggest banks harness artificial intelligence systems to the wave of roles created in recent years to meet ever-growing regulatory demands, industry experts have warned.

New technologies mean that banks could make vast savings in compliance, according to Richard Lumb , head of financial services at Accenture, who estimated that "thousands of roles" in the banks' internal policing could be replaced by automated systems.

"We are seeing work with clients today which is very much around big data and robotic process automation, where in compliance - take anti-money laundering - you can take out thousands of roles," Mr Lumb told the Financial Times. "That is coming quite quickly now and that will sweep across the industry."

He said that many of the jobs created by banks for compiling and checking data on customers and transactions had already been moved offshore to lower-cost countries. In the next wave of automation they will simply disappear.

"Companies have really thrown bodies at this to deal with the demands of the regulators," he said. "But now we are shifting from a revolution of labour arbitrage and offshore to a revolution of automation around this."

Citigroup estimates that the biggest banks have doubled the number of people they employ to handle compliance and regulation. This now costs the banking industry $270bn a year and accounts for 10 per cent of operating costs.

In a report called "digital disruption" sent to clients this week, Citi said there was a "huge cost take-out opportunity for financial institutions" from regulatory technology, or regtech .

Ronit Ghose, a banks analyst at Citi and co-author of the report, said: "So much stuff in banks is still paper-based. That is just archaic and with the advent of artificial intelligence and biometric identification it has to change."

Spanish bank BBVA recently estimated that, on average, financial institutions have 10 per cent to 15 per cent of their staff dedicated to this area. This heavy investment has been necessary in response to the crackdown by regulators that followed the financial crisis. European and US banks have paid more than $150bn in litigation and conduct charges since 2011, Citi estimated.

The US bank said that, ultimately, banks would benefit from pooling their resources in compliance. "Over the longer term, a nationwide [know your customer] utility could be beneficial to the whole of society, and many regulators and governments are working towards this ideal," it said.

However, progress has been slow on persuading big US and European banks to sign up to the private sector projects offering to provide a customer identity-checking utility service to the sector.

Lance Uggla, president of IHS Markit, a financial data provider that is offering a KYC utility service, said he was "disappointed" at the lack of progress but the concept remained "very strong" and the expectation of success was "intact".

Welcome to the Virgin Islands, One of the Most Indebted Places in the U.S. The U.S. territory is running out of options as it faces rising debt and pension obligations, a declining population and tepid response to proposed new bond offerings

"I think this is a critical juncture," said Nikolao Pula, director of the Office of Insular Affairs, which coordinates federal policy for several U.S. territories as part of the Interior Department. "We just hope whatever decision they make will be good moving forward."

The closing was expected to deprive the government of an estimated $100 million in annual revenue, according to a 2012 report from the then-governor.

With less revenue, the territory has relied increasingly on bond proceeds to pay operating costs while contributing less to pension plans. That borrowing has increased its debt to a level similar to that of Puerto Rico, on a per capita basis.

The lower pension contributions widened the funding gap for a retirement system that covers 9,303 current workers and 8,465 retirees and past workers, according to the fund's 2015 financial reports.

That pension plan has only 27% of what it needs to pay future benefits, according to 2015 financial statements; a 2015 analysis by Segal Consulting predicted the fund would run out of money by 2024.

The governor said he plans to unveil proposed pension fixes this year and hold hearings on the topic. "We need to come up with a strategy," Mr. Mapp said.

Another strain is that U.S. territories, including the Virgin Islands, typically receive less federal money than U.S. states, according to Rep. Stacey Plaskett, the nonvoting U.S. congresswoman representing the Virgin Islands. For example, the federal government caps the amount of Medicaid payments the territories receive. "Our disparity of treatment is I believe what has caused these financial issues to occur," Rep. Plaskett said.

Some analysts expect the territory to eventually turn to Washington, D.C., for help, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-ricos-drastic-population-loss-deepens-its-economic-crisis-1467219467". Congress last year passed "http://www.wsj.com/articles/president-obama-signs-puerto-rico-debt-relief-bill-1467321998"in exchange for oversight from a seven-member board that controls the territory's finances and approves any court-supervised debt restructuring.

A similar solution for the Virgin Islands "is totally possible within the next five years," said Matt Fabian, a partner with research firm Municipal Market Analytics.

But a cash crunch could come much sooner. Ken Kurtz of Moody's predicts the territory will need to sell bonds within the next few months to keep from running out of operating cash.

Interest in Virgin Islands bonds has been scarce ever since Congress authorized debt-relief legislation for Puerto Rico last June. Bondholders showed lukewarm interest in a Jan. 11 offering, even after the governor requested that federal funds backing the bonds be wired directly to an escrow agent, to alleviate concerns that the Virgin Islands would divert the money if the financial situation worsens.

The Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority received orders for slightly more than 60% of the bonds after offering an interest rate "in the 6% range," according to Mr. Mapp. The authority opted to cancel the deal rather than reduce its size, he said. A spokesman for the authority said it is no longer trying to sell bonds and will assess whether to re-enter the market "when appropriate credit and acceptable interest rates are present."

About $55 million of the $219 million offering would have been used to close a gap in this year's $1.35 billion budget, the governor said. If the Virgin Islands can't close that gap, "this is not sustainable," Mr. Mapp said. "We can't continue doing this."

Equities: Goldman Set Pace for Dow Climb --- Industrial giants gave a final shove to 20000 after a long stock rally led by bank's advance

When it came to Dow 20000, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. drove the index to the five-yard line. But International Business Machines Corp. and Boeing Co. got it over the goal line.

In the immediate aftermath of the presidential election, Goldman Sachs powered the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher. It was the biggest contributor to its historic drive to the 20000 level, contributing 21.9% of the gain the index notched since Nov. 8.

Of the Dow's 1735.77-point rise since the election, Goldman accounted for 378.91 points.

Goldman's rally -- the shares are up 30.4% since the election -- came as financial stocks overall rose sharply on hopes Donald Trump's administration would loosen regulatory shackles on banks, cut taxes and pursue pro-growth policies. And, importantly, all this would hopefully lead to higher interest rates, which help improve bank profitability.

Indeed, gains for the KBW Nasdaq Bank index since Election Day are more than double those of the Dow.

Mirroring investors' optimistic view, Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said Wednesdaythat the U.S. economy was "on very sound footing," and that consumer and business confidence had jumped since the election.

"In less than a week you're seeing things happen," Mr. Moynihan said, referring to initiatives by Mr. Trump. That could bolster consumer and business confidence, although "now we will have to see how that will play out," Mr. Moynihan added in remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

Mr. Moynihan has good reason to be cheery. Bank of America has gained even more ground than Goldman. Its 35% rise since the election is the best of any big-bank stock.

But Bank of America isn't in the Dow. And as Bank of America's rally gained further ground in mid-January on the back of its fourth-quarter results, Goldman lost steam. While the bank reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, investors seemed to have already priced into financial stocks many of the benefits they expect to see in 2017.

At that point, IBM and Boeing stepped in to keep the Dow's momentum going. Those stocks were the second- and third-biggest contributors, respectively, to the Dow's rise since Election Day.

Much of their gains came this month, though. They contributed more than 80 points to the Dow's nearly 300-point rise so far in 2017.

Boeing gained 4.2% on Wednesday alone after the aerospace giant reported earnings that topped analyst forecasts. IBM is up more than 7% since the start of the year as the company attempts a transformation of its cloud-computing and artificial-intelligence businesses.

Although it flagged into the finish, Goldman remained the only Dow component to account for more than 10% of its increase since the election.

The ascent of Goldman's shares has helped lift the value of its executives' stock-based compensation plans. It has left the stock within striking distance of its all-time closing high of$247.92. That was hit in October 2007.

But Goldman isn't likely to dwell on its Dow victory. Speaking on the bank's earnings call earlier this month, finance chief Harvey Schwartz said he is "always rooting for the share price." But that, he added, isn't going to lead to Goldman "thinking about changing how we run the company."

Accel's Steve Loughlin on Breaking Through the Noise in SaaS; RelateIQ's co-founder shares his outlook on investing, Salesforce and artificial intelligence

Steve Loughlin co-founded RelateIQ Inc., which Salesforce.com acquired for $390 million in 2014. Last year he left Salesforce to become a partner at Accel Partners, which was an early backer of RelateIQ. WSJ Pro Venture Capital spoke with Mr. Loughlin about bringing both his startup and corporate experience to investing in artificial intelligence-enabled software-as-a-service.

WSJ: You recently invested in Split Software. You worked with them at RelateIQ when they were developing the capability that later turned into their current product. What drew you to get involved as an investor?

I knew that team has been working on this technically, before it was a problem they really wanted to solve. It's about how can you deploy software and continue to play software in a really high-quality manner but also a manner in which it's responsive at the speed that customers and users expect. Having to respond to competitors' speed is actually just an incredible asset to have.

What's your investment thesis for sales and marketing investments?

There's this whole concept around how you scale these businesses, so you not only have the product, but you also have to build a sales and marketing engine around that. Where are you going to get your first $5 million in recurring revenue? And then $20 million, and then $100 million. Being precise about that is important because if you try and focus on every customer, you're not going to give a great experience.

With Salesforce, you've been a leader of their AI initiative. What special advantage is that give you as an investor?

There are certain products and problems that are more relevant to Salesforce, so it's having worked on the strategy with the team and knowing the places are that are going to be a high priority in the future. You're looking for things that are pretty early but are going to have high prospects in the future. The advantage is that I have a deep understanding of what's happening inside one of the larger companies, and at the same time kind of know what these emerging companies can do to find the white space in a very large category.

What areas of AI-enabled sales and marketing technology may be overhyped?

I wouldn't say there are any areas that are overhyped because I think there is a lot of opportunity. I would say one of the key things that startups and emerging companies need to think about is the value that they are creating for the customer and also where they sit in the priority of the customers' buying patterns. There are a lot of companies that have great features, but haven't connected to becoming great businesses. The challenge is: Are you a feature, a product, or company? The challenge is most startups start out as a feature, and then you have to have a plan to actually go from feature to product to company.

Heard on the Street
For U.S. Banks, U.K. Offers a Model

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Just what banking regulation will be like under President Donald Trump remains unclear. But recent comments by Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin suggest he might be looking across the Atlantic to the U.K. for inspiration.

That isn't necessarily good news for investors in the biggest U.S. lenders.

In his Senate testimony last week and in written responses to senators this week, Mr. Mnuchin repeatedly raised the specter of some kind of "21st century Glass-Steagall," without giving any details.

Mr. Mnuchin clearly doesn't favor a simple return to the Great Depression-era law. In his written comments, Mr. Mnuchin said that "a bright line between commercial and investment banking. . .may inhibit the necessary lending and capital markets activities to support a robust economy."

So what does Mr. Mnuchin want? So far, he isn't saying. But one possibility would be a separation of retail bank operations such as that being put in place in the U.K., says Karen Petrou, analyst at Federal Financial Analytics.

Under this system, U.K. banks like Barclays and HSBC Holdings must establish separate subsidiaries that contain their U.K. operations serving individuals and small businesses, funded by government-guaranteed deposits. Their global investment-banking businesses stand outside this "ringfence" with their own capital, allowing them in theory to be wound down if they run into trouble without endangering the retail bank or necessitating a bailout.

Legislation along these lines could conceivably garner support from both parties.

Such a plan also could help Mr. Mnuchin square his seemingly contradictory comments on the Volcker rule. He has said banks with federally insured deposits shouldn't be taking trading risks with their own money, but also that trading restrictions on those banks have harmed market liquidity.

For universal banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the potential implications are huge. They would have to decide if it is worth incurring the costs of undergoing a ringfencing process, including potentially higher overall capital requirements, or if it would be more efficient to just break up, potentially losing some synergies between units.

Either way, it will be a cumbersome process.

Another question is how the investment-banking units would be funded. It would be problematic if they were overly dependent on short-term wholesale finance, as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers Holdings were. One possible source of funding would be corporate deposits, which aren't insured.

U.S. banks don't necessarily want another regulatory revamp that forces further rethinking of fundamental business models, after years of adapting to current rules. Tweaks to the existing system, such as looser Volcker-rule enforcement, would suit them just fine.

But in today's political scene, big banks can't bet on getting exactly what they want. Until the regulatory outlook is clearer, investors should be mindful of the risks.

Thousands of jobs will be put at risk as the world s biggest banks harness "https://www.ft.com/artificial-intelligence-robotics" systems to the wave of roles created in recent years to meet ever-growing regulatory demands, industry experts have warned.

New technologies mean that banks could make vast savings in compliance, according to Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture, who estimated that  thousands of roles  in the banks  internal policing could be replaced by automated systems.

 We are seeing work with clients today which is very much around big data and robotic process automation, where in compliance   take anti-money laundering   you can take out thousands of roles,  Mr Lumb told the Financial Times at last week s World Economic Forum in Davos.  That is coming quite quickly now and that will sweep across the industry. 

He said many of the jobs created by banks in recent years for compiling and checking data on customers and transactions had already been moved offshore to lower-cost countries. In the next wave of automation they will simply disappear.

 Companies have really thrown bodies at this to deal with the demands of the regulators. They have had no option,  he said.  But now we are shifting from a revolution of labour arbitrage and offshore to a revolution of automation around this. 

Citigroup estimates that the biggest banks, including JPMorgan and HSBC, have doubled the number of people they employ to handle compliance and regulation. This now costs the banking industry $270bn a year and accounts for 10 per cent of operating costs.

In a report called  digital disruption  sent to clients this week, Citi said there was a  huge cost take-out opportunity for financial institutions  from the fast-growing area of regulatory technology, or regtech.

Ronit Ghose, banks analyst at Citi and co-author of the report, said:  So much stuff in banks is still paper-based. We are forever being asked to sign things. That is just archaic and with the advent of artificial intelligence and biometric identification it has to change. 

Spanish bank BBVA recently estimated that, on average, financial institutions have 10 to 15 per cent of their staff dedicated to this area. This heavy investment has been necessary in response to the crackdown by regulators that followed the financial crisis. European and US banks have paid more than $150bn in litigation and conduct charges since 2011, Citi estimated.

The US bank said that, ultimately, banks would benefit from pooling their resources in compliance.  Over the longer term, a nationwide [know your customer] utility could be beneficial to the whole of society, and many regulators and governments are working towards this ideal,  it said.

However, progress has been slow on persuading big US and European banks to sign up to the private sector projects offering to provide a customer identity-checking utility service to the sector.

Lance Uggla, president of IHS Markit, a financial data provider that is offering a KYC utility service, said he was  disappointed  at the lack of progress but the concept remained  very strong  and the expectation of success was  intact .

 The concept of a utility for KYC is very well embraced by financial market participants today as well as many other shared services they would like to create to reduce their cost structures,  he told the FT.

Under Trump, U.S. Banks Could Get a British Makeover; Recent comments by Steven Mnuchin suggest the U.K. could be a model for banking regulation under President Donald Trump

Just what banking regulation will be like under President Donald Trump remains unclear. But recent comments by Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin suggest he might be looking across the Atlantic to the U.K. for inspiration.

That isn't necessarily good news for investors in the biggest U.S. lenders.

In "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mnuchin-hearing-does-little-to-clear-trump-fog-of-uncertainty-1484861753"and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-nominee-steven-mnuchin-says-bank-regulation-should-be-tailored-to-activity-1485258397", Mr. Mnuchin repeatedly raised the specter of some kind of "21st Century Glass-Steagall," without giving any details.

Mr. Mnuchin clearly doesn't favor a simple return to the Great Depression-era law. In his written comments, Mr. Mnuchin said that "a bright line between commercial and investment banking &may inhibit the necessary lending and capital markets activities to support a robust economy."

So what does Mr. Mnuchin want? So far, he isn't saying. But one possibility would be a "ringfencing" of retail bank operations such as that being put in place in the U.K., says Karen Petrou, analyst at Federal Financial Analytics.

Under this system, U.K. banks like Barclays and HSBC"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-banks-start-to-ring-in-the-changes-heard-on-the-street-1421769384" that contain their local U.K. operations serving individuals and small businesses, funded by government-guaranteed deposits. Their global investment-banking businesses stand outside this ringfence with their own capital, allowing them in theory to be wound down if they run into trouble without endangering the retail bank or necessitating a government bailout.

Legislation along these lines could conceivably garner support from both parties, avoiding a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.

Such a scheme also could help Mr. Mnuchin square his seemingly contradictory comments on the Volcker rule. He has said banks with federally insured deposits shouldn't be taking trading risks with their own money, but also that trading restrictions on those banks have harmed market liquidity.

For universal banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the potential implications are huge. They would have to decide if it is worth incurring the costs of undergoing a ringfencing process, including"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-u-ks-version-of-glass-steagall-will-hit-big-banks-1444913519", or if it would be more efficient to just break up, potentially losing some synergies between units. Either way, it will be a cumbersome process.

Another question is how the hived-off investment-banking units would be funded. It would be problematic if they were overly dependent on short-term wholesale finance, as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were. One possible source of funding would be corporate deposits, which aren't insured.

U.S. banks don't necessarily want another regulatory revamp that forces further rethinking of fundamental business models, after years of adapting to current rules. Tweaks to the existing system, such as looser Volcker-rule enforcement, would suit them just fine.

But in today's political scene, big banks can't bet on getting exactly what they want. Until the regulatory outlook is clearer, investors should be mindful of the risks.

EquipmentShare Builds Case for Peer-to-Peer Construction Gear; The company gets $26 million to expand its peer-to-peer marketplace for construction equipment

A Missouri company that is bringing the on-demand marketplace business model to the construction industry has raised $26 million.

Insight Venture Partners and Romulus Growth, a Romulus Capital fund, led the round in EquipmentShare. Previous investor Y Combinator also participated.

EquipmentShare operates as a marketplace like AirBnB where contractors can lend or rent construction equipment ranging from forklifts to concrete buggies.

The round comes as venture capital interest in marketplaces and on-demand startups has softened, following a frenzy of funding rounds in 2014 and 2015. EquipmentShare Chief Executive William Schlacks said he thinks the company was somewhat insulated from the changing funding environment because it is a business-to-business, not consumer, service.

"We're about solving real problems, not playing some VC game," Mr. Schlacks said.

The investment in EquipmentShare highlights the increase of industries that are being transformed by software. Late last year, construction software provider "http://www.wsj.com/articles/procore-technologies-joins-billion-dollar-startup-club-1481230801" raised funding at about a $1 billion valuation.

Mr. Schlacks said when evaluating investors, he knew he wouldn't find many with experience in construction, but did look marketplace expertise.

Romulus has invested in another marketplace startup that allows medical professionals to lend and rent equipment.

"There really is no investor who spends 60 hours a week in this space," Mr. Schlacks said.

EquipmentShare offers rentals in Columbia and St. Louis, Missouri, as well as Dallas, Jacksonville, Fla., and Auckland, New Zealand. The company will use the funding to expand to new markets in the South and Midwest, including Austin.

In addition to expanding its rental service, EquipmentShare will offer ES Track, a telematics platform. The software allows businesses nationwide to track their fleet and it provides analytics about the equipment.

The tracking software launches as a federal mandate is set to go into effect at the end of the year that would require contractors to keep electronic logs on the hours of services of vehicles.

Neil Chheda, Romulus Capital co-founder and general partner, said this software could be "the backbone" of automated fleets of construction equipment in the future. But he noted that autonomous construction equipment is likely 5 to 10 years away.

He said there are many other problems EquipmentShare can focus on today just in helping contractors better manage their equipment, adding, "There's a lot of low-hanging fruit."

Tracy's Take: At Washington March, Not Much Wall Street Rhetoric

CFPB Chief Presses On With Regulatory Agenda

Former SEC Enforcement Chief Ceresney to Return to Private Practice

Treasury Nominee Steven Mnuchin Says Bank Regulation Should Be Tailored to Activity

At Wells Fargo, Bank Branches Were Tipped Off to Inspections

At Washington March, Not Much Wall Street Rhetoric

On Saturday, I brought my notepad to the National Mall as one several Wall Street Journal reporters monitoring the throngs "http://www.wsj.com/articles/demonstrators-gather-for-womens-march-a-day-after-trump-inauguration-1485006572" the day after Inauguration Day. What I saw reminded me of the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203735304577167214156233978", in that the crowd represented a litany of different people advocating for litany of different causes.

One "Occupy" element that was missing: Very few people were ranting about Wall Street.

The marchers showed up to advocate for women and to show their displeasure with the election results. It was no surprise to see signs demanding equal pay and abortion rights alongside jabs at President Donald Trump.

Chants, flyers and posters also addressed many other issues, including immigration, climate change, the minimum wage, Obamacare, the Patriot Act, socialism, racism, gay rights and public education. In five hours, I saw one sign about financial regulation, about halfway through: "Regulate Banks, Not Bodies!"

It would be a leap to conclude the public is no longer angry at Wall Street. I suspect many marchers still harbor negative views of the financial industry, a premise confirmed anecdotally when I walked past Bank of America Corp.'s branch across from the Treasury Department and heard a handful of young men shouting their opinions of the firm. Suffice it to say it's not appropriate to repeat them here.

Recent polling by "http://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/161300NBCWSJDecember216PollFinal1.pdf", as well as Gallup, suggests hating Wall Street has fallen out of favor somewhat, with banking and finance receiving substantially higher marks from the public at the end of 2016 than around 2010, the last time there was substantial shift in Washington's orientation toward the industry.

Perhaps that helps explain why Mr. Trump has felt free to do what was unthinkable only months ago, and appoint several Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni to key administration posts. If memories of the crisis weren't fading, it would be hard to imagine someone like Steven Mnuchin, the Goldman veteran turned leader of a bank that critics called a "foreclosure machine," sailing to confirmation as Treasury secretary, as Mr. Mnuchin appears to be doing.

How big banks fare in the Trump era remains to be seen, and surely the industry is wary of the fact that populism appears to be a powerful political force. Mr. Trump won't want to be painted as a puppet of Wall Street power, and lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) won't shy away from branding him that way if they see what they perceive as lax regulatory policies.

What the march suggests is that for now, other perceived evils have the public's attention.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

CFPB Chief Presses On With Regulatory Agenda

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTON On the first full business day of the Trump administration, Richard Cordray, the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, made his presence known by alleging that Citigroup Inc.'s mortgage-servicing units mistreated struggling borrowers.

Monday's settlement with Citigroup the bureau's 15th enforcement action in the past two months underscores Mr. Cordray's intention to keep pursuing a busy regulatory agenda, unfazed by the intensifying heat from the Republican administration to rein in his agency and remove him from its helm.

The consumer watchdog created in the aftermath of the financial crisis is on the front line of President Donald Trump's war on Obama-era financial regulations and Mr. Cordray has emerged as a major target of the Republican assault. (Mr. Cordray will discuss his stance at a WSJ Pro Financial Regulation event Tuesday morning, his first public appearance since Friday's inauguration.)

Congressional Republicans are stepping up their attack on the CFPB, which they and the financial industry have long criticized as a symbol of regulatory overreach. They are preparing legislation to rein in its budget, weaken its leadership structure and narrow its authority. They are looking for ways that would allow President Donald Trump to fire Mr. Cordray despite legal hurdles.

"This was a duplicative agency that didn't need to be there," Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R., Mo), who heads a House subcommittee with oversight of the CFPB, said in an interview earlier this month. "It's been a total failure, and in my mind it needs to go away."

Mr. Trump hasn't made any specific remarks about the CFPB but some of his aides said they wanted to see the agency constrained. Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, said in his confirmation hearing last week that the CFPB should be preserved but Congress should have control over its budget. Asked about the future of Mr. Cordray at a press conference Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said "no decision has been made."

A CFPB spokeswoman has said Congress has confirmed Mr. Cordray to serve a term until July 2018 and he had no plans to step down.

The CFPB is plowing ahead with a spree of enforcement actions. In January alone, the regulator sued Navient Corp., the nation's largest servicer of federal and private student loans, over its handling of loan repayments. It fined two big credit-reporting agencies, alleging deceptive marketing of credit reports, and it expanded a crackdown on overdraft fees by suing a regional bank.

Navient and TCF denied wrongdoing. The two credit-reporting bureaus settled without admitting or denying the allegations.

"When banks deliberately design ways to pull the wool over the eyes of their customers, the consumer bureau is watching carefully," Mr. Cordray told reporters after filing the lawsuit over TCF National Bank's overdraft program on Jan. 19. "We will not hesitate to take action against any entity that we find to be deceiving or abusing consumers. "

The aggressive stance has drawn sharp reactions from some of the companies targeted.

Navient Chief Executive Jack Remondi said in an interview Monday that the CFPB was acting with a political agenda, adding that an official from the agency's enforcement team made what Mr. Remondi characterized as an ultimatum weeks after the presidential election. That came after the two sides held regular talks over the case since 2015, the CEO said. "Settle now or be sued," Mr. Remondi said in the interview. "  Settle before inauguration day' was their quote, turning this into a politically driven solution."

"This case is about standing up for student-loan borrowers, plain and simple," said Seth Frotman, the CFPB's student-loan ombudsman. "For years, Navient has systematically and illegally failed borrowers at every stage of repayment."

A Navient spokeswoman said the company "welcomes a strong central consumer regulator who publishes clear rules for all to follow, and doesn't have a position on the future of the CFPB or its director."

People familiar with the transition process said the administration might start its push to revamp the agency with Mr. Trump urging Mr. Cordray to step down voluntarily. If the CFPB director won't oblige, the president could fire him for cause or by citing a federal court ruling that declared the bureau's single-director structure unconstitutional. The CFPB has appealed the decision.

In a sign that the new administration may be looking to name a new director soon after the inauguration, Mr. Trump earlier this month met with Randy Neugebauer, a recently retired congressman who is seen as a top candidate for the job. The Texas Republican had led his party's attack on the CFPB as a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee.

Mr. Cordray's departure could scuttle the bureau's continuing efforts to roll out new rules on payday lending, forced arbitration in consumer financial contracts and prepaid cards.

The CFPB was established with the help of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass), a firebrand popular with liberal voters, to tip the balance of power toward consumers from banks after millions lost their homes and savings during the financial crisis. Since then, it has grown into a major regulator with 1,600 employees that has written rules to rein in companies' activities in markets including mortgages, credit cards and student loans.

The bureau's enforcement actions against banks, payday lenders, debt collectors and others have resulted in a total of $12 billion returned to some 27 million consumers the regulator said were harmed by alleged corporate misconduct.

Democrats and consumer advocates have vowed to protect the agency and urged Mr. Trump to keep Mr. Cordray in the job or be ready for a prolonged fight.

"Republicans, working with special interests in the industry, are trying to make us forget that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression just eight years ago," said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program Director for Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups, known as U.S. PIRG, a consumer group that supports the CFPB.

To guarantee the CFPB's independence, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which created the agency, states the president can remove its director only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office."

To allow Mr. Trump to fire the CFPB chief for cause, lawyers working with Republicans have been looking for missteps during Mr. Cordray's career. House Republicans last week issued a report laying out one such scenario, saying Mr. Cordray may have violated federal law regarding 2015 rules on auto lending.

Former SEC Enforcement Chief Ceresney to Return to Private Practice

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON Andrew Ceresney, a top white-collar lawyer who led the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division for the past three years, is returning to his former legal home at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP.

Mr. Ceresney, 45 years old, will resume a practice he handled for Debevoise before becoming Wall Street's top civil enforcer. He returns with an added rank, joining as co-chair of the firm's litigation practice, a title once held by his mentor, former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White. Ms. White, who took over the SEC in 2013 and stepped down Friday at the end of Barack Obama's presidency, brought Mr. Ceresney with her as enforcement director.

At Debevoise, Mr. Ceresney will defend some of the same types of companies and executives that he investigated at the SEC, where he and Ms. White were known for seeking higher corporate penalties in legal settlements. The move from probing Wall Street to defending it from regulators is a common switch for SEC lawyers, although the practice frustrates many advocates of strict regulation who say the "revolving door" promotes coziness.

Like many former regulators, Mr. Ceresney is a supporter of moving between the two worlds, saying government lawyers are better equipped to grapple with Wall Street if they know where to apply the pressure. Under government ethics rules, he is forbidden from directly dealing with the SEC for a year, but can interact with officials at other federal or state agencies.

"When I worked for the government, I represented my client, the American people," Mr. Ceresney said. "It was extremely valuable in my prior role to have the private-practice experience and to know what kind of leverage the government had."

The law firm is expected to announce the hiring Tuesday, and Mr. Ceresney will resume work from its New York office in early March.

Unlike some prior SEC enforcement chiefs, Mr. Ceresney didn't carry out an extended courtship after leaving in December. A predecessor, Robert Khuzami, benefited from a bidding war for his services when he left the government in 2013. Mr. Khuzami eventually landed at Kirkland & Ellis, where he was paid more than $5 million a year.

Mr. Ceresney said he "explored a bit" in terms of other opportunities, but quickly decided he wanted to return to Debevoise, a firm he first joined in 2003. He earned about $245,000 at the SEC; he declined to comment on his pay at Debevoise.

Debevoise is one of the few white-shoe law firms that uses a "lockstep" system to compensate partners based on seniority, rather than rewarding them for how many clients they bring in. Ms. White reported earning $2.4 million in 2012 when she had the title that Mr. Ceresney will take.

In recent months, Debevoise has recruited other former government lawyers, including David O'Neil, who was acting head of the U.S. Justice Department's criminal division, and Julie Riewe, who worked for Mr. Ceresney and led the SEC's asset-management unit.

Ms. White hasn't announced what she intends to do next. Mr. Ceresney has worked with Ms. White for nearly two decades, having joined the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan in 1998 when she was its top federal prosecutor.

As an ex-prosecutor, Ms. White was an unusual choice to run the SEC, a bureaucracy faulted by critics for not punishing enough banks that sold the toxic mortgage securities that nearly toppled the financial system in 2008. Mr. Ceresney said early on that he would restore the SEC's "swagger" and take "bolder action" against Wall Street. During his term as director, the SEC pursued a record number of enforcement cases using a strategy that targeted small infractions as well as bigger frauds.

The commission's next likely leader is corporate attorney Jay Clayton of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, who like past SEC chairmen appointed before the financial crisis would come directly from Wall Street.

Mr. Ceresney said he doesn't think he'll lack for work in his new job. "Enforcement is a bipartisan issue," he said. "I don't expect the new administration to change that."

Treasury Nominee Steven Mnuchin Says Bank Regulation Should Be Tailored to Activity

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin said banks should be regulated based on their "complexity and activity, not simply size" and addressed other regulatory issues in written answers submitted to members of the Senate Finance Committee after his confirmation hearing last week.

"I believe in a regulatory framework that is determined by complexity and activity, not simply size," he wrote, addressing a question about the $50 billion asset threshold at which banks face tougher regulation under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Many lawmakers and regulators want to change the line.

Mr. Mnuchin also endorsed a "comprehensive review" of the powers and institutional processes of the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of senior regulators created by Dodd-Frank, signaling he is open to discussing changing that aspect of the law as well.

Many of Mr. Mnuchin's answers repeated or elaborated on statements he made in the hearing. Addressing whether he supported a return to the Glass-Steagall law forcing banks to split the business of traditional lending from investment banking, he said the Trump administration wanted to study the issue.

"A bright line between commercial and investment banking, although less complicated, may inhibit the necessary lending and capital markets activities to support a robust economy," Mr. Mnuchin said. "This is why we have suggested a 21st Century Glass-Steagall may be appropriate."

At Wells Fargo, Bank Branches Were Tipped Off to Inspections

By Emily Glazer

As Wells Fargo & Co.'s sales-tactics scandal unfolded, investors, regulators and politicians asked how improper practices could have persisted for so long. One possible reason: bank branches were given a heads up before Wells Fargo's internal monitors landed for inspections.

Managers and employees at the bank's roughly 6,000 branches across the U.S. typically had at least 24 hours' warning about annual reviews conducted by risk employees, current and former Wells Fargo employees and executives said. That gave many employees time to cover up improper practices, such as opening accounts or signing customers up for products without their knowledge.

More than a dozen current and former employees of the bank across California, Arizona and New Jersey, for instance, said they forged or saw colleagues forge signatures on documents or shred papers that could have indicated accounts were opened without authorization.

Often, managers would call for all hands on deck at a branch to stay late into the evening or sometimes all night to shred documents or forge signatures if they weren't there, some current and former managers said.

For instance, they would go through desks to find signature cards that hadn't been approved, make sure wire forms had been filled out properly and that documents in a "control binder" like cash or teller audits were filled out, said Ivan Rodriguez, a former branch banker at Wells Fargo for about six years until 2013.

Some branches that opened accounts for customers without the customer present would cut and paste a signature the bank had on file for the customer and add it to the required signature card, Mr. Rodriguez said.

"You became numb to it," he added. "It became pretty normal."

A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the bank has boosted oversight, monitoring and accountability so unethical practices don't happen again. That includes investing millions in staffing, mystery shops by a third party, unannounced branch inspections on employee sales behavior and an increase in branch visits by its internal auditors.

The bank has been under fire since September when it entered a $185 million settlement and enforcement action with regulators and a city official over opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized information. Wells Fargo still faces a spate of state and federal investigations, including from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In the scandal's wake, Wells Fargo has been changing procedures and trying to tighten internal checks, said Vic Albrecht, who has led risk management for the retail bank since September. Last fall, it piloted a surprise sales-practices inspection that previously didn't exist to ensure there isn't undue sales pressure and customers get appropriate products, among other checks, he said.

Around 100 of these "Conduct Risk Reviews" have been completed based on possible risks or complaints. Top retail-banking executives who typically oversee hundreds of branches, risk executives and company lawyers are aware of the results, Mr. Albrecht said.

But the other system, now known as "Branch Control Review," still gives a 24-hour notice so branch managers can staff appropriately and it doesn't interrupt customer service, he said, though advance notice and other parts of the review could change in the future. It measures "operational integrity," according to an internal bank document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. That system, alongside the bank's "Quality of Sales Report Card" that checks signatures, procedures and funding, are part of a new branch "risk score." This will be factored into employees' compensation under a new plan rolled out to staff this month, according to plan documents.

Bank-branch audits are common in the industry, especially to try to spot risks related to large transactions, paperwork logs and cash shipments. Other big banks, such as Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. typically have surprise branch audits, or checks, at least once a year, said people familiar with the banks, who added that branches didn't get notice ahead of time.

"They need to audit business as usual, not to see somebody put on their Sunday best clothes," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, professor and associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of Management. "Mystery shoppers...don't give advance notice to the stores that they're coming."

Banks are expected to have three lines of defense to spot irregularities or problems: its business executives, risk-management professionals and internal auditors. The board of directors is supposed to add another layer for checks and balances. It appears some of these were lacking at Wells Fargo, according to regulators.

"Had these structure elements been functioning properly, they would have prevented the type of abuses we have witnessed at Wells Fargo," Thomas Curry, head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said at one of two congressional hearings about the bank's sales practices.

At Wells Fargo, retail-bank risk executives some branch employees called them auditors typically traveled district by district to check on branches, some current and former employees said. But retail-bank executives would usually receive anywhere from 24 to 72 hours' notice of the inspections, and branch managers typically got one day's heads up, these people said.

Some of those bank managers would meet with operations staff in their districts to discuss issues auditors were finding so they could fix those in advance of another audit, one of these people said.

Internally, the advance notice known to some within the bank as an open-book test was considered standard, these people said. Only in recent years did much of the operational-control checks move to electronic forms auditors would gather in advance, making it harder for branch employees to fake records.

The inspectors would examine, for instance, how many accounts were funded, whether signature cards existed for accounts opened in the last 90 days, and if employees knew the opening and closing procedures of the branch, among other checks, these people said.

"The volume of business you did was humongous, so the dotting of Is and the crossing of Ts was not that great," one of these people said. "Growing the business was primary: the more successful you were, the higher the goals were. So you had to keep up."

WSJ Pro: Ex-SEC Chief Thinks She Could Have Accomplished Much More

By Dave Michaels

SAN DIEGO Speaking publicly for the first time since she left the Securities and Exchange Commission, former chairman Mary Jo White on Monday said postelection politics prevented her from finishing several regulations that were drafted and ready to advance.

Ms. White, whose tenure ended on Friday, said she couldn't muster a commitment from other commissioners to vote on rules governing derivatives trading and electronic delivery of mutual-fund shareholder reports.

SEC rules require that at least three of its sitting commissioners be present for the commission to vote on new regulations effectively granting dissenting commissioners veto power over any measure they oppose when the SEC has two open seats on its five-member board. By simply not showing up to a vote, a dissenting commissioner can block the SEC from acting altogether.

Ms. White, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, didn't name the commissioners who objected to moving forward on particular rules. But she evinced frustration with her inability to corral enough votes to finish items that were high on her priority list.

"Several were ripe for final commission action last year, but were stalled by the postelection absence of a quorum to act," Ms. White told Northwestern University's Securities Regulation Institute in Coronado, Calif.

Ms. White said some rules could advance under her anointed successor corporate attorney Jay Clayton of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP but she acknowledged that others are unlikely to move forward because Republicans oppose them. The list of endangered regulatory proposals includes measures required by the 2010 Dodd Frank Act, such as rules to oversee trading platforms for security-based swaps and new executive-compensation disclosures.

"It remains to be seen what the new Commission may do with these initiatives, and when," she said.

Ms. White said she expects the SEC will in the future continue her focus on revising corporate disclosures, with an eye toward reducing duplication and complexity. She said regulators also would likely expand their oversight of the bond market and high-speed traders. The SEC under Ms. White proposed requiring all active proprietary traders to register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. It also sought to have Finra establish a repository for trades in U.S. Treasurys.

WSJ Pro: Republicans on House Financial Services Huddle at Agenda Retreat

By Gabriel T. Rubin

Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee huddled at a resort outside of Washington on Sunday and Monday to strategize about top priorities for the new Congress.

The meeting, which took place at the Gaylord National Resort in Maryland, focused on the top agenda items of the panel's chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, and other senior committee members, chief among them being a rollback of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Their agenda focused on the "big priorities for the year: Choice Act, flood insurance and housing finance," a congressional aide said, referring to Mr. Hensarling's bill that would provide regulatory relief to banks that hold more capital, among other changes.

Subcommittee chairmen, several of whom are new to their positions, also made presentations at the retreat, which was held in private.

Congressional Republicans will meet in Philadelphia later this week at a corporate-backed policy retreat to address overall priorities for the Congress, which besides a financial regulatory overhaul include replacing the Affordable Care Act and making changes to the corporate tax code.

The committee is expected to move forward with the Choice Act sometime next month. The bill, initially introduced in the last Congress, will be revamped slightly to account for new political realities, including Donald Trump taking office as president last week.

Still, it is unclear how far the legislation can go given the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.

"We doubt the bill can pass the Senate and testimony last week by Treasury Secretary-designate [Steven] Mnuchin casts a lot of doubt on whether the Trump administration will spend political capital trying to pass the Choice Act in the Senate," said Brian Gardner, an analyst for the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Fugitive in Credit-Card Case Who Fled to Pakistan Is Arrested

By Kate King

Federal authorities have arrested a fugitive who fled to Pakistan after he was indicted four years ago in a $200 million credit-card-fraud scam, the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey said Monday.

Habib Chaudhry, 49, has been living in Pakistan but decided to return to the U.S. and turn himself in to federal officials, according to Jerome Ballarotto, who was appointed by the court Monday to serve as Mr. Chaudhry's attorney.

"It's not easy, living in the world today with something like this hanging over your head," Mr. Ballarotto said. "It's not like the old days when you could just disappear. He decided he didn't want to live that way, so he came here to clear things up."

Federal officials charged Mr. Chaudhry in February 2013 with participating in an effort to create 7,000 false identities and open thousands of credit cards, which were then used to charge hundreds of millions of dollars. Nineteen people have pleaded guilty in connection with the fraud case and two remain at large, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

Mr. Chaudhry, who is an American citizen, appeared in federal court in Newark, N.J., on Monday but didn't enter a plea. He was released on a $250,000 bail secured by the deed to a house he and his wife own in Valley Stream, N.Y. He surrendered his passport and will live under house arrest and wear an electronic monitor, his lawyer said.

Federal officials said the credit-card fraud was one of the largest ever prosecuted by the Justice Department. The 2013 criminal complaint outlines a 10-year scheme, spanning eight countries and 28 states, which involved creating fake identities and sham companies to open credit cards and process transactions. Federal officials accused Mr. Chaudhry and others of using the proceeds to buy luxury cars, electronics, spa treatments, clothing and gold.

Yahoo Among Many Disclosing Data Breaches to SEC

By Vipal Monga

Yahoo is part of a growing list of companies disclosing past data breaches to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as hackers become more successful in penetrating company firewalls to steal sensitive data.

The internet company reported in September that hackers had stolen data from 500 million users in 2014, making it the 102nd company to disclose such a theft to the SEC, according to data from Audit Analytics. Overall, 17 companies reported breaches to the regulator last year, down from 18 in 2015 and 34 in 2014.

Yahoo also disclosed in December a second breach that occurred in 2013.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the SEC has opened an investigation into whether Yahoo should have reported the data theft to investors earlier. The SEC requires companies to disclose cybersecurity risks as as soon as they are determined to have a material effect on their businesses.

But, as CFO Journal reported in September, company executives must exercise judgement when deciding whether any hacking is material. Many hesitate to do so, because offering too much or too little information to investors can hurt companies.

On the one hand, investors may feel management or boards tried to hide a problem or failed to disclose a breach in a timely way. On the other, too much disclosure could cause investors to bid down a company's stock price, even if a later investigation reveals little impact on the business, according to experts.

The SEC has yet to bring a case against any company that failed to disclose a breach. At a conference last February, Stephanie Avakian, the SEC's deputy director of enforcement, said the disclosure failure would need to be "significant" to warrant such a move.

Poland's Pitch to Brexit Bankers: You Might as Well Move Somewhere Cheap

By Max Colchester

When the U.K. quits the European Union, many banks will shuffle operations to Paris or Frankfurt. But London-on-Seine or London-on-Main might not be as compelling as London-on-Oder.

Wroclaw, Poland, is one of a clutch of cities in the Eastern European country wooing big banks' business. The pitch: If you're going to move a bunch of stuff, you might as well go somewhere cheap.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executives recently visited Wroclaw to scope it out; the giant U.S. bank is weighing hiring roughly 2,000 people in Poland, according to people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse Group AG already has 4,000 staff in Wroclaw, a medieval city with a picturesque market square. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. has about 1,000.

New York, London, Paris and Frankfurt will still be the locales of choice for fancy bankers who pitch megaclients. But banks have tens of thousands of operational and support roles. Bank executives say Brexit will accelerate a well-establish trend to move them to lower-cost locations.

"Brexit will encourage people to look at outsourcing simply because there is more pressure on costs," says Isabelle Jenkins, a partner at consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

Poland which is in the EU is marketing itself as an inexpensive place for profit-strapped banks to put their European back-office workers. Even before Brexit, Credit Suisse, BNY Mellon and UBS Group AG were expanding their operations in the country. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is doubling staff numbers this year and eyeing Poland as a potential hub to service its enlarged EU operations after Brexit, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan said its review "has nothing to do with London jobs or Brexit."

The Association of Business Leaders in Poland estimates up to 20,000 financial-services-related jobs could be created in the country this year alone. As Brexit unfolds, more roles will come, says Polish Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. "We are now seeing a definite interest by some of these and other financial institutions in relocating all or part of their European head-office activities to Poland," he says.

Last November Mr. Morawiecki, a former banker, traveled to London to make his pitch. Polish cities offer a different draw from Paris or Frankfurt: a cheap, educated European workforce that can process transactions and help manage functions like human resources.

Razor-thin margins were pushing Europe-based banks to move jobs out of London well before Brexit. Credit Suisse, for instance, said it is aiming to reduce head count in London to 5,000 by the end of 2017 from 9,000 in 2016. The bank's website currently advertises for 250 jobs in Poland, compared with just 37 in the U.K.

Now finance companies in the U.K. are again combing through their businesses to work out what needs to be shifted where to ensure they can continue selling to EU-based clients. If they are forced to spend heavily to recreate subsidiaries in the European Union to service clients, then costs may have to be cut elsewhere.

Poland isn't alone in trying to lure operational roles. Ireland and several other Eastern European countries are making similar pitches. Poland also has its drawbacks. EU authorities have criticized its conservative government for cracking down on judicial and press freedoms. The country's leader is a euroskeptic. Mr. Morawiecki, meanwhile, has led a campaign to "re-Polonize" the country's domestic financial sector, raising questions about how foreign businesses may be treated.

There are also practical considerations. The operations centers have to manage a high turnover of staff because employees regularly move looking for better pay. There are also some unpractical Polish labor laws including one that prevents pregnant women from sitting at computer screens for more than four hours.

Having a back-office in the country offers several advantages, bankers say. Poland offers a large and young workforce. State university tuition is free, so many have a higher education. The time zone and the fact it is in the EU's single market mean that it is easy for managers to visit from other European hubs without facing visa issues. Currently 212,000 people work in service centers in Poland, with the majority in financial services, according to the Polish business association.

Other Polish cities are also capitalizing. Credit Suisse last year opened a new office in Warsaw. Goldman Sachs recently moved into a skyscraper in the capital and took an option to extend office space for an extra 750 people.

U.K. Supreme Court Rules Theresa May Must Consult Parliament Before Starting Brexit

By Jenny Gross

LONDON Britain's Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled Prime Minister Theresa May can't start the Brexit process without approval from Parliament, a decision that could potentially complicate her path toward a clear break from the European Union.

The government said the ruling wouldn't affect Mrs. May's plans to trigger talks to leave the EU by the end of March and the opposition Labour Party said after the judgment it wouldn't seek to stop Brexit from happening.

But Labour said it would try to amend any bill introduced by Mrs. May to kick off the Brexit process, possibly influencing how the U.K.'s new relationship with the EU will look.

While a majority of lawmakers voted to stay in the EU, many have said they won't seek to block Article 50, which formally starts Britain's exit from the EU, given the popular vote, in which 52% voted to leave.

"The British people voted to leave the EU, and the government will deliver on their verdict triggering Article 50, as planned, by the end of March," a U.K. government spokesman said. "Today's ruling does nothing to change that."

Eight justices voted against the government and three voted in favor of it, in a decision that was widely expected.

Lord David Neuberger said any change in the law to put Brexit into effect must be made by an act of Parliament. "To proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries," he said.

He said the Supreme Court justices were ruling on the process of legally bringing the result into effect, and that the ruling had nothing to do with whether the U.K. should exit from the EU or the timetable.

The case has been one of the most politically charged in decades. After the High Court ruled against the government in November, pro-Brexit activists called the decision an attempt to overturn the will of Britons who chose to break away from the bloc in a June referendum. The Daily Mail newspaper said the three High Court judges who ruled on the case were "enemies of the people."

But the landscape has shifted since then. In December, Mrs. May won lawmakers' backing to trigger the start of Brexit by the end of March after promising to give Parliament, the majority of whom backed staying in the EU, an opportunity to scrutinize her plan first.

Mrs. May has outlined a plan for a definitive break from the EU, saying she intends to take the country out of the EU's single market for goods and services. Leaving the single market will create uncertainties for U.K. businesses that rely on trade with Europe, particularly financial markets, auto makers and aerospace.

Asked in an interview with a German newspaper this month whether the U.K. was seeking to become a tax haven with low levels of corporate tax, U.K. Treasury Chief Philip Hammond said the U.K. could change its economic model if it isn't granted access to trade in the EU after it leaves the bloc.

Jeremy Corbyn, Labour leader, said in a statement after the ruling that Labour "will not frustrate" the process for trigger the U.K.'s exit.

"However, Labour will seek to amend the Article 50 bill to prevent the Conservatives using Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven off the coast of Europe," Mr. Corbyn said. "Labour will seek to build in the principles of full, tariff-free access to the single market and maintenance of workers' rights and social and environmental protections."

He added that the party would demand that the U.K. government lays out a plan for negotiations so parliamentarians could hold it to account.

Kelvin Hopkins, a Labour member of Parliament, urged his party not to seek to complicate the process of leaving.

"My colleagues in the House of Commons need to realize that if we are seen to frustrate the will of the British people, by opposing or delaying Brexit we could find ourselves in a position where we will never see a Labour government again," Mr. Hopkins said in a statement.

Over four days of hearings before the Supreme Court last month, the government said it had the right to trigger Brexit because of the so-called royal prerogative, in which executive authority is given to ministers so they can govern on the monarch's behalf.

The case was brought by a group of British citizens opposed to Brexit with the help of some of the U.K.'s top constitutional lawyers.

Spearheading the legal challenge were British businesswoman Gina Miller and hairdresser Deir Dos Santos. Grahame Pigney, a France-based expatriate who used crowdfunding from more than 4,000 people to pay for lawyers, joined the suit as a co-party.

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

White Sees Corporate Disclosure as SEC Priority

Mary Jo White, who stepped down as SEC chairman Friday, predicts changes to corporate disclosures will be on her successor's front burner. White says the SEC would likely seek public comment on how it should update the statistical disclosures required by bank holding companies. Other changes will probably have to wait for the SEC to be back to full strength with five commissioners, she says. Those measures could include further relief for smaller companies seeking to raise money from private investors, she says. "I would expect the next commission to do so, looking for ways to provide flexibility where appropriate to facilitate the ability of private markets to provide liquidity to small companies to grow and to adjust the incentives for companies to go public and remain public," she tells the Securities Regulation Institute sponsored by Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law.

Bailout Prevention Rule Publishing Despite Trump Freeze

The Federal Reserve's "total loss-absorbing capacity" rule designed to prevent bailouts of big banks is set to be published in the Federal Register Tuesday, according to the register's website. President Donald Trump's chief of staff had issued a moratorium on new regulations Friday, asking executive agencies to withdraw any rules that had been submitted for official publication. The Fed board had voted to adopt the so-called TLAC rule on December 15. It is not clear whether the Fed and other regulators will be following the White House regulatory freeze going forward. Financial regulators are generally considered independent of the White House, although they may choose to follow the order so as to comply with its spirit. (Ryan.Tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

State AGs Support CFPB in Lawsuit Vs PHH

Democratic state attorneys general from 16 states and Washington DC came to the aid of the CFPB in a high-profile lawsuit, in which a panel of judges last year declared the CFPB's single-director structure unconstitutional and granted the president power to fire the CFPB chief at will. In a motion filed with the federal appeals court in Washington, the AGs asked for permission to intervene in the case, PHH v. CFPB, to support the CFPB's ongoing appeal process, saying that the bureau's interest may not be represented adequately under the new administration. After the earlier ruling, the CFPB has requested a rehearing of the case. "The current ruling, if permitted to stand, will undermine the power of the State Attorneys General to effectively protect consumers against abuse in the consumer finance industry," wrote the AGs. The move comes as Congressional Republicans seek the removal of CFPB Director Richard Cordray by President Donald Trump. (yuka.hayashi@wsj.com; @TokyoWoods)

Increased Competition Boosts Bank Risk

Competitive pressures facing individual banks can materially boost bank risk, "http://papers.nber.org/tmp/64653-w23080.pdf"from the National Bureau of Economic Research. Economists disagree about whether competition raises or decreases bank risk, and the trade-off between bank competition and risk tends to get less attention from policy makers than the trade-off between competition and stability, the paper says. The researchers employ a new approach for identifying changes in competitive pressures facing individual U.S. banks in the 1980s and 1990s, and find that competition "reduces bank profits, charter values, and relationship lending and increases banks' provision of nontraditional banking services," they write.

Trump Economic Team's Wall Street Tint

President Donald Trump's nominees and appointees for economic posts are reflective of the financialization of the U.S. economy, "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/19/trump-is-putting-the-wolves-of-wall-street-in-charge-of-americas-economy/?utm_term=.73004ed0296a". Financiers who earn their fortunes from a focus on maximizing shareholder returns through "clever feats of financial engineering" have little in common with "small-business owners trying to create and protect a market niche from the predations of corporate giants, or the high-tech entrepreneurs desperate for engineering talent and second-stage funding or the community banker in Dubuque."

When Is a Judge Not Really a Judge?

Writing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/when-is-a-judge-not-really-a-judge-1485215998" argue the increased use of administrative law judges at Securities and Exchange Commission in enforcement cases has led to an unfortunate legal holding that could curtail their use.

"The immediate problem for the SEC is that Congress hasn't authorized the appointment of administrative law judges through the constitutional process. So the agency faces the risk, in cases it tries in-house, that its decisions will be voided," the two write. "If the 10th Circuit's decision is upheld, this will almost certainly be the next shoe to drop, and it will leave administrative law judges subject to political control."

At Washington March, Not Much Wall Street Rhetoric

On Saturday, I brought my notepad to the National Mall as one several Wall Street Journal reporters monitoring the throngs "http://www.wsj.com/articles/demonstrators-gather-for-womens-march-a-day-after-trump-inauguration-1485006572" the day after Inauguration Day. What I saw reminded me of the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203735304577167214156233978", in that the crowd represented a litany of different people advocating for litany of different causes.

One "Occupy" element that was missing: Very few people were ranting about Wall Street.

The marchers showed up to advocate for women and to show their displeasure with the election results. It was no surprise to see signs demanding equal pay and abortion rights alongside jabs at President Donald Trump.

Chants, flyers and posters also addressed many other issues, including immigration, climate change, the minimum wage, Obamacare, the Patriot Act, socialism, racism, gay rights and public education. In five hours, I saw one sign about financial regulation, about halfway through: "Regulate Banks, Not Bodies!"

It would be a leap to conclude the public is no longer angry at Wall Street. I suspect many marchers still harbor negative views of the financial industry, a premise confirmed anecdotally when I walked past Bank of America Corp.'s branch across from the Treasury Department and heard a handful of young men shouting their opinions of the firm. Suffice it to say it's not appropriate to repeat them here.

Recent polling by "http://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/161300NBCWSJDecember216PollFinal1.pdf", as well as Gallup, suggests hating Wall Street has fallen out of favor somewhat, with banking and finance receiving substantially higher marks from the public at the end of 2016 than around 2010, the last time there was substantial shift in Washington's orientation toward the industry.

Perhaps that helps explain why Mr. Trump has felt free to do what was unthinkable only months ago, and appoint several Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni to key administration posts. If memories of the crisis weren't fading, it would be hard to imagine someone like Steven Mnuchin, the Goldman veteran turned leader of a bank that critics called a "foreclosure machine," sailing to confirmation as Treasury secretary, as Mr. Mnuchin appears to be doing.

How big banks fare in the Trump era remains to be seen, and surely the industry is wary of the fact that populism appears to be a powerful political force. Mr. Trump won't want to be painted as a puppet of Wall Street power, and lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) won't shy away from branding him that way if they see what they perceive as lax regulatory policies.

What the march suggests is that for now, other perceived evils have the public's attention.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

CFPB Chief Presses On With Regulatory Agenda

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-chief-presses-on-with-regulatory-agenda-1485253801" of the Trump administration, Richard Cordray, the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, made his presence known by alleging that Citigroup Inc.'s mortgage-servicing units mistreated struggling borrowers.

Monday's settlement with Citigroup the bureau's 15th enforcement action in the past two months underscores Mr. Cordray's intention to keep pursuing a busy regulatory agenda, unfazed by the intensifying heat from the Republican administration to rein in his agency and remove him from its helm.

Mr. Cordray will discuss his stance at a "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/livevideo/cordray-0124"Tuesday morning, his first public appearance since Friday's inauguration.

Former SEC Enforcement Chief Ceresney to Return to Private Practice

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-sec-enforcement-chief-andrew-ceresney-to-return-to-private-practice-1485253803", a top white-collar lawyer who led the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division for the past three years, is returning to his former legal home at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP.

Mr. Ceresney, 45 years old, will resume a practice he handled for Debevoise before becoming Wall Street's top civil enforcer. He returns with an added rank, joining as co-chair of the firm's litigation practice, a title once held by his mentor, former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White. Ms. White, who took over the SEC in 2013 and stepped down Friday at the end of Barack Obama's presidency, brought Mr. Ceresney with her as enforcement director.

Treasury Nominee Steven Mnuchin Says Bank Regulation Should Be Tailored to Activity

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-nominee-steven-mnuchin-says-bank-regulation-should-be-tailored-to-activity-1485258397" said banks should be regulated based on their "complexity and activity, not simply size" and addressed other regulatory issues in written answers submitted to members of the Senate Finance Committee after his confirmation hearing last week.

"I believe in a regulatory framework that is determined by complexity and activity, not simply size," he wrote, addressing a question about the $50 billion asset threshold at which banks face tougher regulation under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Many lawmakers and regulators want to change the line.

At Wells Fargo, Bank Branches Were Tipped Off to Inspections

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-wells-fargo-bank-branches-were-tipped-off-to-inspections-1485253800", investors, regulators and politicians asked how improper practices could have persisted for so long. One possible reason: bank branches were given a heads up before Wells Fargo's internal monitors landed for inspections.

Managers and employees at the bank's roughly 6,000 branches across the U.S. typically had at least 24 hours' warning about annual reviews conducted by risk employees, current and former Wells Fargo employees and executives said. That gave many employees time to cover up improper practices, such as opening accounts or signing customers up for products without their knowledge.

WSJ Pro: Ex-SEC Chief Thinks She Could Have Accomplished Much More

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-sec-chief-thinks-she-could-have-accomplished-so-much-more-1485216685" since she left the Securities and Exchange Commission, former chairman Mary Jo White on Monday said postelection politics prevented her from finishing several regulations that were drafted and ready to advance.

Ms. White, whose tenure ended on Friday, said she couldn't muster a commitment from other commissioners to vote on rules governing derivatives trading and electronic delivery of mutual-fund shareholder reports.

WSJ Pro: Republicans on House Financial Services Huddle at Agenda Retreat

The meeting, which took place at the Gaylord National Resort in Maryland, focused on the top agenda items of the panel's chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, and other senior committee members, chief among them being a rollback of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Fugitive in Credit-Card Case Who Fled to Pakistan Is Arrested

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fugitive-in-credit-card-case-who-fled-to-pakistan-arrested-1485213045" a fugitive who fled to Pakistan after he was indicted four years ago in a $200 million credit-card-fraud scam, the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey said Monday.

Habib Chaudhry, 49, has been living in Pakistan but decided to return to the U.S. and turn himself in to federal officials, according to Jerome Ballarotto, who was appointed by the court Monday to serve as Mr. Chaudhry's attorney. "It's not easy, living in the world today with something like this hanging over your head," Mr. Ballarotto said. "It's not like the old days when you could just disappear. He decided he didn't want to live that way, so he came here to clear things up."

The internet company reported in September that hackers had stolen data from 500 million users in 2014, making it the 102nd company to disclose such a theft to the SEC, according to data from Audit Analytics. Overall, 17 companies reported breaches to the regulator last year, down from 18 in 2015 and 34 in 2014.

Poland's Pitch to Brexit Bankers: You Might as Well Move Somewhere Cheap

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/polands-pitch-to-brexit-bankers-you-might-as-well-move-somewhere-cheap-1485253805", many banks will shuffle operations to Paris or Frankfurt. But London-on-Seine or London-on-Main might not be as compelling as London-on-Oder.

Wroclaw, Poland, is one of a clutch of cities in the Eastern European country wooing big banks' business. The pitch: If you're going to move a bunch of stuff, you might as well go somewhere cheap. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executives recently visited Wroclaw to scope it out; the giant U.S. bank is weighing hiring roughly 2,000 people in Poland, according to people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse Group AG already has 4,000 staff in Wroclaw, a medieval city with a picturesque market square. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. has about 1,000.

U.K. Supreme Court Rules Theresa May Must Consult Parliament Before Starting Brexit

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-supreme-court-rules-theresa-may-must-consult-parliament-before-starting-brexit-1485251024" Prime Minister Theresa May can't start the Brexit process without approval from Parliament, a decision that could potentially complicate her path toward a clear break from the European Union.

The government said the ruling wouldn't affect Mrs. May's plans to trigger talks to leave the EU by the end of March and the opposition Labour Party said after the judgment it wouldn't seek to stop Brexit from happening.

Money-Fund Overhaul Gives Federal Home Loan Banks New Prominence

Money funds that invest in government debt are fueling a rise in debt issuance by the FHLBs, independently chartered financial institutions created by Congress 80 years ago to bolster U.S. housing finance. The increase is a boon to FHLB member banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., which borrow from the FHLBs for a range of needs including to fund mortgage lending, and is the latest ripple from a series of regulatory changes at the heart of financial markets.

Increased Competition Boosts Bank Risk

Competitive pressures facing individual banks can materially boost bank risk, "http://papers.nber.org/tmp/64653-w23080.pdf"from the National Bureau of Economic Research. Economists disagree about whether competition raises or decreases bank risk, and the trade-off between bank competition and risk tends to get less attention from policy makers than the trade-off between competition and stability, the paper says. The researchers employ a new approach for identifying changes in competitive pressures facing individual U.S. banks in the 1980s and 1990s, and find that competition "reduces bank profits, charter values, and relationship lending and increases banks' provision of nontraditional banking services," they write.

Trump Economic Team's Wall Street Tint

President Donald Trump's nominees and appointees for economic posts are reflective of the financialization of the U.S. economy, "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/19/trump-is-putting-the-wolves-of-wall-street-in-charge-of-americas-economy/?utm_term=.73004ed0296a". Financiers who earn their fortunes from a focus on maximizing shareholder returns through "clever feats of financial engineering" have little in common with "small-business owners trying to create and protect a market niche from the predations of corporate giants, or the high-tech entrepreneurs desperate for engineering talent and second-stage funding or the community banker in Dubuque."

When Is a Judge Not Really a Judge?

Writing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/when-is-a-judge-not-really-a-judge-1485215998" argue the increased use of administrative law judges at Securities and Exchange Commission in enforcement cases has led to an unfortunate legal holding that could curtail their use.

"The immediate problem for the SEC is that Congress hasn't authorized the appointment of administrative law judges through the constitutional process. So the agency faces the risk, in cases it tries in-house, that its decisions will be voided," the two write. "If the 10th Circuit's decision is upheld, this will almost certainly be the next shoe to drop, and it will leave administrative law judges subject to political control."

Sterling Partners Backs Amerigo Education; Deal marks the firm's third investment from its $200 million Education Opportunity Fund

Sterling Partners said it invested in Amerigo Education, a company that provides academic programs to international students enrolled in American private high schools.

Amerigo offers services including English language training, cultural exposure and college preparatory education to students living in dormitory-style communities. Private schools that use Amerigo's services include Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, Ill., and Lexington Catholic High School in Lexington, Ky., according to a news release.

Sterling started the business about nine months ago and has backed the company from its Education Opportunity Fund, said Jason Rosenberg, a managing director of the fund.

The firm in 2015 launched the $200 million education vehicle with USA Funds Inc., a nonprofit that prepares students for and helps them complete postsecondary education opportunities.

"Amerigo incubated within the fund," Mr. Rosenberg said. "We don't do this very often. We mostly invest in existing businesses, and we will from time to time start a business."

Mr. Rosenberg said the fund has set aside a "significant" amount of capital to invest in Amerigo. The firm didn't disclose the amount of its initial investment in the Chicago business.

The deal marks Sterling's third investment from the pool, which invests $10 million to $25 million per platform in growth-stage education companies, according to the release.

The Education Opportunity Fund currently has two other portfolio companies: Panopto, a software company with a video platform used for recording and live streaming in academic and business settings; and the National Research Center for College & University Admissions, a data and analytics provider for colleges and universities.

Investors Curb Their Enthusiasm --- Market sentiment shifts from just after U.S. election; bets against equities grow

Investors are turning more cautious as President Donald Trump takes office, a shift from the early days after his victory when stocks surged on the hopes that his policies would accelerate growth.

The S&P 500 is still up 6.2% since Election Day, and it hasn't fallen by 1% or more in 69 trading sessions. But investors also are positioning themselves more defensively by increasing cash or hedging against a potential resurgence in volatility.

Global fund managers increased their cash holdings to 5.1% of their portfolios this month from 4.8% in December, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey released Jan. 17, well above the 10-year average of 4.5%. A U.S. trade war and devaluation of China's currency were cited as among the biggest fears, the survey showed.

Other investors are even more wary, ramping up bets against equities in the week ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration.

Short interest, or bearish bets, on the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund, the largest ETF tracking the benchmark, rose to $32.9 billion on Jan. 19 from $30.8 billion a week earlier -- a reversal from the trend in the two months after the election, according to S3 Partners, a financial-analytics firm.

Last week, financial shares, which burst ahead after Mr. Trump's election, led the market's retreat -- evidence that investors are losing conviction in some postelection trades. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index slid 2.8% in the five days through Friday. Investors pulled $749 million from the global financial sector for the week through Wednesday, the first outflows in 17 weeks, EPFR Global data show.

The recalibration, investors and analysts say, doesn't reflect a broad-based retreat from the initial enthusiasm for the U.S.'s economic prospects.

Rather, investors are moderating their conviction, they say, as they wait to see what unfolds with Mr. Trump in office and with business more broadly. They also are factoring in general anxiety about how politics will play out this year in the U.S. and world-wide.

On Inauguration Day Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose in early trade, pared its gains during Mr. Trump's speech and rallied to end up nearly 100 points, putting its year-to-date gains at 0.3%.

Mr. Trump "has not been a career politician and is a lot more unpredictable in his policies and in his views," said Sebastien Page, head of asset allocation at T. Rowe Price Group Inc. "For example, his tweets," he said. "All of this increases the political risk."

Mr. Trump's election, along with the market shock of Brexit last year and coming European elections, suggest financial markets are transitioning into a period in which political risks appear to supersede other perils, investors say.

It is a switch, they say, from the years following the 2008 financial crisis when central-bank actions dominated the course of markets.

"The influence of the Federal Reserve on markets is probably less significant than it was over the past several years," said Michael Fredericks, portfolio manager of BlackRock Inc.'s multiasset income fund. "We can expect that Trump will implement very different policies than under Obama. That policy is probably a big driver of volatility and uncertainty in the equity markets."

Among the political risks are more protectionist trade policies under Mr. Trump. Investors also expect fiscal stimulus and tax cuts, which could take time to implement.

Following Britain's decision to exit from the European Union, questions remain about elections in France and Germany and the extent to which populist forces are sweeping through Europe.

Asset managers such as BlackRock and T. Rowe Price are using options strategies such as covered calls, which involve selling a call option while buying the underlying security or index.

Some investors say it is a strategy that can generate extra income in a flat to mildly bullish market.

Anxiety over outsize swings in the stock market also has crept up. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near multiyear lows, but a measure that tracks expectations for wild swings in the fear gauge -- the CBOE VVIX Index -- has climbed to near its highest since 2006 relative to the VIX, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch show. The VIX has posted a steeper decline than the VVIX in 2017.

History suggests caution when a new president takes office.

In the month after a president is sworn in, the median change in the S&P 500 has been a decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke Investment Group data going back to 1928. When a Republican president succeeded an outgoing Democrat, the decline was more pronounced, with a median drop of 2.6%.

All this uncertainty prompted Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, to cut equity exposure and add cash near the end of 2016.

"The market's getting ahead of itself," said Mr. Pavlik, who manages the firm's large-cap growth strategy fund. If Mr. Trump's administration is able to push through key agenda items and stocks rally, "folks like me will have to be drawn back in. But I think the risks of having a bit of extra cash right now are relatively low."

Martin's Take: Is AI Investment Overblown? If so, there's an obvious consolation prize for the losers

Artificial intelligence has been all the rage for the past few years, but the question is whether it has also been overhyped as the next big thing.

Investment in private companies working on AI has rocketed. In the past year, U.S. venture-capital investment in AI-related startups more than doubled to $1.7 billion from 2015. The surge of investments on a year-over-year basis comes as funding to startups across the board fell 32% in the same period. The AI stakes suggest heavy competition for a somewhat undefined market.

Startups talk up a good game on AI. Often industry buzzwords such as machine learning, neural networks, deep learning and predictive analytics get played up as if those things alone are magical answers. What's light in the discussions is novel uses that make you say, "Wow."

"My hypothesis is that the only thing that matters is the use case. So if they use an industry term in lieu of telling you about their use case, it's bullshit," said Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners.

AI has grown competitive beyond startups. It has become the mantra du jour for the likes of Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Apple. The R&D budgets of these tech giants suggests this won't be an easy slog for startups, which often stake out developments in nascent areas of tech in efforts to upend lumbering corporate behemoths. This time, it's clear they don't have the field to themselves.

To be sure, there's hope that it's still early days in AI, as many entrepreneurs say. On the consumer side, Apple's Siri has proven it is more of a marketing stunt than an actually useful assistant. And If Amazon's Alexa assistant is all we can really collectively embrace, then maybe it truly is early days.

There is an obvious consolation prize for AI startups that fail: corporate giants, facing an AI talent dearth, will be on the sidelines waiting to gobble them up.

Mr. Trump "has not been a career politician and is a lot more unpredictable in his policies and in his views," said Sebastien Page, head of asset allocation at T. Rowe Price Group Inc. "For example, his tweets," he said. "All of this increases the political risk."

Mr. Trump's election, along with the market shock of Brexit last year and upcoming European elections, suggest financial markets are transitioning into a period in which political risks appear to supersede other perils, investors say. It is a switch, they say, from the years following the 2008 financial crisis when central bank actions dominated the course of markets.

"The influence of the Federal Reserve on markets is probably less significant than it was over the past several years," said Michael Fredericks, portfolio manager of BlackRock Inc.'s multiasset income fund. "We can expect that Trump will implement very different policies than under Obama. That policy is probably a big driver of volatility and uncertainty in the equity markets."

Among the political risks are more protectionist trade policies under Mr. Trump. Investors also expect fiscal stimulus and tax cuts, which could take time to implement. Following Britain's decision to exit from the European Union, questions remain about elections in France and Germany and the extent to which populist forces are sweeping through Europe.

Asset managers such as BlackRock and T. Rowe Price are using options strategies such as covered calls, which involve selling a call option while buying the underlying security or index. Some investors say it is a strategy that can generate income in a flat to mildly bullish market.

Anxiety over outsize swings in the stock market also has crept up. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near multiyear lows, but a measure that tracks expectations for wild swings in the so-called fear gauge -- the CBOE VVIX Index -- has climbed to near its highest since 2006 relative to the VIX, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch show. The VIX has posted a steeper decline than the VVIX in 2017.

History suggests caution when a new president takes office. In the month after a president is sworn in, the median change in the S&P 500 has been a decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke Investment Group data going back to 1928. When a Republican president succeeded an outgoing Democrat, the decline was more pronounced, with a median drop of 2.6%.

All this uncertainty prompted Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, to cut equity exposure near the end of 2016. "The market's getting ahead of itself," said Mr. Pavlik, who manages the firm's large-cap growth strategy fund. If Mr. Trump's administration is able to push through key agenda items and stocks rally, "folks like me will have to be drawn back in. But I think the risks of having a bit of extra cash right now are relatively low."

Markets
Investors Taper Bullish Bets, as Trump Takes Office; Investors increase cash holdings, turn defensive as a hedge against possible rise in volatility

Investors are turning more cautious as President Donald Trump takes office, a shift from the early days after his victory when stocks surged on the hopes that his policies would accelerate growth.

The S&P 500 is still up 6.2% since Election Day, and it hasn't fallen by 1% or more in 69 trading sessions. But investors also are positioning themselves more defensively by increasing cash or hedging against a potential resurgence in volatility.

Global fund managers increased their cash holdings to 5.1% of their portfolios this month, from 4.8% in December, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey released Jan. 17, well above the 10-year average of 4.5%. A U.S. trade war and devaluation of China's currency were cited as among the biggest fears, the survey showed.

Other investors are even more wary, ramping up bets against equities in the week ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration. Short interest, or bearish bets, on the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund, the largest ETF tracking the benchmark, rose to $32.9 billion on Jan. 19 from $30.8 billion a week earlier a reversal from the trend in the two months after the election, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

Last week, financial shares, which burst ahead after Mr. Trump's election, led the market's retreat evidence that investors are losing conviction in some postelection trades. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index slid 2.8% in the five days through Friday. Investors pulled $749 million from the global financial sector for the week through Wednesday, the first outflows in 17 weeks, EPFR Global data show.

The recalibration, investors and analysts say, doesn't reflect a broad-based retreat from the initial enthusiasm for the nation's economic prospects. Rather, investors are moderating their conviction, they say, as they wait to see what unfolds with Mr. Trump in office and with business more broadly. They also are factoring in general anxiety about how politics will play out this year in the U.S. and world-wide.

On Inauguration Day Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose in early trade, pared gains during Mr. Trump's speech and rallied to end up nearly 100 points, putting its year-to-date gains at 0.3%.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Technology and low returns: the end for active investing?

Charles D Ellis sees decades of decline for the traditional fund manager, to the point where actively managed funds are no longer beating the market - instead the market is beating them

Charles D Ellis's most recent book is The Index Revolution: Why Investors Should Join It , Wiley, 19.99/ebook 13.99)

Since index funds deliver the market rate of return through a widely diversified portfolio with no more than the market level of risk, the only justification for actively managed funds must either be more returns or less risk, or both - increasingly recognised as the investment world's version of the triumph of hope over experience.

During the 1960s and 1970s, most actively managed "performance" funds were able - more years than not, and almost always over longer periods - to produce superior returns. Clients loved them. And, as fees were raised, investment managers prospered. If nothing had changed, active investing would still be triumphantly successful.

But things have changed . New companies were created, prospered, and expanded rapidly. Established ones reorganised and then prospered too. Darwinian evolution drove inferior institutional managers out of the market and strong firms made themselves even stronger. As the competitive norm rose higher during the 1980s and 1990s, the capabilities required for even moderate success continued to rise. Today, actively managed funds are not beating the market. The market is beating them. And the long-term trend for active management is grim.

The distorted conventional data on the performance of active managers are now being corrected by adding back into the record the results of funds that, because they performed so poorly, had been closed or merged into other funds and then deleted from the records. This corrected data has important messages.

Actively deficient

Over 10 years, 83 per cent of active funds in the US fail to match their chosen benchmarks; 40 per cent stumble so badly that they are terminated before the 10-year period is completed and 64 per cent of funds drift away from their originally declared style of investing. These seriously disappointing records would not be at all acceptable if produced by any other industry. And while these are US statistics, since international institutions now dominate all stock markets, they are all moving in a similar direction.

The forces of change causing these shabby results for most active managers are numerous and undeniably powerful. Over 50 years, trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange has increased 500 times - from 3m shares a day to 1.5bn (while trading in derivatives has gone from zero to now exceed the stock market in value.) Investment research has increased substantially. Today's leading securities firms have as many as 300 company analysts, industry analysts, market analysts, commodities and foreign exchange experts, economists, demographers and political analysts located in offices in major cities all over the world. The number of chartered financial analysts is up from zero to 135,000, with another 200,000 studying for the exams.

Instant communication of all sorts of information via 320,000 Bloomberg terminals, the internet and blast faxes ensure that all investors worldwide have immediate, equal access to a global cornucopia of information, analysis and insight. With SEC Regulation FD (for fair disclosure), any investment information made available to any investor must be simultaneously made available to all investors. This eliminates what was once the "secret sauce" of active investors: getting "the first call".

The number of professionals engaged in price discovery has, over half a century, exploded from an estimated 5,000 to more than 1m.

Hedge funds, the most intensive and price-sensitive market participants, have proliferated and now execute nearly half of all buying and selling. Algorithmic trading, computer models, and early versions of artificial intelligence are all increasingly powerful factors.

As a result, institutional investors have collectively created a global expert information network that produces the world's largest, most effective prediction market.

The only way for active investors to outperform is to discover and exploit pricing errors by other expert professionals, all having the same information at the same time with the same computers and teams of experts having much the same talent and drive. The difficulty of sustaining a significant competitive advantage at price discovery continues to increase.

Standing out?

Curiously, the most powerful force for change has gone largely unnoticed. In the US, institutional trading has risen steadily over the same half century from a market share of 9 per cent to 20 per cent to 50 per cent to 80 per cent and now more than 95 per cent. And since most retail trading is informationless "noise", 95 per cent understates how intensively professionalised the stock market has become.

While institutional trading volumes may have advanced in an almost straight line, the difficulty of achieving superior performance when selling only to, or buying only from, near-equal competitors - all active participants in the same giant, swift global information network - has been accelerating. The difficulty of outperforming the expert pricing consensus - which is the market - has been accelerating up an exponential "power law" curve.

Like the Doppler effect of an approaching train's whistle, the impact of professionals increasingly trading only with other professionals - all nearly equally well armed and equally well-informed - has and will make it increasingly hard to outperform the market they collectively dominate as the corrected data on funds now shows.

Surely, some active managers with unusual skills or practices will continue to outperform somewhat, but they will not be competing directly with the many conventionally active managers. Nor will future "winners" be at all easy to identify in advance.

Now that most future "winners" will be easy to identify in advance if and when price volatility or a bull market in small company stocks or a bear market in large capitalisation stocks develops, we can be sure stories will appear claiming that "active is back", filled with admiring interviews of the new heroes of the sector. But most of that will be due to focusing on the lucky winners while ignoring the equally unlucky losers in the wide dispersion of results so predictably caused by the statistical "law of small numbers".

Even as evidence piles up that forceful changes are closing in and threaten to confound more and more active managers, most do not recognise the reality - or say they don't. But, as Winston Churchill once said: "We must look at the facts because the facts are looking at us." Like climate change and other complex systemic changes, the evidence needs careful analysis to separate long-term secular trends from medium-term cyclical fluctuations around those secular trends - and both of these from meaningless short-term, random statistical "noise".

Sorting out the profound from the probable - and both of these from the ephemeral - will be sufficiently difficult for most clients that clever sellers will be able to find and merchandise highly selective, semi-plausible supportive "evidence". We've seen this before in the way Big Tobacco cast doubt over the evidence that smoking causes cancer or the oil industry raised doubts about climate change.

The good old days

Active managers had their halcyon days in the 1960s, when they did less than 20 per cent of the trading in the US and were almost always competing at price discovery with amateur individual investors who bought or sold for reasons outside the market: to invest a bonus or inheritance, to raise money to buy a home or pay college fees for their children. With little or no research or investment expertise, individual investors averaged just one or two trades a year.

Back then, most institutional investors were conservative mutual funds or trust divisions of banks following the precepts of personal trust investing: blue-chip "dividend" stocks held over the long term to avoid taxes and bond portfolios with laddered maturities. They were not challenging competition. In those days, it was not unusual for active managers to beat the market by 200-300 basis points each year. Would investors mind paying 100 bps to get double or triple that much in higher returns? No!

But if stock market returns over the next several years average only 6-7 per cent and bond returns only 2-3 per cent (as the consensus expects) will investor clients still be happy to pay more than 100 bps in fees when most active managers underperform chosen benchmarks? Index funds repeatedly and predictably produce market-matching returns with no more than market-matching risk and charge less than 10bps. Will investors be willing to pay 90 to 120bps more to get active management that produces lower rates of return combined with more risk and uncertainty?

Before answering that central question, readers may want to consider four phases in the past half century of active investment management.

 " Phase one (1960-80): active managers compete principally against individuals and conservative mutual funds and trust institutions. Results: 200-300bps of superior performance.

 " Phase two (1980-00): active managers ride a strong bull market, which pleases clients, but can only achieve enough incremental performance to offset their costs and fees. Index funds get some attention.

 " Phase three (2000-10): active managers no longer earn back all costs and fees. Index funds experience increasing interest and demand.

 " Phase four (2010-17): increasing numbers of active managers - particularly larger firms that must invest in large capitalisation, widely owned stocks covered by many analysts and mostly correctly priced - underperform, with returns averaging 7 per cent. Observers conclude that fees and costs can no longer be dismissed as "inconsequential". Demand for low-cost indexing accelerates.

By phase four, clients learn that the key question is not "Can we find an investment firm of bright, hardworking, skilful managers who will work hard for us?" The obvious answer to that is yes. The correct question is: "Can we find significantly more skilful, harder-working, more creative active managers?" Alas, the answer to that for most investors is no.

Poor value

The fees conventionally described as "only 1 per cent" of assets are better seen for what they really are in a 7 per cent return market - 15 per cent of returns. Worse, try taking incremental fees as a percentage of incremental returns - both versus indexing. When you do, incremental fees for active investment management are now actually more than 100 per cent - a price-to-value ratio seldom seen.

Dismal reality will not confront all active managers equally nor simultaneously. Managers least at risk will be those delivering the best results or having the best client relationships or the least demanding clients. Also, managers with clearly differentiated capabilities in mathematics or clearly longer fundamental research time horizons will be under less pressure.

The greatest pressure will be on large, conventionally active managers of portfolios necessarily dominated by the same large stocks that are most widely owned and most carefully priced by the professional consensus. Meanwhile, the "vice of destiny" squeeze layer after layer of full-fee active managers.

Historically, most products and services that have commanded prices that produce unusually high profit margins in free, competitive markets have been unable to sustain their exceptional profitability. So far, active investing has been remarkably successful - for the active managers. But, the remarkable success of the business - as distinct from the profession - continues to attract more and better competitors, information and technologies. This makes superior returns ever harder to achieve. And, in a lower rate of return market, this problem is increasingly visible to growing numbers of clients.

As the negative evidence accumulates, and the forces driving active investing's underperformance are better understood, increasing numbers of clients will realise that in toe-to-toe competition versus near-equal competitors, most active managers will not and cannot recover the costs and fees they charge.

As indexing earns higher returns at lower cost and with less risk, active management will be taken down, firm by firm, from its once dominant position. The painful process will be seen in retrospect as the inevitable result of the increasingly visible impact of external and internal forces of change. As TS Eliot wrote in 1925: "This is the way the world ends - not with a bang but a whimper."

Technology Is Set to Help, and Hurt, Banks

Some banks may be turning big profits this quarter. But they will have to spend a lot of money in a gamble to stay profitable as technology encroaches, according to new set of studies.

McKinsey & Co., in a report this week, argues that up to $45 billion of bank profits could be wiped out by 2020 thanks to encroaching automation, ranging from electronic trading to mobile banking.

Fees charged for payments like checks and wires, wealth advisory and management, and consumer banking and lending could each drop by more than 10% in the U.S. in that time, and more than 20% in the U.K. and Japan, McKinsey says.

But new technology is also one way to avoid future profit collapses, another study said this week.

Accenture PLC, in a new report, estimates that banks could save $8 billion a year by using the shared databases known as blockchains, which were invented as a way to track ownership of bitcoin among a network of individual computers.

Accenture says the costs can come out of the $30 billion annually spent on trading data, trading compliance and operations.

McKinsey, in a study presented earlier in January to the U.S. Treasury, estimated that across all of financial services, using blockchain in its pure form could save as much as $110 billion annually globally, with half of that coming from the expense of cross-border money transfers.

The problem banks face is that they have to commit to spend money up front, against still-theoretical benefits. Already, banks will directly spend about $130 millionin 2016 on blockchain technology, McKinsey said. That could reach $400 millionin two years.

More broadly, the World Economic Forum, which sponsors this week's Davos meetings, said that banks are spending an average of $15 million a year on artificial intelligence -- more than double what the average company in other sectors does in a year, according to figures from Infosys, an outsourcing services firm.

The bottom line, according to McKinsey, is that banks will continue to struggle to cover their cost of capital, which is roughly 10%. McKinsey projects that year-end 2016 data released by global banks in coming weeks will show a return-on-equity similar to 2015, when it was 9.6%.

What that suggests is that despite banks' mostly increasing profits, they are still doing less with shareholders' money than they did in the past.

Finance looks to harness digital disruption; DAVOS; Banking: Technological upheaval

Wider automation is poised to deliver cost savings even as it threatens lenders' survival

When the chairman of one of the world's biggest banks was asked recently how technology would change finance, he pointed to the rise of Ant Financial, the digital payments arm of Alibaba, China's ecommerce colossus.

Ant Financial gained about 100m clients last year, taking its total above 500m, almost 10 times the level of the world's biggest banks. The veteran chairman, who was unwilling to be quoted by name, noted that the Chinese group had thereby acquired a "huge amount of data" and "a great ability to make credit decisions". The tone of jealousy was hard to miss.

Eric Jing , Ant Financial's chief executive, is due tomorrow to speak alongside other big financial names at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a first-time appearance that illustrates how finance is being upended by digital disruption.

It is a transformation, leading professionals attending Davos have said, that is likely to lead to widespread automation, a blur in the dividing line between finance and technology and, ultimately, widespread sectorial consolidation.

Many expect hundreds of thousands of jobs to be lost and the likes of Ant Financial to make incursions on banks' most valuable businesses, as the old financial order battles to survive.

"I think employment in finance will decrease and those working in the industry will be doing very different kinds of jobs," said Ralph Hamers, chief executive of ING, who in the past few months has announced plans to shed 7,000 of the Dutch bank's 54,000 staff.

Overall, as many as 1.7m jobs are expected to be lost as banks digitise operations over the next decade, Citigroup predicted recently.

This focus on technology's potential to replace human workers in the finance sector, much as robots have taken the place of factory workers for decades, is part of the backdrop to this year's Davos gathering, amid a continuing international backlash against globalisation in the name of those left behind.

While last year the agenda celebrated what the forum dubbed "the fourth industrial revolution" - a fusion of technologies "disrupting almost every industry in every country" - this year enthusiasm for such advances is tempered with more discussion of their social cost.

But, for banks dogged by low margins, automation and technology represent a long-desired chance to boost profitability, even if in the longer term they pose a near-existential threat to the banks' old way of business. This is particularly significant for European banks, whose average return on equity is stuck in the low single digits, far below their 10 per cent-plus cost of capital.

As a result, many institutions are racing to combine new technologies, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and voice recognition, to help provide financial services.

"Because of computing power available, we can have more useful predictions on default rates than we do now, which will allow us to do pre-scoring of customers and make instant lending decisions, both for existing customers and those we don't yet know," said Mr Hamers.

Automation should allow financial services groups to cut costs as a proportion of revenues by 15 percentage points, according to a study presented in Davos yesterday by Oliver Wyman, a consultancy. Bankers predict they will get much better at crunching vast amounts of data to make immediate lending decisions and provide far more tailored advice to customers.

They are also looking for big savings from blockchain, the shared database system that underpins the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Eight of the world's 10 biggest investment banks are expected to use blockchain to cut 30 per cent of their costs, totalling $8bn-$12bn, according to a study by the Accenture and McLagan consultancies yesterday.

But as banking moves into such activities, the distinction between finance and technology will become less and less clear, presenting established financial institutions with formidable new competitors at a time when they are already under strain.

"For the time being, the likes of Facebook and Google are on the fringes of banking as they don't want to be regulated," said Francisco Gonz-lez, chairman of Spain's BBVA.

"But sooner or later they will jump into our arena. They will try to take some parts of the value chain. That is the real challenge."

Banking in Europe is also expected to be transformed by EU regulations that will force banks to provide third parties with access to the data of any customers who authorise it. This should make it easier for banks to poach their rivals' clients and to offer more products.

But the regulatory change could also unleash competition for banks from fintech start-ups and big Silicon Valley technology groups. Oliver Wyman predicts many banks will be left as "component suppliers", producing highly regulated financial services such as loans and savings accounts, while the valuable relationships with customers are run by technology-focused groups acting as so-called platform providers and demand aggregators.

"The traditional boundaries of what industry I'm in are fading," said Ashok Vaswani, head of Barclays UK. "I tell my team that if you aren't eating someone else's lunch, you are doing it wrong. We are technology companies with a balance sheet."

The technological upheaval will require heavy investment, which is why the final big prediction of the bankers is that there will be big consolidation among banks, particularly in the fragmented European sector.

Technology Will Help And Hurt Bank Results, Studies Say; Fees, consumer banking and lending could drop by more than 10% in the U.S. by 2020, but new tech is also a way to avoid future profit collapses

Some banks may be turning big profits this quarter. But they will have to spend a lot of money in a gamble to stay profitable as technology encroaches, according to new set of studies.

McKinsey & Co., in a report this week, argues that up to $45 billion of bank profits could be wiped out by 2020 thanks to encroaching automation, ranging from electronic trading to mobile banking.

Fees charged for payments like checks and wires, wealth advisory and management, and consumer banking and lending could each drop by more than 10% in the U.S. in that time, and more than 20% in the U.K. and Japan, McKinsey says.

But new technology is also one way to avoid future profit collapses, another study said this week.

Accenture PLC, in a new report, estimates that banks could save $8 billion a year by using the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-blockchain-could-change-corporate-structure-1476887998", which were invented as a way to track ownership of bitcoin among a network of individual computers.

Live or work in multiple states? If so, you may be at risk for an audit if you're not careful.

Multistate taxpayers are often an attractive target for cash-strapped states and now some, such as New York, are using big data to track travelers' digital footprint, says Jonathan Mariner, founder of TaxDay, an app that tracks the time you spend working or living in different states.

Each state has its own rules and regulations regarding what counts as residency or work, says Mr. Mariner, who is also the former chief financial officer of Major League Baseball. How can you know the rules of the states you're working in? How can you protect yourself from being audited? Where can you seek help?

In his conversation with Watching Your Wealth's Veronica Dagher, Mr. Mariner also shares what he's learned from being audited.

Creighton's Take: Europe's  Bank Bias' Is Culprit Behind Basel Delay

Wilbur Ross to Sever Ties to His Firm to Avoid Financial Conflicts

Treasury Pick Mnuchin, Like His Would-Be Boss, Followed His Own Rules

Thesys to Build System Tracking All Stock and Options Orders

U.S. Companies Are Paring China Investment Plans, Survey Says

Europe's  Bank Bias' Is Culprit Behind Basel Delay

In geopolitics the U.S. remains supreme, but in global banking the story is more complex: Europe's banking giants, for all their problems, have enough clout to have foiled an attempt by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to finalize crucial global rules.

The committee had been expected to sign off on banks' minimum capital requirements in early January its chairman had said in December that the plan was "well on track" but in a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/making-banks-safer-waits-for-another-day-1483466526", the panel said "more time was needed," without specifying a timeline.

Behind the scenes, European banks have been pushing back against the committee's efforts to reduce the variability of risk weights produced by banks' internal risk models, an overhaul that would mean higher capital charges, and mechanically, lower returns on equity.

European banks' risk-weighted assets as a share of their total assets are typically much lower than their U.S. peers. That's because European banks tend to hold mortgages, which attract lower risk weights, on their balance sheets "http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-global-rule-makers-see-risks-in-european-banks-1474283129". The Basel deal was meant to narrow that capital gap.

Europe's banks enjoy a de facto veto over global rulemaking for two main reasons: They are relatively much more politically powerful in their countries than Wall Street banks are in the U.S., and the Basel Committee is skewed toward European interests.

The committee is made up of "http://www.bis.org/bcbs/membership.htm", 17 of which are European (including tiny Luxembourg's bank regulator). Just four regulators represent the U.S., which makes up about the same share of global gross domestic product as the European Union.

U.S. banks account for a much smaller share of their country's economy than Europe's do in their respective domestic markets. Bank assets in the EU amount to more than the equivalent of 300% of GDP, compared with around 200% in Japan and only around 100% of GDP in the U.S. In the U.K., bank assets are around "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q402.pdf".

Europe's domestic banking markets are dominated by large diversified financial institutions such as UniCredit SpA in Italy or Crdit Agricole SA in France.

"European governments have nurtured the birth and growth of mega-banks that act as  national champions' in competition with foreign banks," the European Central Bank explained last year, pointing out that governments often have direct equity stakes in their biggest banks, blunting their incentive to rein in their excesses. Banks in Europe are also larger corporate taxpayers and employers relative to their peers in the U.S., where the technology, resource and manufacturing industries loom larger.

"Banks have been able to strengthen their dominance within Europe's financial structure over time by lobbying for favorable legislation; and, as they have become more vital to the functioning of financial markets and to the economy, they have increased their lobbying power vis--vis politicians," the ECB said it said in a "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1797.en.pdf?21971652ba3f7c1925aaadb3b5a5ae2f".

In other words, the French and German governments see Socit Gnrale SA and Deutsche Bank AG, for instance, differently from how the U.S. government sees Citigroup Inc. or J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The U.S. also has powerful community and regional banks that see their interests as distinct from, or even opposed to, Wall Street's.

European banks' victory is pyrrhic as far as the ECB is concerned. The central bank argued Europe's "bank bias" was damaging the region's economic growth and fueling excessive risk taking. "More could be done to cap the growth and size of large banks," it said. It's very unlikely that will happen in time to help the Basel Committee craft its capital rules.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Wilbur Ross to Sever Ties to His Firm to Avoid Financial Conflicts

By Chris Cumming

President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Commerce Department promised to cut most but not quite all of his ties to the private-equity firm that made his name to avoid illegal financial conflicts in the cabinet role.

Wilbur Ross, the billionaire private-equity investor known as the "King of Bankruptcy" for his takeovers of troubled companies, plans to step down as chairman of W.L. Ross & Co. and sell dozens of holdings tied to the firm if he is confirmed as commerce secretary, he wrote in a letter to the agency made public Tuesday.

Mr. Ross, 79 years old, has forged wide-ranging ties over his decadeslong career, now holding more than 50 positions at businesses and nonprofits and hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in industries from international shipping to finance, finance records show. If confirmed to lead the Commerce Department, he will sell 80 assets and step down from his board seats and other positions, under his agreement with government ethics officials.

However, Mr. Ross won't completely dissociate himself from his namesake firm. He plans to retain his stakes in nine entities connected to W.L. Ross or its parent company, the asset-manager Invesco Inc., though he said he would recuse himself from matters that could affect those interests if confirmed.

In his letter to the Commerce Department, he wrote that a department ethics official told him "it is not necessary at this time for me to divest" those assets, though he wrote he would "remain vigilant" in avoiding potential conflicts.

Those nine stakes are worth between around $7 million and $40 million in total, according to his financial disclosures, and Mr. Ross will have no control over what investments they make, he said in his ethics agreement.

Mr. Ross outlined his plan to steer clear of financial conflicts in the document released Tuesday by the Senate Commerce Committee, a day before the panel is scheduled to hold a hearing on his nomination.

That offers just a narrow window of time for members of the committee to prepare to question Mr. Ross on his potential conflicts of interest, a topic expected to be a focus of his hearing Wednesday.

Lawyers and government-ethics experts have raised doubts about whether Mr. Ross, whose fortune was estimated by Forbes at $2.5 billion, can easily pare back his financial ties if confirmed as commerce secretary. The position entails a wide range of responsibilities, from overseeing cross-border trade to supporting domestic business, making it fraught with potential conflicts of interest, lawyers said.

Current Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, also a billionaire, sold more than 200 assets and stepped down from more than 150 positions after her ethics review, in 2013.

Although Mr. Ross sold W.L. Ross & Co. to Invesco Inc. in 2006, he has remained its chairman and still has a large financial stake in it. His holdings in W.L. Ross funds and investment vehicles could be worth more than $100 million, based on value ranges in his financial disclosures, but if forced to sell quickly he might not be able to collect their full value.

Mr. Ross should be able to afford the hit without too much pain, however. Along with his stocks and fixed income, disclosure documents show he holds more than $150 million in cash and owns an art collection worth more than $50 million.

He holds between $10 million and $50 million in Invesco stock, including unvested shares, and Invesco paid him $4.2 million last year, according to financial-disclosure documents released Tuesday.

W.L. Ross will no longer use Mr. Ross's name if he becomes commerce secretary, under the ethics agreement.

Among the other holdings he promised to sell are the chemicals distributor Nexeo Holdings Inc., of which he owns $25 million to $50 million stock, and oil producer Exco Resources Inc., of which he owns as much as $300,000 in stock.

Selling Mr. Ross's private-equity fund stakes could prove tricky, however, because such investments are much less liquid and trade much less frequently than stocks and bonds. Mr. Ross has been given up to 180 days rather than the usual 90 to divest some assets, with further extensions possible.

Treasury Pick Mnuchin, Like His Would-Be Boss, Followed His Own Rules

By Kirsten Grind, Rachel Louise Ensign and AnnaMaria Andriotis

First Federal Bank of California executives knew their thrift was in deep trouble but thought they had time to try to save it.

They didn't know that Steven Mnuchin, the chairman of OneWest Bank and now President-elect Donald Trump's pick as Treasury secretary, had been trying to persuade federal regulators to sell First Federal to him. That would require the government to decide the problems were deep enough to seize the thrift, even though its executives had been given a March 2010 deadline to raise additional capital, according to people familiar with the matter.

On a Friday afternoon in December 2009, regulators swooped in and shut down First Federal, one of the largest savings institutions in California. At a branch in the thrift's hometown of Santa Monica, employees were told that OneWest was now in charge. Mr. Mnuchin soon arrived at First Federal's headquarters.

When the Senate considers Mr. Mnuchin's nomination Thursday, Democrats are likely to scrutinize his role in foreclosing on homeowners, particularly from failed IndyMac Bank, which he also bought from the federal government.

Mr. Mnuchin has said OneWest did what it could, but some home seizures were unavoidable because it inherited "the worst mortgage portfolio in the history of time."

The acquisition of First Federal, by contrast, has been relatively overlooked, even though it was a big reason for OneWest's eventual success. It shows an executive willing to push outside normal channels, according to more than two dozen interviews with former executives and employees of OneWest and First Federal, former and current regulators, and government and company documents.

While most bankers waited until a formal bidding process to signal their interest in buying failed financial institutions, Mr. Mnuchin told the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. before then about his strong interest in First Federal, these people say. He had been doing the same for months with the thrift's primary regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which had the authority to decide whether to close First Federal, the people add.

Those traits and results sound a lot like his new boss, Mr. Trump, who has cited the transformation of OneWest after Mr. Mnuchin took over as evidence of his qualifications.

The First Federal acquisition allowed Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner, and his management team to double the size of their branch network and move into higher-end areas of Southern California, accelerating OneWest's shift toward catering to high-income clients and commercial loans.

At the end of 2014, OneWest had more than $6 billion of business, commercial real-estate and multifamily property loans on its books, up from practically none when Mr. Mnuchin's management team took over.

CIT Group Inc. agreed in July 2014 to buy OneWest for $3.4 billion, a return of more than $3 billion, including dividends. Mr. Mnuchin's take was hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Federal regulators say Mr. Mnuchin didn't influence their decision to seize and sell First Federal, adding that the severity of the financial crisis was a major factor in the closure. A Treasury Department review said the failure was caused by First Federal's risky loan strategy.

First Federal was founded in 1929 and known as a community-centric financial institution where tellers knew their customers' names. Its directors included actress June Lockhart, who played the mother in the "Lassie" television series. Many of the thrift's 600 employees worked there for a decade or more.

In the early 2000s, First Federal expanded heavily into option adjustable-rate mortgages, a type of loan that allowed a borrower to pay little for years while increasing the loan's balance. The thrift typically required little documentation.

More than $400 million in bad loans piled up by early 2009. Shares of the thrift's parent company dropped so much they were in danger of being delisted.

The OTS ordered First Federal to increase capital levels by September or it would have to try to sell itself. In a worst-case scenario, First Federal would have to liquidate.

First Federal executives raced to modify shaky loans, handing out free-gas cards to borrowers to encourage them to contact call-center representatives and sign new paperwork. The thrift also stopped originating most types of mortgages.

Across the U.S., regulators shut down more and more banks as the financial crisis spread. The closings typically happened on Friday afternoons, so buyers could convert computer systems over the weekend and reopen Monday morning. The death count in 2009 was 140, according to the FDIC.

At the Pasadena, Calif., headquarters of OneWest, Mr. Mnuchin had a goal: buy as many failed banks as possible, increase his bank's financial strength and value, and then sell OneWest later or take it public, say people familiar with his plans. Within a year of taking over IndyMac, he had bid for six other failing lenders and won two of them.

OTS officials were skeptical of Mr. Mnuchin and his team at first, largely because he had never run a bank before.

"I want to know that I can depend on you not to break this," a senior regulator warned Mr. Mnuchin at an initial meeting after the IndyMac purchase. The regulator added about IndyMac: "It's a major situation, and it's a high-profile place. I don't want you screwing it up on our watch."

Mr. Mnuchin sought to reassure the OTS official. "We're going to have a great relationship," he said, according to a person familiar with the meeting. "I understand what you have given me. And it's not a bank, it's a position of trust."

First Federal became his chief acquisition target. The thrift had 39 branches and $4.5 billion of deposits, and loan delinquencies declined for several months in 2009, an encouraging sign. But it missed a September capital-raising deadline imposed by the OTS. First Federal began exploring the possibility of selling itself.

Executives hosted a handful of rivals at its headquarters, allowing the visitors to scour financial records to lay the foundation for a possible purchase. When Mr. Mnuchin sent a team from OneWest, it was kicked out by First Federal executives, say people who were there. The process was supposed to be secret, but First Federal executives believed Mr. Mnuchin's team was leaking information to the press.

People close to Mr. Mnuchin say he believed it would be less risky to buy First Federal as part of a seizure, since a government backstop could protect investors.

By December 2009, he instructed several executives to review First Federal's financial statements, regulatory filings and other records to determine a possible bid, says one person familiar with the matter.

Almost everything went through him. He was the kind of deal maker who would "know the cost of every pencil," says one former regulator.

OneWest's chairman shunned the limelight and cherished his privacy. OneWest paid for security services at his home.

When he got divorced, Mr. Mnuchin asked a court to keep his home address out of public records, saying his position subjected him to "public ire at the banking industry in general."

In early December 2009, First Federal missed another capital-raising deadline, this time to raise $515 million. First Federal President James Giraldin called a top OTS official in Washington. "Please," he pleaded, on the verge of tears, according to a person with knowledge of the call. "I'm begging you, give us a chance."

OTS and FDIC officials met with members of First Federal's board of directors and executives to discuss the future. Directors were met with blank stares from regulators but left the meeting feeling it had gone well.

A week later, an OTS examiner called First Federal with news that it would get until March 31 to raise capital, say people familiar with the matter. There was one condition: First Federal's chief executive, Babette Heimbuch, had to resign. She did immediately. The government still had the power to seize First Federal if its financial condition deteriorated in the eyes of regulators.

Mr. Mnuchin repeatedly made sure regulators knew he was an interested buyer. "If a large institution in this area comes up for bid, I want to know about it," he once told OTS examiners, says a person familiar with the conversation. "We're in the business of buying failed banks."

Throughout the financial crisis, banks interested in bidding on failing institutions were put on a list kept by the FDIC, which wanted to minimize payouts from its deposit-insurance fund. Potential bidders would receive an alert when a bank or thrift was up for sale, which meant it was about to be seized by regulators.

Bidders could then log on to a secure website for access to the failing institution's financial information. Names of failing banks usually were kept secret to prevent a customer run.

The FDIC hadn't begun the bidding process for First Federal, but Mr. Mnuchin talked to someone he knew at the agency about his interest in the thrift. Around the same time, an FDIC official called the OTS and said OneWest wanted to bid for First Federal, according to people familiar with the matter.

It was common for bankers to express interest in buying troubled institutions during the financial crisis, but Mr. Mnuchin was particularly persistent, regulators say.

While officials at the OTS thought First Federal should get more time, the FDIC ran the sale process and had the larger goal of protecting the deposit-insurance fund. The financial crisis already had caused the steepest losses in decades.

Both agencies eventually agreed to close First Federal, partly because they were losing confidence that it could raise the additional capital.

OneWest put together a bid package within hours. Five other banks and private-equity firms also were interested because First Federal was in better shape than many other failing lenders. People's United Bank, a unit of People's United Financial Inc., based in Bridgeport, Conn., made what it thought was a winning bid, say people familiar with the offer.

Mr. Mnuchin topped People's United by $700 million, offering $400 million more than the amount of assets First Federal had at the time. It was one of only about a half-dozen deals during the crisis when a bidder offered to pay a premium.

On Dec. 16, 2009, Mr. Mnuchin and about 30 OneWest executives sat down with FDIC officials in Orange County, Calif. The FDIC said if First Federal was shut down later that week, the plan was to hand it to OneWest as the winning bidder.

At First Federal, executives suddenly were having trouble contacting any of their regulators and were worried.

On the morning of Friday, Dec. 18, OneWest executives were dispatched in groups to wait for instructions. One team waited near First Federal's headquarters.

A separate group of about 50 executives gathered at a strip mall in Marina del Rey and decided to split up because they didn't want to risk being noticed by First Federal employees. Some of the OneWest employees went to a restaurant and others to a coffee shop.

At about 3 p.m., one of the executives at the strip mall received a call from OneWest headquarters. OneWest had officially won the bid for First Federal.

"First Federal was our No. 1 strategic target," Mr. Mnuchin told The Wall Street Journal at the time.

The FDIC estimated that First Federal's failure would cost the deposit-insurance fund $146.3 million. The actual losses turned out to be zero.

Thesys to Build System Tracking All Stock and Options Orders

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON Thesys Technologies LLC won the award to operate one of the largest databases ever created, a forensic tool for detecting suspicious trading and investigating the causes of flash crashes in stock markets.

Thesys, a provider of high-speed trading platforms and analytics software, topped two other finalists seeking to build the consolidated audit trail, which will track every stock and options order in the U.S. market, a selection committee of securities exchanges said Tuesday. The ambitious project, which started on the orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflects regulators' struggles to police the fragmented and increasingly automated U.S. stock market, where rapid-fire algorithms create and cancel orders in slivers of a second.

The milestone means a committee of nine exchange operators that selected Thesys must quickly strike a contract with the small firm to build the repository, known as the CAT. The plan for the system calls for the CAT to begin receiving trading data from the exchanges by November.

Thesys was widely seen as an underdog to another bidder, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to run the audit trail. The SEC called for the system after the May 2010 "flash crash," when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted nearly 1,000 points before quickly rebounding. It took the SEC more than four months to reconstruct trading on that chaotic day, mostly because it lacked quick access to granular order data.

The announcement was a clear loss for Finra and its new chief executive officer, Robert Cook, who took over in August. Finra was seen as the favorite because it is the front-line regulator of U.S. brokerages and is directly overseen by the SEC. It has experience running complex trade-reporting systems, including a new one planned for U.S. Treasurys, and is required to comply with SEC data-security standards.

"For the SEC, there is a deep and long-established track record in dealing with them," said James Burns, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and former top SEC official. "They would have been responsible to the SEC on two levels: contractually, and the SEC is their regulator."

Finra in a statement said it would continue to cooperate with the CAT developers because the data would still be useful for its regulatory duties. "Finra remains committed to its robust program of cross-market surveillance and looks forward to enhancing that oversight with the uniform, comprehensive data that the CAT will provide," the organization said.

Thesys is a subsidiary of Red Bank, N.J.-based Tradeworx Inc., which supplies trading platforms to both exchanges and traders. In 2012, the SEC contracted with Tradeworx to acquire the Market Information Data Analytics System, or Midas, which collects about one billion trading records a day from 13 U.S. stock exchanges.

"We are extremely excited about the opportunity to bring our technology solutions to bear in creating the best CAT solution we can for the industry," said Mike Beller, Thesys's managing partner. Its partners on the bid include International Business Machines Corp., Latham & Watkins LLP and Rosenblatt Securities Inc.

Unlike Midas, which the SEC acquired and began using to monitor the market within a period of months, the CAT project has been mired in red tape for years, as industry representatives overseeing it have haggled over everything from its cost to the data-security requirements for a system that will include details about individual customers. Under a plan approved by the SEC, the system is supposed to be largely operational by 2018, when the largest U.S. brokers start reporting activity to it.

The CAT has become even more critical in recent years as exchange technology snafus and haywire trading algorithms have occasionally caused market mayhem. A wild trading session on Aug. 24, 2015, forced hundreds of trading halts across stocks and exchange-traded funds and caused many ETFs to trade at sharp discounts to the sum of their holdings, worsening losses for many fundholders who sold during the panic.

Thesys and the exchanges will also have to navigate concerns that the CAT will become a prime target for hackers, because the repository will include information about the customers behind trades. Brokers and traders have worried that if an intruder pilfered CAT data, they could use it to replicate trading strategies or know when to trade ahead of big investors such as mutual funds.

"You are going to have a historical database of every single customer, firm and market maker in one location, and I can't think of a bigger target," said Joanna Fields, the founder of Aplomb Strategies and former head of U.S. market structure for Deutsche Bank Securities.

Negotiations between the selection committee and Finra broke down in recent weeks because the two sides couldn't agree who would be responsible in the event of a cyberattack in which personal information leaked out, according to people familiar with the matter. The exchanges wanted to be shielded from liability, but Finra wanted them to share responsibility, including for legal costs and damages, the people said.

Mr. Beller declined to comment on the specifics of Thesys's negotiations with the exchanges.

In addition to Thesys and Finra, the other finalist to build the CAT was SunGard, a financial-software developer owned by Fidelity National Information Services Inc.

Deutsche Bank Completes $7.2 Billion U.S. Deal to Settle Claims From Financial Crisis

By Aruna Viswanatha

WASHINGTON In May 2006, a Deutsche Bank AG supervisor warned a senior trader at the bank's subprime desk that a mortgage lender whose loans the bank was securitizing was becoming too lenient with its underwriting practices.

Details in a $7.2 billion agreement the bank reached with the Justice Department made public Tuesday show the Deutsche employee was concerned about Option One Mortgage Corp., which collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. "I once heard that OOMC will approve anyone with a pulse I would move that to half a pulse," the supervisor wrote.

Deutsche Bank's expected settlement with the U.S. resolves claims it misled investors on mortgage securities it sold before the housing collapse. It ends one of the largest legal headaches the bank faced, days before the Obama administration leaves office.

In a 71-page "statement of facts," the bank admitted it knew the loans it was bundling into securities were more risky than it marketed them. A series of other major global banks have paid billions of dollars in penalties to resolve similar allegations those securities fueled a housing bubble and exacerbated the subsequent collapse.

The settlement "recognizes the immense breadth of Deutsche Bank's unlawful scheme," said the Justice Department's No. 3 official, Bill Baer, who will be leaving his post later this week.

"Our conduct in this matter &falls short of our standards and is unacceptable. We apologize unreservedly for it," Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan said in a written statement, adding the bank had exited those activities and improved its standards.

The settlement provides a detailed picture of traders and supervisors at the bank knowing of problems in the mortgage market but continuing to sell the loans.

Later in May 2006, for example, the supervisor also admitted Deutsche Bank was looking the other way on the standards that had become fraudulent, including blacked-out borrower pay stubs. "We tolerate misrepresentation. What goes around will eventually come around; when performance (default) begins affecting profits and/or the investors who purchase the securities, only then will Wall St. take notice," the supervisor wrote.

In one 2005 instance described in the settlement, one investor asked the bank about the percentage of second liens by borrowers in one mortgage bond deal. " Tell them verbally &But don't put in the prospectus," one trader instructed his team on how to respond.

While the settlement puts the bank's largest headaches behind it, Deutsche still faces an anticipated smaller fine from the U.S. government following an investigation of Russian stock trades, and other matters.

"Given other lawsuits, it is still too early to talk of having drawn a line under all matters," Mr. Cryan said in a letter to the bank's employees Tuesday. "We are, however, nearing our objective of being able to concentrate primarily on the future instead of repeatedly having to look over our shoulders at past events."

The settlement includes a $3.1 billion civil penalty paid to the U.S. Treasury and $4.1 billion in help to struggling borrowers, including reducing mortgage balances and providing financing for affordable retail housing.

Democrats Tell Donald Trump Not to Fire CFPB Chief

By Donna Borak

WASHINGTON Senate Democrats on Tuesday pledged a "long fight" should President-elect Donald Trump fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing there is insufficient cause for his ouster.

"There is no cause available to go after him other than something that was trumped up, manufactured," Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York said on a conference call with reporters. "We want to make sure they understand that there would be a long fight if they try to remove him."

Democratic lawmakers have been pushing back against Republican efforts to remove CFPB Director Richard Cordray, a move that faces legal hurdles. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law that created the CFPB states that the president may only remove its director for "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office."

A CFPB spokeswoman has said Congress has confirmed Mr. Cordray to serve a term until July 2018 and he had no plans to step down.

On the call, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said firing Mr. Cordray would be "extreme and unprecedented," adding "No agency head has been fired for cause for a century."

The CFPB has emerged as a fresh battleground between the two parties since Republicans swept into power in the November elections. Republicans want to significantly weaken the bureau as part of a campaign to dismantle Obama-era financial regulations.

The consumer agency has helped to return $12 billion to consumers the regulator said were harmed by alleged corporate misconduct. The agency's critics accuse it of regulatory overreach.

On Tuesday, 10 Democrats sent a letter to Mr. Cordray commending his leadership, from imposing tough fines against banks like Wells Fargo & Co. for its allegedly fraudulent sales practices to taking enforcement actions against mortgage-aid schemes, predatory lenders that target military personnel and others types of misconduct.

The only Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee who didn't sign the letter was Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. The senator couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

"If Trump intendeds to keep any of his promises to protect consumers and unrig the system, he would keep Richard Cordray as the CFPB director for the remainder of his term," Mr. Schumer said.

Ms. Warren said an abrupt departure by Mr. Cordray from the agency before his term ends would jeopardize the CFPB's ability to finalize three critical rules, harming families, veterans and others. The agency is close to finishing rules that will limit a forced arbitration clause, crack down on payday lenders and stop abusive practices by the debt-collection industry.

"Firing Director Cordray shortly before the agency can finish those rules is a huge handout to lobbyist of the big banks, payday lenders and debt collectors," said Ms. Warren. "We'll be fighting back if the president-elect decides to start his administration by kissing the boots of big banks and payday lending lobbyists."

SEC's White Says Congress Stifling Regulator's Mission

By Andrew Ackerman

NEW YORK Departing Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White on Tuesday criticized legislation she claimed would harm the commission's independence, saying recent moves by Congress would crimp its ability to protect investors and impede responses to another financial crisis.

"The House passed a bill just last week that would impose conflicting, burdensome, and needlessly detailed requirements regarding economic matters in commission rule making that would provide no benefit to investors beyond the exhaustive economic analysis we already undertake," Ms. White said in a speech in New York.

Her comments refer to legislation the House adopted largely along party lines Thursday that aims to require securities regulators to more extensively assess how much their rules cost the financial industry. The measure, introduced by Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.), is significant because it is among the first deregulatory measures congressional Republicans are expected to advance this year, though its prospects in the Senate are unclear.

Supporters say the Wagner bill, which would require the SEC to analyze all of its existing rules and to conduct "look backs" on a regular basis to ensure new and existing regulations are still effective, are needed to prevent unduly costly regulations.

Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, Ms. White said the bill's highly prescriptive provisions could prevent the agency "from responding timely to market developments or risks that could lead to a market crisis."

Ms. White, who is stepping down as SEC chairman Friday, praised her likely successor, corporate attorney Jay Clayton. The departing SEC chief said Mr. Clayton would be a "terrific successor," adding he is "very smart, very thoughtful, very knowledgeable of the markets and the securities laws and I think a terrific person."

Yet she urged her successor to challenge legislative efforts to overhaul the SEC's rulemaking process, framing the efforts as part of a broad threat to the independence of the commission. Its members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but it conducts day-to-day business independent of both the executive and legislative branches with a commission membership from both parties.

"These trends and similar ones create real consequences for the efficacy of the commission, as well as for other independent regulators," she said. "Most visibly, they tend to increase polarization within the commission and make it harder to forge consensus."

In addition to warning about Thursday's House legislation, Ms. White took aim at aspects of sweeping legislation House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) is expected to unveil in the coming weeks. The aim of the plan is to broadly replace the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.

Ms. White said "elements" of Mr. Hensarling's legislation would "undermine agency rule making as well as crippled our enforcement capabilities," though she stopped short of identifying specific provisions she found objectionable.

"The next commission must continue to challenge these efforts," she said.

SEC Alleges BlackRock Forced Outgoing Employees to Waive Whistleblower Rights

By Samuel Rubenfeld

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday penalized asset manager BlackRock for using separation agreements to force outgoing employees to waive their ability to get whistleblower awards, the latest example of the agency targeting firms for allegedly trying to silence potential tipsters.

The SEC spent the latter half of 2016 beefing up its enforcement of a rule, established as part of its whistleblower program created under the Dodd-Frank Act, that prohibits companies from restricting employees from speaking to the agency about potential wrongdoing. Jane Norberg, head of the SEC's whistleblower office, told The Wall Street Journal that it would remain a priority for the SEC in 2017.

More than 1,000 departing employees from New York-based Blackrock signed separation agreements containing language that said, upon exiting the firm, they "waive any right to recovery of incentives for reporting of misconduct" to receive separation payments, the SEC alleged. BlackRock added the provision in October 2011 and continued using it in separation agreements until March 2016, the SEC said.

"Companies should review and revise their agreements that stifle whistleblowers from reporting to the SEC," said Ms. Norberg, in a statement on Tuesday announcing the BlackRock case.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, BlackRock Inc. agreed to pay a $340,000 penalty. A BlackRock spokesman said the firm is pleased to resolve the matter, and noted that the firm, as the SEC's administrative order in the case indicated, removed the language at issue from its separation agreements prior to contact from the agency.

"There was no finding that this provision ever prevented an employee from communicating with the agency," the spokesman said.

The SEC's order said BlackRock took a number of remedial actions, including the implementation of mandatory annual training that summarizes the rights of employees under the SEC's whistleblower program. It also agreed to send the agreement to ex-employees who had signed the restrictive agreement.

U.S. Companies Are Paring China Investment Plans, Survey Says

By Eva Dou

BEIJING More U.S. businesses are shelving investment plans in China, a survey says, as companies find themselves caught between hardening trade stances in Washington and Beijing.

The annual survey of members of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, released Wednesday, found that the percentage of companies that rate China among their top three investment targets fell to 56%, the lowest since at least 2009. Four out of five companies said they felt less welcome in China than before, nearly double the rate from three years ago.

The survey, which isn't scientific, was conducted online between Oct. 26 and Nov. 27. The results were calculated based on 462 responses from members of the chamber, which represents 900 companies in China, about 80% of which are American.

Because the survey began before the Nov. 8 election, it only partly reflects opinions on how President-elect Donald Trump will affect U.S.-China relations. But Mr. Trump's calls for steep tariffs on China have raised the specter of Beijing retaliation and given U.S. companies pause in deepening their investment in the country.

While 72% of companies said positive relations between Beijing and Washington were "very" or "extremely" important to their business growth in China, only 17% expected ties to improve over the next year.

"This is somewhat sobering," said William Zarit, chairman of the chamber. And "a growing majority feel that a strong bilateral relationship is important to their companies' success," he said.

The China investment environment has grown tougher in other ways. China's economic growth has slowed, production costs have risen and local rivals strengthened. Survey respondents said new cybersecurity rules and other regulations made it harder to compete against local companies. Choking smog in China's largest cities has also hampered recruitment of international executives.

China's top leaders have given public reassurances that they will treat foreign and domestic companies equally and let market forces play a larger role. But 55% of respondents said foreign companies were treated unfairly, and companies said that economic reforms were slower than expected.

The release of the survey came after Chinese President Xi Jinping defended free trade and globalization at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. When it comes to those issues, Mr. Zarit said the chamber continues to see the U.S. and other countries he didn't specify as being more open than China. "I think that's kind of ironic."

The group said it is planning to reach out to the new Trump administration in February and that it would recommend the U.S. be more aggressive in talks with China amid "the increasing realization of an unfair playing field" that foreign firms face.

One bright spot was a rebound in revenue, with 58% of respondents seeing year-over-year sales growth in 2016, compared with 55% in 2015. This showed that U.S. companies are adjusting to the "new normal" of China's slowing economy, the chamber said.

"Now that they cannot count on double-digit economic growth to drive sales, companies are looking to grow by investing more in innovation in China and by branching out beyond core markets," it said in the report.

Companies rated the prosperous southern Guangdong province and the capital city Beijing as their top priorities for investment.

Chinese leaders pledged in December to open up to foreign investment previously restricted sectors, and the State Council, the cabinet, on Tuesday reiterated that commitment, saying foreign investment would be welcome in some financial services, manufacturing businesses and mining, among other sectors.

Bond Trading Wave Gets Harder for European Banks to Catch

By Paul J. Davies

The capital markets business is back. While U.S. investment banks are taking advantage, it is less certain that Europeans can.

J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley have both reported big rebounds in fourth-quarter bond trading. Corporate debt markets have seen strong new issuance to start 2017 as well, which is normally an indicator of good trading activity. But large European investment banks face obstacles in getting in on the action: They may be frustrated by capital concerns or distracted by restructuring.

Deutsche Bank could see the biggest recovery in 2017. Even it needs the right sort of activity, though, and smart ways of taking it on.

Trading related to foreign exchange and interest rates is likely to be the biggest spur to activity, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, which they say will benefit Deutsche Bank and Barclays more than Credit Suisse. If successful, Deutsche should enjoy the biggest rebound in earnings expectations, though partly because expectations have been slashed heavily. Since the start of 2015, forecasts for 2017 profit at Deutsche's investment bank division have been cut by more than half, according to Credit Suisse analysts.

Recovery from a low base is better than no recovery at all, though. The question is whether Deutsche can jump on the increase in activity. The German bank remains constrained by its relatively thin capital, which makes it harder to take on extra risk to earn more revenue.

It has reached a $7.2 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over mortgage bond sales one of the major uncertainties hanging over it but it still has to settle a highly uncertain probe related to Russian equity trades, which could eat up more capital.

Furthermore, the finalization of global capital-rule changes has been delayed until at least March, leaving the industry in the dark about how much more capital it needs. Analysts at Credit Suisse think Deutsche will need to raise  5 billion to  6 billion ($5.4 billion to $6.4 billion) to meet its final requirements.

There are things that Deutsche can do to get revenue without straining capital. For example, it can lay off large parts of the counterparty credit risk involved in derivatives trading to big hedge funds or other sophisticated investors. The extra business would be slightly less profitable, but it still would boost overall returns.

Banks also can take less risk by shifting the assets off their books much more quickly. A good indication of how much trading assets a bank holds is its value-at-risk number. Less risk by that measure doesn't have to mean weaker revenue. J.P. Morgan's fourth-quarter trading value-at-risk was 30% lower than for the same period in 2015, but its trading revenue was 30% higher. Morgan Stanley also cut risk while boosting revenue.

Deutsche could pull off a similar trick and have its investment bank start to look healthier. The problem is the cost of past bad behavior and very high central costs, which will still drag down overall returns this year, limiting the benefits to Deutsche's shareholders.

Regulator Sees Risks in Fintech Bank Charters

New York's top financial regulator says that a new type of federal bank charter for fintech companies was "highly problematic" and could "create institutions that are too big to fail." Maria Vullo, the superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, said in a letter that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's plan to regulate fintech firms that applied for the charter would give such entities an advantage over competitors and could increase the systemic risk of the financial system. "The OCC should not rush to grant national status to unknown and unproven business models thereby enabling them to become financial giants," Vullo wrote in the letter.

Future of Federal Insurance Office Uncertain

One political question for the insurance industry is whether the US Treasury's Federal Insurance office, which was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, will be eliminated by the incoming Trump administration. The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies has concerns about the office's data collection and subpoena authority, says CEO Charles Chamness at a conference in New York. But the office will be hard to get rid of, says Ian Adams at the R Street Institute, because the new administration won't want to turn down an opportunity to make a political appointment.

UK Financial Industry Seeks Same EU Market Access

Despite the fact that UK Prime Minister Theresa May signaled an end to the existing framework of passporting rights for the financial sector, TheCityUK, an industry association, welcomed her comments. "The Prime Minister is right to emphasize the need for a bespoke agreement with the EU that benefits the UK and the EU," a statement published by TheCityUK read. The industry is now, according to the association, seeking a trade with "mutual market access between the UK and the EU on terms similar to those currently in place," the statement read. It also requests a transitional period that would allow businesses to adjust to new trade regulations following the UK's exit from the EU. (nina.trentmann@wsj.com; @Nina_Trentmann)

May Speech Could be Bad News For City of London

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's rejection of the European Court of Justice could have important consequences for the City of London, according to Stephanie Flanders, strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.

"If that view is correct, then May's hope of replicating-- or nearly replicating-- what U.K.-based financial services companies have now within the single market is not going to be realized."

German Finance Groups See Frankfurt Benefiting From Brexit

German banking lobby groups say they regret U.K. plans to quit the EU single market, but expect Frankfurt to benefit when banks leave London to remain within the trading bloc. "For financial firms based in the U.K., this makes the loss of passporting-rights inevitable," says Hans-Walter Peters of the German Banking Association. Hubertus Vaeth who leads Frankfurt's push to lure banking jobs from London, says talks with wantaway banks are intensifying, with decisions expected over the next 8-12 weeks. "But let us not forget: Europe will need the London financial center and we would be well advised to build new sustainable bridges between London and Frankfurt," Mr. Vaeth says.

Creighton's Take: Europe's  Bank Bias' Is Culprit Behind Basel Delay

Europe's  Bank Bias' Is Culprit Behind Basel Delay

In geopolitics the U.S. remains supreme, but in global banking the story is more complex: Europe's banking giants, for all their problems, have enough clout to have foiled an attempt by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to finalize crucial global rules.

The committee had been expected to sign off on banks' minimum capital requirements in early January its chairman had said in December that the plan was "well on track" but in a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/making-banks-safer-waits-for-another-day-1483466526", the panel said "more time was needed," without specifying a timeline.

Behind the scenes, European banks have been pushing back against the committee's efforts to reduce the variability of risk weights produced by banks' internal risk models, an overhaul that would mean higher capital charges, and mechanically, lower returns on equity.

European banks' risk-weighted assets as a share of their total assets are typically much lower than their U.S. peers. That's because European banks tend to hold mortgages, which attract lower risk weights, on their balance sheets "http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-global-rule-makers-see-risks-in-european-banks-1474283129". The Basel deal was meant to narrow that capital gap.

Europe's banks enjoy a de facto veto over global rulemaking for two main reasons: They are relatively much more politically powerful in their countries than Wall Street banks are in the U.S., and the Basel Committee is skewed toward European interests.

The committee is made up of "http://www.bis.org/bcbs/membership.htm", 17 of which are European (including tiny Luxembourg's bank regulator). Just four regulators represent the U.S., which makes up about the same share of global gross domestic product as the European Union.

U.S. banks account for a much smaller share of their country's economy than Europe's do in their respective domestic markets. Bank assets in the EU amount to more than the equivalent of 300% of GDP, compared with around 200% in Japan and only around 100% of GDP in the U.S. In the U.K., bank assets are around "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q402.pdf".

Europe's domestic banking markets are dominated by large diversified financial institutions such as UniCredit SpA in Italy or Crdit Agricole SA in France.

"European governments have nurtured the birth and growth of mega-banks that act as  national champions' in competition with foreign banks," the European Central Bank explained last year, pointing out that governments often have direct equity stakes in their biggest banks, blunting their incentive to rein in their excesses. Banks in Europe are also larger corporate taxpayers and employers relative to their peers in the U.S., where the technology, resource and manufacturing industries loom larger.

"Banks have been able to strengthen their dominance within Europe's financial structure over time by lobbying for favorable legislation; and, as they have become more vital to the functioning of financial markets and to the economy, they have increased their lobbying power vis--vis politicians," the ECB said it said in a "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1797.en.pdf?21971652ba3f7c1925aaadb3b5a5ae2f".

In other words, the French and German governments see Socit Gnrale SA and Deutsche Bank AG, for instance, differently from how the U.S. government sees Citigroup Inc. or J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. The U.S. also has powerful community and regional banks that see their interests as distinct from, or even opposed to, Wall Street's.

European banks' victory is pyrrhic as far as the ECB is concerned. The central bank argued Europe's "bank bias" was damaging the region's economic growth and fueling excessive risk taking. "More could be done to cap the growth and size of large banks," it said. It's very unlikely that will happen in time to help the Basel Committee craft its capital rules.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Wilbur Ross to Sever Ties to His Firm to Avoid Financial Conflicts

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-commerce-department-pick-wilbur-ross-to-sever-ties-to-his-firm-to-avoid-financial-conflicts-1484699994" to run the Commerce Department promised to cut most but not quite all of his ties to the private-equity firm that made his name to avoid illegal financial conflicts in the cabinet role.

Wilbur Ross, the billionaire private-equity investor known as the "King of Bankruptcy" for his takeovers of troubled companies, plans to step down as chairman of W.L. Ross & Co. and sell dozens of holdings tied to the firm if he is confirmed as commerce secretary, he wrote in a letter to the agency made public Tuesday. The Senate Commerce Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on his nomination Wednesday.

"http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/Administration-Personnel/"

Treasury Pick Mnuchin, Like His Would-Be Boss, Followed His Own Rules

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-pick-mnuchin-like-his-would-be-boss-followed-his-own-rules-1484688776" nomination Thursday, Democrats are likely to scrutinize his role in foreclosing on homeowners, particularly from failed IndyMac Bank, which he also bought from the federal government.

Mr. Mnuchin has said OneWest did what it could, but some home seizures were unavoidable because it inherited "the worst mortgage portfolio in the history of time."

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/not-the-foreclosure-king-1484688504"

Thesys to Build System Tracking All Stock and Options Orders

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/thesys-to-build-system-tracking-all-stock-and-options-orders-1484678642" on Tuesday won the award to operate one of the largest databases ever created, a forensic tool for detecting suspicious trading and investigating the causes of flash crashes in stock markets, a group of stock and options exchanges said.

Thesys, a developer of high-speed trading platforms and analytics software, topped two other finalists seeking to build the consolidated audit trail. The ambitious project, which will be used by the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflects regulators' struggles to police the fragmented and increasingly automated U.S. stock market, where rapid-fire algorithms create and cancel orders faster than a human eye can blink.

Deutsche Bank Completes $7.2 Billion U.S. Deal to Settle Claims From Financial Crisis

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-completes-7-2-billion-u-s-deal-to-settle-claims-from-financial-crisis-1484684864" a $7.2 billion deal to resolve U.S. claims that it misled investors on mortgage securities it sold before the 2008 financial crisis, authorities said Tuesday.

The German lender admitted in a 71-page statement of facts that it made "false representations" to mortgage bond investors and omitted material information in disclosures to them, according to the agreement with the U.S. Justice Department.

Democrats Tell Donald Trump Not to Fire CFPB Chief

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-tell-donald-trump-dont-fire-cfpb-chief-1484683376" pledged a "long fight" should President-elect Donald Trump fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing there is insufficient cause for his ouster.

"There is no cause available to go after him other than something that was trumped up, manufactured," Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York said on a conference call with reporters. "We want to make sure they understand that there would be a long fight if they try to remove him."

"http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/CFPB-at-5/"

SEC's White Says Congress Stifling Regulator's Mission

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/outgoing-sec-chair-says-congress-stifling-regulators-mission-1484673028" Commission Chairman Mary Jo White on Tuesday criticized legislation she claimed would harm the commission's independence, saying recent moves by Congress would crimp its ability to protect investors and impede responses to another financial crisis.

"The House passed a bill just last week that would impose conflicting, burdensome, and needlessly detailed requirements regarding economic matters in commission rule making that would provide no benefit to investors beyond the exhaustive economic analysis we already undertake," Ms. White said in a speech in New York.

SEC Alleges BlackRock Forced Outgoing Employees to Waive Whistleblower Rights

"http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2017/01/17/sec-alleges-blackrock-forced-outgoing-employees-to-waive-whistleblower-rights/" on Tuesday penalized asset manager BlackRock for using separation agreements to force outgoing employees to waive their ability to get whistleblower awards, the latest example of the agency targeting firms for allegedly trying to silence potential tipsters.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, BlackRock Inc. agreed to pay a $340,000 penalty. A BlackRock spokesman said the firm is pleased to resolve the matter, and noted that the firm, as the SEC's administrative order in the case indicated, removed the language at issue from its separation agreements prior to contact from the agency.

U.S. Companies Are Paring China Investment Plans, Survey Says

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-companies-are-paring-investment-plans-in-china-survey-says-1484695803?tesla=y" investment plans in China, a survey says, as companies find themselves caught between hardening trade stances in Washington and Beijing.

The annual survey of members of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, released Wednesday, found that the percentage of companies that rate China among their top three investment targets fell to 56%, the lowest since at least 2009. Four out of five companies said they felt less welcome in China than before, nearly double the rate from three years ago.

Bond Trading Wave Gets Harder for European Banks to Catch

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-trading-wave-gets-harder-for-european-banks-to-catch-1484737508". While U.S. investment banks are taking advantage, it is less certain that Europeans can.

J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley have both reported big rebounds in fourth-quarter bond trading. Corporate debt markets have seen strong new issuance to start 2017 as well, which is normally an indicator of good trading activity. But large European investment banks face obstacles in getting in on the action: They may be frustrated by capital concerns or distracted by restructuring.

Called "dai chi" in Chinese literally, holding something on someone's behalf the trading practice resembles a short-term loan backed by bonds, and it has boomed as China's bond market rallied during the past three years, according to half a dozen traders and executives at Chinese financial companies who have engaged in or are familiar with the practice.

What exactly led to the sterling "flash event" on October 7, 2016, when the pound fell 6%? "https://www.bis.org/publ/mktc09.htm"see the event as the result of many factors, including the time of day and options-related hedging flows. They see the event as one in a series of "flash events" that have occurred "in a broader range of markets than was previously the case." Though these events have generally proved to be short-lived without immediate impacts on financial stability, the researchers note that "flash events undermine confidence in financial markets."

Firing Cordray No Easy Task for Trump

If President-elect Donald Trump tries to fire Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, he could have a constitutional crisis on his hands, "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-13/why-trump-can-t-just-say-you-re-fired-to-this-official". Presidents have generally respected, if not appreciated, the unique powers of independent agencies. Mr. Trump would have to fire Mr. Cordray for cause in order to remove him from his post, and Mr. Sunstein believes Mr. Cordray would win a court battle over his dismissal. "Strong policy disagreements are not a lawful ground for dismissing the CFPB director," he writes.

Tech
At Davos, IBM Chief Predicts Artificial Intelligence  Won't Be a Job Killer; While the technology will create obsolescence, it may also create employment

Advances in artificial intelligence will lead to job losses, but new forms of employment will take their place, International Business Machines Corp. Chief Executive Ginni Rometty said Tuesday.

For artificial intelligence such as "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-a-billion-people-to-use-watson-by-2018-1477496455" to succeed, companies need to build the trust of prospective users, Ms. Rometty said at a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland. "It's not man or machine," she said. "It's a symbiotic relationship. Our purpose is to augment and be in service of what humans do."

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/does-artificial-intelligence-pose-a-threat-1431109025" were a central theme of the panel, run by Vista Equity Partners founder Robert F. Smith. In addition to Ms. Rometty, the panel featured Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab director Joichi Ito and HealthTap Inc. CEO Ron Gutman.

AI offers a "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/01/11/artificial-intelligence-looms-larger-in-the-corporate-world/" for people in areas such as financial services, health care and education, the panelists said. But before releasing any AI products into the wild, companies need to do extensive testing to ensure users have a safe experience, Mr. Nadella said.

He recounted a story in which AI software helped a man discover his toothache was actually a symptom of a heart attack. Still, he said, AI errors could put lives at risk, particularly when it comes to the health field.

"The software-engineering infrastructure is where have to make a lot of investments," Mr. Nadella said. "You can't make mistakes."

Companies dealing with AI need to be "https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2017/01/ibm-cognitive-principles/" that goes into products and explain how those products are trained to interpret that data, Ms. Rometty said. "With any new technology, we all, particularly here, have to think about how to develop trust and that is around transparency and a set of principles."

A diverse slate of engineering talent can help broaden AI's potential, Mr. Ito said. "When the people who are actually doing the work actually create the tools, you get much better tools."

Ms. Rometty acknowledged some jobs will become obsolete because of AI. History, though, has demonstrated that technological breakthroughs lead to new employment opportunities, she said.

"There's so much fear about jobs," she said. "But most of us will be working with these systems."

The Property Report
Investors Pump In Cash But Supply Is Lacking

Investors are piling money into real-estate funds, but fund managers are finding it a challenge to spend it.

Global fund managers had a record $237 billion available to invest in commercial property at the end of last year, according to the data firm Preqin, up from $229 billion at the end of 2015 and $136 billion at the end of 2012.

Real-estate funds are one way investors can bet on the property market without having to buy a whole building. When an investor commits capital to a fund, whatever amount remains unspent is known as dry powder.

The record level of dry powder comes as investors increasingly have turned to commercial real estate in a hunt for returns. Ultralow interest rates at global central banks have made returns on offices and shopping malls look attractive compared with other asset classes such as bonds.

Global fund managers have raised $446 billion for commercial property in the past four years, on par with the total raised from 2005 to 2008 in the run-up to the global financial crisis, Preqin said.

This level of fundraising "reflects the sustained institutional appetite for real estate," said Andrew Moylan, head of real-estate products at Preqin.

But the amount of property for sale hasn't kept pace with the level of demand, a big reason for the accumulation of dry powder, analysts said.

With competition for deals fierce, "it has been much more challenging to invest," said Don Rowlands, head of real estate in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Africa for the London-based law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.

One reason for the lack of property to buy: Landlords aren't willing to sell. Their low debt levels and readily available bank financing have made it easy to hold on to properties longer in hopes of reaping bigger paydays later, analysts said.

After Britain voted to leave the European Union, international investors circled London waiting for bargains. But even there, only a handful of discounted deals emerged.

"There are very few forced sellers," said Guy Grainger, chief executive of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region at Chicago-based property broker JLL.

Commercial-property-investment volumes boomed in recent years as investors hunted for returns greater than the rock-bottom yields offered by government bonds. But last year, the 234.5 billion euros ($248.6 billion) of deals in Europe was down by about 27% from 2015, according to data from Real Capital Analytics, which tracks deals.

Europe's largest property markets -- the U.K., Germany and France -- saw the steepest declines. In the U.K. last year, deal volumes dropped 48% from 2015, Real Capital said. Caution over politics, including the U.S. election, Brexit and a spate of European elections this year, has been part of the drop in deals, analysts said. But a big reason, according to analysts, is the lack of assets to buy.

Deals Show Discipline

In Strategy, CEO Says

BP PLC's recent moves to invest in oil and natural-gas fields off Africa, Egypt and in Indonesia and Abu Dhabi highlight the company's push to be selective about new investments as the industry recovers from the two-year price rout, the company's chief executive said.

Bob Dudley, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting, cited the string of deals as well as BP's deal to buy a stake in the Trion oil field in the Gulf of Mexico as examples of a more disciplined investment strategy that will seek to maintain the cost-cutting strategies the company adopted during the downturn.

"We'll be very selective," he said. "What we don't want to do is lose the discipline we've built in. . . . There are some things we're just not doing," he said.

For example, expensive projects such as deep-water exploration will be undertaken only if infrastructure is in place to serve them, he said.

Some of the most carbon-intensive projects, such as Canadian oil sands, would also not meet the bar, he said.

U.S. PRESIDENCY

Business Leaders Are

Bullish on Trump

U.S. business leaders are optimistic that President-elect Donald Trump will boost economic and job growth, said John Chambers, executive chairman of Cisco Systems Inc.

Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Mr. Chambers brushed aside anxiety over the antiglobalization movement that helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency. That sentiment, he said, was a symptom of anemic U.S. wage growth in recent years that can be fixed by focusing on digital jobs.

"I've been amazed at how short-term-focused the world has suddenly become," Mr. Chambers said. "You don't focus on symptoms, you focus on the underlying issues."

He said that anxiety over some of Mr. Trump's positions on trade and his volatile Twitter persona should be set aside: "Give the new administration time. Let them learn."

Many executives at Davos this year have expressed optimism about the economy under a Trump administration, but have been nervous about a rising antiglobalization sentiment that threatens to erect trade barriers of the type championed by the annual gathering. Among the worries: That the fast pace of economic change is displacing workers faster than they can find new jobs.

-- Sam Schechner and Jason Anders

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

HP CEO: Join Forces

To Ease Job Impact

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. Chief Executive Meg Whitman said the pace of change from technological advances will only accelerate, and the corporate and academic worlds need to better collaborate to address the problem of eliminated jobs.

"Think about the current technology we have and add robotics, more automation, artificial intelligence," said Ms. Whitman, a former eBay Inc. chief executive and Republican California gubernatorial candidate, at a news conference in Davos.

Ms. Whitman said technological innovations would solve climate-change, medical and agricultural issues, but would also eliminate jobs regardless of the age and class of workers.

Ms. Whitman said last year's vote in Britain to leave the European Union and in the U.S. to elect Donald Trump president showed that many people felt left behind by globalization.

She said it was "up to business and academia to manage the transition" and that the current American educational system was "out of step of what's required."

One of the hardest parts of the transition, Ms. Whitman said, is that the new jobs created by technology might not be where people live. "What do we do with the places where [artificial intelligence] is not going to be an employer, autonomous-driving vehicles aren't going to be there?" she said.

BANKING

Deutsche CEO: Banks

Are Too Complicated

Big banks are too complicated to manage properly rather than too big too fail, Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive John Cryan said.

Major global banks "Didn't apply common sense in the past," he said, adding Germany's largest bank was more careful now. "We apply a lot of common sense. We ask ourselves what could go wrong,"

Mr. Cryan is leading a broad restructuring of Germany's largest lender, designed to cut costs and restore long-term stability to the embattled bank.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Mr. Cryan also said central banks' low interest rate policies were tough on banks. Large bond buying programs distort bond and other market price signals, he said.

How finance is being taken over by tech

When the chairman of one of the world s biggest banks was asked recently how technology would change finance, he pointed to the rise of Ant Financial, the digital payments arm of Alibaba, China s ecommerce colossus.

Ant Financial gained about 100m new clients last year, taking its total above 500m, almost 10 times the level of the world s biggest banks. The veteran chairman   who was not willing to be quoted by name   noted that the Chinese group thereby acquired a  huge amount of data  and  a great ability to make credit decisions . The tone of jealousy was hard to miss.

Eric Jing, Ant Financial s chief executive, is due on Thursday to speak alongside other big financial names at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a first-time appearance that illustrates how finance is being upended by digital disruption.

It is a transformation, leading professionals attending Davos have told the Financial Times, that is likely to lead to widespread automation, a blur in the dividing line between finance and technology and, ultimately, widespread sectorial consolidation.

Many expect hundreds of thousands of jobs to be lost and the likes of Ant Financial to make incursions on banks  most valuable businesses, as the old financial order battles to survive.

 I do think employment in finance will decrease and those people working in the industry will be doing very different kinds of jobs,  says Ralph Hamers, chief executive of ING, who in the last few months has announced plans to shed 7,000 of the Dutch bank s 54,000 staff.

Overall, as many as 1.7m jobs are expected to be lost as banks digitise operations over the next decade, Citigroup predicted recently.

This focus on technology s ability to replace human workers in the finance sector, much as robots have taken the place of factory workers for decades, is part of the backdrop to this year s Davos, which meets amid a continuing international backlash against globalisation in the name of the left-behind.

While last year the official agenda celebrated what the forum dubs  the fourth industrial revolution    a fusion of technologies  disrupting almost every industry in every country    this year enthusiasm for such advances is tempered with more discussion at the forum of their social cost.

But, for banks dogged by low margins, automation and technology represent a long-desired chance to boost profitabilit, even if in the longer term they pose a near-existential threat to the banks  old way of business.

This is particularly significant for European banks, whose average return on equity is stuck in the low single digits, far below their 10 per cent-plus cost of capital.

As a result, many institutions are racing to combine new technologies, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and voice recognition, to help provide financial services.

 Because of the computing power now available, we can have much more useful predictions on default rates than we do now, which will allow us to do pre-scoring of customers and make instant lending decisions, both for existing customers and those we don t yet know,  says Mr Hamers.

Automation should allow financial services groups to cut costs as a proportion of revenues by 15 percentage points, according to a study presented in Davos on Tuesday by Oliver Wyman, the consultants.

Bankers predict they will get much better at crunching vast amounts of data to make immediate lending decisions and to provide far more tailored robo-advice to customers.

They are also looking for big savings from blockchain, the shared database system that underpins the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Eight of the world s 10 biggest investment banks are expected to use blockchain to cut 30 per cent of their costs   totalling $8bn-$12bn   according to a study published by Accenture and McLagan on Tuesday

But as banking moves into such activities, the distinction between finance and technology will become less and less clear, presenting established financial institutions with formidable new competitors at a time when they are already under strain.

 For the time being, the likes of Facebook and Google are on the fringes of banking because they don t want to be regulated,  says Francisco Gonzlez, chairman of Spain s BBVA.  But sooner or later they will jump into our arena. They will try to take some parts of the value chain. That is the real challenge. 

Banking in Europe is also expected to be transformed by new EU regulations that will force banks to provide third parties with access to the data of any customers who authorise it.

This should make it much easier for banks to poach their rivals  clients and to offer more products from rivals.

But the regulatory change could also unleash competition for banks from fintech start-ups and big Silicon Valley technology groups.

Oliver Wyman predicts many banks will be left as  component suppliers    producing highly regulated financial services such as loans and savings accounts   while the valuable relationships with their customers are controlled by technology-focused groups acting as  platform providers  and  demand aggregators .

 The traditional boundaries of what industry I m in are fading away,  says Ashok Vaswani, head of Barclays UK.  I m always telling my team that if you aren t eating someone else s lunch, you are doing it wrong. We are technology companies with a balance sheet. 

The technological upheaval will require heavy investment, which is why the final big prediction of the bankers is that there will be big consolidation among banks, particularly in the fragmented European sector.

 What will the banking system look like in five years' time? There will be fewer players. Consolidation will be done by those who have mastered technology,  says Mr Gonzlez.  If you don t master technology you won t survive.

FT REPORT - THE WORLD: 2017
Life-long learning will be crucial in the AI era; Opinion

Artificial intelligence and automation technologies are already starting to affect our work and daily lives. AI is present in everyday objects and processes such as virtual assistants, supermarket checkouts, driverless cars and detecting fraud in credit card transactions.

Disruption is inevitable but it is often deeply feared. The current wave of change, fuelled by technological advancement, is no different. However, like generations before us, we must learn to transcend the disruption and thrive in new times. Changing how we view education is essential to humanity's ability to achieve the best from new technologies.

I recently spoke to graduating students at the University of Queensland in Australia and their excitement was tinged with trepidation about the future. I made three points to them: first, AI - and the resulting automation of industrial and business processes - will affect us all and is here to stay; second, it is in its infancy and there is an immense opportunity to transcend the disruption; third, as AI develops, this disruption will be repeated again and again. The only certain strategy in our world is for us all to become life-long learners.

We are still far from the "society of mind" that Marvin Minsky wrote about in the 1980s, in which many sophisticated instruments of intelligence possessed with faculties of deduction and learning - as well as different ways of representing knowledge and reasoning about it - combine to deliver systems capable of complex, autonomous behaviours. Yet many business leaders already consider AI integral to the future. A recent survey of 1,600 global enterprises by Infosys found that 71 per cent of their leaders feel the adoption of AI in business and society is inevitable; more than three quarters feel AI adoption will deliver positive, wider economic change; a quarter have already fully deployed at least one AI technology.

But I believe humans will not do well if they merely endure such disruptions. Rather, we can play an active part in shaping our collective future and changing our world in a meaningful and purposeful way. Technology can be a great enabling force that amplifies and empowers people, improves the quality of life for all and opens up opportunities for the underprivileged.

For example, at the start of the 20th century 38 per cent of Americans worked on farms. Since then, mechanisation has increased production while reducing the number of employees. Today hired farm workers constitute less than 1 per cent of the US workforce and yet overall employment has soared . Farming jobs have been replaced with new industries - telecoms, health, manufacturing, financial services and more. We work in areas unimaginable to a farmer in the 1900s.

In the same way, AI will affect how we work, the jobs we do and the activities we take part in, both for work and in our free time. It will provide humans with opportunities to create new kinds of experiences and jobs that are unimaginable today, but that have the potential to create trillions of dollars of new value. While intelligent systems may eventually surpass humans in performing well-defined cognitive tasks (such as problem solving), it takes human creativity and ingenuity to "see" the opportunity (such as recognising a problem technology can solve in the first place).

AI can enable us to overcome the limitations of our minds and senses. As my co-chair at the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on AI and Robotics, Professor Missy Cummings of Duke University, says, we are still in the early stages of understanding how intelligent systems can work with people more seamlessly. This would enable both the sharing of work and achieving shared meaning and perspectives. It is not a question of man or machine, but of man and machine. Such collaboration is critical to establishing shared meaning as we have seen in human collaboration for generations.

Breakthroughs can only be achieved if man and machine work together on a set of shared goals. When we achieve such a symbiosis, the potential for our species will be immense.

This story of disruption and transcendence has played out over millennia. But the pace of change is accelerating, necessitating an ever-faster rate of adaptation.

The time has come to rethink education and to recast it as a life-long process. That means we need to move away from rewarding memorisation and instead prize curiosity and experimentation - the building blocks of discovering and understanding the things we do not yet know. Curriculums should be modernised to encourage creative problem finding and solving, and learning through doing, with mandatory computer science learning as the bedrock for enabling digital literacy. Organisations also need to make life-long learning resources available for employees to enhance skills development. Indeed, they should be required to dedicate a percentage of their annual revenue to reskilling staff.

Humans have adapted in part because we have evolved our education systems alongside our technologies: we advanced our capacities to understand our tools. As with reading and writing, being digitally literate is a fundamental need and every child should study computer science.

Today's rapid changes call for a new perspective on education by states and companies. Infosys is rethinking its training infrastructure and augmenting it with, for example, short courses (or "nanodegrees") to help drive the rapid acquisition of new skills, including AI techniques, at scale. We are also introducing company-wide training to help employees reassess the way they approach challenges and identify problems, and to be more creative and bring innovation to everything we do.

These are small starts and governments and businesses need to help develop an approach to life-long learning that will create a more level playing field for people everywhere.

If we can do this, I believe the only limit to our human potential will be the capacity of our imaginations. The AIs of our creation will help us to become more human.

Real Estate
Mall Owners Find Relief From Unlikely Source: Online Retailers; Vacant space in malls is being filled by stores used for pickup and returns of goods bought online, and by online merchants looking to reach new customers

Online retailing has been chipping away at mall revenue for years. Now it is starting to make a contribution as well.

Retailers are converting empty mall space into makeshift distribution centers used for package pickup and returns of goods bought online. At the same time, online merchants are opening physical stores to reach more customers, either via short-term leases in pop-up stores or long-term tenancies like Amazon.com's upcoming move into Manhattan's Time Warner Center.

"We don't view [online retailing] as the enemy, we view it as another distribution channel," said Stephen Lebovitz, chief executive officer of mall owner CBL & Associates. While online sales make up less than 10% of all retail sales today, Mr. Lebovitz said, the number will grow.

More retail centers, including those at town-center locations in smaller cities, are housing Amazon Lockers, which allow Amazon's online customers to pick up and return packages at their convenience. Other online retailers without any physical stores are looking to provide options for their customers to drop off unwanted purchases in person in shopping centers where they can get immediate refunds.

One startup, Happy Returns, accepts in-person returns from participating online retailers at six malls in California, Chicago and Virginia. Its first "return bar" is located in a kiosk at Santa Monica Place, while the other five locations use the host mall's concierge desk. Returned items are sent to a regional processing hub, then on to retailers' fulfillment centers, third-party logistics companies or liquidators.

Happy Returns hopes to build a national network that includes open-air shopping centers, high-end grocery stores and coffee shops and is aiming to have a presence in the top 20 metro areas by 2017, said David Sobie, president and co-founder of the start-up.

Such efforts could provide needed relief to shopping malls across the U.S. as they grapple with a rise of e-commerce and retailer bankruptcies. Vacancy rates in community shopping centers increased in 30 of 77 U.S. metro areas last year, compared with 24 in 2015 and 19 in 2014, according to data from real estate researcher Reis Inc.

Columbus, Ohio-based landlord Washington Prime Group in November started rolling out Amazon Lockers in 50 of its retail centers and is looking to add digital screens that offer coupons and promotions to draw shoppers to restaurants and apparel stores nearby. The idea is to get the customers "into the belly of the beast," said Lou Conforti, Washington Prime's chief executive.

The real estate investment trust, which runs so-called class B and C malls across the country, also is allocating a small portion of space in its portfolio of about 70 million square feet to pop-up stores. The stores have 60- or 90-day leases that typically target new merchants, including those that started their business online.

"We have to be creative,"said Mr. Conforti. "People are so hungry in Middle America for interesting products."

At the Crocker Galleria in downtown San Francisco, the Storenvy Popup, a 1,700 square foot space that started in March 2013, has been an avenue for new merchants to try out physical retailing. Women's clothing retailer TopShelf, for instance, started out in a "fashion truck" in a parking lot but moved into the pop-up space and now occupies a retail storefront in the three-story mall.

"Online merchants are trying to duplicate their online strategy into the physical world, trying to optimize the way customers look for items, gathering feedback about their offline experience," said Mohamed Haouache, chief executive officer of Storefront, an online marketplace for renting short-term retail space.

Amazon, Google and Facebook have rolled out numerous pop-up stores and roadshows around the country showcasing their gadgets, such as speakers with the latest intelligent voice functions (Amazon Echo and Google Home) or virtual reality goggles and wireless controllers (Google's Daydream View and Facebook's Gear VR).

Amazon has been the most active, with 31 pop-up stores in shopping centers around the U.S., and it plans to roll out grocery stores.

Analysts and landlords still expect to see a dip in demand for retail space across the country as more retailers rethink their physical footprint.

"E-commerce doesn't mean the death of the American shopping mall. But there are clearly too many malls in the U.S. and hundreds are likely to close or become irrelevant retail destinations over the coming decade," said Andy McCulloch, managing director of real estate analytics at Green Street Advisors, a research and advisory firm.

Thesys to Build System Tracking All Stock and Options Orders; Database inspired by the May 2010  flash crash'

WASHINGTON Thesys Technologies LLC won the award to operate one of the largest databases ever created, a forensic tool for detecting suspicious trading and investigating the causes of flash crashes in stock markets.

Thesys, a provider of high-speed trading platforms and analytics software, topped two other finalists seeking to build the consolidated audit trail, which will track every stock and options order in the U.S. market, a selection committee of securities exchanges said Tuesday. The ambitious project, which started on the orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflects regulators' struggles to police the fragmented and increasingly automated U.S. stock market, where rapid-fire algorithms create and cancel orders in slivers of a second.

The milestone means a committee of nine exchange operators that selected Thesys must quickly strike a contract with the small firm to build the repository, known as the CAT. The plan for the system calls for the CAT to begin receiving trading data from the exchanges by November.

Thesys was widely seen as an underdog to another bidder, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to run the audit trail. The SEC called for the system after the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303919504577520723010703272"" when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted nearly 1,000 points before quickly rebounding. It took the SEC more than four months to reconstruct trading on that chaotic day, mostly because it lacked quick access to granular order data.

The announcement was a clear loss for Finra and its new chief executive officer, Robert Cook, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-industry-regulatory-authority-selects-robert-cook-as-new-ceo-1465831385". Finra was seen as the favorite because it is the front-line regulator of U.S. brokerages and is directly overseen by the SEC. It has experience running complex trade-reporting systems, including "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-approves-new-treasury-tracker-1476886180", and is required to comply with SEC data-security standards.

"For the SEC, there is a deep and long-established track record in dealing with them," said James Burns, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and former top SEC official. "They would have been responsible to the SEC on two levels: contractually, and the SEC is their regulator."

Finra in a statement said it would continue to cooperate with the CAT developers because the data would still be useful for its regulatory duties. "Finra remains committed to its robust program of cross-market surveillance and looks forward to enhancing that oversight with the uniform, comprehensive data that the CAT will provide," the organization said.

Thesys is a subsidiary of Red Bank, N.J.-based Tradeworx Inc., which supplies trading platforms to both exchanges and traders. In 2012, the SEC contracted with Tradeworx to acquire the Market Information Data Analytics System, or Midas, which collects about one billion trading records a day from 13 U.S. stock exchanges.

"We are extremely excited about the opportunity to bring our technology solutions to bear in creating the best CAT solution we can for the industry," said Mike Beller, Thesys's managing partner. Its partners on the bid include International Business Machines Corp., Latham & Watkins LLP and Rosenblatt Securities Inc.

Unlike Midas, which the SEC acquired and began using to monitor the market within a period of months, the CAT project has been "http://www.wsj.com/articles/flash-crash-overhaul-is-snarled-in-red-tape-1430868811", as industry representatives overseeing it have haggled over everything from its cost to the data-security requirements for a system that will include details about individual customers. Under a plan approved by the SEC, the system is supposed to be largely operational by 2018, when the largest U.S. brokers start reporting activity to it.

The CAT has become even more critical in recent years as exchange technology snafus and haywire trading algorithms have occasionally caused market mayhem. A wild trading session on Aug. 24, 2015, forced hundreds of trading halts across stocks and exchange-traded funds and caused many ETFs to trade at sharp discounts to the sum of their holdings, worsening losses for many fundholders who sold during the panic.

Thesys and the exchanges will also have to navigate concerns that the CAT will become a prime target for hackers, because the repository will include information about the customers behind trades. Brokers and traders have worried that if an intruder pilfered CAT data, they could use it to replicate trading strategies or know when to trade ahead of big investors such as mutual funds.

"You are going to have a historical database of every single customer, firm and market maker in one location, and I can't think of a bigger target," said Joanna Fields, the founder of Aplomb Strategies and former head of U.S. market structure for Deutsche Bank Securities.

Negotiations between the selection committee and Finra broke down in recent weeks because the two sides couldn't agree who would be responsible in the event of a cyberattack in which personal information leaked out, according to people familiar with the matter. The exchanges wanted to be shielded from liability, but Finra wanted them to share responsibility, including for legal costs and damages, the people said.

Mr. Beller declined to comment on the specifics of Thesys's negotiations with the exchanges.

In addition to Thesys and Finra, the other finalist to build the CAT was SunGard, a financial-software developer owned by Fidelity National Information Services Inc.

Top-Ranked Dutch Firm Waterland to Open U.K. Office

Waterland Private Equity Investments is set to open an office in the U.K., Hans Scheepers, a managing partner at the Dutch midmarket firm, told U.K. sister publication Private Equity News.

The decision to open a Manchester office, which will focus on helping lower midmarket companies expand across Europe, came before the U.K. vote to leave the European Union. But, Mr. Scheepers, said Britain's exit would help the firm's investment strategy.

"We believe that the Brexit vote will present significant investment opportunities in the U.K.," he said. "We can help U.K. companies pursue European growth strategies. By doing this, it will create a natural hedge for them so that they not only have revenues and acquisition financing in sterling but also in euros.

Mr. Scheepers added there might be a "short lived opportunity" investing part of a euro denominated fund in pound sterling, which he said is "significantly cheaper" than before the Brexit vote. However, he said Waterland would approach some sectors with caution, particularly those that were reliant on consumer spending.

Waterland was recently ranked as the top-performing private-equity firm in the world in rankings compiled by private-equity analytics firm Peracs.

The firm knocked heavy-hitting U.S. technology investor Vista Equity Partners off top spot, with four of Waterland's funds having a top quartile ranking, according to Preqin Ltd.

Since the firm was founded by Dutch entrepreneur Rob Thielen in 1999, investors in its funds have received nearly twice the amount of money back than they would have done if they had invested in the average private-equity firm during the same period, Peracs found.

Mr. Scheepers described the decision to open an office in the U.K. as "the natural next step in the firm's expansion strategy".

Waterland did its first direct deal in the U.K. in October 2016 but hasn't yet released details. The firm's first platform investment follows five previous add-on deals in which Waterland-backed companies on the continent bought U.K. based firms as part of a buy-and-build strategy.

The firm, founded in the Netherlands in 1999, has slowly been expanding its investment strategy across Europe, opening offices in Dsseldorf in 2004, Antwerp in 2005, followed by Warsaw in 2012 and Munich in 2013.

The Manchester office would source "direct platform transactions" in the U.K., Mr. Scheepers said, with the firm looking to expand U.K.-based lower-mid market companies across Europe, in line with the wider buy-and-build strategy it has employed so successfully.

The rationale behind the move was that Waterland believed that companies in the lower midmarket in the U.K. were underserved when it came to having access to private-equity firms that can help them expand across Europe, Mr. Scheepers explained.

Mr. Scheepers will assume responsibility for setting up and supporting the development of the office, alongside two hires. The firm has recruited Ryan Hallworth, formerly of corporate finance house DC Advisory, as a senior investment manager, alongside an associate.

Mr. Scheepers said Waterland was planning to hire in the first half of 2017 an executive to head up the office, with a view to hiring half a dozen or so investment professionals during the next 12 months. The firm is currently investing its sixth buyout fund; a  1.25 billion ($1.34 billion) core fund with an additional  300 million overflow fund raised back in 2015.

There was no set amount of capital that the firm had to invest in specific countries and the firm would continue to invest on a "case-by-case" basis, Mr. Scheepers said.

The fund typically puts between  10 million and  40 million equity into deals, with similar amounts of capital put to work in bolt-on deals.

Catching the CAT is Next Step in Finra's Evolution

If everything goes according to plan, a committee of stock and options exchanges will announce Tuesday who will build the government's latest supercomputer: the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-to-vote-on-consolidated-audit-trail-to-detect-market-manipulation-1479240411".

Of the three finalists to build the CAT, one is the clear favorite: the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Finra, Wall Street's self-overseer, is the frontline regulator of U.S. brokerages. It has strived in recent years to automate its surveillance of equity and options markets, consulting a range of technology experts to help build and operate the CAT.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the CAT's construction after regulators struggled to explain the causes of the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704029304575526390131916792", when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 1,000 points before quickly rebounding. Simply put, the SEC in 2010 lacked the information needed to quickly analyze the chaotic trading session. In response, it proposed a massive supercomputer to track the lifecycle of every stock and options order, including data on the identity of brokers' customers.

Finra is well positioned to operate the CAT, given its history as a quasi-governmental market regulator that reports to the SEC. While Finra began as a voluntary association of over-the-counter brokers, it has become a sort of deputy for the SEC in recent decades. It proposes and enforces regulations, fines wrongdoers and monitors markets for insider trading.

The other bidders SunGard Data Systems Inc. and Thesys Technologies LLC are private companies. To be sure, they are on the cutting edge of trading technology. But the exchanges that will pick the winning bid are, like Finra, self-regulatory organizations. In recent years they have contracted with Finra to handle nearly all of their regulatory duties. Setting aside variation in the cost of bids and assuming they are all technically feasible, it seems likely that exchanges will once again pick Finra, this time to build the most comprehensive repository of stock and options orders.

Finra has experience dealing with and learning from the risks inherent in big technology projects. Two years ago, it backed away from an ambitious project known as Cards, for Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System. Cards was supposed to automate Finra's hunt for broker practices that can be harmful to investors, but the project was dropped after some lawmakers and many brokers complained it would become a target for hackers. The brokerage industry has raised the same concerns about the CAT, which is more expansive than Cards would have been.

Tuesday's announcement is important for Finra's future. Winning the bid and operating the CAT would cement Finra's indispensability to the U.S. regulatory system. In fact, if Wall Street's self-regulator doesn't win the award, it's fair to ask what went wrong with its bid.

By Gabriel T. Rubin and Rachel Witkowski

WASHINGTON Congressional Republicans are moving quickly to lay the groundwork for an aggressive financial deregulation agenda, passing a half-dozen related measures in the first two weeks of the year as they look ahead to launching a broader overhaul next month.

Following President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to unwind Obama-era financial laws, the House has opened the congressional session that began Jan. 3 by passing bills that would create new hurdles in rulemaking for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The House also passed a more significant bill called the Reins Act that would require congressional approval of major federal rulemaking. That move is teeing up a much larger GOP strategy to repeal regulations like the landmark Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.

Congressional review of rules needs to happen "early and often," Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) told WSJ Pro Financial Regulation in a brief interview Friday. Mr. Hensarling, who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said he sees the Reins Act as the first step toward passing his own Dodd-Frank replacement bill "and it needs to be done as early as possible."

While Republican congressional leaders are for now focused on higher-priority goals like repealing President Barack Obama's health law, Mr. Hensarling and others are moving equally aggressively on financial deregulation, hoping to lay the groundwork for that as well.

In an interview with Fox News radio, Mr. Hensarling said that "Dodd-Frank is to household finances what Obamacare is to household health care."

Republican control of both the White House and Congress means the deregulatory measures passed this month by the House have a greater chance of becoming law than they did in previous years, now that there's a president sharing GOP lawmakers' objectives. But it's unclear when, or if, the Senate might take up the measures, or what the prospects would be in that chamber, given the requirement there for at least some Democratic votes to pass bills.

The bills chosen so far in the House were ones that had passed the chamber in earlier years, so it was easier to move them out the gate with the new Congress. Under one, the CFTC would have to obtain a subpoena before it could collect computer source code from algorithmic trading firms, and the SEC would have to do additional cost-benefit analysis before completing new regulations.

The House also passed a larger bill last week that would require agencies to adopt the lowest-cost versions of rules and to publicly post detailed information on rule proposals for extended periods, among other changes.

All of the GOP moves precede a coming effort to roll back "midnight regulations" put in place by the Obama administration. Under the 1996 Congressional Review Act, only simple majorities are required to block rules that have been promulgated within 60 congressional "session days." That puts any rule finalized since May in the crosshairs of Republican leaders. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that under a timetable fixed by legislative procedures, lawmakers could start voting to repeal specific rules as soon as Jan. 30.

Following that effort, Republicans are expected to move forward on more ambitious legislation to repeal and replace the main financial regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis.

The Financial Services Committee will consider an updated version of Mr. Hensarling's Financial Choice Act, which first passed the House last year. The legislation would make major changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, including revamping the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R., Mo.), who was recently named to lead the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, said the full committee is expected to mark up the Choice Act by mid-February and the bill could hit the House floor in the second quarter.

The Choice Act is "a priority of leadership to get it to the floor as quickly as possible, and the new administration wants it out of the House and out of the Senate as quickly as possible," Mr. Luetkemeyer said in an interview with WSJ Pro Financial Regulation.

The sweeping changes to the legislative policy and financial laws face Democratic opposition in the Senate, and it is unclear whether they would be able to win enough Democratic votes to overcome a filibuster delay strategy that could block a vote.

Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, blasted the GOP deregulation push in a statement, saying the changes to a regulatory process would "seriously undermine critical protections across every regulated industry, including consumers' health and product safety, environmental protections, workplace safety and consumer financial protections."

How a Financial Council Republicans Loathe Could Work in Their Favor

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON Republicans have for years trashed a powerful regulatory committee born after the financial crisis as too political, opaque, and overreaching. But once a GOP administration takes control of the panel, they may find its broad remit useful in quickly scaling back Obama-era policies.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of 15 state and federal officials, was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law as a single entity watching the health of the full financial system something some felt was missing in the crisis.

It is chaired by the Treasury secretary. The two men who have held that post under President Barack Obama have used its authority to expand oversight of big non-banks from insurers to investment funds.

President-elect Donald Trump's choice to fill the job, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Steven Mnuchin, has criticized Dodd-Frank, and could reverse the committee's agenda.

"FSOC up to now has focused on where regulation could be strengthened and increased, but could easily focus on where regulation should be streamlined," said David Portilla, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP who worked for FSOC.

Mr. Trump's team has talked about a broad regulatory rollback. Much of that agenda will be time-consuming and require congressional approval. But some changes can be done quickly and unilaterally, once Mr. Trump has his regulatory team in place. These include freezing not-yet-completed rules, relaxing enforcement of existing ones and repurposing FSOC.

Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Mnuchin, whose Senate confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday, have spoken publicly specifically about FSOC. But Mr. Trump has populated his "landing team" in charge of overseeing the transition of power at FSOC with some of its loudest critics.

Alex Pollock, a fellow at the conservative think tank R Street Institute, has said FSOC lacks credibility, saying it has not sounded enough alarm on risks from government-sponsored financial market players like housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or the Federal Reserve.

Kyle Hauptmann, another FSOC landing team member, is executive director of the Main Street Growth Project, an advocacy group whose website calls FSOC a "rogue regulator" and asks readers to "Sock Back at FSOC" by telling Congress to curtail its power or abolish it.

Republicans have proposed repealing some of FSOC's authority, including in a bill from House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Tex.) that is expected to serve as a starting point for a debate on changing Dodd-Frank this year.

Yet, Republicans could instead maintain FSOC's authority and use it for different aims. Consider the powers it grants the Treasury secretary:

  As chair of FSOC whose members include the chairs of the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission Mr. Mnuchin can convene a meeting of the top financial regulators at any time, and set the agenda. The Treasury controls a staff of about 20, known as the Secretariat, which drives the regular meetings of FSOC and its five subcommittees. Financial regulators are independent from the Treasury, but by placing an item on the agenda of an FSOC meeting, the Secretariat can effectively force staff at financial regulators to focus on it.

 FSOC can make public statements or recommendations that have a name-and-shame effect. Mr. Obama's first Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, successfully pushed for FSOC to draft recommendations for the SEC to more tightly regulate money market mutual funds. Under his successor, Jacob Lew, FSOC conducted a yearslong investigation of the asset-management industry. In both cases, the SEC acted in response.

Mr. Mnuchin's FSOC could issue reports or recommendations on the need for cost-benefit analysis of regulations, the impact of regulations on the economy, or the future of Fannie and Freddie.

FSOC doesn't have "the most powerful tools," Mr. Lew said in a recent interview, but it can convene regulators "to have sensible coordination and conversation."

  FSOC's greatest power is to designate "systemically important" financial firms outside the banking system for stricter federal oversight. It also has the power to remove that label once a firm has been designated -- a step it already took with GE Capital, the financing arm of General Electric Co., after that firm shrunk significantly. Mr. Mnuchin's FSOC could rescind the designations of two current "systemic" insurance firms, Prudential Financial Inc. and American International Group Inc. and drop an effort in the courts to reinstate the label on a third, MetLife, Inc.

Mr. Mnuchin could also push FSOC to rewrite its policies in a way that would make it easier for companies to avoid "systemic" designations in the future.

 If Mr. Mnuchin sympathizes with FSOC detractors, he could call fewer meetings with lighter agendas, essentially letting the council die on the vine. By law, FSOC must meet at least quarterly. During the Obama administration, FSOC has met roughly every six weeks, while staff subcommittees generally meet every two weeks.

Appointment of Trump's Economic Policy Team Faces Delays

By Nick Timiraos

Several of President-elect Donald Trump's top economic policy jobs may go unfilled for days or even weeks after he is sworn in Friday, potentially slowing his pursuit of an ambitious domestic policy agenda that includes an overhaul of the tax code, repeal of the Affordable Care Act, infrastructure spending and broad deregulation.

Mr. Trump faces delays in the confirmation of the Treasury, commerce and labor secretaries and the budget director. The hearing for Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's intended nominee for Treasury secretary, is set for Thursday, the day before inauguration.

Committees delayed hearings set last week for Wilbur Ross Jr., the intended nominee for commerce secretary, until Wednesday, and for Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump's pick for labor secretary, until February. Hearings for Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.), tapped as the budget director, haven't been set.

Other selections still haven't been announced. Mr. Trump hasn't said who he will name as agriculture secretary and the new administration hasn't tapped anyone to chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Transition officials considered CNBC commentator Lawrence Kudlow for the job, but he appears unlikely to receive the post because he has been critical of Mr. Trump's trade positions, according to a person familiar with the discussion.

"It's going to be a challenge. People are going to have to get up to speed very quickly," said Jacob Lew, the outgoing Treasury secretary, in an interview last week.

The delays are due in part to routine vetting by congressional committees. Democratic opposition hasn't proven to be a setback yet, though partisan roadblocks could further slow the process. Senate committees began confirmation proceedings for seven of Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees last week, including his picks for attorney general and the secretaries of state and defense.

Such delays aren't unprecedented. In 2009, Congress delayed the hearing of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner until the day after President Barack Obama's inauguration, when the Senate Finance Committee's review of Mr. Geithner's tax returns showed he had failed to pay more than $34,000 in federal taxes over several years. Mr. Geithner said those had been innocent mistakes, and he was confirmed less than a week after inauguration of that year.

Mr. Geithner later saw top picks for key Treasury posts withdraw from consideration, prompting Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman advising Mr. Obama on economic issues, to call the lack of staff "shameful."

Mr. Obama's first two picks for commerce secretary also withdrew from consideration, and the position remained vacant until late March. Tax issues also led Mr. Obama's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, former Sen. Tom Daschle, to withdraw from consideration.

Until Mr. Geithner's delay, Treasury secretaries for incoming administrations had been confirmed on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21, extending back through the Carter administration. Likewise, the budget director has traditionally been confirmed within one week of the inauguration.

Any confirmation delay could be especially important shaping the initial proposals advanced by the administration given Mr. Mnuchin's desire for the Treasury to serve as the locus of economic policy-making. The same goes for regulatory policy and Mr. Mulvaney, given the central role the Office of Management and Budget plays in finalizing new regulations and unraveling old ones.

Mr. Trump has appointed several economic advisers to West Wing positions that don't require Senate confirmation, including former Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn as the director of the National Economic Council and economist Peter Navarro to lead a new National Trade Council. If it takes longer for cabinet nominees to be seated, those West Wing advisers and their deputies could play an even greater role in shepherding policy.

Trump transition officials didn't respond to requests for comment.

While the U.S. economy doesn't face the same crisis that Mr. Obama inherited upon his inauguration eight years ago, the Treasury Department will assume responsibility for a series of international financial challenges that have required constant attention in recent months, including capital flight from China, the still-shaky state of European banks and potential economic turbulence in Brazil and Mexico.

Other tasks could become pressing. Officials will have to prepare a budget proposal by February laying out their plans for the domestic economy and may have to take special measures to avoid breaching the federal debt ceiling after mid-March, when a suspension of that ceiling expires.

The Treasury will also have to prepare the semiannual foreign-exchange report due in April, in which Mr. Trump has promised to take issue with what he has said is China's effort to gain an unfair trade advantage through currency intervention.

"You do not know what is going to happen in the world, particularly in the post-9/11 world, where economics should be seen as a part of national security," said Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration who is now managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisers LLC.

If Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary-designate, isn't confirmed by Friday, another Treasury official would become acting secretary. That role is likely to be taken by Adam Szubin, the acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, according to people familiar with the matter.

Confirmation delays could reflect the intricate finances of the businessmen selected by Mr. Trump, requiring more preparation for Senate aides tasked with combing through financial disclosures.

"You've never had this many people with these complicated financial disclosures all at once," said Mr. Myrow. Delays could also arise if the Trump transition team announced nominees before having cabinet picks submit extensive paperwork required, including tax returns, for congressional committees to review, he said.

WSJ Pro: ECB Survey Suggests Easing Credit Conditions in Eurozone

By Todd Buell

FRANKFURT Eurozone banks expect credit standards to ease in the current quarter, while demand for funding is also expected to pick up, a quarterly survey showed Tuesday, offering policy makers signs of economic vitality as they meet here this week.

An overwhelming majority said that standards remained broadly unchanged, the European Central Bank's latest Bank Lending Survey found.

For the current quarter, banks expect a net easing of credit standards for all categories, according to the survey. This includes corporate loans, housing loans and consumer credit.

Analysts said the results showed a steady firming of growth in the eurozone, while revealing a worrying low level of borrowing to fund new projects.

"For now, business loan demand is failing to pick up steam," said Teunis Brosens an economist at ING Bank.

The results will still probably be welcome news for the ECB's policy-setting Governing Council as it gathers here for its meeting. The Council is expected to leave policy unchanged after agreeing in December to extend its asset-purchase program until the end of this year, albeit at a lower volume from April. The ECB will announce its policy decision on Thursday.

The eurozone economy is generally more reliant on bank lending than the U.S., meaning that weak bank health and reluctance to lend can be a significant hindrance to growth in the currency bloc. The ECB has tried to set policy since the onset of the economic crisis in a way to ease conditions for banks to allow them to lend to households and firms.

The ECB survey, which polls lenders across the currency bloc, did show that in aggregate terms more banks said they had tightened standards on loans to companies in the fourth quarter than eased.

This was the first tightening of standards for business loans since the fourth quarter of 2013, though the shift was "driven mainly by developments in the Netherlands," the ECB said.

The ECB survey expresses its results in terms of "net percentage", which means the difference between the share of banks that report a tightening of standards versus those that report an easing.

The survey showed that a bigger share of banks reported an increase in demand for business loans in the fourth quarter than a decrease, though still about 70% reported no change.

Banks expect this positive trend to continue in the early parts of this year. Net demand for housing loans and for consumer credit was up significantly in the fourth quarter.

"For the first quarter of 2017, banks expected a continuing increase in net demand for housing loans and consumer credit," the survey said.

U.K. Leader to Seek Clean Break From EU

By Jenny Gross

LONDON Prime Minister Theresa May is set to declare Tuesday that the U.K. wants a clean break from the European Union, in a closely watched speech in which she is expected to lay out her plans for the divorce.

Mrs. May is expected to say that Britain doesn't want "partial membership" in the EU "or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out," according to excerpts of a speech released by her office on Monday.

Previous such comments, interpreted to mean that Britain is heading toward a looser relationship with the EU and could lose access to the bloc's common market, sent the pound tumbling. The currency dropped to three-month lows against the dollar in European markets Monday.

"We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave," Mrs. May's prepared remarks said. Instead, Britain will seek a new type of relationship with the EU, according to the remarks. The prime minister is to deliver the address to a group of diplomats and other officials in London on Tuesday.

The prime minister has repeatedly said London wants to control immigration. EU leaders have said the U.K. can't impose restrictions on EU citizens' ability to live and work in the U.K. and retain its existing economic relationship, which includes unfettered access to the EU's market of 440 million consumers.

The speech excerpts released by her office made no reference to the single market.

Politicians who campaigned for Brexit said the U.K. will be better off once it is outside the single market and can negotiate its own trade deals with countries elsewhere. They say the U.K. will thrive if it is no longer bound to EU regulations and required to abide by the bloc's free movement of people principle.

Tim Farron, leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, said that Mrs. May is delivering "a destructive, hard Brexit and the consequences will be felt by millions of people through higher prices, greater instability and rising fuel costs."

In recent weeks, Mrs. May has come under increasing pressure to spell out details of her vision for Britain's exit as the country prepares to give formal notice at the end of March that it will leave.

Mrs. May has broadly outlined her priorities. In addition to immigration, she has said she wants to remove the U.K. from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while maintaining good trading terms with Europe. She hasn't said whether she wants to stay in Europe's single market.

"We want to buy your goods, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship," Mrs. May will say, according to the excerpts. She will also say she wants the U.K. post-Brexit to be "a magnet for international talent."

"I want us to be a truly global Britain the best friend and neighbor to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too," she is expected to say.

Negotiations between Britain and the remaining 27 EU governments are expected to be lengthy and contentious.

In a boost for Brexit supporters, President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview with the Times of London that the U.S. would work hard to come to a quick trade deal with the U.K. Downing Street welcomed those comments on Monday, saying a U.K.-U.S. trade deal is one of the opportunities of Britain's exit from the EU.

Past trade deals have taken years to complete, and some officials have cast doubt on whether the U.K. can quickly hammer out a quick trade deal with the U.S.

WSJ Pro: Chinese Insurers Scale Back Risky Products as New Rules Bite

By Chao Deng

China's clampdown on high-yielding insurance products is taking a bite out of one high-profile issuer and the network of domestic banks that has helped to peddle them.

Analysts say the withdrawal of a property insurance product by Anbang Insurance Group Co. is evidence that recent regulations by the insurance regulator are having an impact on the industry.

A person familiar with the situation said the firm had by Jan. 5 stopped selling "Anbang Win-Win #3," a three-year product that yielded more than 5% annually and had been distributed by China's largest banks. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Industrial Bank Co. and China Merchants Bank are among the banks that have stopped selling the policy, according to a local media report by Caixin.

China's insurance regulator has been trying to rein in sales of wealth-management products that insurers have masked as universal life products. Authorities view the products as risky because insurers have taken the proceeds to pump into stocks and property as well as investment overseas. Such activity, analysts say, puts the nation's financial system at risk if investments go under or insurers abuse their newfound power in listed firms.

While the policy that Anbang pulled is a property policy, it typifies the kind of high-yielding products regulators are trying to curb and shows the firm is falling in line with the spirit of the law, according to analysts.

The insurance regulator said in late December that it will bar insurers from opening new subsidiaries within one year if premiums on their short-term savings products account for more than 50% of their total premium income in the current quarter. This followed a tightening round in September, in which insurers were given a grace period until 2019 to lower their share of short- and medium-term products to below 50% of total premiums.

"I think [the rules] are very strong incentive for insurers to stop selling these short-term universal life products," said Sally Yim, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service in Hong Kong. "Insurers will have to expand less quickly and if they still want to open new branches, they have to meet the requirement for that 50% rule."

The person familiar with the matter said that the pulling of Win-Win #3 was a regular part of Anbang's product renewal cycle and that the deadline was communicated to users of Anbang's mobile app.

Moody's Agrees to Settle Financial Crisis-Era Claims for $864 Million

By Aruna Viswanatha and Josh Beckerman

Moody's Corp. said Friday it agreed to pay $864 million to the U.S. Department of Justice and several states in connection with bond grades it issued before the 2008 housing-market collapse.

The agreement marks what is expected to be the last in a series of deals in the waning days of President Barack Obama's administration closing investigations into the financial crisis.

Late last month, the Justice Department struck multibillion-dollar settlements with Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG over toxic securities and separately filed a lawsuit against Barclays PLC alleging misconduct in billions of dollars in mortgage securities sold in the mid-2000s.

Barclays said it would seek to dismiss the case and said it believed the claims were "disconnected from the facts."

Moody's had said in October it expected the Justice Department to sue the company in connection with its mortgage-bond ratings, but many companies and government officials have scrambled to close out long-running investigations in advance of President-elect Donald Trump taking office next week.

"Moody's failed to adhere to its own credit rating standards and fell short on its pledge of transparency in the run-up to the Great Recession," said Bill Baer, the Justice Department's No. 3 official.

Moody's said in a statement it determined the agreement removed "significant legacy legal risk" and avoided "costs and uncertainty associated with continued investigations and litigation." The firm said it "stands behind" the integrity of its ratings and methodologies.

The firm said in the agreement that it, at times, deviated from methodologies it said it would use to rate mortgage bonds and used a more lenient standard on some complicated bonds than it had disclosed.

Moody's didn't admit in the out-of-court settlement that the conduct violated the law.

"Moody's stands behind the integrity of its ratings, methodologies and processes, and the settlement contains no finding of any violation of law, nor any admission of liability," it said.

Nearly every top global bank has paid tens of billions of dollars to resolve claims that they packaged risky mortgages into securities and marketed them to investors as safer than they knew them to be. Ratings firms, which gave many of the bonds top grades, had initially eluded liability and argued their analysis was protected as free speech under the First Amendment.

After fighting a Justice Department lawsuit for two years, Moody's rival, S&P Global Ratings, agreed in 2015 to pay $1.5 billion to resolve similar claims.

The Moody's settlement includes a $437.5 million civil penalty to the Justice Department and $426.3 million to 21 states and the District of Columbia.

Moody's said it would record the financial impact of the payments in its fourth-quarter 2016 results. It estimated the impact of an after-tax charge of about $702 million, or about $3.62 a share.

Under the pact, Moody's agreed to maintain multiple policy changes, including separating its commercial and credit-rating functions and exclude analysts from any commercial discussions.

Zohar CLO Funds Target Lynn Tilton in $1 Billion Lawsuit

By Peg Brickley

The Zohar investment funds at the heart of Lynn Tilton's $2.5 billion distressed-debt empire sued their founder Monday, accusing Ms. Tilton of pillaging more than $1 billion from investors and the troubled companies she manages.

Through a "toxic mix of fraud, theft and mismanagement," Ms. Tilton stole money from the Zohar funds and from the troubled companies, siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars in fees and assets from a souring loan portfolio and failing businesses, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in New York.

The Zohar funds are collateralized loan obligations created by Ms. Tilton and packed with loans to troubled companies managed by her and her New York-based Patriarch Partners investment firm. Their lawsuit claims that Patriarch Partners was essentially a black box, and only Ms. Tilton knew what was inside. Once the Zohar financial machinery began to falter, Ms. Tilton stepped away and new managers got a look at the books.

Ms. Tilton, under the guise of multiple companies that the lawsuit calls "the Patriarch Enterprise," was running a racket, not a turnaround empire, the funds allege.

"The Patriarch Enterprise's repeated, continuous, and flagrant violations of law constitute a pattern of racketeering activity' in violation of civil racketeering laws, according to the lawsuit. "Their racketeering activities, both individually and collectively, have been ongoing since at least 2006 and pose a serious threat of continuing criminal conduct into the foreseeable future."

A Tilton spokesman said Monday he was not immediately able to comment on the lawsuit. Ms. Tilton in the past has defended her handling of the investment funds and the companies, denying any wrongdoing or improper fees.

Fraud allegations have been mounting for months against the flashy financier with an Ivy League education and a Wall Street background. She is already battling fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a lawsuit from a German bank Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, or Nord.

The SEC and the German bank each accuse her of mishandling the Zohar funds, collateralized loan obligation vehicles Ms. Tilton created to attract investor dollars into the risky business of lending to troubled companies. A decision is awaited on the SEC charges, which she denies, and on Ms. Tilton's bid to squash the Nord suit.

Ms. Tilton created the first Zohar fund in 2003 and ran all three until March 2016, when she resigned. She has said she has put more than $440 million of her own funds into the Zohar funds and the Patriarch collection of troubled companies.

The first Zohar fund defaulted in 2015, a second is due to default this month, and new managers of the funds that took over when Ms. Tilton resigned, Alvarez & Marsal, want her to give back hundreds of millions of dollars she allegedly pilfered and to relinquish her claims on the companies. Investors believe there's significant value in the portfolio companies, and have sued to oust her from control so they can sell or restructure the businesses.

"While Ms. Tilton has made herself famously wealthy, she has left nothing but losses in her wake for the Zohar Fund investors who trusted in her integrity and promises," according to the lawsuit.

The new suit may be the toughest test yet for Ms. Tilton, who kept the financial details of her turnaround operation under wraps for years. From their post as fund managers, Alvarez & Marsal got an inside look at Ms. Tilton's Patriarch Partners investment and management firm, an array of at least 20 different units, the workings of which had long been kept from public view.

Ms. Tilton wooed ratings firms and investors, based on her talent for spotting value in well known but financially troubled companies like Rand McNally and Spiegel. Using Zohar funds, she gained control of them, and worked to bring them back to financial health. Interviewed by Barbara Walters, pictured with furs and helicopters for magazine and newspaper profiles some glowing, some damning Ms. Tilton was the bejeweled, leather-clad, smiling public face of what was for over a decade a very private business.

Not even investors knew exactly what was in the Zohar funds, multiple sources told The Wall Street Journal. In 2015, SEC charges of fraud opened a crack in the facade, and lawyers for Nord, a German bank that lost money on its Zohar investments, began piecing together information and found what appeared to be equity in funds that were supposed to be composed of less-risky debt investments.

Ms. Tilton has said investors banked on her talent for spotting turnaround candidates and restoring them to financial health. That took time, money and commitment, she said. In defending herself in the SEC case, she argued she was entitled to amend loan terms to give distressed businesses more time to recover. That discretion, she said, benefited the Zohar investors as well as the companies.

There were successes in what was generally known as the Patriarch portfolio of businesses, and they paid dividends. But the Zohar funds never saw those dividends, according to new fund manager Alvarez & Marsal. Instead, Ms. Tilton claimed the dividends as owner of the companies, according to the new Zohar suit.

Who owns the companies in the Patriarch portfolio is a question that's already being fought over in courts in New York, where Nord sued, and Delaware, where Alvarez & Marsal sued. Nord says it was bilked into investing in equity in troubled companies, as opposed to debt, which carries less risk in a workout situation. Ms. Tilton says the Zohar investors knew full well they were getting equity as part of their investment. She has moved to have the Nord case thrown out.

In Delaware, Alvarez & Marsal has moved to oust Ms. Tilton from control of some of the more valuable companies, including game-controller maker PDP, on the grounds that the Zohar funds own the businesses. In response to Alvarez & Marsal, Ms. Tilton insists she owns the businesses, and has the irrevocable right to control them.

Who owns the companies is an important point, since warding off a default in the last Zohar fund, which comes due in 2019, likely means selling the businesses, or taking other action to refurbish them. Ms. Tilton has said she put more than $440 million into the companies and Zohar funds, but was not willing to continue financing the portfolio companies once she had relinquished control of the loan funds.

However, for months after Ms. Tilton handed over control of the Zohar funds to Alvarez & Marsal, Patriarch-run businesses allegedly refused to accept calls from their lender. Executives of several portfolio companies directed all inquiries to Patriarch, a lawyer for the Zohar funds told a Delaware judge last year.

The judge ordered Ms. Tilton and Patriarch to start handing over documents, a decision she's still appealing.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the Zohar complaint alleges some $100 million of dividends were diverted. No figure was cited in the lawsuit.

Supreme Court to Review Time Limits on SEC  Disgorgements'

By Brent Kendall and Jess Bravin

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court said Friday it would decide whether employers can prohibit groups of workers from suing over labor disputes by requiring each employee to submit individual claims through private arbitration.

The case was one of 13 new matters the justices added to their docket, breaking with a monthslong pattern in which the court operating with an open seat that leaves it more vulnerable to tie votes has generally accepted few new cases for review. Among the other new cases is one examining the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission to relax time limits for requiring money managers and others to forfeit ill-gotten gains from fraudulent conduct.

The arbitration case amounts to a dispute over which of two federal laws takes precedence: the National Labor Relations Act, which authorizes employees to take collective action for "mutual aid or protection," or the Federal Arbitration Act, which provides that arbitration clauses generally are "valid, irrevocable and enforceable."

The Supreme Court in a series of pro-business rulings has given wide sweep to arbitration clauses, and companies have been expanding use of the device to funnel consumer and employee disputes into private arbitration and out of court.

Businesses say arbitration is cheaper and more efficient than suits in court. Consumer and labor groups say the private forum is stacked against them and prevents public disclosure of alleged corporate misconduct. The groups also say it effectively eliminates the opportunity to bring class-actions where a large number of individuals sue collectively.

The high court took up three different disputes that examine the use of arbitration in employment agreements and will consider them in one consolidated case. Lower courts are divided on the enforceability of arbitration clauses in the labor context.

One dispute involves an appeal by the National Labor Relations Board, which said an arbitration agreement imposed by Murphy USA Inc. violated the rights of gas station workers who wanted to sue over alleged labor violations. A federal appeals court in New Orleans disagreed and sided with the company.

A different appeals court sided with workers at accounting firm Ernst & Young who wanted to bring collective claims for overtime in court instead of being forced into arbitration. The third case involves an appeal by Epic Systems Corp., a health-care software company, after a lower court ruled its arbitration clause couldn't prevent workers from joining together to bring wage-and-hour claims in court.

The Supreme Court could hear oral arguments in the case as soon as this spring.

Among the other new cases, the court:

 Will rule on whether a five-year statute of limitations in federal law applies to SEC orders that require financial firms and individuals to "disgorge" orders in which defendants in SEC civil cases must give back ill-gotten gains such as salary or stock. The Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the five-year statute of limitations does apply to SEC claims for monetary penalties but didn't say whether it applies to disgorgement. Federal appellate courts are split on the issue.

The case revolves around an appeal by New Mexico-based investment adviser Charles Kokesh, who is seeking to avoid paying $34.9 million in disgorgement sought by the SEC. The SEC in 2009 charged that Mr. Kokesh misappropriated money from several business-development companies he ran to pay for expenses such as salaries and bonuses, according to the agency's complaint.

 Will consider how strictly filing deadlines in certain shareholder class actions should be enforced. The issue involves class actions that are filed before the deadline, typically a three-year or five-year period, that later are dismissed. Lower courts disagree over whether other investors can pursue the claims if they can demonstrate they would have qualified for the original plaintiff class. The case before the court involves an appeal by California's public employees' pension fund, which is seeking to bring claims related to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

 Will decide whether challenges to a controversial Obama administration clean water regulation should have been heard directly in an appeals court or whether the lawsuits should have been considered by trial courts first. An appeals court already has put the regulation on hold during the litigation, but some challengers say it would have been fairer for federal district judges to review the cases first. They say the confusion has caused needless delay. President-elect Donald Trump has called for the water regulation to be repealed.

EU, U.S. Reach Trans-Atlantic Agreement Over Insurance Rules

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine and Jacob M. Schlesinger

The U.S. and European Union have reached a trans-Atlantic agreement to smooth the ability of insurance companies to operate in the two regions, officials said Friday.

The agreement, reached after more than 20 years of discussions and almost a year of formal negotiations, aims to remove regulatory uncertainty for American insurers that do business in Europe. Meanwhile, EU reinsurers will benefit from changes to collateral requirements that could save them hundreds of millions of dollars.

American International Group Inc. and MetLife Inc. are among the biggest U.S. insurers with European operations. AIG declined to comment. MetLife didn't have an immediate comment.

"This is a very welcome development for U.S. insurers" as it "will enable them to write business in the EU insurance market and will alleviate their long-standing concern that lack of equivalence would restrict their ability to be globally competitive in an ever-increasingly competitive insurance marketplace," said Howard Mills, global insurance regulatory leader for consultancy Deloitte Services LP and a former New York state insurance commissioner.

Trade associations representing reinsurers and insurance companies across the U.S.  the American Insurance Association, the American Council of Life Insurers and the Reinsurance Association of America in a joint statement said they welcome the deal, saying it "seeks to resolve significant insurance and reinsurance regulatory issues for companies doing business in both jurisdictions."

Negotiators worked to close out an agreement in the final days of President Barack Obama's administration, in part because the U.S. political transition could have led to further delays as new officials take over for the incoming Trump administration.

Under the agreement, American insurers won't be subject to new EU insurance regulations, known as Solvency II, that went into effect a year ago.

Europe's regime seeks to ensure insurers have enough capital to weather severe losses and to establish unified requirements across the bloc. The rules apply only to European firms, but EU representatives had called for "equivalent" regulatory oversight of non-European insurers operating in EU countries.

EU reinsurers could save about $400 million a year in collateral costs in the U.S., according to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, because collateral requirements for reinsurers operating overseas will be eliminated.

A third pillar of the deal, which isn't binding, is a set of principles outlining how American and European insurance supervisors should exchange information with one another to mitigate risks in the sector.

EU national governments and the European Parliament have to approve the agreement. The commission hopes to expedite the process by requesting to sign on behalf of member states, which shortens the process.

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Treasury Department, which also joined in the negotiations, sent letters to Congress notifying members of the deal, kicking off the 90-day scrutiny period before U.S. authorities can sign the agreement.

"This agreement will provide opportunities for U.S. insurers and reinsurers doing business in the EU while continuing to ensure a high standard of protection for U.S. and EU consumers," U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.

Citadel to Pay Over $22 Million for Misleading Clients

By Dave Michaels and Alexander Osipovich

U.S. regulators made Citadel Securities LLC pay $22.6 million for failing to fill customer orders at the best price, nabbing their first offender in the lucrative side market for executing retail stock orders.

Citadel Securities, which handles more retail trades than any other brokerage, agreed to settle claims that it didn't always obtain the best price for orders despite giving assurances that it would. The trading firm, owned by billionaire investor Kenneth Griffin, handles more than one in three retail orders that once would have gone straight to stock exchanges, promising better prices and speedier executions.

The practice in which Citadel and other high-tech "wholesalers" pay retail brokers to execute mom-and-pop orders has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years. At a Senate hearing in June 2014, Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) questioned TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. about whether such deals simply reap windfalls for retail brokers instead of ensuring the best price and trade execution for their clients.

Joe Saluzzi, a co-founder of brokerage Themis Trading LLC, said Friday that "this is all about a system that's been rigged and broken for many, many years."

Firms such as Citadel, which handles 35% of the average daily volume for retail shares, noted the SEC has approved the practice, known as payment for order flow. It results in better prices for retail clients than trading on exchanges, these firms say.

Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman, said the firm takes "very seriously our obligations to comply fully with all laws and regulations" and is "committed to providing superior service and execution quality to our clients."

The Securities and Exchange Commission's civil probe targeted two specific algorithms that Citadel used to execute about 2.6% of retail orders from 2008 to 2010. The algorithms decided how Citadel would fill an order when prices from a slower feed differed from prices on a richer and faster view that is sold by exchanges. When the two sources diverged, an algorithm known as FastFill used the price shown on the slower feed, which resulted in a worse price for "a substantial number of smaller orders," the SEC's order said.

Because of the way FastFill worked, some orders for larger numbers of shares actually received a better price, the SEC said.

Another algorithm, called SmartProvide, delayed the immediate execution of retail orders when the slower feed showed a better price than the faster one, the SEC said. In those cases, Citadel sent the order to the broader market, which sometimes netted clients a better price. In other cases, some orders that came back to Citadel got a worse price than if they had been immediately filled at the quote shown on the slow tape, the SEC's order said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's action faulted Citadel because its agreements with retail broker-dealers didn't fully explain how the algorithms worked, and only said Citadel would get the best available price for clients. Under the agreement, Citadel will pay a $16 million penalty and forfeit $5.2 million in profits and $1.4 million in interest. Citadel didn't admit or deny the allegations.

"The penalty reflects that it's a substantial amount for serious conduct," Robert Cohen, co-chief of the SEC's market abuse unit, said on a conference call with reporters. "It's a difficult area to penetrate if you are an investor or even a regulator, and it affected a lot of orders."

Retail brokers who supply Citadel with orders include Charles Schwab, Ameritrade, Scottrade Financial Services and E*Trade Financial Corp. Retail brokers shouldn't be faulted because, on average, their customers benefit from trading with market makers such as Citadel, said David Weisberger, head of trading analytics at IHS Markit Ltd.

"The size of the fine has nothing to do with the impact on investors and everything to do with disclosure," Mr. Weisberger said.

Critics such as IEX Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. have complained that speedy trading firms could exploit arbitrage opportunities created by the gap between the slower feed, known as the consolidated tape, and faster feeds sold by the stock exchanges. That gap has narrowed in recent years as exchanges, under pressure from regulators and money managers, committed to upgrade the slower tape's technology.

Corrections & Amplifications:

The Securities and Exchange Commission found that Citadel Securities LLC didn't use algorithms that would have found clients the best prices. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Citadel did use the algorithms and referred to the SEC as the "Security and Exchange Commission." Also, the name of the earlier article's contributing reporter is Imani Moise. The first name was misspelled as "Imami." (Jan. 13, 2017)

Fiduciary Rule Guidance Unveiled as Implementation Deadline Looms

By Lisa Beilfuss

The Labor Department published two more batches of guidance aimed at investors and the wealth-adviser industry over the new rule on retirement-savings advice, a move that keeps the so-called fiduciary rule's April implementation deadline on track amid mounting Republican opposition.

The fiduciary rule, unveiled last spring, requires brokers and advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings to work in the best interest of their clients and generally avoid conflicts of interest, which can arise with commission-based compensation. Previously, professionals were held to a less-rigorous standard that required only suitable advice.

In one list of frequently asked questions released Friday, the Labor Department focuses on investor rights, the fate of commission-generating accounts and advisers' responsibilities under the fiduciary rule. The FAQs are meant to help the brokerage industry be in compliance with the stricter standards by April 10 and to continue informing investors of the coming changes.

The department highlights in its FAQs that the rule doesn't require advisers move clients from commission-based accounts to fee-based accounts. Advisers act as fiduciaries when they recommend the proper type of account, the department said, nodding to concerns that smaller investors who do few annual trades will wind up paying more in fees than they might in commissions.

Under the rule, a fiduciary is anyone paid for making an investment recommendation specific to a client's needs about retirement accounts. Covered recommendations include advice about buying, holding or selling securities or other investment property in retirement accounts, including recommendations to roll over an account, buy an annuity or take a distribution from a 401(k) plan or IRA.

When it comes to defining "best interest," the Labor Department said advisers' obligation isn't perfection, but rather that he or she "make recommendations that adhere to a professional standard of care and that are based on your financial interest, without regard to his or her own competing financial interests." It doesn't require that advisers "somehow scour the market and identify the single best investment product for you out of all the investments in that vast market."

The second list of FAQs released Friday focuses on technical compliance issues. With that set of guidance, the Labor Department clarifies the types of investment recommendations and communications bound by the rule and discusses how the rule treats third-party administrators.

The publication of the guidance comes as speculation swirls that the rule will be delayed and either killed or watered down. While President-elect Donald Trump hasn't publicly addressed the fiduciary rule, he has appointed high-level officials who are vocal opponents of the rule.

Meanwhile, Republican control of Congress makes delay more likely and potential dismantling easier. Last week, Rep. Joe Wilson (R., S.C.) introduced a bill to delay the rule's implementation date by two years, a move he says is meant to give Mr. Trump "adequate time to re-evaluate" the regulation. Mr. Wilson said he expects to get his bill to the House floor before April 10.

Despite uncertainty over the rule's fate, many brokers are moving forward with efforts to comply with the more rigorous standard come April. As such, the industry has been anticipating the FAQs issued by the Labor Department for more clarity on the rule's reach, the terms of its exemptions and investors' potential recourse if they feel their best interest wasn't served.

How a Growth Push Derailed CAN Capital, a Big Lender to Small Businesses

By Peter Rudegeair

An ill-fated growth push has tripped up one of the oldest, most-successful online lenders to small businesses.

CAN Capital Inc. was forced to stop making new loans late last year after it discovered problems in how the company reported borrower delinquencies, according to people familiar with the matter. The errors were significant enough, the people said, to cause the company to breach covenants with its big-bank creditors such as Wells Fargo & Co. and push out three top executives.

To help turn the business around, the firm recently hired restructuring firm Realization Services Inc. for assistance in negotiating with creditors and brought on investment bank Jefferies Group LLC for advice on strategic alternatives, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Acting Chief Executive Parris Sanz, a lawyer who took over the top spot at the company in November, said in an interview earlier this month that the problem affected a tiny amount of the company's loans.

"We hit a bump in the road and blew out a tire," said Mr. Sanz. "We just need to change out the tire, and we'll be back on the road."

CAN Capital's struggles are the latest setback for the fast-growing financial-technology sector, particularly online lending, in which lenders use algorithms to automate credit decisions and fund loans with investor money rather than customer deposits.

Resurgent competition from banks and cooling investor demand for many online loans have hurt companies such as LendingClub Corp., Prosper Marketplace Inc. and On Deck Capital Inc. LendingClub, the largest online consumer lender by historical loan-origination volume, replaced its CEO after loan-disclosure problems last May.

Ultimately, CAN Capital's problems can be traced in large part to a decision made around five years ago to expand rapidly into new markets without putting in place proper internal controls. "It became clear that our business has grown and evolved faster than some of our internal processes," a spokeswoman said at the time of the executive changes.

What makes CAN Capital's's situation particularly painful is its long track record. Over its nearly two-decade history, it has issued about $6.5 billion in loans and merchant cash advances, in which the company agrees to fund a small business in exchange for a percentage for its future sales, the company has said.

Some advocacy groups criticized the cash advances as having high fees, but CAN Capital grew, signing up big banks as partners. Wells Fargo has referred customers who were declined for a loan from its merchant-services division to CAN Capital for the past six years.

Around five years ago, CAN Capital started to shift its approach to resemble its startup competitors. The company named a new CEO, Daniel DeMeo, and moved its headquarters in the New York suburb of Scarsdale, N.Y., to Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District. Venture-capital firms including Accel Partners and Meritech Capital Partners invested $63 million into the lender, which one investor called the "best-kept secret in the emerging financial innovation boom."

The early signs from the changes were encouraging. In 2015, CAN announced it had attracted $650 million in debt backing from Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and other large banks The same year, the company had around $29 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, up from about $19 million in 2014, according to people familiar with the matter.

But as the firm shifted to compete with online lenders, CAN's loan systems allowed some employees to grant borrowers a few extra days to get payments made beyond what was stated in loan agreements, people familiar with the situation said. Such "grace days" were more common in cash advances, and typically don't happen in the loan business unless there is a formal modification. Otherwise, the loans need to be declared delinquent.

Last summer, top CAN executives learned the issue was widespread enough to cause the firm to misstate delinquencies to investors and creditors. In November, the board of directors put Mr. DeMeo, along with the company's chief financial officer and chief risk officer, on leave. They aren't expected to return, the people say.

Around that time, banks involved in CAN Capital's credit facility, led by Wells Fargo, said CAN's issues put it in violation of covenants governing how much it was permitted to borrow, according to people familiar with the matter. As part of a December letter notifying CAN's less-senior creditors about the breach, the banks said certain debt payments starting in March could be at risk, these people said.

Mr. Sanz says CAN officials are in talks with Wells Fargo and other banks to fix the issues and that only 3% of the loans funded with the credit facility were considered ineligible. CAN is looking to sell more than $100 million in loans and assets to strengthen its financial position and has laid off about 250 staffers in Georgia and Costa Rica, or 55% of its overall workforce, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Sanz said the asset sale and other steps are part of plans to raise additional liquidity for lenders and "position us for success in 2017."

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

CSRC Chairman's Saturday Meeting Spooks Local Investors

The Shanghai Composite closes down 0.3% Monday after dropping as much as 2.2% in afternoon trade following rumors of tighter regulation on margin financing, say analysts at three brokerages in China. They did not wish to be named. Nearly 10 initial public share sales are expected to hit the market this week, to raise a combined (approximate) 4 billion yuan ($579.91 million), threatening to drain liquidity from other stocks. Also, market regulator China Securities Regulatory Commission held a meeting on Saturday on stock refinancing, backdoor listing and a new listing board, say analysts. "There was some speculators suggesting this might signal another round of tighter regulation, however this is purely just a rumor at this stage," said David Millhouse, head of China research at Forsyth Barr Asia. There was a big amount of large cap buying coming in late in the day when the Shanghai Composite got below 3050, he said. (kenan.machado@wsj.com)

China Regulator: Insurer Eavesdropped on Inspectors During Visit, Xinhua Reports

A Chinese insurance regulator said a state insurance firm used an iPhone and a voice recorder to eavesdrop on inspectors, according to the official Xinhua News Service. The eavesdropping devices were found taped under chairs at the Weifang office of Yingda Taihe Property Insurance, which was being inspected, according to a branch of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission based in northeastern Shandong province. Yingda said four employees had been removed from their posts and were under investigation, according to Xinhua. "In a modern society when everyone is called upon to learn and obey the law, executives and employees of a state-owned insurance company adopted such gravely improper means to confront inspection," the regulator said in a statement, Xinhua reported. "They need to rectify their work ethic, morals and legal consciousness." (mark.magnier@wsj.com; @MarkMagnier)

Australia Regulator Focusing on Lending Standards

Australia's prudential regulator appears to be more interested in addressing systemic risks for banks through a focus on lending standards rather than further building up buffers, Deutsche Bank says. The regulator opted to maintain the "countercyclical capital buffer" at zero, despite what Deutsche Bank says was a risk it would set a small buffer to reflect housing growth running ahead of nominal GDP growth, still high household indebtedness and similar moves to lift the capital buffer in other countries. The decision is a small positive for Aussie banks, and a sensible approach by the regulator, Deutsche reckons. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; Twitter: @RobbMStewart)

Fitch Turns Negative on Australian Banks

Rising macroeconomic risks and pressure on profit growth prompts Fitch to cut its 2017 outlook on Australian banks to negative as household debt is high and rising relative to disposable income making borrowers sensitive to changes in the job market and interest rates. The ratings firm also thinks banks' earnings growth is likely to continue slowing this year amid low rates, competition, higher funding costs and a rise in loan-impairment charges. Fitch, though, keeps its ratings view on banks while being watchful of the previously stated risks. The move comes as Australia's prudential regulator opted against requiring banks to hold more capital, leaving its "counter-cyclical buffer" at zero given no observed change in the level of systemic risk.

BSE Exchange Releases Estimated IPO Terms

India's BSE is set to raise as much as INR12.43B ($182.3M) from its IPO next week, with Asia's oldest stock exchange offering 15.4M shares at INR805-806 each. BSE will be the first stock exchange to be listed in India; the National Stock Exchange of India, the country's largest by volume, has also applied to market regulators to go public. Officials last year amended its rules for stock listings in an effort to make it easier for domestic exchanges to go public. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)

Wells Fargo Reports Decrease in Earnings

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-reports-decrease-in-earnings-1484312882", Wells Fargo had been one of the most consistent big banks at growing earnings and revenue, but that momentum has fallen off recently. The bank continues to face reputational damage from its sales practices scandal and was dealt another black eye when regulators last month said it failed its so-called living will regulatory test of how it could unwind in a crisis scenario.

The unit responsible for the questionable sales tactics is part of Wells Fargo's community banking division, which reported profit of $2.73 billion, a 15% decrease from the $3.3 billion it earned in the fourth quarter of 2015. Among other factors, the bank cited the hedge ineffectiveness and higher deposit service charges.

Does taking part in a government program carry a stigma? In a "https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2017/wp_17-01", Huberto M. Ennis looks at whether borrowing at the central bank's discount window stigmatizes banks. Discount window stigma, or the reluctance of banks to borrow from the central bank for fear of being regarded as in weak financial conditions, could be considered a sign of weakness, the paper finds, but there is no clear sense in which stigma reduces the efficacy of the discount window.

Improving Financial Reporting Standards

An efficient and stable financial system requires improvements in the quality, scope and accessibility of financial data, "https://www.financialresearch.gov/from-the-director/2017/01/12/promoting-higher-quality-and-lower-cost-in-financial-regulatory-reporting/" The fragmented U.S. regulatory system makes for inefficient data reporting that "can be costly and undermines quality," he writes. The lack of shared data reporting standards among regulators makes for an inefficient system that could be improved by using an identification standard namely the legal entity identifier, a unique ID associated with a single corporate entity.

Toyota marks break from past with fund for tech investments

Toyota has invested in 15 technology start-ups worldwide through a $310m "https://www.sparxgroup.com/press/uploads/PressE151104-01.pdf" it launched 14 months ago, marking a break from its typically conservative investment stance in an attempt to ride the new wave of connected vehicles and robotics.

The uncharacteristic focus on tech companies   ranging from car sharing and flat-panel satellite antennas to home robots   reflects a sense of urgency felt by Akio Toyoda, the chief executive of the Japanese company, to keep pace with innovation in autonomous driving and incursions by tech rivals such as Google, according to people close to the company.

Mr Toyoda launchedthe fund in late 2015 with Shuhei Abe, the chief executive of Tokyo-based hedge fund Sparx who is also Mr Toyoda s former MBA classmate at Babson College in the US, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.

The 35.1bn ($307m) fund has19 investors, and has poured an average $5m to $10m into companies including San Francisco-based car sharing provider Getaround; UIEvolution, a US company that makes software for connected vehicles; and Groove X, a Japanese start-up launched by the developer of SoftBank s companion robot Pepper.It invests primarily in AI, robotics and hydrogen-related technologies, and last week also announced an investment in FiNC, a Japanese digital health start-up.

Sparx hopes to close the fund soon, once it has raised 50bn, and expand its focus region to include Europe and Israel.

Though dwarfed by the $100bn tech fund SoftBank recently set up, it is part of a broader effort by Mr Toyoda to speed up decision-making at the Japanese car company. It works closely with Toyota s "https://www.ft.com/artificial-intelligence-robotics" and robotics research lab in Silicon Valley headed by Gill Pratt, a robotics expert poached from the US defence department. Toyota has promised a $1bn investment in the new research division.

 The first priority for our investment is to find a company that has a technological edge. The key word is the new services that will emerge when everything becomes connected in the age of  internet of things ,  said Takaki Demichi, executive officer of Sparx Asset Management who oversees the fund with Toyota.

The fund has an investment span of up to 10 years with a target internal rate of return of 15 per cent, according to Mr Demichi.

In the past, Toyota has invested in a range of start-ups on its own including a $50m investment in US electric vehicle maker Tesla, but analysts say the approach has not always borne fruit.

The target areas of Toyota s fund are very crowded and the Japanese carmaker is not alone in recognisingthe potential of those new technologies.

A string of carmakers including General Motors and Volkswagen have also turned to car services, such as on-demand journey-booking or car-sharing schemes, in response to the risk of falling vehicle ownership among young people. Honda is in talks for an alliance with a self-driving car unit that was split out of Google, which is also working with Fiat Chrysler.

What Do Trump Nominees' Goldman Ties Actually Mean?

Goldman Sachs Group Inc . has attracted more publicity than it probably cares for in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory. The president-elect's choice of current and former Goldman bankers for key nominations has resurrected the crisis-era pejorative "Government Sachs."

Steve Bannon and Steven Mnuchin, who previously worked for the investment bank, have been tapped to be "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bannon-set-to-reshape-white-house-role-1479089587" and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-to-pick-ex-banker-steven-mnuchin-for-treasury-nominee-1480469049", respectively. Gary Cohn is leaving his post as Goldman's No. 2 to become "http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-names-goldman-president-gary-cohn-as-director-of-national-economic-council-1481573082", and lawyer Jay Clayton, who was a senior adviser to the bank, has been nominated to become "http://www.wsj.com/articles/president-elect-trump-to-nominate-jay-clayton-securities-and-exchange-commission-chairman-1483545999".

But it's too early, and simplistic, to assume a Trump government will reflect behavior set by "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/16/u-s-treasury-secretaries-often-find-new-life-on-wall-street/"Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson, who as Treasury secretaries were instrumental in deregulating Wall Street and bailing it out, respectively.

For a start, Trump appointees with Goldman ties might be more not less sensitive to any perception they are changing rules to favor Wall Street or Goldman in particular.

More importantly, though, a Goldman pedigree doesn't necessarily correlate with a pro-Wall Street worldview. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, is a Goldman alumnus. He has made "http://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-neel-kashkari-rolls-out-blueprint-for-ending-too-big-to-fail-banks-1479300301" the hallmark of his tenure, last year proposing eye-popping "http://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-feds-neel-kashkari-on-breaking-up-banks-and-monetary-policy-1455747231" that would weigh heavily on Wall Street's leverage-dependent business model.

Gary Gensler, who became a Goldman partner at 30, helped dismantle the Glass-Steagall rules separating commercial and investment banking as a senior Treasury official in the late 1990s. But in the wake of the financial crisis, he became an "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703766704576009312321035744"as chairman of the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission from 2009 to 2014.

Mr. Bannon "http://fortune.com/2016/08/17/donald-trump-bannon-mnuchin-goldman/" in the 1980s, when it was a very different institution. It was much less dependent on debt, and a partnership rather than a publicly traded limited liability company, meaning top bankers had personal liability for their decisions. In fact, in 2014 he said, "We've never really gone and dug down and sorted through the problems of 2008," calling for "a real clean-up of the banks' balance sheets" including much higher levels of capital and less trading of securities anathema to Goldman's interests.

Mr. Mnuchin left Goldman in 2002, a few years after it went public in 1999 and long before the precrisis "Big Short" excesses emerged.

To be sure, Mr. Mnuchin has said he wants to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-treasury-choice-steven-mnuchin-vows-to-strip-back-dodd-frank-1480513188" parts of the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, saying "it's way too complicated and cuts back lending." But his views on other financial-regulation issues of more concern to larger institutions, such as capital standards, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/schlesingers-take-trumps-treasury-picka-goldman-guy-with-no-clear-agenda-1480509119".

Mr. Trump's high-profile choices have amassed significant personal wealth already, and would seem to have far less personal incentive to help their former Goldman colleagues of decades past than they might have been at the start of their careers. Work histories offer clues, not a guide, on how Trump's government will treat big finance.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

WSJ Pro: Key House Republican Wants Consumer Bureau Shut Down

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTON A key Republican on the House Financial Services Committee said he wants to see the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau closed and its responsibility given back to other regulators, a move that would return to a regulatory framework for consumer protection before the financial crisis.

Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R., Mo.), who was appointed in January as head of the Financial Services panel that oversees financial regulators, said eliminating the CFPB is among options Republicans are considering as they examine ways to change the bureau created by the Obama administration.

"This was a duplicative agency that didn't need to be there," he said in an interview. "It's been a total failure, and in my mind it needs to go away."

A businessman who has worked as a state bank examiner and a community banker, Mr. Luetkemeyer is the new chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, which has oversight of the CFPB.

A CFPB spokesman declined to comment.

The CFPB has emerged as a fresh battleground between the two parties since Republicans swept into power in the November elections. Republicans want to significantly weaken the bureau as part of a campaign to dismantle the Obama-era financial regulations.

The view expressed by Mr. Luetkemeyer is more radical than other ideas discussed to weaken the CFPB. The bureau's opponents are pushing the incoming administration to remove its director, Richard Cordray, before his term ends in mid-2018 and replace him with an official who shares their ideas.

House Republicans also plan to soon reintroduce broad financial deregulation known as the Financial Choice Act bill that includes a significant revamp of the CFPB. Possible changes include turning its single-director leadership into a commission; subjecting its budget to the purview of Congress; narrowing its rule-making and enforcement authority; and revamping its employee pay structure to make it harder to recruit professionals.

Democrats oppose GOP moves to overhaul the CFPB, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped establish the CFPB.

"We're going to fight back against any efforts to gut financial reform and to allow big banks and shady financial institutions to once again cheat consumers and put our economy at risk," the Massachusetts senator said during a conference call hosted by consumer groups Tuesday.

Mr. Luetkemeyer said if the CFPB is shut down, the responsibility of consumer protection could be shared among existing agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.

"I think we have a lot of regulatory folks already in place," he said, adding they were "doing a good job of it."

The CFPB's 1,600 employees "probably will have to go find another job" if the bureau is closed, he said. "They may go back to some of the other regulatory agencies that may have to ramp up their oversight with regards to consumer protection."

House Votes to Require More Cost Analysis of SEC Rules

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON House lawmakers voted largely along party lines Thursday to approve a bill to require securities regulators to more extensively assess how much their rules cost the financial industry, part of a push to curtail what Republicans say is overly burdensome red tape.

The House voted 243 to 184 to pass the measure, with the support of a handful of Democrats. It would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to analyze all of its existing rules and to conduct "look backs" on a regular basis to ensure new and existing rules are still effective. Critics, including top SEC officials, say the measure is intended to gum up the regulatory process and would further hamstring a commission with limited resources.

Passage of the bill is significant because it is among the first of several deregulatory measures congressional Republicans are expected to advance this year. It faces uncertain prospects in the Senate, where no companion bill is pending and Democrats have more power to block the legislation, but comes at a time when Republicans are about to control Congress and the executive branch.

The House separately voted 239-182 to require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to conduct more rigorous analysis on the costs and benefits of its rules, as part of legislation setting the contours of the CFTC's regulatory powers for the next five years.

And the House on Wednesday passed related legislation that would require a broader array of federal agencies to adopt the lowest-cost version of a proposed regulation and to limit judges' deference to regulators on legal challenges to regulations.

Under Thursday's SEC bill, sponsored by Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.), the top U.S. markets regulator would need to more carefully examine a problem to see if there is a need for a rule, with analysis conducted by the agency's chief economist. One year after implementation, the commission would have to perform another analysis to see if the rule met its intended goals. It would have to repeat the process again every five years.

SEC Chairman Mary Jo White, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment. In 2013, she told lawmakers that she was "troubled" by a nearly identical version of the bill, sponsored at the time by Rep. Scott Garrett (R., N.J.), saying the agency already takes steps to ensure "robust" analysis of the costs and benefits of its rules. Ms. White said the steps have already won positive feedback from a congressional watchdog and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .

Ms. Wagner succeeded Mr. Garrett as the bill's sponsor after the New Jersey Republican lost his reelection bid last year.

The SEC is required by law to assess the impact its rules have on competition, efficiency and capital formation. It faced a series of legal challenges to its rules in past years, with plaintiffs arguing successfully that regulations weren't adopted with sufficient economic analysis.

To address those concerns, the SEC in 2012 boosted internal guidelines, which call for the commission's economists to play an early role in drafting new rules. The guidance applies to rules mandated by Congress, such as those in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, and those done on a discretionary basis, such as a set of restrictions for the asset-management industry. Thursday's bill would effectively replace such guidance if signed into law.

Before Thursday's vote, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , a top Wall Street trade group, said it backed the bill for strengthening the rigor of the SEC's rule-making process. Andy Blocker, the industry group's top lobbyist, said in a letter to congressional leadership the bill would "ensure the continued efficacy of regulation."

The Consumer Federation of America , which opposed the bill, said it "goes far beyond what is reasonable or balanced" and would cause a "serious drain" on the SEC's resources.

"It would tie the SEC in procedural knots, keep its focus on an endless review of existing rules rather than emerging issues, [and] provide endless grounds for legal challenge," said Barbara Roper, CFA's director of investor protection, in a written statement.

Key Reforms From Dodd-Frank Shouldn't Be Rolled Back, Yellen Says

By Kate Davidson

WASHINGTON Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Thursday that key regulatory changes implemented by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law including higher capital standards and enhanced supervision for big banks and new tools to help regulators deal with potential bank failures should not be rolled back.

Speaking at a Fed town hall discussion with teachers, Ms. Yellen said, "Dodd-Frank was a very important road map for strengthening the financial system and mitigating the chance of another financial crisis."

While Ms. Yellen said there is room for changes to the law that would help reduce the regulatory burden on small banks, she said Dodd-Frank established many key reforms that made the system "substantially safer and sounder," including new liquidity requirements, derivatives reforms, stress tests, resolution plans and the establishment of the Financial Stability Oversight Council .

Congressional Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump have vowed to dismantle the bulk of the Dodd-Frank law, which they argue will remove regulatory uncertainty for businesses and help promote economic growth.

Ms. Yellen also told teachers she worries "a great deal" about income inequality and its long-term effects on the U.S. economy. She noted that a larger share of income gains in recent years have gone to workers at the top of the income distribution, and that the gap between workers without a high school diploma and those with advanced degrees has grown wider.

And she lamented the underrepresentation of women in the economics profession, as well as among economics majors and in Ph.D. programs, a problem she said begins in college or even earlier.

The disparity may have to do with a lack of role models for young women in economics, as well as an implicit bias, Ms. Yellen said, citing research that shows women economists receive significantly less credit than their male counterparts for coauthoring academic research papers, especially when their co-author is a man.

"It's something that I do hope will change over time and it may even make a difference in the way that policy is conducted," she said, adding that the Fed is working to improve diversity in its ranks.

In remarks prepared for delivery, Ms. Yellen said that improving education is at the top of her list among initiatives she believes could help spur economic growth and raise living standards. She credited educators with helping students build practical life skills, including the ability to make wise financial decisions, that benefit not just the students but all of society.

"Everyone is engaged in and depends on the economy, and nothing is more critical to a healthy and growing economy than the capability, creativity and productiveness of its workforce," she said.

Ms. Yellen also said all teachers, but especially economics teachers, effectively help further the Fed's mission by educating students and supporting their contributions to the economy.

She didn't comment on monetary policy, interest rates or the economic outlook in her prepared remarks.

Ms. Yellen took questions from teachers Thursday evening at the Fed's main building in Washington and via a webcast on its website.

Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke held several similar meetings with teachers during his tenure where he spoke about his own background as a college professor and the importance of financial education.

Ms. Yellen has spent much of her career in academia. She is a professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley and has been a faculty member since 1980, with various stints in government in between. Before that, she was a faculty member at the London School of Economics and Political Science , and an assistant professor at Harvard University.

Paul Atkins, Trump's Regulatory Adviser, Likely to Remain at Consulting Firm

By Andrew Ackerman and Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON Donald Trump's point man on financial regulation probably won't be joining the incoming administration, at least not initially.

Paul Atkins, widely viewed as a top candidate for a powerful regulatory perch at the Federal Reserve, has told people he intends to stay at his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners, according to people familiar with the matter.

A former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Atkins has had a key role on Trump's transition team, helping to recommend regulatory policy and personnel at federal financial regulators.

He was seen as a leading candidate for a top post in the president-elect's administration, including the Federal Reserve's point man on banking oversight.

That post is now unlikely to go to Mr. Atkins, these people said, though the situation could change and the Trump administration may tap Mr. Atkins for a post at some point in the future.

The Trump transition team couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Mr. Atkins has told people for months that he was happy at Patomak and wasn't actively campaigning for a top job, such as the vice chair of supervision at the Fed.

That post was created by Congress in 2010, but it has never been filled. Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, who has been effectively doing the job, has used the role to exert significant influence over the largest U.S. banks. His term as fed governor expires in 2022, though he could step down sooner.

Any nominee to the vice chairman role would need to be confirmed by the Senate.

Other possible candidates for the Fed job, The Wall Street Journal has reported, include: Rep. French Hill (R., Ark.), a former banker; David Nason, chief executive of General Electric Co.'s GE Energy Financial Services and a Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration; and John Allison, the former leader of the libertarian Cato Institute think tank and former CEO of regional bank BB&T Corp.

Mr. Trump's team also is considering whether to appoint two Fed officials at once, people familiar with the matter have said. The vice chair job is open, as is another slot on the Fed's seven-member governing board, which currently has only five members.

Mr. Atkins founded his behind-the-scenes consulting business Patomak in the garage of his suburban Washington home in 2009 after he stepped down as a Republican member of the SEC.

Since then, he has prepared private-equity firms for compliance exams, devised strategies for mutual funds to resist government curbs on risk-taking and helped Chinese accounting firms avert a ban on doing business in the U.S. Patomak's other clients have included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Fidelity Investments .

Financial Stability Board Releases Guidelines on Asset-Management Industry

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine

In a bid to avoid a future market meltdown, the Financial Stability Board released final policy guidelines Thursday to regulate the growing asset-management industry.

The global standards setter which is based in Basel, Switzerland, and headed by Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney laid out recommendations for regulators to implement over the next several years.

The FSB identified several points of weakness that could wreak havoc on financial stability. At the top of its list is liquidity, the ease with which market participants can buy and sell securities without undue price movements, which could spark a crisis if asset managers seek to exit trades simultaneously. Other concerns the FSB cited were use of leverage and operational risks such as system failures.

The final guidelines include minor changes to the FSB's original proposal from June 2016.

Asset managers expressed some worry about the guidelines. Paul Schott Stevens, president and chief executive of the Investment Company Institute, which represents funds that manage total assets of $18.4 trillion in the U.S., said the report is based on flawed assumptions about liquidity risk management. He also criticized the FSB's plan to consider designating big asset managers as systemically important, which would subject them to stricter rules.

"The FSB has made some helpful changes to its recommendations," said Mr. Stevens. "Nevertheless, we remain troubled."

The FSB's efforts come in response to the increasingly important role of asset managers, which are now responsible for managing 40% of global financial assets, or $76.7 trillion as of 2015. That was up from $53.6 trillion in 2005, according to the FSB paper.

"The growth in asset management activities provides new sources of credit and investment, and adds diversity to our financial system," said Mr. Carney, adding the new guidelines "will enhance the resilience of asset management activities so that this form of market-based finance can help underpin strong, sustainable and balanced economic growth."

The global regulator expressed most concern around liquidity, considered a proxy for market stress.

"As investors have reached for yield in an environment of exceptionally low interest rates, they have sought out asset managers and funds that offer exposures to higher yielding, less actively traded asset classes," the FSB said.

While the FSB said it recognizes that funds and asset managers pose less of a risk than investment banks, as they don't use their balance sheets to finance market transactions, it highlighted the impact the collapse Long-Term Capital Management , a hedge fund, had on markets in 1998.

The International Organization of Securities Commissions , the world's biggest committee of markets regulator, is in charge of developing the relevant solutions and reviewing its existing guidance. The FSB set out 14 recommendations for IOSCO. For instance, to address the systemic risk of leverage, the FSB recommends the market regulator create common measures with which to monitor and assess leverage across funds globally.

The FSB recommendations "are an important step toward addressing potential financial stability issues in the asset management sector," said Ashley Alder, head of the IOSCO board and a member of the FSB steering committee. "IOSCO will take forward the recommendations on liquidity mismatch and leverage so as to enhance the overall soundness of this important financial sector."

ITG Agrees to Pay $24 Million in SEC Settlement

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON Brokerage firm Investment Technology Group Inc . agreed to pay $24.4 million to settle claims that it improperly obtained and lent foreign shares to clients, the first penalty in a wide-ranging probe of misconduct in the market.

ITG is a broker that provides execution services and trade analytics to institutional investors. It provided American depositary receipts, which are certificates representing ownership of a foreign stock, to clients without ensuring they would be backed by the actual shares, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. The SEC said that resulted in the issuance of phantom shares, or ADRs that weren't tied to securities issued by a foreign company.

ITG, which didn't admit or deny the claims, agreed to pay $9.3 million in penalties and interest and forfeit $15 million in profits, the commission added.

"ITG's failure to properly supervise its securities lending desk caused ADRs to be issued that were not backed by actual shares, leaving them ripe for potential market abuse,'' said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the SEC's New York regional office.

ITG declined to comment. Frank Troise, its chief executive, said in an earnings call last year that the office accused of wrongdoing was shut down in late 2014.

"We take these matters very seriously, and we recognize that there is heightened sensitivity among some of our clients with respect to regulatory matters," Mr. Troise said in November.

The probe of ITG, which covered activity from 2011 to 2014, was related to the prerelease of ADRs, where banks issue depositary receipts without first having the underlying shares in their custody. The practice was intended to smooth trading by bridging different countries' settlement times.

Created by J.P. Morgan in 1927, ADRs make it easier for American investors to own stocks that are listed outside the U.S. They allow, for instance, U.S. shareholders to avoid receiving dividend payments in foreign currency; each ADR represents a specific number of foreign shares. Brokers who sell or transfer ADRs are typically responsible for ensuring that a matching number of foreign shares has been deposited with a custodian.

ITG's customers included other brokers who used the ADRs to close out short sales, the SEC's order said. Regulators have worried that prereleased depositary receipts could be abused for "naked short selling," according to people familiar with the matter. The activity is an illegal practice where traders bet against a company's stock by selling shares they don't own, without borrowing or locating the shares needed to cover the sale. The agency is also looking at whether such receipts are being used to illegally arbitrage between different tax regimes.

The SEC's press release said its investigation isn't over but didn't elaborate. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that the SEC had sent subpoenas to four depositary banks  Bank of New York Mellon Corp ., Citigroup Inc ., Deutsche Bank AG and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . as it examined whether the banks have broken controls designed to prevent market abuse and tax fraud, people close to the investigation said.

Two years ago, ITG agreed to pay $20.3 million to settle SEC allegations that it ran a secret trading project that relied in part on confidential information from its clients and improper trading in its dark pool, a private trading venue that doesn't disclose investors' orders.

Officials Planned to Prioritize Debt Payments as 2011 Debt-Ceiling Deadline Loomed

By Kate Davidson

Federal Reserve and Treasury Department officials in August 2011 had privately formalized a plan to make on-time payments on Treasury debt and delay paying other government bills if Congress and the White House failed to reach an agreement to raise the federal borrowing limit, according to transcripts of a central bank meeting released Thursday.

The transcripts provide the most detailed description yet from any government agency of what officials were prepared to do in the event of a debt-limit breach.

At the time, Obama administration officials were warning the Treasury would run out of cash to pay all the government's bills if Congress failed to lift the debt ceiling.

Republicans were pressing the Treasury to prioritize payments to bondholders to avoid a default on U.S. government securities, a linchpin of global markets. But Treasury officials said prioritizing principal and interest payments while missing payments on other obligations such as Social Security checks, veteran benefits and other vendor bills was "simply default by another name," and thus an "unacceptable outcome."

The issue was of great concern then to investors around the world, and could be again this year as Congress could face another debt ceiling deadline in the coming months. The federal borrowing limit was suspended in 2015 but will return mid-March, after which the Treasury will have to deploy emergency measures to avoid breaching the limit, measures that can probably last for a few months.

The prospect that the U.S. government might fail to make bond payments had roiled financial markets when Fed officials held an emergency conference call on Aug. 1, 2011, just after congressional leaders announced a deal to raise the debt limit.

Transcripts from the call show the Fed acting as the Treasury's fiscal agent and at its direction was prepared to keep making principal and interest payments on time, and delay other payments as necessary, if the deal fell through and the debt limit wasn't raised in time.

Louise Roseman, the director of the Fed's division of reserve bank operations and payment systems at the time, told Fed officials that the central bank, its regional reserve banks and the Treasury had jointly developed and codified the procedures into a "special operating circular," which it planned to issue to banks if Congress failed to strike a timely agreement. The plan was "approved by the Treasury as reflecting what it would like the Reserve Banks to do as its fiscal agents if it ever came to that," she said.

The Fed released the transcripts from its 2011 meetings on Thursday under its customary five-year lag.

Ms. Roseman said the Treasury planned to ensure it would be able to make the interest payments "by holding back other government payments and accumulating sufficient cash balances in its Fed account to pay upcoming coupon payments."

Janet Yellen, the Fed's vice chairman at the time, said she came away from the debt ceiling episode "quite concerned" about the vulnerability of market infrastructure in the event of an actual default, which she said could have had "catastrophic market consequences."

"Given that we could face a similar situation somewhere down the road, I think it's important for us to think about lessons learned so that we and markets will be better prepared if we face such a situation again," Ms. Yellen said, according to the transcript.

Fed officials also discussed ways they might respond in the event of a default or renewed market turbulence. Those options included valuing defaulted securities at their own market prices, conducting reverse repurchase operations to address strains in money markets, providing emergency liquidity to money market mutual funds and buying defaulted Treasury securities outright.

Some officials worried that emergency lending to money markets could generate moral hazard, and that buying defaulted Treasurys could be seen as financing the public debt. Ms. Yellen said those options "seem to be possible to me" if such a situation were to arise in the future and default seemed to be a possibility, "but whether or not I would endorse them would depend on the actual circumstances were this to arise."

"The implication of this approach would be that the Treasury would be delaying non-[principal and interest] payments even on days when it may have ample balances in its Fed account to have been able to make those payments if it had so chosen," she said. "Instead, the Treasury would be conserving that cash to be able to ensure that it would be able to pay future-dated interest payments."

Ms. Roseman said the Treasury wouldn't submit any payments to the Fed's regional reserve banks unless it was sure it would have sufficient balances to settle the transactions on the settlement dates.

The release of the transcripts could complicate efforts to negotiate the next debt-limit increase ahead of the return of the ceiling in March. Congressional Republicans had repeatedly called on the Treasury to prioritize payments ahead of the 2011 deadline, as well as other categories of federal spending.

In the years since the showdown, administration officials have acknowledged that they conferred with the New York Fed and determined that prioritizing such payments was technologically possible. But they warned such a move "would be entirely experimental and create unacceptable risk to both domestic and global financial markets."

Treasury officials told government watchdogs that they determined the "least harmful option" available in 2011 was to delay all payments until they could all be made on a day-by-day basis.

According to the inspector general's report, the Treasury said that, because Congress has never provided guidance on how to prioritize payments, its systems are designed to make each payment in the order it comes due.

"Treasury officials determined that there is no fair or sensible way to pick and choose among the many bills that come due every day," the report said.

The Fed transcripts released Thursday suggest that, at the end of the day, officials were prepared to prioritize principal and interest payments on bonds, though Ms. Roseman acknowledged the plans were fluid and had only been finalized the prior Friday, July 29.

"That would be a comfort if we find ourselves in another debt ceiling event, although we view that as less likely this time around," said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of Montreal , said after the transcripts were released Thursday.

Contingency planning for such a default "had been under way for months," she said, but the plan had changed substantially over the previous week or two, in part because "it was only recently that senior policymakers, here at the board and at the Treasury and elsewhere, paid very serious attention to what the procedures would be, and questioned, perhaps, whether that was the appropriate approach."

She said the plan she was outlining would "provide a higher degree of certainty" to payment recipients.

Then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke asked whether the Fed would have been able to prioritize payments for other major categories of federal spending, in addition to payments on Treasury debt, as envisioned under a bill that had been proposed by Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.).

Ms. Roseman said the challenge "would be more on the Treasury side," adding that the department had concerns about its ability to send certain types of payments to the Fed while withholding others.

"But frankly, the Treasury had concerns about some of the approaches we've ultimately adopted &in the past week or so that it has now decided it would be able to do after all," she said. "So I suspect that it would, with sufficient lead time at least in weeks, not days be able to accommodate that."

"But it's something that, until you have developed the procedures and tested the procedures, your comfort level is pretty low," she added.

Ms. Roseman also said the Fed system would have been capable of handling delayed coupon payments or delayed redemption of matured securities if the Treasury changed its mind again and decided not to prioritize payments. But she said it could create "very big operational challenges and probably a lot of disruption" for other market participants, who never anticipated the possibility of the government missing a debt payment.

Leslie Caldwell, Head of Justice Department's Criminal Division, Stepping Down

By Aruna Viswanantha

The head of the Justice Department's criminal division will leave her post on Friday, leaving behind efforts to simplify and speed up white-collar investigations that helped pave the way for the indictment of Volkswagen executives and a multi-billion dollar fine against the company this week.

Leslie Caldwell, who has led the unit since 2014, also oversaw the seizure last year of more than $1 billion in assets tied to alleged corruption at 1Malaysia Development Bhd ., or 1MDB, and landmark foreign corruption cases against J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., and Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht SA .

"The key is to keep things relatively simple, you don't need to include every fact," Ms. Caldwell said in an interview, describing her approach to prosecuting cases. "The temptation in white-collar cases is to investigate everything."

Ms. Caldwell said she doesn't yet know what she will do next, other than a trip planned to the Caribbean next week.

A U.S. grand jury on Wednesday indicted six current and former executives of Volkswagen AG for their alleged part in the company's U.S. emissions fraud, as the company agreed to plead guilty to engaging in the fraud and pay $4.3 billion in criminal and civil penalties.

The case focused on several internal Volkswagen meetings and several meetings with regulators the officials allegedly participated in. One of the executives was arrested earlier this week when vacationing in Miami. The others are believed to be in Germany.

The case serves as something of a capstone to a what has been a thorny issue for the Justice Department during the Obama administration   the investigations of major corporations.

The government has extracted record multibillion-dollar fines from banks and other companies for alleged misconduct, but Democrats have charged the Obama administration has failed to hold executives criminally accountable for conduct leading up to the financial meltdown of 2008, and failed to pursue individuals in other corporate cases.

Ms. Caldwell apologized last month after appearing to blame colleagues for problems in some white-collar prosecutions.

Earlier this week a grand jury also returned an indictment of three former currency traders alleging they colluded to move foreign exchange rates, in violation of antitrust laws. Their employers paid billions of dollars to resolve related criminal cases in 2015.

Ms. Caldwell took over the unit in 2014 as it raised its profile as a prosecuting office by handling large, international financial investigations that historically might have been the purview of federal prosecutors in New York, including into the manipulation of Libor and other financial benchmarks.

The division has added dozens to its ranks in the past few years, including increasing its foreign corruption group by 50% with an effort to focus on "bigger" cases and provide companies more information about how they can avoid prosecution if they report potential misconduct and cooperate in any investigation.

Ms. Caldwell said she devoted more people and resources to investigating cyber crimes, and said she expected her successor would need to tackle the growing inability for investigators to access information stored on encrypted devices.

"That will be problem No. 1 to address," she said.

SEC Backs  Virtual-Only' Annual Meeting Option

By Tatyana Shumsky

The growing popularity of virtual-only shareholder meetings isn't sitting well with shareholders.

In the latest round of the debate, the Securities and Exchange Commission backed the right of companies to decide on the format of annual meetings.

The regulator in December told HP Inc . it could drop an investor proposal objecting to virtual-only meetings. The proposal called for a shareholder vote on restoring in-person annual meetings.

A virtual meeting can done over the phone, online or by using a combination of both. Shareholders log into a special website using a code or pin number to cast their votes and ask executives and board members questions.

In granting HP's no action letter request, the SEC reaffirmed its earlier position, that company boards of directors can decide whether the annual meetings should be virtual-only or in-person.

The SEC declined to comment beyond the staff's response in the letter.

HP Inc . declined to comment. However the law firm representing HP, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP , said it's likely more companies will follow HP's lead.

"Given the potential cost savings and flexibility that can be achieved from holding virtual-only annual meetings, we expect that more companies will choose to hold virtual-only annual meetings in the near future," Lori Zyskowski, Elizabeth Ising and Ronald Mueller from Gibson Dunn said in a blog post. Ms. Zyskowski represented HP in the matter.

Companies can also save money on swag. While some companies, such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc ., are known for lavishing gifts on shareholders at the annual meeting, many companies have been cutting back on these expenses in recent years. An attendee of Alphabet Inc .'s annual meeting in June complained that the company wasn't giving out bags, caps or mugs, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Last year, 187 companies used the services of Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc ., the main provider of virtual shareholder meeting technology, to hold virtual shareholder meetings. This is up from 28 companies in 2010.

Virtual shareholder meetings have grown in popularity despite opposition from groups including the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) and the California Public Employees' Retirement System , as well as individual investors. Critics say that companies could use the technology to limit shareholder participation, allowing executives to cherry pick shareholder questions and avoid addressing critical issues.

The HP proposal was lodged by John Chevedden, an activist investor who earned his corporate gadfly bones by filing hundreds of shareholder proposals aimed at strengthening shareholder rights, corporate governance and transparency.

"A cloud meeting gives a company wide latitude to muzzle shareholders during the mandatory annual meeting," Mr. Chevedden said in a letter to the SEC regarding his HP proposal.

"As shareholders we believe it is important for companies to have in person stockholder meetings where investors can ask questions and speak before management and the Board," Mr. Chevedden said in an email to CFO Journal. "Our request for annual in person meetings should be seen as basic good governance and not a minor administrative detail."

You Know What Banks Need? Slot Machines, Miniskirts and Chocolate

By Eleanor Warnock

OGAKI, Japan Entrepreneur Takashi Tsuchiya is eager to talk of new ventures he has launched under his "OKB" brand. There's the OKB blueberry jam, the OKB chocolates, an OKB art gallery.

He makes loans, too.

Those are OKB loans, short for the institution he heads, the Ogaki Kyoritsu Bank . But the other OKB stuff is as exciting as banking, the 70-year-old Mr. Tsuchiya says, what with Japan's superlow interest rates forcing ever-slimmer margins on loans and turning his day job into drudgery.

"With these interest rates," he says, "you might make more money selling 10 OKB chocolates instead of managing a million yen in deposits" (about US$8,600).

It's tough being a small-bank operator in Japan. Customers are rapidly aging. Companies are stockpiling cash rather than borrowing. Big Japanese banks are seeking growth in the U.S. and elsewhere, but that's far beyond the means of smaller banks such as Mr. Tsuchiya's.

Some other smaller lenders have branched out, too, including one that offers a special interest rate to elderly people who can certify they recently gave up their driver's licenses. Another calls itself Tomato Bank.

Dozens of regional banks sponsor an annual food convention in Tokyo to proffer local delicacies such as lemon-flavored squid chips. The prime minister's famously outspoken wife, Akie Abe, showed up at the most recent event in November. Banks "aren't just for lending," Ms. Abe said. "We're in an era when the role of a bank has changed a little."

It is an economic era that has inspired other Japanese industries to branch out, too, including electronics companies that have moved into growing vegetables. Fujitsu Ltd . grows lettuce in a former semiconductor plant.

To go beyond lending, Mr. Tsuchiya has plastered his OKB brand around this town of about 160,000 people near Nagoya. That includes OKB rice, an OKB farm and, just in time for the new year, the new OKB chocolates at $25 for a box of 10.

He does have to stay on the right side of Japanese laws that say banks can't run other businesses. The store selling the chocolates, which opened in late December, is run by a partner of his bank.

The OKB farm, which grows the rice, is managed by an independent company that OKB paid to put a giant yellow "OKB Farm" sign out front. Chief Farmer Hiromasa Kasai works for the bank's think tank as well as the farm company and consults with Mr. Tsuchiya on new projects.

Mr. Kasai says the farm will likely turn a profit in the fiscal year that ends in March, partly because the think tank pays his salary.

"The Financial Services Agency wants banks to create a new business model," says Mr. Tsuchiya, "so we're using this brand strategy because we don't want to be like other banks."

A spokesman for the agency, Japan's banking regulator, declined to comment.

Mr. Tsuchiya, who giggles as he shows off gadgets such as a secret remote control to call his secretary, does direct some of his innovative instinct into banking. He claims to be the only bank president in Japan who has penned the lyrics to a song available at karaoke boxes nationwide.

The ballad, "To the One and Only Palm in the World," viewable on YouTube , is dedicated to one of the bank's signature services: palm-scanning ATMs. OKB customers can withdraw and deposit cash with only their birth date, personal identification number and palm scan.

To make its ATMs even more fun, OKB gives customers a chance to win cash prizes in slot, roulette, dice and pinball games when they deposit or withdraw money. "We're not a bank, we're a service company," says Mr. Tsuchiya. "If you're going to go to the bank, it should be fun."

Among the bank's other innovations: Women can get loans to finance divorce proceedings, undergo infertility treatments or get plastic surgery.

His branding strategy extends to the menu of one of the town's most expensive restaurants, Yontori, or "Four Birds," featuring $170 courses of traditional kaiseki cuisine and a private room with its own lavatory so VIP customers don't run into each other. The restaurant uses OKB rice and OKB blueberries.

"If a bank can make rice," says head chef Shujiro Tsutani, "maybe it's OK for a restaurant like us to do something different as well. It provides a spark" for the local economy.

He says a challenge is avoiding OKB talk when rival-bank executives come to dine.

The store selling the OKB chocolate says it has mostly run out of stock and is trying to fill 2,300 orders. Next door is an OKB studio from which a local radio station broadcasts a show. A short walk down OKB Street stands the art gallery it recently featured paintings by Mr. Tsuchiya's late father, himself a former president of the bank whose enthusiasms also ranged beyond financial services.

To Japanese customers, the name OKB brings to mind AKB48, a Japanese group featuring more than 100 mostly teenage girls who sing sugar-sweet pop songs.

Mr. Tsuchiya says he came up with the OKB brand first, but he did make a play on the pop group's name with "OKB45" 45 bank employees dressed in miniskirts who advertise for the bank at local events and "OKB3," three professional models who appear in advertisements for financial services.

The bank has expanded its market share over the past decade and increased net profit for the last two years. Mr. Tsuchiya says attaching the OKB name to both banking and nonfinancial ventures will help contribute to the local economy and create jobs.

"It's my dream," he says, "that one day people will say to us,  OKB was originally a bank?' "

HUD Nominee Carson Wants More Private Mortgage Entities

When quizzed on mortgage companies Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC), HUD nominee Ben Carson tells lawmakers he supports "some kind of backstop" for the home-loan market but favors introducing more private entities into the marketplace. Government-controlled FNMA and FMCC purchase loans from lenders and repackage them as securities that are insured if the loans default. Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin said after his nomination was announced in November the administration would move quickly to restore the mortgage firms to private ownership.

Former Rep Neugebauer Seen as Candidate for CFPB Job

Randy Neugebauer, a former Republican congressman, visited Donald Trump late Wednesday, fueling speculation that the president-elect may be considering him for a job in the administration. The Texas politician, who has led his party's attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until his retirement in December, is viewed as one of the top candidates to lead the agency if Trump decides to remove its current director before his term ends in 2018. In December, he discussed various steps for overhauling the CFPB with WSJ, while declining to deny or confirm his interest in its top job. Neugebauer couldn't be reached for comment.

Nordic Banks Could Copy Santander's Haste in Tier 3

Banks in the Nordic region could follow the example of Banco Santander and start issuing bail-in-able bonds before required to do so by national law, says Swedbank. Santander is planning to issue bonds compliant with total loss-absorbing capacity and minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities requirements, commonly referred to as TLAC and MREL, before Spain transposes relevant EU directives into national law. Non-preferred senior bonds issued by Santander before legislation amendments would include a clause signifying them as senior non-preferred in resolution and insolvency. This contractual solution could become a template for Nordic banks, Swedbank adds. (tasos.vossos@wsj.com, @tasosvos)

Italian Banks: How to Get Something for Nothing

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/italian-banks-how-to-get-something-for-nothing-1484243440" right price. For some Italian banks, that price is zero. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena found this out when it failed to raise fresh equity last month, forcing it into a state-backed rescue. But now a rival has found a way to exploit the problem: UBI Banca is buying three failed Italian lenders for a price of one euro.

The proposed deal announced Thursday will see UBI buy the three lenders, which all collapsed at the end of 2015 from Italy's resolution fund. But the takeover will only happen if the fund injects  450 million ($474 million) of fresh capital into the banks and takes  2.2 billion of bad loans out of them before the sale. Both are likely.

Dodd-Frank's Impact on Financial Stability and Economic Growth

Where has the Dodd-Frank Act been successful, and where has it failed? "http://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/full/10.7758/RSF.2017.3.1.02"by Martin Neil Bail, Aaron Klein and Justin Schardin published in the Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences, the "clear wins" are in areas of higher prudential standards (including for capital), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and single-point-of-entry resolution authority. They base their analysis on measures of "long-run sustainable growth and stability."

Barney Frank's 2012 Argument for President's Ability to Fire CFPB Chief

Comments Barney Frank made in a 2012 congressional hearing may have bearing on the possibility that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray could be removed from his post by the president, "http://yalejreg.com/nc/is-barney-frank-right-about-the-presidents-power-to-remove-the-cfpb-director-by-aditya-bamzai-john-f-duffy/" for the Yale Journal on Regulation's blog. The former congressman's views "may be relevant since he is the  Frank' in Dodd-Frank," the 2010 regulatory-overhaul law, the authors write. "No one doubts that if a change in administration comes, and the new president disagrees with the existing director, he or she can be removed," Mr. Frank said at the time. "And proving that you were not inefficient, the burden of proof being on you, would be overwhelming."

Authers  Note: glass half-full

Financial Times (FT.Com)

There are some things on which we can all agree. "https://www.ft.com/content/e4230062-b1ba-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2", and the US post-crisis expansion has been going on for a long time (albeit very slowly). But that still, according to Goldman Sachs' private wealth management group, means that US stocks are a buy. The glass is half-full, not half-empty.

I am nervous about this logic, but must concede that the US has been the most expensive stock market for years and has continued to rise. I interviewed Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs  private wealth management group, today on Facebook live. You can visit the video on "https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes/videos/10154864462430750/":

Here is her argument, using the graphs from the report. First, there is no sign of euphoria, even after the month of Trump-led excitement that followed the election. Instead the talk is still of decline, and Charmin even drew a parallel between a famous BusinessWeek cover from 1979 and a more recent illustration in the Financial Times:

That we are publishing such images could be viewed as a classic contrarian buying signal. Next comes the acknowledgment that US equity valuations are now in the tenth decile (meaning that they are more expensive than they have been 90 per cent of the time). This normally means that it is a terrible time to buy:

The problem is that expensive assets can always grow more expensive. And since the US market entered the ninth decile, by Goldman s metrics, it has gained another 38 per cent. Further, it is reasonable to pay a higher multiple when yields and inflation are low:

And the low bond yields of the present, combined with the low disparity between equity and bond returns of recent years, create a reasonable expectation that equities can move forward:

Not only this, but while rates are low, stocks do well until bonds reach an inflection point, apparently. (As there have not been all that many inflection points in the bond market this is a hard one to gauge, but here is Goldman's version of the effect). Rises in bond yields only cease to be good for stocks once they have passed 3.9 per cent. We are still only at 2.4 per cent:

Then there is an argument from the Trump effect. Any cut in the effective tax rate will be good for shareholders of US companies. Naturally, much devil is in the detail. Different companies pay different effective rates at present, and an attempt to level the terms of trade by imposing a destination tax would create some major losers among the bigger importers. But the logic that lower tax, all else being equal, is good for stocks, and that lower tax is very likely, is unassailable.

Finally, there are arguments from economics. Unlike other recoveries, this one has been accompanied by continuous household deleveraging. Easing lending standards, and signs that wages are beginning to grow, suggest that there is plenty of room now for credit to expand.

Many will suspect data-mining, so it is worth taking a look. There is also a broader argument to be made about the dangers of being out of the market. Long-term studies show that market-timing is very difficult. Lest anyone think that this is typical over-the-top bullishness from a notoriously bullish house, note that the outlook still characterises risks as high, particularly from China, and expects equity returns to be well below historic averages, thanks to multiple compression. "http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investment-management/private-wealth-management/intellectual-capital/isg-outlook-2017.pdf", and it is worth taking a read.

Two other points: first, we have to wait for the new president, and see how his first 100 days play out. Bond yields are back where they were early in December. US stocks have gone nowhere for a month. There is no great retracement of the Trump rally, and I think "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/beware-of-the-trump-dump-in-stocks-as-rally-peters-out-2017-01-11"But for another move forward, "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-12/trump-rally-needs-more-policy-fuel", it will need some more policy fuel.

Second, Goldman also subscribes to worries about Chinese credit. Yesterday I offered a chart putting Chinese credit in the context of previous great credit crises. Goldman offers a chart that is strikingly similar.

Chinese credit is still nagging away at influential investors  minds. It would not take much bad news on that front to start a new  risk-off  wave.

Thinking fast and slow

Last night I was lucky enough to have dinner withDaniel Kahneman. Almost certainly the only person ever awarded the Nobel Prize for economics even though he does not describe himself as an economist, "https://www.ft.com/content/a33e54d0-eefd-11dd-bbb5-0000779fd2ac?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2"nowadays best known for his book "https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555".

His greatest work was carried out with Amos Tversky, now no longer with us. Between them, working at a time when Israel s conflicts were at their peak, the two psychologists discovered and documented a raft of "https://www.ft.com/content/d2b32b2c-e034-11e3-9534-00144feabdc0?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2"that lead to "https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248"behaviour. Although neither had much interest in finance or investing, they became the fathers of behavioural finance.The Undoing Project, anew book by Michael Lewis, tells the story of their great collaboration.

Kahneman is now inhis 80s, but does not look it. He appeared in New York at a networking dinner, held in the unlikely confines of the LGBT Center in Greenwich Village, that had been organised by Zach Liberman and Saumitra Thakur of The College-100network. He is as fascinatingas he is generous with his time. Here are some of the thoughts he shared that struck me as most interesting:

* The most exciting field in psychology now is no longer decision-making theory but artificial intelligence   which is an area where investors are now taking an intense interest, and where the last 18 months have seen vital breakthroughs. Computers can now mimic an individual's voice so that it is indistinguishable from the original. It is not long before they can do this for video.

* He enjoys changing his mind, and has no  sunk costs  when he works. Changing his mind means that he has learnt something.

* Sunk costs   or in a psychological context, a commitment to a belief or a theory that we have already nurtured   are a great problem, and cause many to get stuck. This applies either to projects or to investments.

* The use of the words  rational  and  irrational  in common usage is a recent development. Their definitions are not clear-cut, and when someone accuses someone else of being  irrational    as often happens when coastal elitists criticise Trump voters   what they really mean is that they have a polite way to call them "evil".

* There is already great acceptance of behavioural theories in microeconomics. Even though he does not in any way consider himself an economist, his ideas have been widely taken on board. What is not clear is whether behavioural science can be applied to macroeconomics. It hasn't happened yet.

* Collaboration is a matter of luck. His collaboration with Tversky worked because they found each other funny.

*  The world is not kind to collaborators    a quote from Tversky himself. There is an urge to give credit to an individual and to assume that one person did something that makes collaborations very difficult. This was true even though this work with Tversky was a true collaboration. They were two brilliant men, but the work they did together was  clearly superior to what either of us could have done on our own .

*

As for Michael Lewis  book, he found it uncomfortable reading but hopes that it will inspire more collaborations. His response to the election of Donald Trump was to take a Valium and go to bed early.

Separately, "https://www.ft.com/content/ec89a34a-bc6f-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2" that the Trump victory owes much to the flaws in reasoning and perception that Kahneman and Tversky discovered, which he shared with Gary Silverman, is also worth reading.

Citadel to Pay $22.6 Million for Misleading Clients; Firm agreed to settle claims that it didn't always obtain the best price for orders despite giving assurances

Corrections & Amplifications:

The Securities and Exchange Commission found that Citadel Securities LLC didn't use algorithms that would have found clients the best prices. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Citadel did use the algorithms and referred to the SEC as the "Security and Exchange Commission." Also, the name of the earlier article's contributing reporter is Imani Moise. The first name was misspelled as "Imami." (Jan. 13, 2017)

U.S. regulators made Citadel Securities LLC pay $22.6 million for failing to fill customer orders at the best price, nabbing their first offender in the lucrative side market for executing retail stock orders.

Citadel Securities, which handles more retail trades than any other brokerage, agreed to settle claims that it didn't always obtain the best price for orders despite giving assurances that it would. The trading firm, owned by billionaire investor Kenneth Griffin, handles more than one in three retail orders that once would have gone straight to stock exchanges, promising better prices and speedier executions.

The practice in which Citadel and other high-tech "wholesalers" pay retail brokers to execute mom-and-pop orders has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years. At a Senate hearing in June 2014, Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) questioned TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. about whether such deals simply reap windfalls for retail brokers instead of ensuring the best price and trade execution for their clients.

Joe Saluzzi, a co-founder of brokerage Themis Trading LLC, said Friday that "this is all about a system that's been rigged and broken for many, many years."

Firms such as Citadel, which handles 35% of the average daily volume for retail shares, noted the SEC has approved the practice, known as payment for order flow. It results in better prices for retail clients than trading on exchanges, these firms say.

Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman, said the firm takes "very seriously our obligations to comply fully with all laws and regulations" and is "committed to providing superior service and execution quality to our clients."

The Securities and Exchange Commission's civil probe targeted two specific algorithms that Citadel used to execute about 2.6% of retail orders from 2008 to 2010. The algorithms decided how Citadel would fill an order when prices from a slower feed differed from prices on a richer and faster view that is sold by exchanges. When the two sources diverged, an algorithm known as FastFill used the price shown on the slower feed, which resulted in a worse price for "a substantial number of smaller orders," the SEC's order said.

Because of the way FastFill worked, some orders for larger numbers of shares actually received a better price, the SEC said.

Another algorithm, called SmartProvide, delayed the immediate execution of retail orders when the slower feed showed a better price than the faster one, the SEC said. In those cases, Citadel sent the order to the broader market, which sometimes netted clients a better price. In other cases, some orders that came back to Citadel got a worse price than if they had been immediately filled at the quote shown on the slow tape, the SEC's order said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's action faulted Citadel because its agreements with retail broker-dealers didn't fully explain how the algorithms worked, and only said Citadel would get the best available price for clients. Under the agreement, Citadel will pay a $16 million penalty and forfeit $5.2 million in profits and $1.4 million in interest. Citadel didn't admit or deny the allegations.

"The penalty reflects that it's a substantial amount for serious conduct," Robert Cohen, co-chief of the SEC's market abuse unit, said on a conference call with reporters. "It's a difficult area to penetrate if you are an investor or even a regulator, and it affected a lot of orders."

Retail brokers who supply Citadel with orders include Charles Schwab, Ameritrade, Scottrade Financial Services and E*Trade Financial Corp. Retail brokers shouldn't be faulted because, on average, their customers benefit from trading with market makers such as Citadel, said David Weisberger, head of trading analytics at IHS Markit Ltd.

"The size of the fine has nothing to do with the impact on investors and everything to do with disclosure," Mr. Weisberger said.

Critics such as IEX Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. have complained that speedy trading firms could exploit arbitrage opportunities created by the gap between the slower feed, known as the consolidated tape, and faster feeds sold by the stock exchanges. That gap has narrowed in recent years as exchanges, under pressure from regulators and money managers, committed to upgrade the slower tape's technology.

Authers  Note: glass half-full

There are some things on which we can all agree."https://www.ft.com/content/e4230062-b1ba-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2", and the US post-crisis expansion has been going on for a long time (albeit very slowly). But that still, according to Goldman Sachs' private wealth management group, means that US stocks are a buy. The glass is half-full, not half-empty.

I am nervous about this logic, but must concede that the US has been the most expensive stock market for years and has continued to rise. I interviewed Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs  private wealth management group, today on Facebook live. You can visit the video on"https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes/videos/10154864462430750/":

Here is her argument, using the graphs from the report. First, there is no sign of euphoria, even after the month of Trump-led excitement that followed the election. Instead the talk is still of decline, and Sharmin even drew a parallel between a famous BusinessWeek cover from 1979 and a more recent illustration in the Financial Times:

That we are publishing such images could be viewed as a classic contrarian buying signal. Next comes the acknowledgment that US equity valuations are now in the tenth decile (meaning that they are more expensive than they have been 90 per cent of the time). This normally means that it is a terrible time to buy:

The problem is that expensive assets can always grow more expensive. And since the US market entered the ninth decile, by Goldman s metrics, it has gained another 38 per cent. Further, it is reasonable to pay a higher multiple when yields and inflation are low:

And the low bond yields of the present, combined with the low disparity between equity and bond returns of recent years, create a reasonable expectation that equities can move forward:

Not only this, but while rates are low, stocks do well until bonds reach an inflection point, apparently. (As there have not been all that many inflection points in the bond market this is a hard one to gauge, but here is Goldman's version of the effect). Rises in bond yields only cease to be good for stocks once they have passed 3.9 per cent. We are still only at 2.4 per cent:

Then there is an argument from the Trump effect. Any cut in the effective tax rate will be good for shareholders of US companies. Naturally, much devil is in the detail. Different companies pay different effective rates at present, and an attempt to level the terms of trade by imposing a destination tax would create some major losers among the bigger importers. But the logic that lower tax, all else being equal, is good for stocks, and that lower tax is very likely, is unassailable.

Finally, there are arguments from economics. Unlike other recoveries, this one has been accompanied by continuous household deleveraging. Easing lending standards, and signs that wages are beginning to grow, suggest that there is plenty of room now for credit to expand.

Many will suspect data-mining, so it is worth taking a look. There is also a broader argument to be made about the dangers of being out of the market. Long-term studies show that market-timing is very difficult. Lest anyone think that this is typical over-the-top bullishness from a notoriously bullish house, note that the outlook still characterises risks as high, particularly from China, and expects equity returns to be well below historic averages, thanks to multiple compression."http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investment-management/private-wealth-management/intellectual-capital/isg-outlook-2017.pdf", and it is worth taking a read.

Two other points: first, we have to wait for the new president, and see how his first 100 days play out. Bond yields are back where they were early in December. US stocks have gone nowhere for a month. There is no great retracement of the Trump rally, and I think"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/beware-of-the-trump-dump-in-stocks-as-rally-peters-out-2017-01-11"But for another move forward,"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-12/trump-rally-needs-more-policy-fuel", it will need some more policy fuel.

Second, Goldman also subscribes to worries about Chinese credit. Yesterday I offered a chart putting Chinese credit in the context of previous great credit crises. Goldman offers a chart that is strikingly similar.

Chinese credit is still nagging away at influential investors  minds. It would not take much bad news on that front to start a new  risk-off  wave.

Thinking fast and slow

Last night I was lucky enough to have dinner withDaniel Kahneman. Almost certainly the only person ever awarded the Nobel Prize for economics even though he does not describe himself as an economist,"https://www.ft.com/content/a33e54d0-eefd-11dd-bbb5-0000779fd2ac?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2"nowadays best known for his book"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555".

His greatest work was carried out with Amos Tversky, now no longer with us. Between them, working at a time when Israel s conflicts were at their peak, the two psychologists discovered and documented a raft of"https://www.ft.com/content/d2b32b2c-e034-11e3-9534-00144feabdc0?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2"that lead to"https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248"behaviour. Although neither had much interest in finance or investing, they became the fathers of behavioural finance.The Undoing Project, anew book by Michael Lewis, tells the story of their great collaboration.

Kahneman is now inhis 80s, but does not look it. He appeared in New York at a networking dinner, held in the unlikely confines of the LGBT Center in Greenwich Village, that had been organised by Zach Liberman and Saumitra Thakur of The College-100network. He is as fascinatingas he is generous with his time. Here are some of the thoughts he shared that struck me as most interesting:

* The most exciting field in psychology now is no longer decision-making theory but artificial intelligence   which is an area where investors are now taking an intense interest, and where the last 18 months have seen vital breakthroughs. Computers can now mimic an individual's voice so that it is indistinguishable from the original. It is not long before they can do this for video.

* He enjoys changing his mind, and has no  sunk costs  when he works. Changing his mind means that he has learnt something.

* Sunk costs   or in a psychological context, a commitment to a belief or a theory that we have already nurtured   are a great problem, and cause many to get stuck. This applies either to projects or to investments.

* The use of the words  rational  and  irrational  in common usage is a recent development. Their definitions are not clear-cut, and when someone accuses someone else of being  irrational    as often happens when coastal elitists criticise Trump voters   what they really mean is that they have a polite way to call them "evil".

* There is already great acceptance of behavioural theories in microeconomics. Even though he does not in any way consider himself an economist, his ideas have been widely taken on board. What is not clear is whether behavioural science can be applied to macroeconomics. It hasn't happened yet.

* Collaboration is a matter of luck. His collaboration with Tversky worked because they found each other funny.

*  The world is not kind to collaborators    a quote from Tversky himself. There is an urge to give credit to an individual and to assume that one person did something that makes collaborations very difficult. This was true even though this work with Tversky was a true collaboration. They were two brilliant men, but the work they did together was  clearly superior to what either of us could have done on our own .

*

As for Michael Lewis  book, he found it uncomfortable reading but hopes that it will inspire more collaborations. His response to the election of Donald Trump was to take a Valium and go to bed early.

Separately,"https://www.ft.com/content/ec89a34a-bc6f-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080?emailid=56cef8b84218200300714481&segmentId=e2b21419-1ad0-96bc-fb17-88413ea973e2" that the Trump victory owes much to the flaws in reasoning and perception that Kahneman and Tversky discovered, which he shared with Gary Silverman, is also worth reading.

Heard on the Street
How Banks Flatter Themselves

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Investors are looking for higher returns from big banks, but one measure lenders are embracing can be deceiving.

Some big banks now highlight "return on tangible common equity" in earnings reports, which start landing in investors' inboxes on Friday. This measure typically makes banks look stronger than the more straightforward "return on equity."

In J.P. Morgan Chase's third-quarter earnings press release last year, for instance, it touted a 13% return on tangible common equity. That looked better than its 10% return on common equity.

Banks say the tangible-equity return number helps investors gauge success in putting core capital to work. Investors should be wary.

Return on tangible equity is a non-GAAP measure that doesn't follow generally accepted accounting principles, something J.P. Morgan didn't make clear in its release. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been warning companies in recent months about placing too much emphasis on such ersatz measures, although it hasn't addressed banks' use of return on tangible equity during its latest push.

Tangible equity excludes intangible assets such as goodwill created from acquisitions. When those assets are stripped out, earnings are measured against a smaller base, boosting the return figure.

At least 28 banks and other financial companies disclosed tangible-equity measures in SEC filings detailing their third-quarter results, according to consulting firm Audit Analytics.

In some cases the shift to return on tangible equity gave banks a more favorable metric to tout just when it was most useful to them. At J.P. Morgan, return on tangible equity was just another line item in its financial tables back in 2011. From then on, the bank has moved it higher in releases; it has been featured in the headline section since late 2013. The change happened as banks were struggling to post returns much above their theoretical cost of capital.

Bank of America had a return on average tangible common equity of 10.3% in the third quarter versus a return on average common equity of just 7.3%. It has included the non-GAAP number on the first page of its earnings releases since the second quarter of 2015. BofA identifies it as non-GAAP and features it alongside the comparable GAAP number, although the non-GAAP disclosure is in footnotes deep in its releases.

Although investors have been starved for decent returns in recent years, they should pass when banks offer them junk food.

MYLAN

EpiPen Coverage Dropped by Cigna

A top U.S. health insurer has dropped its coverage of Mylan NV's brand-name EpiPen and switched to the half-priced version Mylan launched in response to public outrage over its sharp price increases on the lifesaving drug.

Cigna Corp. swapped its coverage of the $600 EpiPen for Mylan's $300 version, according to a document on Cigna's website outlining its prescription-drug coverage changes for 2017. Cigna will also cover a competing drug device made by Impax Laboratories Inc., and allow physicians to choose which product to prescribe, Cigna spokeswoman Karen Eldred said.

Mylan launched the cheaper version, which it refers to as a generic, in December. The product is identical to the original -- which has been on the market for nearly 30 years but carries the generic name epinephrine instead of the brand name.

"We have revised our covered drug list to encourage use of the generic version as it will deliver more overall value to customers and clients," Cigna spokeswoman Karen Eldred said.

Mylan took heat last summer for its price increases on EpiPen the list price since 2007 had climbed nearly 550% from about $94, according to data from Truven Health Analytics.

In August, Mylan announced it would launch a cheaper generic in an attempt to quell the furor over its pricing practices. The move also better positioned the company to defend its market share in anticipation of greater market competition, some analysts said.

HESS

Exploratory Budget To Grow This Year

Hess Corp. said its capital and exploratory budget will grow by 18% in 2017 compared with last year as it dives deeper into the oil patch, following similar moves from other shale drillers that have made investors wary.

The company also announced it will take more than $4.6 billion in charges in the fourth quarter.

Some producers, such as Devon Energy Corp. and Pioneer Natural Resources Co., have "http://www.wsj.com/articles/some-shale-drillers-return-to-oil-patch-1471799516"as the price of crude oil has risen above $50-a-barrel territory, but investors have been wary that more drilling activity may be premature.

DELTA AIR LINES

Carrier Cites Costs Of Pilots Contract

Delta Air Lines Inc. which reported a 37% slide in fourth-quarter net profit on a small drop in revenue, said Thursday that it thinks the worst is behind it as absorbs higher pilot costs and holds down its capacity.

The Atlanta-based company said it believes the current quarter will represent a trough in operating margins, and that things will improve in the second half in spite of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which makes it more costly for foreigners to fly on Delta. In the fourth quarter, Delta's operating margin was 10.7%, compared with 17.1% a year ago. Its long-term goal is 17% to 19%.

In the December quarter, Delta's net income fell to $622 million, a decline it blamed almost entirely on the cost of a new pilot labor contract. A year ago, Delta earned $980 million.

Revenue fell by about 0.5% to $9.46 billion. The company beat Wall Street expectations on its fourth-quarter revenue and earnings per share excluding items.

TATA GROUP

New Chairman

Is Appointed

India's Tata Group chose a new chairman Thursday, picking an insider to help heal damage to the reputation and morale of India's largest conglomerate from a monthslong boardroom battle.

Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company that controls the group, said late Thursday it will appoint Natarajan Chandrasekaran as chairman, to succeed interim Chairman Ratan Tata on Feb. 21.

The group, which has revenue of more than $100 billion a year, has been struggling with a leadership crisis. The battle began when the Tata Sons board ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistryin October, saying it had lost confidence in his ability to lead.

LOWE'S

Retailer to Cut Jobs,

Reshuffle Workers

Lowe's Cos. is cutting thousands of workers and shuffling the jobs of thousands more, according to people familiar with the matter, as the home-improvement retailer tries to adapt to shifting shopping habits.

The company plans to eliminate less than 1% of its workforce, or fewer than 3,000 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter. But it also will shift many workers' "back-of-house responsibilities and activities to customer-facing ones," the person familiar said, aiming to redeploy them to help answer shoppers' questions about products or home-improvement projects.

The move comes after the Mooresville, N.C.-based hardware retailer in November cut its profit outlook for the year, citing weaker-than-expected store traffic.

CNBC reported earlier about Lowe's layoff plans.

Economy
Bank of Korea Keeps Rates Unchanged, Lowers Growth Forecast; Central bank expects South Korea's gross domestic product to grow 2.5% in 2017

SEOUL The Bank of Korea left interest rates unchanged for a seventh straight month Friday despite cutting its economic growth forecasts for the year.

The decision to keep the main policy rate at 1.25% was widely expected as the central bank balances concerns over continued softness in the economy with the need to keep a lid on high household debt and possible capital outflows. Uncertainties at home and abroad also favored a continued cautious stance.

The central bank now expects South Korea's gross domestic product to grow 2.5% in 2017 slower than its October estimate of 2.8%--Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said shortly after it unanimously decided to stand pat on interest rates.

The bank also expects consumer prices will rise 1.8% this year, compared with its previous estimate for a 1.9% gain, Mr. Lee said.

"There were big adjustments in private consumption," Mr. Lee said, noting the likely weaker-than-expected consumer spending was a primary reason for slashing the forecasts. The slump in exports has eased but the recovery in domestic demand has weakened, the bank said in a separate policy statement.

All 16 market analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the central bank would hold the base rate steady at its current record low. The bank "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-korea-surprises-with-a-rate-cut-1465434720".

Policy makers see downside risks outweighing those on the upside, with corporate restructuring and a cooling housing market clouding prospects for growth. However, uncertainties over "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fresh-arrests-in-south-korean-political-scandal-1483350679", who is awaiting a Constitutional Court decision on the matter, and the incoming U.S. administration's policies are keeping the central bank in wait-and-see mode.

The potential for capital flight spurred by the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy tightening also likely kept the bank from easing further.

Barclays economist Angela Hsieh said the central bank seemed comfortable with keeping the policy rate on hold for now but cutting rates still remained a viable option. "Factoring in weak domestic demand and a slowdown in construction, we believe further easing still cannot be completely ruled out," Ms. Hsieh said. She also said the uncertainty around U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed protectionist policies weighed on South Korea's trade outlook.

As the scope for further rate cuts has narrowed, the likelihood of a larger fiscal stimulus has increased.

The government said last month it would work out a fresh fiscal-stimulus package of more than 20 trillion won ($17 billion) with additional tax revenue and state funds for financing small companies, creating jobs and expanding public services. It also plans to front-load budget spending in the first quarter.

In December, the government lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 2.6% from 3%. The nation's economy expanded 2.7% last year, following 2.6% growth in 2015.

"High private debt remains a problem for the central bank, while rising U.S. interest rates will put further pressure on capital outflows," said Emily Dabbs of Moody's Analytics. She said she expects interest rates in South Korea to stay on hold through this year.

Finance & Markets: Deal Aims At U.K. Student Housing

U.S. real-estate investment firm Starwood Capital Group has made its first foray into Britain's student housing market, where demand has been booming as investors hunt for yield.

Starwood together with Round Hill Capital LLC, a U.K. real-estate investment and management firm, said Thursday that they bought six student housing assets and one development for about GBP 120 million ($145.6 million).

Demand from investors for alternative property assets, from student housing to hotels, has been surging. Shrinking returns on traditional commercial real estate such as offices and shopping malls have sent investors to niche sectors.

Alternative property assets captured 15% of all property transactions in Europe in 2016, a record share, according to data provider Real Capital Analytics.

Student housing has been one of the hot spots, and the U.K. is Europe's most active market. In 2016, the GBP 3.1 billion invested in the sector was the second highest on record, according to real-estate broker Cushman & Wakefield.

Starwood Capital made its first U.S. student housing investments in 2015. The decision to expand into the U.K. was partly because the country has attracted a large population of international students, said Zsolt Kohalmi, head of European acquisitions at Starwood Capital.

One out of five U.K. college students is from overseas, Cushman & Wakefield said.

Analysts have warned that Britain's exit from the European Union could weaken the U.K.'s appeal for foreign students.

"We believe that the U.K. is, and will continue to be, one of the top educational destinations for international students," Mr. Kohalmi said.

Technology
CIO Journal: AI Looms Large in Business World --- Plenitude of data, lower costs add impetus to adoption of the technology

Artificial intelligence, long a subject of fanciful forecasts, is starting to enter the corporate world in a much bigger way, as costs decline and the need increases to identify patterns within ever-growing troves of business data.

Once a mainstay of startups and big-tech firms such as International Business Machines Corp. and Alphabet Inc., technologies such as machine learning are taking a larger role inside corporate giants including American International Group and Fannie Mae, which are deploying AI to automate and augment tasks previously done by humans alone.

Chief information officers say the technology helps them complete routine tasks faster and often without human help, saving money while freeing their employees to focus on value-added activities. But as the technology becomes both less expensive and smarter, and more advanced technologies continue to emerge, companies will extend AI use beyond routine jobs to aid in decision making and spot trends and patterns that wouldn't be evident to the sharpest data scientist.

Spending on AI technologies by companies is expected to grow to $47 billion in 2020 from a projected $8 billion in 2016, according to market-research firm International Data Corp.

"We're at a point where artificial intelligence has finally come of age," said Philip Fasano, executive vice president and chief information officer at AIG. "Any CIO . . . has to be considering what AI and knowledge-based systems mean to their business."

AIG launched a number of AI projects in 2016 and will continue to invest in the technology, Mr. Fasano said. He has cut spending on outsourced projects, allowing the company to redirect money to AI initiatives, and plans to hire more programmers with AI development skills.

Less expensive, more abundant data storage, increased processing power and advances in deep-learning technology could lower the cost of artificial intelligence and make it possible for machines to learn with minimal programming from humans.

Nova Spivack, founder of AI startup Bottlenose, said the latest versions of deep learning employ hundreds of layers of neural networks. That power can be used in areas such as weak-signal detection, or the ability to spot trends more quickly.

Artificial intelligence has grown in fits and starts since the 1950s, but has become more viable as less costly and faster computers have made it possible to store and analyze massive data sets. Cheaper computing power also means companies can direct more money toward developing algorithms and acquiring new data.

In broad terms, artificial intelligence encompasses the techniques used to teach computers how to learn, reason, communicate and make decisions. Its applications span technologies that can recognize images and process human speech, to name a few.

Applications range from practical, highly targeted virtual assistants to broad-based artificial intelligence such as IBM's Watson system. Facebook Inc.'s Messenger service supports at least 33,000 chatbots, including one from MasterCard Inc. that allows Messenger users to check activity on their credit, debit and loan accounts.

New applications across industries continue to crop up. Massachusetts General Hospital plans to use a system that draws on a database of 10 billion images to identify anomalies on CT scans and other medical images. Industrial conglomerate General Electric Co. uses computer-vision systems to quickly identify cracks in jet engine blades.

Silicon Valley start-ups raised more than a quarter less venture capital funding in 2016 than in 2015, falling further than the global average and under-performing other US tech hubs.

The home of the world's largest tech companies saw total VC funding fall 28 per cent to $24.9bn, with 21 per cent fewer deals than in 2015, according to a PwC and CB Insights MoneyTree report published yesterday.

Global VC funding fell 23 per cent to $100.8bn in 2016. In the US, Los Angeles and Washington outperformed Silicon Valley. The Washington area posted a 26 per cent increase in fundraising year on year, buoyed by a $1.2bn round for -satellite company One Web, while Snapchat's owner Snap helped Los Angeles' so-called "Silicon Beach" achieve a 13 per cent increase in fundraising in 2016 as it heads towards an initial public offering.

Anand Sanwal, co-founder and chief executive of CB Insights, said 2016 was "a nice reset to 2015's exuberant funding environment".

"But for those who predicted 2016 would be the popping of the venture bubble, it was not," he said, comparing it favourably with 2014. "In 2017, unicorns and megarounds could see some of the same headwinds as in 2016 but, interestingly, the introduction of new big money investors from the likes of Asia and, increasingly, the Middle East may serve to offset that."

Start-ups based in Silicon Valley still receive more venture capital than any other region, with about a quarter of -global funding, almost double that of the next region, New York, and more than the whole of Europe.

The three most active investors by number of deals done were all based in Silicon Valley: 500 Startups, New Enterprise Associates and Intel Capital.

But in the fourth quarter, Europe beat the global slowdown, with funding jumping 22 per cent from the previous three months to $3bn, led by healthcare and mobile deals and investments from corporate VCs.

In the US, cyber security funding plunged 51 per cent quarter on quarter, after rising in the third quarter, while investors flocked to artificial intelligence start-ups, funding 71 deals with a total of $705m, up 16 per cent quarter on quarter.

Anand Rao, partner at PwC, said artificial intelligence had become a "major disrupter" across industries. "This is likely to continue in 2017, as AI moves from the technology sector to other traditional enterprise sectors like automotive, financial services and healthcare," he said.

ITG Agrees to Pay $24 Million in SEC Settlement; Brokerage firm neither admits nor denies claims it improperly obtained and lent foreign shares to clients, agency says

WASHINGTON Brokerage firm Investment Technology Group Inc. agreed to pay $24.4 million to settle claims that it improperly obtained and lent foreign shares to clients, the first penalty in a wide-ranging probe of misconduct in the market.

ITG is a broker that provides execution services and trade analytics to institutional investors. It provided American depositary receipts, which are certificates representing ownership of a foreign stock, to clients without ensuring they would be backed by the actual shares, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. The SEC said that resulted in the issuance of phantom shares, or ADRs that weren't tied to securities issued by a foreign company.

ITG, which didn't admit or deny the claims, agreed to pay $9.3 million in penalties and interest and forfeit $15 million in profits, the commission added.

"ITG's failure to properly supervise its securities lending desk caused ADRs to be issued that were not backed by actual shares, leaving them ripe for potential market abuse,'' said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the SEC's New York regional office.

ITG declined to comment. Frank Troise, its chief executive, said in an earnings call last year that the office accused of wrongdoing was shut down in late 2014.

"We take these matters very seriously, and we recognize that there is heightened sensitivity among some of our clients with respect to regulatory matters," Mr. Troise said in November.

The probe of ITG, which covered activity from 2011 to 2014, was related to the prerelease of ADRs, where banks issue depositary receipts without first having the underlying shares in their custody. The practice was intended to smooth trading by bridging different countries' settlement times.

Created by J.P. Morgan in 1927, ADRs make it easier for American investors to own stocks that are listed outside the U.S. They allow, for instance, U.S. shareholders to avoid receiving dividend payments in foreign currency; each ADR represents a specific number of foreign shares. Brokers who sell or transfer ADRs are typically responsible for ensuring that a matching number of foreign shares has been deposited with a custodian.

ITG's customers included other brokers who used the ADRs to close out short sales, the SEC's order said. Regulators have worried that prereleased depositary receipts could be abused for "naked short selling," according to people familiar with the matter. The activity is an illegal practice where traders bet against a company's stock by selling shares they don't own, without borrowing or locating the shares needed to cover the sale. The agency is also looking at whether such receipts are being used to illegally arbitrage between different tax regimes.

The SEC's press release said its investigation isn't over but didn't elaborate. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-banks-over-possible-mishandling-of-adrs-1478537802" Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as it examined whether the banks have broken controls designed to prevent market abuse and tax fraud, people close to the investigation said.

Two years ago, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brokerages-trading-orders-drop-after-sec-settlement-disclosure-1438300534"SEC allegations that it ran a secret trading project that relied in part on confidential information from its clients and improper trading in its dark pool, a private trading venue that doesn't disclose investors' orders.

Big-Bank Earnings: What Not to Look At; This financial metric large lenders are touting in their earnings releases can be deceiving

Investors are looking for higher returns from big banks but one measure banks are embracing can be deceiving.

Some big banks now highlight "return on tangible common equity" in earnings reports, which start landing in investors' inboxes on Friday. This performance measure typically makes banks look stronger than the more straightforward "return on equity."

In J.P. Morgan Chase's third-quarter earnings press release last year, for instance, it"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/document/3Q16_Earnings_Press_Release.pdf"on tangible common equity. That looked better than its 10% return on common equity, which was only in line with banks' theoretical cost of capital.

Banks say the tangible-equity return number helps investors gauge success in putting core capital to work. Investors should be wary.

Return on tangible equity is a non-GAAP measure that doesn't follow generally accepted accounting principles something J.P. Morgan didn't make clear in its release. The Securities and Exchange Commission"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/12/07/sec-and-non-gaap-accounting-whats-next/" in recent months about placing too much emphasis on such ersatz measures, although it hasn't addressed banks' use of return on tangible equity during its latest push.

Tangible equity excludes intangible assets like goodwill created from acquisitions. When those assets are stripped out, earnings are measured against a smaller base, boosting the return figure.

"It's a perfect metric that ignores all the costs of acquisitions," says David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs, an investment-research firm. J.P. Morgan has $47.3 billion in goodwill on its balance sheet; Bank of America has $69.7 billion.

At least 28 banks and other financial companies disclosed tangible-equity measures in SEC filings detailing their third-quarter results, according to consulting firm Audit Analytics.

In some cases the shift to return on tangible equity gave banks a more favorable metric to tout just when it was most useful to them. At J.P. Morgan, return on tangible equity was just another line item in its financial tables back in 2011. From then on, the bank has moved it higher in releases; it has been featured in the headline section since late 2013. The change happened "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304788404579523960269522076"to post returns much above their theoretical cost of capital.

Bank of America had a return on average tangible common equity of 10.3% in the third quarter versus a return on average common equity of just 7.3%. It has included the non-GAAP number on the first page of its earnings releases since the second quarter of 2015 previously it was just a line item. BofA identifies it as non-GAAP and features it alongside the comparable GAAP number, although the non-GAAP disclosure is in footnotes deep in its releases.

Although investors have been starved for decent returns in recent years, they should pass when banks offer them junk food.

Corrections & Amplifications:

The caption on a photograph in an earlier version of this article wrongly said it was of Barry Sternlicht. (1/12)

U.S. real-estate investment firm Starwood Capital Group has made its first foray into Britain's student housing market, where demand has been booming as investors hunt for yield.

Starwood together with Round Hill Capital, a U.K. real-estate investment and management firm, said Thursday they bought six student housing assets and one development for around 120 million ($145.6 million).

Demand from investors for so-called alternative property assets, from student housing to hotels, has been surging. Shrinking returns on traditional commercial real estate such as offices and shopping malls "http://www.wsj.com/articles/property-investors-explore-alternatives-in-europe-1484050103".

Alternative property assets captured 15% of all property transactions in Europe in 2016, a record share, according to data provider Real Capital Analytics.

Student housing has been one of the hot spots and the U.K. is Europe's most active market. In 2016, the 3.1 billion invested in the sector was the second-highest on record, according to real-estate broker Cushman & Wakefield.

Starwood Capital made its first U.S. student housing investments in 2015. The decision to expand into the U.K. was partly because the country has attracted a large population of international students, said Zsolt Kohalmi, head of European acquisitions at Starwood Capital.

One out of five U.K. college students is from overseas, Cushman & Wakefield said.

Analysts have warned that Britain's exit from the European Union could weaken the U.K.'s appeal for foreign students.

"We believe that the U.K. is, and will continue to be, one of the top educational destinations for international students," Mr. Kohalmi said.

Another draw: returns. Prime student housing yields are around 4.6%, compared with 4.1% for offices, according to an October report from property broker Savills.

The deal announced Thursday includes six buildings in five cities: one in Edinburgh, Cambridge, Southampton, and Glasgow, and two in Newcastle. A new development in Newcastle, due to be finished in 2018, was also part of the acquisition.

The new joint venture between Starwood Capital and Round Hill is aiming to build a 1 billion portfolio.

Round Hill Capital owns Nido Collection, which manages U.K. student accommodation assets. Round Hill in 2015 "http://www.wsj.com/articles/greystar-to-buy-u-k-student-housing-portfolio-1425859405" to U.S. firm Greystar Real Estate Partners.

Many U.K. college towns still lack high-quality student accommodation, said Michael Bickford, Founder and Chief Executive of Round Hill Capital. Meanwhile, "the demand for higher education in the U.K. is continuing to rise," he said.

Cigna Drops Coverage of Mylan's EpiPen in Favor of Cheaper Generic; Mylan, under fire for soaring price of lifesaving drug, launched generic option in December

A top U.S. health insurer has dropped its coverage of Mylan NV's brand-name EpiPen and switched to the half-priced version Mylan launched in response to public outrage over its sharp price increases on the lifesaving drug.

Cigna Corp. swapped its coverage of the $600 EpiPen for Mylan's $300 version, according to a document on Cigna's website outlining its prescription drug coverage changes for 2017.

Mylan's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mylan-launches-cheaper-generic-epipen-alternative-1481896300", which it refers to as a generic, in December. The product is identical to the original -- which has been on the market for nearly 30 years but carries the generic name epinephrine instead of the brand name.

"We have revised our covered drug list to encourage use of the generic version as it will deliver more overall value to customers and clients," Cigna spokeswoman Karen Eldred said.

Cigna will also cover a competing drug device made by Impax Laboratories Inc., and allow physicians to choose which product to prescribe, Ms. Eldred said.

Mylan took heat last summer for its price increases on EpiPen the list price since 2007 had climbed nearly 550% from about $94, according to data from Truven Health Analytics. EpiPen global sales are estimated to exceed $1 billion annually.

In August, Mylan announced it would launch a cheaper generic in an attempt to quell the furor over its pricing practices. The move also better positioned the company to defend its market share in anticipation of greater market competition, some analysts said.

Kaleo Inc., a privately held drug company in Richmond, Va., plans to relaunch its competitor to EpiPen in the U.S. in the first half of this year. The product, called AUVI-Q, was withdrawn from the market in 2015 after the device was found to potentially deliver inaccurate dosages.

A Mylan spokeswoman said Cigna's move was expected. "These changes were anticipated and are why we anticipate successful generic utilization," she said.

A spokesman for Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest administrator of prescription-drug programs for insurers, said EpiPen continues to be on its list of preferred drugs, and said it is evaluating the generic.

Meanwhile, CVS Health Corp. on Thursday said its pharmacies had begun selling Impax's device, a generic version of Adrenaclick, for a cash price of $109.99 for a two-pack, compared with a $649.99 cash price for EpiPen and $339.99 for the EpiPen generic.

"Cash price" refers to how much pharmacies charge customers who pay for medications themselves rather than through health insurers. However, the lower price is also available to insured customers, CVS said, which could benefit people with high-deductible insurance plans.

Impax, based in Hayward, Calif., also owns the rights to brand-name Adrenaclick, but hasn't sold the product for years, Mark Donohue, an Impax spokesman, said in an interview on Thursday.

Manufacturing problems have hurt sales of the generic version of Adrenaclick in recent years, but Impax has resolved the issues, Impax Chief Executive J. Kevin Buchi said at an investor conference this week. Mr. Buchi said Impax had taken advantage of the EpiPen controversy to improve its market share.

Impax doesn't disclose the product's sales, but Mr. Donohue said the product's market share increased from 4% at the end of 2015 to 10% at the end of last year.

BMO Capital Markets estimates the product's 2016 global sales more than tripled to $96.7 million from $28.3 million in 2015.

CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said the decision to offer the generic Adrenaclick was prompted by what the company was hearing from customers at retail locations and seeing on social media regarding EpiPen pricing.

"This was clearly a pain point for retail customers," she said.

Ms. Castel said CVS will keep carrying EpiPen and the EpiPen generic and work with customers to find the lowest cost option on an individual basis depending on coverage.

CVS Caremark, CVS's pharmacy benefit manager, confirmed its formularies include the EpiPen and Adrenaclick generics as well as the EpiPen branded product.

Shares of Mylan were recently trading down 2% to $36.55.

Finance & Markets: The Trader Behind SoftBank's Fund

By Liz Hoffman, Jenny Strasburg and Ryan Knutson

After SoftBank Group Corp. bought control of Sprint Corp. in 2013, the business went further downhill, losing ground to Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. and running dangerously low on cash.   9

Within SoftBank, executive Rajeev Misra was working to limit the damage. The former derivatives trader helped design a series of deals, pledging Sprint's handset leases, network equipment and eventually some of its airwaves to raise billions of dollars in fresh debt and blunt fears the struggling wireless carrier was headed toward bankruptcy.

Now, Mr. Misra is a top lieutenant to SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son for the entrepreneur's next big thing: a $100 billion fund to invest in futuristic technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and other "Jetsons"-like inventions.

Mr. Misra, who built Deutsche Bank AG's large credit-derivatives business in the last decade, is leading a crew of ex-bond traders and Wall Street salespeople helping Mr. Son raise and manage the SoftBank Vision Fund. Others include a trio of Deutsche and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alums well-connected among Middle Eastern royals.

Their knack for financial structuring and ties to ultrarich investors are key as the 59-year-old Mr. Son reinvents SoftBank as an incubator of next-generation technologies.

The fund is set to launch in coming weeks with money from SoftBank itself, several Middle East sovereign-wealth funds, and Silicon Valley luminaries including Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

Of course, the fund is Mr. Son's show.

Mr. Son has a record as a technology investor, albeit owing more to gut than careful study. He famously decided to invest in Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma five minutes after meeting him. That $20 million investment was valued at $58 billion when Mr. Ma's company, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., went public in 2014.

But his empire building has hit its limits. SoftBank carries more than $100 billion in debt and "can't leverage too much anymore," Mr. Son told VentureBeat in October.

The Vision Fund gives him billions of dollars to expand further using other people's money. Not that there aren't practical challenges.

One is finding bargains as startup valuations have climbed.

The fund, because of its large size, also will likely need to pursue large, mature companies in which returns are often harder to achieve.

Another issue is structuring deals without taxing SoftBank's balance sheet, in which the fund's holdings will be consolidated.

Solving those problems will fall to a team of financial whizzes in London. About 15 analysts recently set up shop in the city's posh Mayfair district, a neighborhood thick with hedge funds and high-end tailors.

Mr. Misra, SoftBank's 54-year-old head of strategic finance, is an Indian-born, U.S.-educated cricket fan who was once Mr. Son's banker, structuring debt for his early telecom takeovers.

The son of middle-class parents in New Delhi, Mr. Misra earned engineering degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. He worked in the 1980s designing satellites at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, then was at a technology startup before going to Wall Street to join Merrill Lynch's trading desk.

He jumped to Deutsche Bank in 1996 among a wave of Merrill Lynch defectors.

Mr. Misra spent the next decade building Deutsche Bank's credit-trading desk into one of the most profitable on Wall Street. Interest in these new, increasingly complex financial instruments was surging, and Mr. Misra tested ideas that paid off, former colleagues said.

In the early part of the last decade, he started a unit to buy and repackage asset-backed loans, making Deutsche Bank an early player in what would become a $500 billion market for collateralized debt obligations, one of the most lucrative but ultimately toxic inventions of the age.

He was "a creative genius," said Martin Belvisi, a former Deutsche Bank trader. "We were ahead of the curve in product design."

Mr. Misra, who declined to be interviewed, struck colleagues as tireless, cool under pressure and quirky.

He oversaw dozens of traders including Greg Lippmann, whose big bet in 2007 against the U.S. housing market was a defining trade of the era. It made Deutsche Bank about $1.5 billion in profit, offsetting mortgage-related losses elsewhere at the bank, a Senate subcommittee later found.

As the crisis hit, Mr. Misra left Deutsche Bank and later joined UBS Group AG to run its fixed-income business, then Fortress Investment Group LLC.

In 2014, he reconnected with Mr. Son at the lavish Italian wedding of SoftBank former executive Nikesh Arora, according to attendees.

Mr. Son wooed his old banker to SoftBank.

Pillsbury has previously been a limited partner and lead adviser to the firm. For more than 20 years he has made investments on behalf of Thayer Lodging Group. Mr. Pillsbury holds board seats with Thayer portfolio company Duetto Research Inc. and Adara Media Inc. 

"There's so many disruptive themes in play today [in travel], autonomous vehicles, true artificial intelligence," said Mr. Pillsbury. "We're just in the first revolution of mobile, the rise of asset-sharing, data analytics. It's hard to find an area of the travel industry that isn't under attack." 

Thayer Ventures invests primarily in seed and Series A rounds, and often takes board seats, Mr. Pillsbury said.

China's Regulators Fret Over Insurers

By James T. Areddy

SHANGHAI -- When Han Deqiang decided to plow $15,000 of his savings into life insurance, he wasn't planning for posterity. Instead, the 27-year-old was jumping into the latest trend in China's internet-powered investment boom -- one that is alarming regulators.

Though the product that Mr. Han bought from Foresea Life Insurance Co. is called insurance, it was more like a high-yield one-year deposit, earning more than twice the rate of a bank savings account. Foresea and other insurers are tapping huge amounts of cash raised from sales of newfangled investments to take big stakes in other Chinese companies and to fund international expansion.

China's regulators have publicly criticized insurers for straying from their core mission of providing long-term security and punished at least 10 firms, including Foresea.

China's top stock regulator last month likened insurers to corporate raiders by pointing to the industry's aggressive fundraising and short-term investing. He used the word "barbarians," a reference to the corporate takeovers and breakups by U.S. private-equity firms three decades ago financed with high-risk, high-yield junk debt.

The punished firms, including Foresea, which was told to stop certain fundraising, declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal. They have issued statements expressing confidence about their business strategies and financial health while echoing official calls for a more stable industry.

An insurance industry blowout could pose a challenge to an already shaky Chinese financial system, where bond defaults are rising and analysts estimate that as much as a fifth of bank loans are bad. It would threaten the development of promising industries such as health care, which demand sophisticated involvement by the insurance industry.

A concern is that, even as insurers attract cash, many customers see insurance as a path to profits rather than a way to seek shelter.

Initially, Mr. Han considered himself a short-term depositor in Foresea earning a healthy return. He didn't reinvest when the policy expired, as he saw the firm getting more active in China's stock markets, which the Shenzhen-based finance consultant considers volatile. "They were quite aggressive, so I felt this product also has some risks," he said.

Until now, Beijing has nurtured the industry's expansion to foster a safety net for ordinary Chinese and a long-term investment mentality. In less than two years, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission has issued 30 insurance licenses and has another 200 applications pending.

Driven by rising sales over the internet, industrywide insurance premium income grew 20% in 2015 to more than $370 billion and is projected to hit $700 billion by 2020, according to analysts at New York-based consultancy firm Oliver Wyman.

Anbang Insurance Group Co. epitomizes the industry's rising profile. It drew international notice for paying $1.95 billion for New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.

One of its funding sources is 28-year-old Dai Yiyun, an executive assistant in Shanghai who decided to plow $22,500 into a three-year interest-bearing deal that also includes a small amount of life insurance. When Ms. Dai checks Anbang's app, she says she is monitoring the rate of return and has no idea how much insurance the product includes. She adds that Anbang's high-profile investments give her a thrill.

"I feel I am part of the process, part of the deal," she said.

Anbang and Foresea, which is controlled by a Shenzhen-based property company called Baoneng Group, plus other insurers like that run by property firm China Evergrande Group, are especially active in corporate dealings at home. All three, for instance, are involved in a high-profile struggle for control of developer China Vanke.

In all, insurers held shares of a quarter of companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen at the end of September, compared with about 15% two years earlier, according to data from Wind Information Co.

Insurers are closely watched by traders for their ability to jostle stocks. After Guangdong Meiyan Jixiang Hydropower Co. disclosed on Oct. 25 that an Evergrande unit had become its largest single shareholder with 4.9%, the power producer's stock soared 26% in a few days. On Nov. 1, Meiyan said Evergrande had sold its entire stake the previous day. Meiyan's stock has since lost about 24%.

That kind of investing, more commonly associated with hedge funds than insurers, is what appeared to spark the unusual outburst from China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Liu Shiyu at a conference last month.

A few days later, regulators announced penalties for multiple firms, triggering a dive in the Shanghai Composite Index. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission also vowed to return the industry to core fundamentals. It proposed rules to limit ownership in insurers for a single investor to one-third, down from 51%, and ordered the industry to avoid gimmicks.

Much of the recent hand-wringing about fundraising hinges on an insurance product known as universal life that was purchased by both Mr. Han and Ms. Dai. While such policies are sold elsewhere, issuers in China have aggressively designed universal products that work more like short-term time deposits than insurance.

Under a typical scenario, a customer deposits a chunk of cash with an insurer for two or three years. In exchange, the buyer gets interest payments far above bank savings rates and an element of insurance coverage that is cheap to provide. Some deals pay only if the customer dies in a plane crash.

Insurance specialist A.M. Best Co. estimates that Chinese insurers held $157 billion in deposits associated with universal-life policies at the end of October, more than triple the amount two years earlier.

Such policies raise concern about possible mismatches between short-term fundraising and longer-term investment commitments, according to Christie Lee, Hong Kong-based director of analytics at A.M. Best. "These strategies can seriously threaten the solvency of life-insurance companies if the investment bets go the wrong way," she said.

Shanghai s skyline has long stood as a symbol of the future. Just ask the many Hollywood directors who have used the city as a backdrop for tales of artificial intelligence, time travel and high-tech espionage.

In Spike Jonze s Her, Shanghai plays a futuristic Los Angeles, a backdrop for Joaquin Phoenix s love affair with a computer operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. In Looper, time-travelling hitman Bruce Willis "http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/19/entertainment/la-et-mn-joseph-gordon-levitts-looper-will-be-released-differently-in-china-20120619" to live for 30 years until 2074, when his younger self will arrive to kill him. In Mission: Impossible III, the character Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) bungee jumps from the 53-storey Bank of China Tower after stealing a bioweapon.

With the "https://www.dezeen.com/2016/01/11/shanghai-tower-gensler-world-second-tallest-building/" on the 127-storey Shanghai Tower at the end of 2015, the city gained a potent new futurist symbol. At 632m, it is the world s second-tallest building, surpassed only by Dubai s 828m-tall Burj Khalifa.

Gensler, the US company that designed the tower, hired photographer Noah Sheldon to document its construction. While producing architectural photos to satisfy his client, Sheldon took advantage of his access to the site to capture other kinds of images.

Like most big Chinese construction projects of the past 35 years, Shanghai Tower was built by migrant workers from small cities and rural areas.

Sheldon s photographs capture the pride and physical confidence of workers engaged in dangerous work at high altitude.

 You d have a whole team of, say, scaffolding riggers, who would all be from one town in Henan. And they would all be cousins or friends,  says Sheldon.

 They re proud of the work, and we tapped into that. The way I approached the workers was to say,  You should be documented in the same way the building is.  

Especially striking was the use of female construction workers, who mostly did the same work as their male counterparts.

 The women were doing some really heavy, heavy labour,  says Sheldon.  They d usually be carrying the same huge things as the men. 

Lujiazui, the financial centre that hosts Shanghai Tower, is the ultimate symbol of China s transformation since Deng Xiaoping broke with Maoist state planning in 1978.

As recently as the late 1980s, the area was still a sparse collection of warehouses, factories and low-rise residential buildings.

But change came quickly. In 1996, the city s mayor boasted that 18 per cent of the world s cranes were in Shanghai. Today Lujiazui is a dense warren of skyscrapers.

The tower achieved worldwide fame when a video of "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/video-the-russian-daredevils-who-climbed-a-2-073-foot-tower-in-china/283825/"sneaking on to the site and climbing the unfinished building without safety equipment went viral in 2014. The incident made Sheldon s work more difficult.

Even with all his paperwork in order, security guards were suspicious of a foreigner prowling around with a camera. They also found his choice of subjects baffling.

 It was definitely something that the minders were worried about. They couldn t understand why I was taking pictures of the workers,  he says.

From base to top, the tower twists 120 degrees, a figure calculated to minimise the impact of Shanghai s high winds. Gensler says this innovation saved $58m worth of structural materials.

With the tower complete, the question is where Shanghai and China s economy go from here.

Economists have theorised about the existence of a   "http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21647289-there-such-thing-skyscraper-curse-towers-babel" : the world s tallest building often correlates with an impending economic crash. The Empire State Building in New York, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and the Burj Khalifa are notable examples.

Some analysts say China s real estate marketis a bubble. The Shanghai Tower s agent says only 60 per cent of the office space is currently leased. If the market does crash, workers like those in Sheldon s photos would be among the hardest hit, and the tower could come to stand as a monument to irrational exuberance.

A previous version of this article stated that Tom Cruise rappelled down the 88-storey Jinmao Tower, instead of the Bank of China Tower. It has now been corrected.

In China, Insurers Sell Risky Products to Fund Risky Investments, Freaking Out Regulators; Regulators have criticized insurers for straying from their core mission of providing long-term security

SHANGHAI When Han Deqiang decided to plow $15,000 of his savings into life insurance, he wasn't planning for posterity. Instead, the 27-year-old was jumping into the latest trend in China's internet-powered investment boom one that is alarming regulators.

Though the product that Mr. Han bought from Foresea Life Insurance Co. is called insurance, it was more like a high-yield one-year deposit, earning over twice the rate of a bank savings account. Foresea and other insurers are tapping massive amounts of cash raised from sales of newfangled investments to take big stakes in other Chinese companies and to fund international expansion.

China's regulators have publicly criticized insurers for straying from their core mission of providing long-term security and punished at least 10 firms, including Foresea.

China's top stock regulator last month likened insurers to corporate raiders by pointing to the industry's aggressive fundraising and short-term investing. He used the word "barbarians," a reference to the corporate takeovers and breakups by U.S. private-equity firms three decades ago financed with high-risk, high-yield junk debt.

The disciplined firms, including Foresea, which was told to stop certain fundraising, declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal. They have issued statements expressing confidence about their business strategies and financial health while echoing official calls for a more stable industry.

An insurance industry blowout could pose a challenge to an already shaky Chinese financial system, where bond defaults are rising and analysts estimate that as much as a fifth of bank loans are bad. It would threaten the development of promising industries such as health care, which demand sophisticated involvement by the insurance industry.

A concern is that, even as insurers attract cash, many customers see insurance as a path to profits rather than a way to seek shelter.

Initially, Mr. Han considered himself a short-term depositor in Foresea earning a healthy return. He didn't reinvest when the policy expired, as he saw the firm getting more active in China's stock markets, which the Shenzhen-based finance consultant considers volatile. "They were quite aggressive, so I felt this product also has some risks," he said.

Until now, Beijing has nurtured the industry's expansion to foster a safety net for ordinary Chinese and a long-term investment mentality. In less than two years, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission has issued 30 insurance licenses and has another 200 applications pending.

Driven by rising sales over the internet, industrywide insurance premium income grew 20% in 2015 to over $370 billion and is projected to hit $700 billion by 2020, according to analysts at New York-based consultancy firm Oliver Wyman.

Anbang Insurance Group Co. epitomizes the industry's rising profile. It drew international notice for "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hilton-to-sell-waldorf-astoria-new-york-to-chinese-insurer-1412601586".

One of its funding sources is 28-year-old Dai Yiyun, an executive assistant in Shanghai who decided to plow $22,500 into a three-year interest-bearing deal that also includes a small amount of life insurance. When Ms. Dai checks Anbang's app, she says she is monitoring the rate of return and has no idea how much insurance the product includes. She adds that Anbang's high-profile investments give her a thrill.

"I feel I am part of the process, part of the deal," she says.

Anbang and Foresea, which is controlled by a Shenzhen-based property company called Baoneng Group, plus other insurers like that run by property firm China Evergrande Group are especially active in corporate dealings at home. All three, for instance, are involved in a high-profile struggle for control of developer China Vanke.

In all, insurers held shares of a quarter of companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen at the end of September, compared with about 15% two years earlier, according to data from Wind Information Co.

Insurers are closely watched by traders for their ability to jostle stocks. After Guangdong Meiyan Jixiang Hydropower Co. disclosed on Oct. 25 that an Evergrande unit had become its largest single shareholder with 4.9%, the power producer's stock soared 26% in a few days. On Nov. 1, Meiyan said Evergrande had sold its entire stake the previous day. Meiyan's stock has since lost about 24%.

That kind of investing, more commonly associated with hedge funds than insurers, is what appeared to spark the unusual outburst from China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Liu Shiyu at a conference last month.

A few days later, regulators announced penalties for multiple firms, triggering a dive in the Shanghai Composite Index. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission also vowed to return the industry to core fundamentals. It proposed rules to limit ownership in insurers for a single investor to one third, down from 51%, and ordered the industry to avoid gimmicks.

Much of the recent hand-wringing about fundraising hinges on an insurance product known as universal life that was purchased by both Mr. Han and Ms. Dai. While such policies are sold elsewhere, issuers in China have aggressively designed universal products that work more like short-term time deposits than insurance.

Under a typical scenario, a customer deposits a chunk of cash with an insurer for two or three years. In exchange, the buyer gets interest payments far above bank savings rates and an element of insurance coverage that is cheap to provide. Some deals pay only if the customer dies in a plane crash.

Insurance specialist A.M. Best Co. estimates that Chinese insurers held $157 billion in deposits associated with universal-life policies at the end of October, more than triple the amount two years earlier.

Such policies raise concern about possible mismatches between short-term fundraising and longer-term investment commitments, according to Christie Lee, Hong Kong-based director of analytics at A.M. Best. "These strategies can seriously threaten the solvency of life insurance companies if the investment bets go the wrong way," she said.

Correlation Ventures, which uses proprietary analytics to power its role as a leader in co-investing, has closed a second fund at $200 million.

The firm, now with $366 million in assets under management, said the new fund was oversubscribed.

Correlation remains focused on its strategy as a co-investor, said co-founder David Coats, a managing director.

The firm co-invests in outside VC-led rounds in U.S.-based companies at all investment stages across all industry segments, typically writing checks of $1 million to $4 million, according to the firm. It doesn't take board seats in its companies.

As for recent exits, Correlation-backed Virsto Software was acquired by VMware and InstaEDU was acquired by Chegg. Another portfolio company, AirXpanders, went public in 2015.

The firm with offices in Palo Alto, Calif., New York and San Diego tapped its first fund to invest in 121 companies and is currently investing out of its second fund.

Why MetLife v. FSOC Still Matters

Republicans want more cost-benefit analysis of federal rules, and they are pushing legislation to that effect in the House this week. But the incoming Trump administration has another, less-noticed opportunity to advance the same cause.

That opportunity is MetLife Inc. v. Financial Stability Oversight Council, the legal battle over a 2014 decision by the council of U.S. regulators to subject the large New York-based insurer to federal oversight. Last March, MetLife won the opening round when U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/metlife-ruling/" of MetLife as "systemically important," a label that comes with Federal Reserve regulation. The parties are now awaiting a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which could overturn Judge Collyer's decision or leave it in place.

The outcome is less important for MetLife now that Republicans will be in charge of the executive branch. Even if the appellate court restores federal oversight of the company, Republican-appointed regulators might act to remove the "systemic" label and pull the company out from under the Fed's thumb.

But the case still matters because it has "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tracys-take-metlife-case-puts-cost-benefit-analysis-on-trial-1471865512". In overturning the FSOC's decision, Judge Collyer said the council had "intentionally refused to consider the cost of regulation, a consideration that is essential to reasoned rulemaking." Citing a Supreme Court case involving the Environmental Protection Agency, she said it was arbitrary and capricious for FSOC not to consider costs, even though the law doesn't explicitly require it to do so.

That could be read as applying broadly to federal rules, no matter which agency is issuing them. If Judge Collyer's decision stands, it could provide fodder for other companies and industry groups to challenge regulatory decisions.

The Obama administration was fighting that precedent. The question now is whether the Trump administration will continue the fight something it might be less inclined to do if key officials have a predilection for incorporating cost-benefit analysis into more new federal rules.

Letting Judge Collyer's ruling stand isn't without downsides for the new administration. The next time the FSOC wants to designate a company a "systemically important" threat to financial stability, the bar for justifying such a move would be higher.

Other federal agencies would also have to take the decision into account, considering costs more explicitly when writing new rules. Republicans might prefer to avoid that situation if they are concerned it will limit their executive authority and flexibility. Emphasis on "if."

The appellate court ruling could come soon. If it hasn't arrived before the Jan. 20 inauguration, the Trump administration could, in theory, move to drop the FSOC's appeal even before the court rules. (Some of the FSOC's 10 voting members might want to pursue the case, given that they voted in favor of designating MetLife. But the government appealed Judge Collyer's ruling without a formal vote by the FSOC, so it's not clear a vote would be required to drop the appeal.)

If the appellate court does issue a ruling, it will be worth reading closely, with an eye toward what it means for all industries and their regulators, not just MetLife and the FSOC.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

States to Feds: Back Off on New Fintech Bank Plan

By Telis Demos and Rachel Witkowski

A long-running conflict between states and the federal government over how to regulate online banking is coming to a head.

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will soon begin considering applications by financial-technology companies for national banking charters as a way to promote competition while both streamlining and strengthening regulation.

That could bring more fintech firms which offer online loans, smartphone payments and other services under the direct supervision of the federal government, giving them the power to make loans or transfer money without state approval. Under federal law, banks with national charters don't have to abide by some state lending rules, a practice known as "pre-emption."

In response, banking regulators in some of the largest states say they plan to aggressively challenge Washington's power to override them, arguing that states have been much tougher on "fintech" firms than their federal peers and warning against abusive payday lenders being able to exploit policies intended for tech startups.

"Fintech may be a catchy new word, but the concept of online finance isn't new," said Maria Vullo, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, in an interview.

On Monday, Sens. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) and Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.) sent a letter to the OCC arguing that its proposal would "upset the current financial regulatory structure" and suggesting alternatives including collaboration with state regulators to aid fintech startups.

State regulators say their rules barring loans above certain interest rates, known as usury laws, are a bulwark against abusive lending practices. New York, for example, bans payday loans and makes lending at annual rates above 16% a civil offense. They plan to submit comment letters expressing their concerns. The OCC said the proposal was open to public comments through Jan. 15.

Margaret Liu, deputy general counsel of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, an association of state regulators, on Monday said she shared the senators' concerns and warned the OCC's planned expansion would "pre-empt state consumer-protection laws" and "stifle innovation by arbitrarily picking winners and losers."

State regulators also are discussing some defensive measures, such as a mechanism to make it easier for companies to apply across multiple states for consumer-lending licenses.

Some fintech advocates have argued that dealing with dozens of different states hurts innovation. Without national banking licenses, startups are forced either to team up with banks or scale back their ambitions. Nonbanks generally can't hold deposits, lend across state lines or participate in bank-to-bank payment services.

Lending regulation is a major undertaking for states. California alone oversees lenders that made more than $400 billion worth of loans in the state in 2015, according to state figures. States also generate revenue by charging fees for lending and other licenses.

Already, states including California, Colorado and Texas have investigated or fined a handful of fintech firms for deceptive or prohibited practices in lending and money transfers. New York in 2015 began issuing formal licenses to hold and move the digital currency bitcoin.

One of the fears among state regulators is that payday lenders will argue that they are fintech firms, and use charters as an end run around state laws banning them. Payday loans can carry triple-digit interest rates and require full repayment typically within a few weeks; advocates say they are a needed form of credit for people who can't get bank loans.

The OCC, when it proposed its charters in December, said that many state rules on lending practices would still apply. These firms would also be subject to enforcement by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Separately, a 2009 Supreme Court decision preserved the right of states to sue banks on fair-lending matters.

Paul Nash, senior deputy comptroller at the OCC, told the Journal that "consumer protection and financial inclusion are important parts of the OCC mission," and that the agency "can condition its approval to require recipients to promote financial inclusion and implement strong consumer protections."

He said the regulator has added a unit dedicated to compliance and community affairs. OCC officials have previously said they have no intention of allowing abusive payday-lending behaviors.

It isn't clear how the CFPB or OCC's policies will change following the November election of Donald Trump. Some Republicans in Congress have already proposed reining in the CFPB, saying the agency has overreached its authority.

Meanwhile, California's lending regulator has been compiling data on payday lending, and may submit new rules by midyear, said Jan Lynn Owen, commissioner of California's Department of Business Oversight.

She said the OCC's charter proposal would complicate the state's continuing study of online marketplace lending, and could be a topic when the state meets with lenders to discuss its findings.

"To the extent that state consumer protection laws would be pre-empted &that's bad for consumers," Ms. Owen said in an interview. "If the CFPB retreats from its rule-making, that creates an opening for us."

In China, Insurers Sell Risky Products to Fund Risky Investments, Freaking Out Regulators

WSJ Pro: Lew Urges Democrats to Resist Dodd-Frank Dismantling

By Jacob M. Schlesinger

WASHINGTON A defiant Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urged congressional Democrats to hold firm against looming Republican attempts to scale back postcrisis financial rules, though he acknowledged tighter regulations may have brought some "unintended consequences."

"I don't see 60 votes for the repeal of financial reform," Mr. Lew said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, referring to the hurdle required to pass legislation in the Senate. While Republicans control the 100-seat chamber with 52 seats, Democrats can block major changes to the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank Act if they stay united.

Mr. Lew was speaking a week and a half before leaving his office when President Barack Obama's term ends Jan. 20. In the interview, he was critical of many of the items on the agenda of President-elect Donald Trump, his nominees and his congressional allies. The departing Treasury secretary didn't criticize any of them by name.

Shortly after winning the November election, the Trump transition team issued a statement saying it would work to dismantle Dodd-Frank, arguing the law had squelched growth.

Asked if there were any aspects of Obama-era financial policies that he would, in retrospect, agree to scale back, Mr. Lew demurred.

"My frustration is that we haven't been in a political environment where you could have that kind of conversation," he said. He suggested he might have been willing to provide more regulatory relief to small banks, but "how you define small banks is where it kind of breaks down."

"You could have a very sensible debate" about whether to ease compliance requirements for banks with up to $125 billion in assets, he said. But he noted a Senate Republican proposal that set the level at $500 billion. That "puts you into some of the largest financial institutions in this country and globally," he said. At that point, compromise negotiations "start to break down pretty quickly."

Mr. Lew's comments in the interviews defending Dodd-Frank tracked an article he wrote published last month in the New York University Journal of Legislation & Public Policy.

Asked to respond to critics who say the recent sharp increase in financial regulation has stifled risk-taking, the Treasury secretary said that "where I've heard questions come up that I'm sensitive to are in things like mortgage finance and small-business finance." He was quick to add that "I don't think that financial reform has been the only thing going on there," but that officials have been looking for "unintended consequences."

Mr. Lew singled out the mortgage market and said "that's something that still requires ongoing attention because there's a lot of noise in the signals and you don't want the bank examiner on the local level to be doing something that the national policy doesn't reflect." He then cited other economic factors that slowed the housing market and said, "I don't think the only reason for the gradual healing in the mortgage and housing sector has been financial regulation."

Departing CFTC Chief Warns Against Rollback of Postcrisis Financial Overhauls

By Nina Trentmann

Timothy Massad, the outgoing chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, warned the incoming Donald Trump administration against rolling back postcrisis financial regulation.

"My belief is that to repeal or dismantle the reforms we have implemented would be a major mistake," Mr. Massad said Tuesday during a speech at the London School of Economics. "Their repeal would not contribute to improving the economic conditions that might have given rise to populist discontent expressed in recent elections."

Financial overhauls introduced after the financial crisis, such as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, could however be improved upon, he said.

"As regulators, we should approach our jobs with a degree of humility," he said. "Financial markets develop so quickly. It is difficult to write rules that work the way you want them to."

U.S. regulators should focus on central clearinghouses, market liquidity, automated trading and the risk of cyberattacks, he said, although "it is unclear what will happen" amid increasing signs of a potential repeal of postcrisis regulation.

House Republicans, in a push to ease financial regulations they perceive as unduly rigorous, already are working on demolishing some of Mr. Massad's initiatives.

The House is expected to vote as early as Wednesday on legislation that would hamper the commission's attempts to complete long-delayed rules aimed at curbing speculation in commodities such as gold and oil.

"We have been working on this rule and I had hoped to finalize it," Mr. Massad said, adding it is up to the next commission to take up the matter.

In addition, Mr. Massad said he hopes there won't be a deterioration of international cooperation on implementing financial overhauls under the Trump administration. "If we enter a period when there is less international cooperation in regulating the global financial system, or worse, regulatory competition, that is likely to increase the risk of financial instability, which can in turn lead to another crisis," he said.

The U.K.'s planned departure from the European Union shouldn't result in a race to the bottom in terms of regulatory standards, Mr. Massad said. Challenges could also arise with respect to the regulation of clearinghouses and trading platforms, he said.

"[This] could affect London's role as the pre-eminent financial center in Europe," Mr. Massad said.

When the EU discussed clearinghouse equivalence with the CFTC, it "applied tougher conditions" than to other countries, he said. After its divorce from the EU, the U.K. could face a similar situation.

"It took a long time for us to negotiate our equivalence deal," Mr. Massad said. "We [the U.S.] could take action and withdraw equivalence recognition. There always has to be ongoing communication so that does not happen."

Moving euro clearing from London to continental Europe "could raise costs for businesses" and "could affect the location decisions for some financial-services firms," Mr. Massad said. Should the EU decide to insist euro clearing couldn't take place in London, this could lead to other countries following suit by issuing regulation on the clearing of products in their own currencies, he said.

The CFTC isn't trying to push through any last-minute initiative in the waning days of the Obama administration, he said, adding there could be some "cleanup" on things already in progress.

Fight Over CFPB Chief Heats Up as Democrats Fire Back

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTON Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday pushed back against Republican efforts to remove the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a day after two GOP senators called for his ouster.

In a letter to Donald Trump, 21 House Democrats urged the president-elect to avoid a "costly, meritless" fight to remove CFPB Director Richard Cordray, vowing to oppose any efforts to fire him.

Long critical of the watchdog agency created by the Obama administration after the financial crisis, some financial-industry participants and Republicans in Congress are pressuring the new administration to take steps to weaken the CFPB, starting with firing of Mr. Cordray, a former Ohio state attorney general.

To guarantee the CFPB's independence, the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law of 2010 states the president can remove its director only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office." That clause has prompted the bureau's opponents to look for faults with Mr. Cordray's career.

"Since the founding of our republic, no president has ever removed an independent agency head for cause," the Democratic lawmakers wrote Tuesday, adding that they understood "many powerful special interests" would like to see Mr. Cordray leave. They said efforts to dismiss him would be seen as an attempt to delay or thwart new rules that the CFPB is currently working on to curb payday lenders and the use of forced arbitration.

Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, also urged Mr. Trump on Tuesday to keep Mr. Cordray in his job, saying that firing the CFPB chief and abolishing the consumer bureau would only reward "special interests" in the financial industry and "shatter President-elect Trump's promise to hold Wall Street accountable and protect working people."

A CFPB spokeswoman has said Mr. Cordray was "confirmed by a bipartisan group of 66 senators to serve a term until July 2018 and has no plans to step down."

Mr. Trump has expressed a desire to roll back Obama-era financial regulations but hasn't discussed his plans for the CFPB specifically. His transition team didn't respond to a request for comment.

Consumer groups are stepping up their campaign to fight the Republican efforts, flooding Twitter with hashtags like #DefendCFPB and #StopTheDebtTrap.

"The threat against American consumers is very real," said Michael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, which supports the CFPB.

A large section of the House Democrats' letter was devoted to Mr. Cordray's steps to promote workplace fairness and diversity at the CFPB, reflecting concern that Republicans will use past charges of discrimination against minority and female employees at the CFPB as a reason to fire Mr. Cordray.

The House Democrats' letter was signed by 21 of the 23 Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee, led by ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters of California.

 The Mooch' Earns the Ear of Donald Trump

By Dave Michaels and Lisa Beilfuss

Wall Street's hedge-fund showman is ready to leave investing behind for a new act in Washington.

Wall Street's hedge-fund showman is ready to leave investing behind for a new act in Washington.

Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and an extravagant hedge-fund conference known as SALT, is likely to take a job advising Donald Trump that could be announced as soon as Thursday. Mr. Scaramucci has been a loyal if late arriving surrogate for Mr. Trump on television and Twitter as well as a near-daily fixture at Manhattan's Trump Tower transition headquarters since the New York businessman won the November election.

The role for Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, will likely focus on selling Mr. Trump's agenda through the media and public events, and as a kind of liaison to the business community. He's expected to work closely with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, who will become a senior adviser in the West Wing.

He also could have a voice on policies that affect Wall Street, including those that he's criticized, such as a controversial Obama administration rule shaking up the $3 trillion industry for advising investors on retirement savings. It is still possible the announcement could be delayed as the transition team rounds out the next list of White House appointees who will work for Mr. Trump.

"Being in the arena, at the center of power, is something Anthony has always desired," said Andrew Boszhardt, who started a money-management firm with Mr. Scaramucci in 1996. "I think Washington is in many ways a more natural fit" than Wall Street, he said.

Mr. Scaramucci, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stockbroker, joins a long list of Trump appointments with Goldman and Wall Street ties, following a campaign where the Republican nominee regularly bashed the firm and the financial industry.

For the self-described "diva" dubbed "The Mooch," the move to the White House is the latest maneuver in a career advanced through self-promotion, well-timed bets, and a knack for surviving failure and gaffes. Mr. Scaramucci supported Barack Obama in the 2008 campaign, then turned on the president for his handling of the financial crisis, briefly becoming a symbol of elitism after directly complaining to the new president in a public forum that he was "whacking the Wall Street piata." Comedian Jon Stewart lampooned him, saying the hits would stop after "the candy comes out."

During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Scaramucci stirred controversy again in October by likening the Obama investment-advice rule to the notorious 1857 U.S. Supreme Court Dred Scott decision extending the reach of slavery. He said the analogy fit because both actions were discriminatory and later tweeted that he meant both were "bad governmental decisions."

After his public confrontation with Mr. Obama, Mr. Scaramucci ramped up his political involvement, while pivoting to the Republican Party. His path to Mr. Trump's inner circle was a winding one, including fundraising for two Trump rivals for the GOP nomination. In the heat of that contest, Mr. Scaramucci attacked Mr. Trump as a "hack politician" and an "inherited money dude" after the businessman disparaged hedge-fund managers.

Eventually, Mr. Scaramucci changed his tune after meeting privately with Mr. Trump. He signed on to raise money for Mr. Trump in May, when many establishment Republicans still shunned the GOP front-runner. He was later named to the Trump transition team's executive committee, a group that includes Mr. Trump's children, and has helped to interview nominees for the administration.

The move to Washington means Mr. Scaramucci will sell his stake in Skybridge, which pitches high-cost, hedge-fund investments to wealthy individuals. Clients pay additional fees to Skybridge, which groups their cash and puts the pooled money with dozens of hedge funds.

It is unclear which buyers might bid for the firm. Mr. Scaramucci would be selling at a time when hedge-fund returns have lagged behind a more traditional mix of stocks and bonds for six straight years. Skybridge's flagship fund was down 1% through mid-December, on track for its second straight year of negative returns, according to an investor document.

Mr. Scaramucci is also likely to sell the lavish SALT (for SkyBridge Alternatives) conference, where he's hosted celebrities such as Will Smith and world leaders such as Tony Blair. The Las Vegas affair is synonymous with Mr. Scaramucci, who launched it during the depths of the 2008 recession. "It will be difficult to live on without Anthony," Marc Lasry, founder of Avenue Capital Group, and a major Democratic donor, said of SALT.

Mr. Scaramucci's charisma has propelled his career. It helped him survive being fired by Goldman Sachs in 1991, where he washed out of the real-estate investment banking business. His boss at the time, Michael Fascitelli, recommended him for another job in the division that sold stocks to institutional investors and private clients, where he excelled at cold-calling and building his client base.

Mr. Scaramucci later left Goldman, and started and sold a money-management firm to Neuberger Berman Group Inc. His next move was to start Skybridge, which at the time took stakes in new hedge-fund management firms. The business essentially failed during the 2008 financial crisis and lost money for its original investors, some of them former colleagues at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Scaramucci quickly pivoted the firm by purchasing Citigroup Inc.'s hedge-fund management group.

That former Citigroup business is the one he is poised to sell, and which Mr. Scaramucci has promoted through hundreds of hours of television appearances every year.

"He was not the best analyst or associate," said Mr. Fascitelli, who was also CEO of Vornado Realty Trust. "As he got more into what his skill set is -- dealing with people, selling and trusting his instincts -- he was really terrific."

Trump Nominees Financed Senators Deciding Their Fate

By Rebecca Ballhaus

President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet nominees include several who have financially backed the same people now charged with determining if they are qualified for their new posts.

Five of Mr. Trump's nominees Sen. Jeff Sessions, Reps. Tom Price, Mike Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney and former Sen. Dan Coats have collectively donated about $106,000 to senators sitting on the committees conducting their confirmation hearings, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Election Commission data for the past six years.

The donations were made through the lawmakers' leadership PACs, committees created most often by current and former members of Congress to help them raise their profiles and curry favor with their colleagues.

The donations aren't without precedent John Kerry, President Barack Obama's nominee for secretary of state in 2013, had previously chaired the Senate committee tasked with confirming him and donated to its members. Still, they show the potential for conflicts as confirmation hearings begin.

"We have a president-elect who talked about understanding that contributions buy something," said Larry Noble, general counsel with the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for reducing the influence of money in politics. "So it's disturbing that you then have people being nominated for these high-level cabinet positions who have made contributions to senators who have to confirm them."

Mr. Noble added: "You want to think that the Senate confirmation hearings are about truly determining whether these people are qualified for the job, not just about rewarding contributors."

The donations to committee members aren't confined to Mr. Trump's nominees who have served in Congress.

Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump's pick for education secretary, has together with her relatives in the past two cycles donated more than $220,000 to five senators on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which will conduct her confirmation hearing, according to campaign financial disclosure records. Linda McMahon, tapped to head the Small Business Administration, has donated more than $126,000 to five senators running her confirmation hearing.

Mr. Trump has drawn criticism for nominating to serve in his administration several top donors to his own campaign, after saying that as president he wouldn't be beholden to wealthy backers.

"When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do," Mr. Trump said of politicians in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in July 2015.

His nominees collectively gave more than $10.5 million to his campaign and allied super PACs during the election.

Mr. Sessions, Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, through his leadership PAC has donated $42,500 to seven of the eight Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which on Tuesday conducted his confirmation hearing. Before his nomination, Mr. Sessions had long sat on the committee.

In the 2016 election cycle, Mr. Sessions directed $7,500 to the committee's chairman, Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), who opened Tuesday's hearing by acknowledging the existing relationships.

"We're here today to review the character and qualifications of a colleague who has served alongside us in the Senate for 20 years," Mr. Grassley said. "We know him well."

Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions, said the senator has long supported the Republican Party. "So it's no surprise that he has supported his Republican colleagues on the committee that he chaired and has served on for two decades," she said.

Mr. Coats Mr. Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence who retired from the Senate this year through his leadership PAC has donated $25,000 to five members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which will conduct his confirmation hearing.

A leadership PAC created by Mr. Price, nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has donated $22,500 to six senators sitting on the two committees that will conduct his confirmation hearings.

Mr. Pompeo, picked to head the Central Intelligence Agency, has through his leadership PAC donated $14,500 to three senators on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And Mr. Mulvaney, nominated for director of the Office of Management and Budget, has donated $1,500 to one senator on the two committees overseeing his hearings.

Spokesmen for Messrs. Coats, Price, Pompeo and Mulvaney didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Supreme Court Weighs Difference Between a  Cash Discount' and a  Surcharge'

By Jess Bravin

WASHINGTON What is the difference between a "cash discount" and a "credit-card surcharge" at the corner store?

New York permits merchants to offer the first while prohibiting the second, prompting Supreme Court arguments Tuesday over how far the government may go in regulating price information.

Several small businesses say the law violates their free-speech rights to describe sales practices as they see fit, forcing them to silently incorporate into their prices the transaction costs, or swipe fees, they must pay credit-card issuers. The state justifies the practice, saying it prevents merchants from gouging and gives consumers clarity over how much they are paying.

"Certainly, consumers react to the way price information is communicated," Deepak Gupta, an attorney representing Expressions Hair Design, a beauty salon in Vestal, N.Y., and the other merchants, told the court. The law hides the cost of credit from consumers, Mr. Gupta said, while his clients want to discourage customers from paying with plastic.

It has long been established that the government can impose price limits, as it did during World War II and continues to do through programs such as rent control. But because the New York statute, like similar laws in nine other states and Puerto Rico, allows merchants to charge whatever they wish, Mr. Gupta contended the law was purely a speech restriction that raised First Amendment problems, rather than economic regulation where the state holds wide discretion.

Not all justices were persuaded.

Justice Stephen Breyer said that, while he personally didn't like the law, siding with the merchants risked disrupting other types of commercial legislation.

"We are going to discover all kinds of price regulation all over the place that suffers to greater or lesser degrees from this kind of problem, and you'll have judges all over the country substituting for regulators and others in trying to regulate," he said.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged the state's claim that its law promoted disclosure of prices.

"Can you explain to me how it's a disclosure requirement to suppress the actual cost of the credit-card purchase?" she asked New York's lawyer, Steven Wu.

"It's just requiring a different price the higher dollars-and-cents price for credit-card customers to be displayed," he responded.

U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Feigin argued that a similar federal law, since lapsed, that inspired New York's statute was justified as a method of protecting consumers, even if it did regulate speech.

As New York applies the law, a delicatessen could post "Pastrami sandwich: $10.20 credit card price. $0.20 discount per item for cash purchases," in one example the plaintiffs made. But posting "Pastrami sandwich: $10 cash price. 2% surcharge added to credit card purchases" would be a misdemeanor offense.

"It allows for easy comparison of prices and doesn't require the consumer to complete a math problem," Mr. Feigin said.

"Now hold on," said Chief Justice John Roberts. "You're saying that the American people are too dumb to understand that if you say $10 plus a 20-cent surcharge, they can't figure out that that's $10.20?"

Several justices said the law's actual text appeared to require a single price whether paid with paper or plastic.

"The statute simply says,  No seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.' To me, it's very simple: One price for everything," said Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Justice Samuel Alito suggested asking New York's high court to resolve what exactly the statute meant.

"I have never seen anybody younger than me buy anything with cash," said Justice Alito, 66 years old.

A decision in the case, Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman, is expected before July.

Indonesia Issues New Rules for Bond Dealers

By I Made Sentana and Ben Otto

JAKARTA, Indonesia Indonesia unveiled new rules demanding that bond partners recognize a duty to act in the Southeast Asian nation's interests and avoid conflicts of interest in working with the government, a week after severing ties with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. over what officials here said was a faulty equities downgrade.

In changes to a policy on primary dealers' obligations made public Wednesday, Indonesia's Finance Ministry added several clauses, including one stating that dealers must "maintain the partnership with the Indonesian government based on professionalism, integrity, the avoidance of conflict of interests and upholding the interests" of Indonesia.

The documents, effective Dec. 30, said the ministry can revoke primary-dealer status after sending three warning letters to a participating financial institutions or if a dealer ranks lowest in performance for two consecutive evaluation periods. Dealers who lose their primary-dealer status may reapply after 12 months.

The Finance Ministry appoints banks and securities firms as primary dealers to buy government bonds in auctions and then resell them in the secondary market. Nineteen financial institutions are on the list after the ministry cut business ties with J.P. Morgan for releasing in November a downgrade of Indonesian equities that officials said lacked credibility and could destabilize the country's financial system.

J.P. Morgan has said it is working toward a resolution with the Finance Ministry. The bank said its business in Indonesia continues to operate as usual and that the effect on clients is minimal.

The altered regulation doesn't mention market reports produced by primary dealers' research teams, but the message is clear that the government wants financial institutions to act credibly, including by issuing research that must be based on economic data, said Josua Pardede, an economist with Bank Permata, one of the primary dealers.

He said he understands the government's concerns given that the outlook for budget financing remains difficult this year and that he doesn't expect the new rules to affect analysts' ability to produce independent research

Falcon Bank's Former Singapore Manager Sent to Prison in 1MDB Probe

By P.R. Venkat

A Singapore court Wednesday sentenced a former branch manager of Switzerland's Falcon Private Bank AG to prison for crimes connected to the alleged multibillion-dollar misappropriation at Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB.

Jens Sturzenegger, 42, a Swiss national who managed Falcon's Singapore unit, was charged last week with 16 offenses under various laws, including one that requires banks and their officers to enact due-diligence checks on clients to prevent money laundering.

The court Wednesday handed a 28-week prison sentence and a fine of 128,000 Singapore dollars (US$89,000) to Mr. Sturzenegger after he pleaded guilty to six offenses. These include three counts of providing false information to police and central bank authorities, and three counts of failing to report suspicious transactions. The remaining charges were taken into consideration in his sentencing but won't be pursued separately by the prosecution.

While the charges didn't directly link Mr. Sturzenegger to fund flows at 1Malaysia Development Bhd., Singapore's central bank and regulator had said in October that the branch manager had been arrested that month in connection with the city-state's probe into the alleged misappropriation of billions of dollars from the Malaysian fund. Prosecutors have called the investigation Singapore's largest-ever probe of alleged money laundering.

On Wednesday, prosecutors told the court that Mr. Sturzenegger had lied to officers of the central bank and to the Singapore police's white-collar crimes investigation unit as they examined Falcon transactions related to 1MDB fund flows. Mr. Sturzenegger's lawyer said that his client had not derived any personal gain in relation to bank transactions, and sought a more lenient sentence, court documents showed.

The charges refer to Mr. Sturzenegger's business dealings with Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, who global investigators have said was key to orchestrating the alleged 1MDB misappropriation. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported that global investigators believe hundreds of millions of dollars of 1MDB money made its way through an account held at Falcon in Singapore to the personal accounts of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Mr. Najib has been cleared of wrongdoing by Malaysia's attorney general, who said that the money deposited in his account was a legal donation from Saudi Arabia and most of it was returned. Mr. Najib, the Malaysian financier Mr. Low and 1MDB have all denied any wrongdoing. 1MDB has pledged cooperation with any lawful investigation. None of the three could be reached immediately on Wednesday.

Falcon declined to comment on Wednesday. The bank has previously said it is initiating new control measures to prevent future issues and that it has been cooperating with authorities.

Investigators in at least five countries are probing the finances of 1MDB in response to allegations that billions of dollars have gone missing. Swiss investigators say they believe that as much as US$4 billion was misappropriated from the fund through several banks, including private banks in Singapore.

In October, Singapore's central bank withdrew the merchant-banking license of Falcon's Singapore branch that Mr. Sturzenegger managed for what it called "persistent and severe lack of understanding" of its regulations, and fined it S$4.3 million.

The same month, Switzerland's Office of the Attorney General expanded its scrutiny of Malaysia's 1MDB by opening a criminal investigation into Falcon. The Swiss attorney general's office said at the time that internal "deficiencies" at the Zurich-based bank may have caused it to fail to prevent alleged money laundering associated with 1MDB.

Mr. Sturzenegger is the fourth person to be handed a prison sentence in Singapore's 1MDB-related investigations.

In recent months, Singapore courts have convicted three former bankers at the local branch of another Swiss private bank, BSI SA, for crimes related to their handling of fund flows connected to 1MDB. They were given prison sentences of varying lengths for crimes such as failing to report suspicious transactions, forgery and attempting to obstruct the course of justice.

Chinese Regulators Inspect Bitcoin Exchanges in Efforts to Stem Capital Outflows

BEIJING China's central bank is stepping up supervision of bitcoin trading as it escalates a battle to curb capital outflows and stabilize the yuan.

In separate statements, the Shanghai and Beijing branches of the People's Bank of China said they conducted spot inspections Wednesday of the major exchanges of bitcoin, a virtual currency many analysts have said has been used by investors to move money out of the country as the yuan falls in value.

Following the PBOC's announcements, bitcoin dipped more than 13% on the day. The virtual currency surged last year, and the major exchanges have claimed that China accounted for more than 90% of its global trading.

Representatives at the bitcoin exchanges cited by the regulator BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

The inspections came after warnings by the central bank last week about the risks associated with bitcoin trading and come as Chinese authorities are ramping up efforts to police the movement of capital offshore and ease pressure on the yuan. Latest official data shows that China's foreign-exchange reserves fell to the lowest in nearly six years last month, to $3.011 trillion, highlighting accelerated outflows and the central bank's intensified spending to defend the local currency.

In recent months, Beijing has tightened capital controls, making it more difficult for companies to invest overseas and for individuals to convert their yuan funds into foreign currencies. With bitcoin trading increasingly popular among Chinese investors, regulators are trying to close what analysts say is a channel that could contribute to more outflows.

Over the past few years, China has become a hub for bitcoin. Three of the largest exchanges are located in China, virtually all of the trading occurs there and the largest "miners" businesses that process transactions and maintain the network in return for newly minted bitcoin are also located there.

Two trends are driving bitcoin in China. One is its usefulness in getting money out of the country. Traders buy bitcoins on a Chinese exchange using yuan and then sell it on a foreign exchange using dollars. The other is simply speculation by active Chinese traders.

According to the PBOC's statements, the purpose of the inspections was to look into possible market manipulation, money laundering, unauthorized financing, currency conversion and other issues.

Last Friday, the central bank's Shanghai branch said it had met with executives of BTCC, one of the exchanges, warning them about potential risks in its operations and urging it to comply with rules and regulations. The central bank didn't elaborate.

"BTCC regularly meets with the People's Bank of China and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China," the exchange said in a statement on its website Friday.

BoE Criticized for Softer Bank Regulation

The author of the UK's 2011 Independent Banking Commission has criticized the Bank of England for softening its approach to bank regulation as memory of the financial crisis fades. Oxford professor John Vickers, himself a former Bank chief economist, says Bank executive Andy Haldane and former Governor Mervyn King were "leaders in making the case for more far-reaching reform of bank equity capital requirements. Alas a different view now prevails at the Bank of England," he says, suggesting current governor Mark Carney is not. "Pre-crisis there was a gross failure to appreciate that a highly-leveraged banking system is an accident waiting to happen. That problem, with time, was and remains fixable, but despite important progress it has not been properly fixed," he says. (adam.creighton@dowjones.com)

European Politics May Have Ratings Implications, S&P Says

The crowded European electoral schedule and the possibility of unexpected political outcomes could lead to sharp policy shifts in eurozone member states with implications for sovereign ratings, says S&P Global Ratings. The comments come in a report on Tuesday covering 19 eurozone sovereigns. "Our core view remains that, while any meaningful fiscal and political convergence of eurozone sovereigns is decidedly off the table, commitment to ensuring that all current members remain in the zone remains firm," said S&P Global Ratings sovereign credit analyst Frank Gill. S&P Global Ratings expects that any impending member state withdrawal from the Economic and Monetary Union "would focus minds on the negative implications for the financial and economic stability for that member state," he says.

Why MetLife v. FSOC Still Matters

Republicans want more cost-benefit analysis of federal rules, and they are pushing legislation to that effect in the House this week. But the incoming Trump administration has another, less-noticed opportunity to advance the same cause.

That opportunity is MetLife Inc. v. Financial Stability Oversight Council, the legal battle over a 2014 decision by the council of U.S. regulators to subject the large New York-based insurer to federal oversight. Last March, MetLife won the opening round when U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/metlife-ruling/" of MetLife as "systemically important," a label that comes with Federal Reserve regulation. The parties are now awaiting a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which could overturn Judge Collyer's decision or leave it in place.

The outcome is less important for MetLife now that Republicans will be in charge of the executive branch. Even if the appellate court restores federal oversight of the company, Republican-appointed regulators might act to remove the "systemic" label and pull the company out from under the Fed's thumb.

But the case still matters because it has "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tracys-take-metlife-case-puts-cost-benefit-analysis-on-trial-1471865512". In overturning the FSOC's decision, Judge Collyer said the council had "intentionally refused to consider the cost of regulation, a consideration that is essential to reasoned rulemaking." Citing a Supreme Court case involving the Environmental Protection Agency, she said it was arbitrary and capricious for FSOC not to consider costs, even though the law doesn't explicitly require it to do so.

That could be read as applying broadly to federal rules, no matter which agency is issuing them. If Judge Collyer's decision stands, it could provide fodder for other companies and industry groups to challenge regulatory decisions.

The Obama administration was fighting that precedent. The question now is whether the Trump administration will continue the fight something it might be less inclined to do if key officials have a predilection for incorporating cost-benefit analysis into more new federal rules.

Letting Judge Collyer's ruling stand isn't without downsides for the new administration. The next time the FSOC wants to designate a company a "systemically important" threat to financial stability, the bar for justifying such a move would be higher.

Other federal agencies would also have to take the decision into account, considering costs more explicitly when writing new rules. Republicans might prefer to avoid that situation if they are concerned it will limit their executive authority and flexibility. Emphasis on "if."

The appellate court ruling could come soon. If it hasn't arrived before the Jan. 20 inauguration, the Trump administration could, in theory, move to drop the FSOC's appeal even before the court rules. (Some of the FSOC's 10 voting members might want to pursue the case, given that they voted in favor of designating MetLife. But the government appealed Judge Collyer's ruling without a formal vote by the FSOC, so it's not clear a vote would be required to drop the appeal.)

If the appellate court does issue a ruling, it will be worth reading closely, with an eye toward what it means for all industries and their regulators, not just MetLife and the FSOC.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

States to Feds: Back Off on New Fintech Bank Plan

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/states-to-feds-back-off-on-new-fintech-bank-plan-1484132401" and the federal government over how to regulate online banking is coming to a head.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will soon begin considering applications by financial-technology companies for national banking charters as a way to promote competition while both streamlining and strengthening regulation. That could bring more fintech firms which offer online loans, smartphone payments and other services under the direct supervision of the federal government, giving them the power to make loans or transfer money without state approval. One fear among state regulators is that payday lenders could exploit national fintech charters, getting around usury laws.

In China, Insurers Sell Risky Products to Fund Risky Investments, Freaking Out Regulators

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-insurers-sell-risky-products-to-fund-risky-investments-freaking-out-regulators-1484130601" are tapping massive amounts of cash raised from sales of newfangled investments to take big stakes in other Chinese companies and to fund international expansion.

China's regulators have publicly criticized insurers for straying from their core mission of providing long-term security. An insurance industry blowout could pose a challenge to an already shaky Chinese financial system, where bond defaults are rising and analysts estimate that as much as a fifth of bank loans are bad. It would threaten the development of promising industries such as health care, which demand sophisticated involvement by the insurance industry.

WSJ Pro: Lew Urges Democrats to Resist Dodd-Frank Dismantling

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lew-urges-democrats-to-resist-dodd-frank-dismantling-1484095312" urged congressional Democrats to hold firm against looming Republican attempts to scale back postcrisis financial rules, though he acknowledged tighter regulations may have brought some "unintended consequences."

"I don't see 60 votes for the repeal of financial reform," Mr. Lew said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, referring to the hurdle required to pass legislation in the Senate. While Republicans control the 100-seat chamber with 52 seats, Democrats can block major changes to the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank Act if they stay united.

Departing CFTC Chief Warns Against Rollback of Postcrisis Financial Overhauls

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/outgoing-cftc-chief-warns-against-rollback-of-postcrisis-financial-overhauls-1484076853" chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, warned the incoming Donald Trump administration against rolling back postcrisis financial regulation.

"My belief is that to repeal or dismantle the reforms we have implemented would be a major mistake," Mr. Massad during a speech at the London School of Economics Tuesday. "Their repeal would not contribute to improving the economic conditions that might have given rise to populist discontent expressed in recent elections."

In a letter to Donald Trump, 21 House Democrats urged the president-elect to avoid a "costly, meritless" fight to remove CFPB Director Richard Cordray, vowing to oppose any efforts to fire him.

Peso, Lira Fall Again As Dollar Rolls On

The dollar rose to record highs against the Mexican peso and Turkish lira Tuesday, as political and economic concerns continued to bedevil the emerging- market currencies.

Late Tuesday, the dollar was up 1.9% to 21.81 against the Mexican peso. Against the Turkish lira, the U.S. currency rose nearly 2% to $3.7885.

Mexico's economy has come under pressure on worries that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on pledges to renegotiate key trade agreements with the country. Turkey's economy contracted in the third quarter for the first time since 2009, as the country grapples with accelerating inflation and political uncertainty.

"The selling in these currencies has been relentless," said Win Thin, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.

The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was slightly higher at 92.71. The dollar fell 0.2% against the Japanese yen to 115.76.

Coffee Prices Climb Amid Brazil Worries

Coffee prices rose Tuesday on concerns that dryness in Brazil could continue to affect coffee crops.

Arabica coffee for March delivery was up 2.4% to close at $1.477 a pound on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange, its highest close since Nov. 30.

Brazil is the largest coffee producer in the world, and rainfall in areas growing the mild-flavored arabica bean have been 60% below normal so far this month and 97% below normal in areas that grow robusta coffee, typically used in instant-coffee blends, according to WeatherBELL Analytics in New York.

In other markets, raw sugar for March was up 0.3% to close at 20.48 cents a pound, cocoa for March rose 1.1% to settle at $2,207 a ton, frozen concentrated orange juice for March was up 2% to end at $1.827 a pound and March cotton jumped 0.3% to end at 73.19 cents a pound.

CFTC's Chief Warns On Rules Rollback

"My belief is that to repeal or dismantle the reforms we have implemented would be a major mistake," Mr. Massad said Tuesday during a speech at the London School of Economics. "Their repeal would not contribute to improving the economic conditions that might have given rise to populist discontent expressed in recent elections."

Financial overhauls introduced after the financial crisis, such as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/dodd-frank-rules-on-business-up-for-a-rethink-1480334402", he said.

"As regulators, we should approach our jobs with a degree of humility," he said. "Financial markets develop so quickly. It is difficult to write rules that work the way you want them to."

U.S. regulators should focus on central clearinghouses, market liquidity, automated trading and the risk of cyberattacks, he said, although "it is unclear what will happen" amid increasing signs of a potential repeal of postcrisis regulation.

House Republicans, in a push to ease financial regulations they perceive as unduly rigorous, already are working on demolishing some of Mr. Massad's initiatives.

The Wall Street Trader Behind SoftBank's $100 Billion Fund; Ex-Deutsche Bank executive Rajeev Misra will lead the investments into next-generation technologies

By Liz Hoffman, Jenny Strasburg and Ryan Knutson 
1,199 words

Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

After SoftBank Group Corp. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443675404578057923410181426" of Sprint Corp. in 2013, the business went further downhill, losing ground to Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. and running dangerously low on cash.  

Within SoftBank, executive Rajeev Misra was working to limit the damage. The former derivatives trader helped design a series of deals, pledging Sprint's handset leases, network equipment and eventually some of its airwaves to raise billions of dollars in fresh debt and blunt fears the struggling wireless carrier was headed toward bankruptcy.

Now, Mr. Misra is a top lieutenant to SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son for the entrepreneur's next big thing: "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-operating-profit-rises-beating-forecasts-1478500882" to invest in futuristic technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and other "Jetsons"-like inventions.

Mr. Misra, who built Deutsche Bank AG's large credit-derivatives business in the last decade, is leading a crew of ex-bond traders and Wall Street salespeople helping Mr. Son raise and manage the SoftBank Vision Fund. Others include a trio of Deutsche and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alums well-connected among Middle Eastern royals.

Their knack for financial structuring and ties to ultrarich investors are key as the 59-year-old Mr. Son reinvents SoftBank as an incubator of next-generation technologies.

The fund is set to launch in coming weeks with money from SoftBank itself, several Middle East sovereign-wealth funds, and Silicon Valley luminaries including Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison, The "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-confirms-1-billion-investment-in-softbank-vision-fund-1483552846".

Of course, the fund is Mr. Son's show. He is its sole "key man" a formal designation for a fund's top decision maker and has tapped some of his longstanding relationships in the technology world to fill its coffers.

Mr. Son also has a record as a technology investor, albeit owing more to gut than careful study. He famously decided to invest in Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/09/19/softbanks-alibaba-alchemy-how-to-turn-20-million-into-50-billion/". That $20 million investment was valued at $58 billion when Mr. Ma's company, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., went public in 2014.

But his empire building has hit its limits. SoftBank carries more than $100 billion in debt and "can't leverage too much anymore," Mr. Son told VentureBeat in October.

The Vision Fund gives him billions of dollars to expand further using other people's money. Not that there aren't practical challenges.

One is finding bargains as startup valuations have climbed. Indeed, many investors questioned whether SoftBank overpaid when it "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-buy-arm-holdings-for-more-than-32-billion-1468808434" to buy ARM Holdings PLC, which designs chips used in smartphones.

The fund, because of its large size, also will likely need to pursue large, mature companies in which returns are often harder to achieve. Sprint, for instance, has fallen behind T-Mobile US Inc. to become the smallest of the four national U.S. wireless carriers.

Another issue is structuring deals without taxing SoftBank's balance sheet, in which the fund's holdings will be consolidated.

Solving those problems will fall to a team of financial whizzes in London. About 15 analysts recently set up shop in the city's posh Mayfair district, a neighborhood thick with hedge funds and high-end tailors.

Mr. Misra, SoftBank's 54-year-old head of strategic finance, is an Indian-born, U.S.-educated cricket fan who was once Mr. Son's banker, structuring debt for his early telecom takeovers.

The son of middle-class parents in New Delhi, Mr. Misra earned engineering degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. He worked in the 1980s designing satellites at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, then was at a technology startup before going to Wall Street to join Merrill Lynch's trading desk.

He jumped to Deutsche Bank in 1996 among a wave of Merrill Lynch defectors, including the German lender's future chief executive, Anshu Jain.

Mr. Misra spent the next decade building Deutsche Bank's credit-trading desk into one of the most profitable on Wall Street. Interest in these new, increasingly complex financial instruments was surging, and Mr. Misra tested ideas that paid off, former colleagues said.

In the early part of the last decade, he started a unit to buy and repackage asset-backed loans, making Deutsche Bank an early player in what would become a $500 billion market for collateralized debt obligations, one of the most lucrative but ultimately toxic inventions of the age.

He was "a creative genius," said Martin Belvisi, a former Deutsche Bank trader. "We were ahead of the curve in product design."

Mr. Misra, who declined to be interviewed, struck colleagues as tireless, cool under pressure and quirky. He chewed seeds in meetings and chain-smoked long, thin cigarillos that he later swapped for electronic cigarettes.

He oversaw dozens of traders including Greg Lippmann, whose "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117271874969422974" against the U.S. housing market was a defining trade of the era. It made Deutsche Bank about $1.5 billion in profit, offsetting mortgage-related losses elsewhere at the bank, a Senate subcommittee later found.

As the crisis hit, Mr. Misra left Deutsche Bank"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204349404578100180428890890"UBS Group AG to run its fixed-income business, then Fortress Investment Group LLC. In 2014, he reconnected with Mr. Son at the lavish Italian wedding of SoftBank former executive Nikesh Arora, according to attendees. Mr. Son wooed his old banker to SoftBank.

There, Mr. Misra and other executives, including Chief Financial Officer Alok Sama, have made even simple deals complex in pursuit of an edge. For example, rather than sell Alibaba shares to finance its takeover of ARM, SoftBank raised money based on the future value of those shares.

Already, Mr. Misra's Wall Street troops have played a role in the Vision Fund's birth, according to people familiar with the matter.

An early hire was Saleh Romeih, a Goldman executive who structured and sold the bank's deals to investors in the Middle East. Fluent in Arabic and Japanese, Mr. Romeih's responsibilities include acting as a liaison between the fund and sovereign-wealth funds.

Akshay Naheta, a former Deutsche trader turned hedge-fund executive, is overseeing a chunk of the fund's money that will go toward public stocks.

Meanwhile, Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu, who held senior roles at Deutsche Bank and Goldman, are advisers to the fund and have connected SoftBank to big investors. Last year, they helped introduce Mr. Son to the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-group-launches-investment-fund-1476398189" to the effort.

Property Investors Explore  Alternatives' in Europe; So-called alternative real-estate sectors such as student housing and data centers are enjoying brisk demand

Alt-property in Europe is on the rise.

So-called alternative-property sectors such as hotels, student housing and data centers captured a record share of Europe's commercial real-estate market in 2016, according to data tracker Real Capital Analytics.

The  35.1 billion ($37.1 billion) of deals in 2016 made up 15% of all property transactions, compared with 12% in 2015, Real Capital said.

Commercial real-estate investment has surged in recent years in part because ultralow interest rates have sent investors hunting for returns. And after years of strong demand pushing up prices in traditional commercial-property sectors offices, retail and warehouses investors increasingly have turned to alternatives.

Alternative property is yielding about 6.5%, compared with 5.9% for offices, the most actively traded real-estate sector in Europe, according to Real Capital.

Commercial-property investment in Europe overall declined in 2016 from a very strong year in 2015, falling about 30%, Real Capital data show, but alternative real-estate investment held up better, slipping 17%. And analysts say demand remains high.

Just before Christmas, the investment arm of French insurer AXA SA bought two different portfolios of health-care properties in Germany and Finland. Health-care deals more than doubled in 2016, compared with 2015.

AXA Investment Managers said it paid about  310 million for 17 health-care properties in Germany from U.S. private-equity firm Blackstone LP. In a separate deal, AXA bought 11 properties in Finland for  65 million.

Hideki Kurata, the head of alternatives at AXA Investment Managers Real Assets, said an aging population is a key demographic trend that made the health-care investments attractive.

"We're all getting older," Mr. Kurata said. Even if the economy falters, secular trends such as this "make alternative assets more resilient" than other real-estate sectors, he said.

Data centers where companies such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. house information systems had a big year in Europe. Investment volume of  5.6 billion was four times greater than 2015, Real Capital data show.

Student-housing investment also has been strong. In the U.K., the largest student-housing market in the region, 3.1 billion ($3.8 billion) of investment marked the second-biggest year on record, according to property broker Cushman & Wakefield.

The effect on foreign students of Britain's vote to leave the European Union has increased concerns among analysts, however. One out of five U.K. college students is from overseas, and these foreign students make up 26% of U.K. tuition fees, Cushman & Wakefield said.

But the hunt for returns is likely to continue to drive demand, "especially as real-estate investors increasingly turn to alternative assets such as student accommodation in search of returns unavailable elsewhere," said Mike Mitchell, who works on Cushman & Wakefield's student-property-investment team.

After such a strong year, some investors have voiced unease.

"One thing I'm wary of is the herd effect," Mr. Kurata of AXA said. "People are chasing yield, but higher yield comes with higher risk."

In health care, for instance, landlords need to make sure their tenant is providing quality service, he said. And because the sector is heavily regulated, understanding where government policy is moving is important.

"You shouldn't go into an asset class if you don't fully understand the operating risks," he said.

Another potential pitfall for alternatives: Because these markets are smaller, they are typically less liquid.

"It's easy to get into these sectors, but more difficult to get out," said James Petit, head of real estate in the U.K. and Ireland at the asset-management arm of German lender Deutsche Bank AG.

Deutsche Asset Management invested in alternative real estate such as gas stations and marinas before the 2008 financial crisis.

It has yet to go back, mostly because its clients are uncomfortable with the risks, Mr. Petit said.

Strong demand for alternative-property assets is expected to continue this year, said Tom Leahy, director of analytics at Real Capital. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started to raise interest rates, but European central banks aren't expected to follow quickly.

With interest rates set to remain low, "investors looking for income will increasingly look to the alternative-property sector," Mr. Leahy said.

Spare5 Inc. has changed its name to Mighty AI and raised $14 million in fresh funding.

Intel Capital led the round, with participation from Accenture Ventures, Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, New Enterprise Associates and GV, formerly Google Ventures. The company also said it has signed agreements with Intel and Accenture to provide its customers with more data and tools.

As more companies invest in artificial intelligence, they need more data to train their algorithms to carry out computer vision or natural language processing. Seattle-based Mighty AI provides tools that help companies create such training data.

The company will use the funding to expand its team and platform. Mighty AI said the partnerships will provide customers with access to the infrastructure they need to build artificial intelligence stacks, like Intel's chips, as well as training data and large-scale algorithms.

Courtside Ventures, an early-stage venture fund that invests in sports-related media and technology companies, unveiled its portfolio of inaugural investments.

Established earlier this year, the $35 million fund was formed as a strategic partnership between Bruin Sports Capital, the media, sports, marketing and branded lifestyle venture launched by George Pyne; anchor investor Dan Gilbert, founder of Rock Ventures; and WPP, the global marketing company.

The fund is led by partners Vasu Kulkarni, founder and chief executive of sports analytics software company Krossover, and Deepen Parikh, former partner at Interplay Ventures and co-founder of NYVC Sports.

Courtside said the fund is focused on seed and Series A funding centered on the technological transformation of content such as capture technologies, spoken audio and live-streaming platforms.

Bain Capital Ventures Hires Managing Director for Health-Care Investments; Yumin Choi joins firm after $600 million fundraising last year

Bain Capital Ventures, which closed a $600 million fund in mid-2016, has hired investor Yumin Choi as a managing director to lead a health-care practice focused on markets such as digital health and elder care.

Mr. Choi, who joined"http://www.wsj.com/articles/bain-capital-ventures-closes-600m-fund-1467993136" Capital Ventures from Boston-based HLV Venture Partners, will be based in Boston and invest nationally. Bain, which historically has invested 15% to 20% of its venture funds in health care, also invests in sectors such as population health and behavioral health.

Health-care investors face uncertainty stemming from a potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but Mr. Choi said he would only concentrate on persistent problems such as the high cost of medical care, the difficulty of coordinating patient care, and improving access to behavioral health-care services. These are challenges that will remain regardless of what happens to the law, he said.

New health-care legislation is also unlikely to affect the drive toward value-based medical payments, which reward health-care providers for delivering good outcomes. The transition away from conventional fee-for-service payments is slow, but value-based payments are here to stay, Mr. Choi said.

Bain Capital Ventures has previously backed companies such as Remedy Partners, which plays into this trend. Remedy provides software, analytics and services to health-care providers making use of bundled payments, an alternative to fee-for-service reimbursement that provides a single payment for services delivered during an episode of care.

Other Bain Capital Ventures health-care companies include data-science company Apixio Inc. and Quanterix Corp., whose Simoa technology uses single-molecule measurements to gain access to previously undetectable proteins.

Apple Sets Plan To Put $1 Billion In SoftBank Fund

Apple Inc . said Wednesday that it plans to invest $1 billion in SoftBank Group Corp .'s new fund to help finance technologies the U.S. company could use in the future.

"We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple ," said an Apple spokeswoman, Kristin Huguet . Ms. Huguet added that Apple has worked with the Japanese telecommunications company for many years.

The SoftBank Vision Fund, announced in October, aims to raise $100 billion. It is set to be launched formally in the coming weeks. In addition to Apple and SoftBank, which is investing $25 billion, Saudi Arabia's government is investing $45 billion. Others who have discussed investing include the sovereign-wealth fund of Abu Dhabi, the Qatar Investment Authority and chip maker Qualcomm Inc .

Apple 's participation in the fund reflects a shift in its investment strategy. Last year, Apple invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing Technology Co ., China's homegrown ride-sharing competitor to Uber Technologies Inc .

During a call with analysts in July, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the Didi investment unusual because the company typically acquires companies and technologies rather than investing in them. He said the company would do more investments but that it wasn't "something that you'll see a whole string of from us."

SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is creating the fund to help put his company and investors at the forefront of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, in which everyday objects such as thermostats, watches and cars are connected online.

While competitors such as Alphabet Inc . and Amazon.com Inc . have launched connected devices, Apple has largely stayed out of that arena. Its focus instead has been on the Apple Watch, a wearable device with some health-monitoring capabilities.

Joining SoftBank's investment fund could help Apple as it looks to integrate new technologies into its devices or ensure its smartphones are compatible with connected products such as thermostats.

"Apple doesn't want to sell a lot of the end nodes in the Internet of Things, but it does need to defend its core, smartphone business," said Roger Kay, market analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates.

Mr. Kay said the investment also is about alliances. He said Apple has generally operated independently but is increasingly looking to establish alliances with other companies, particularly in Asia.

Apple and SoftBank have business ties stretching back nearly a decade. In 2008, the companies struck a deal to make SoftBank the exclusive iPhone seller in Japan. The partnership drove record sales, helping make SoftBank Japan's third-largest cellular carrier by 2011.

Mr. Son is close to Terry Gou , the head of Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group, which manufactures most iPhones. During a December meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump , Mr. Son was photographed carrying a paper with Foxconn's logo. Foxconn, known formally as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co ., said after the meeting that it was in talks to expand its operations in the U.S.

Apple has roughly $237.6 billion in cash on hand, according to its annual report. More than 90% of that money, $216 billion, is held abroad because Apple would have to pay additional tax to bring it to the U.S.

Business News: Apple Joins Investors in SoftBank Fund --- Foxconn and Ellison also likely to be part of financing efforts to foster technology

Apple Inc . headlines a growing list of investors in SoftBank Group Corp .'s $100 billion technology fund, which is expected to include Foxconn Technology Group Ltd. and the family office of Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison , the Japanese telecommunications giant said Wednesday.

Apple separately said it plans to invest $1 billion in the fund. "We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple ," said Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet . She added that Apple has worked with SoftBank for many years.

The trio join investors that include Qualcomm Inc . and Saudi Arabia's government, which plans to invest $45 billion over a five-year period, SoftBank said Wednesday. SoftBank will invest $25 billion in its fund, it added.

Foxconn, known formally as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co ., didn't immediately reply to requests for comment. Oracle declined to comment on Mr. Ellison's investment. Qualcomm declined to comment.

The SoftBank Vision Fund plans to hold an initial close to its fundraising by the end of the month, with a final close expected in mid-2017, said people familiar with the matter. SoftBank 's recent investment into U.S. startup OneWeb Ltd ., which aims to use satellites to bring internet access to rural areas, could be placed into the fund, the people said.

The fund brings together many competitors with overlapping business interests that stretch back years. In 2008, SoftBank struck a deal with Apple to become the exclusive iPhone seller in Japan. Those phones are mostly made by Foxconn and many include microchip technology that Qualcomm licenses from SoftBank-controlled ARM Holdings.

Apple 's $1 billion investment is unusual because the company doesn't have a record of investing in venture-capital funds. It is the latest example of a changing investment strategy that last year included a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing Technology Co ., China's homegrown ride-sharing competitor to Uber Technologies Inc .

SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is creating the tech fund to help put his company and investors at the forefront of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, in which everyday objects such as thermostats, watches and cars are connected online.

"We see software and services becoming a core part of Samsung Electronics' DNA, and startups are key to achieving this vision," says David Eun, Samsung NEXT's founder and president.

The division has five offices globally and will be opening additional ones this year.

Chinese Investor Hillhouse Invests in Permira-Backed Magento

Corrections & Amplifications:

X.commerce Inc. previously was an eBay Inc. platform. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated X.commerce is a Permira portfolio company doing business as Magento Inc.

Permira portfolio company Magento Inc. said it would receive a $250 million investment from China-focused investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group.

A person familiar with the matter said Magento would be valued at more than $700 million with the latest investment.

Deal discussions with Hillhouse began in the fourth quarter of 2016 following a strategic review, said Phil Guinand, a Permira partner. During the review, Magento concluded China and the broader Asia region would be among the areas in which the company intends to expand, Mr. Guinand said, adding Hillhouse would be a minority investor in the business.

With the new capital, Magento will continue to invest in its products and strategically make add-on acquisitions, Mr. Guinand said.

The Campbell, Calif.-based company traces its roots to eBay Inc.

After completing a spinoff of PayPal Holdings Inc. in 2015, eBay that year sold its enterprise unit to a consortium of investors led by Permira and Sterling Partners for $925 million.

Permira carved Magento out of the eBay unit at the time of the deal.

Sterling Partners, meanwhile, teamed up with Longview Asset Management to merge eBay Enterprise's services division with former portfolio company Innotrac Corp. The combined entity now is called Radial.

Under Permira's ownership, Magento in 2016 purchased cloud-based analytics provider RJMetrics Inc.

Hillhouse focuses on the consumer; technology, media and telecommunications; health-care; and business-services sectors. The firm has invested in companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu Inc. and JD.Com Inc.

London firm Permira in 2016 signed deals to back companies including financial-services provider Alter Domus, German fashion retailer Schustermann & Borenstein GmbH and Chinese business Tricor Holdings Ltd., which provides back-offices services to enterprises.

Seed investor Streamlined Ventures has set out to raise up to $40 million for its second fund, according to a regulatory filing.

No commitments have been received for the fund, Streamlined Ventures II LP, the filing indicates.

Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Streamlined focuses on seed investments in areas including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, applications, APIs, on-demand services, virtual reality and quantum computing.

Streamlined raised $32.4 million for its first fund in 2014, according to a regulatory filing from the time.

The firm's portfolio includes oil-data startup "http://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-industry-vets-back-oil-data-startup-tachyus-with-5m-1476271805" and augmented-reality company "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120151217ebchaxddu" Inc.

Its exits have included scheduling app Genee, which was "http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-genee-acquisition-reflects-drive-to-ai-enable-digital-experience-1471951530" by Microsoft Corp. in August 2016.

Behind China's Tightened Monetary Stance

China's top leadership has hinted at a slightly tightened monetary stance in 2017. But bubbling below that seemingly unified goal are long-simmering tensions among various financial regulators, each with its own thoughts on what policy measures are appropriate.

A divergence between the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission came into focus in a recent speech by an official at the banking regulator.

Yu Xuejun said China should cut the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserves at the central bank, adding that other financing tools could be used to adjust liquidity after a cut, according to a report last week by state-owned Shanghai Securities News. Reducing the required reserve ratio, or RRR, would let banks lend more.

Tools like medium-term lending facilities, where the central bank agrees to lend to banks at a set rate for a few months, shouldn't be overused before a cut, Mr. Yu said.

But senior party officials at the recent "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-makes-stability-of-housing-financial-sectors-its-2017-priorities-1481894124" have called for "prudent and neutral" policy this year. That language, shifting from "accommodative" in their previous statements, implies that the central bank will refrain from cutting RRR for banks, much less lower interest rates, according to analysts.

The dissonance in rhetoric lies in different regulators' priorities. The banking commission looks out for banks, which in China are buckling under a surge of bad loans coupled with slowing economic growth. The central bank looks out for the broader financial system and attempts to address risk wherever it may arise, from trying to deleverage the local bond market to curbing declines in the yuan and arresting capital flight. Increasingly, it is also taking on a coordinator role between China's various lumbering regulatory groups.

Cutting banks' reserve requirement ratios risks adding to the cash flowing out of China the exact situation the leadership wants to prevent. The last time the central bank cut RRR was in March 2016, when it took the ratio down 0.5 percentage point to 17% for the largest banks. Since then, it has stuck with more flexible money-market instruments to adjust the supply of funds in the financial system, even though such measures are more expensive for banks.

Zhu Chaoping, an economist at UOB Kay Hian in Shanghai, said to "expect more fine-tune measures" this year, but not an RRR cut. The use medium- and short-term lending facilities started in 2015 and authorities are increasingly formalizing them as tools to adjust borrowing costs, he explained.

Given Mr. Yu's relatively narrow role at the banking regulator of overseeing state-owned financial institutions, his opinion might not carry much sway.

But his comments illustrate the need for more coordination between Chinese regulators. Similar policy tussles "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/08/03/in-a-mysterious-redaction-a-glimpse-of-chinas-policy-tussle/" between the central bank and National Development Reform Commission, the country's economic planner.

Unfortunately, analysts say last year's talk of "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-takes-aim-at-regulatory-overhaul-1468507534" has fizzled out. China's undeniable message right now is stability at all costs.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Wall Street Lawyer Jay Clayton Emerges as Top Candidate for SEC Chairman

By Dave Michaels and Michael C. Bender

WASHINGTON Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton has emerged as the leading candidate to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and could be announced as the nominee as soon as Wednesday, according to an official working with the transition team of President-elect Donald Trump .

Mr. Clayton, whose clients have included Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and Barclays Capital Inc ., would succeed SEC Chairman Mary Jo White , another lawyer with a history of representing Wall Street banks before becoming a regulator. Mr. Clayton, who met with Mr. Trump on Dec. 22, is a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP , where he also worked on the 2014 initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ., according to Sullivan's website.

Mr. Trump has also considered Debra Wong Yang, who served as a U.S. attorney during the administration of former President George W. Bush , for the role of chairman. Mr. Clayton appears to have surpassed Ms. Yang, a partner at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP based in Los Angeles, as the most likely candidate to run the SEC, which oversees the $27 trillion U.S. equity market. Mr. Clayton has spent his career working on the kinds of securities deals that the SEC has a hand in regulating.

Reached on his cellphone Tuesday evening, Mr. Clayton said he couldn't talk and hung up.

Mr. Clayton would become the latest Trump appointee with longstanding Wall Street ties, joining former Goldman executive Steven Mnuchin , Mr. Trump's choice for Treasury secretary; former Goldman President Gary Cohn , who will run the National Economic Council; and private-equity investor Wilbur Ross, the pick to head the Commerce Department.

Mr. Clayton represented Goldman when it received a $5 billion investment from billionaire Warren Buffett's company during the peak of the credit crisis in September 2008, according to his bio on Sullivan's website. He's also represented Goldman in connection with other investments and acquisitions, according to the law firm. Sullivan is a key outside legal adviser for Goldman and is more closely associated with Wall Street than perhaps any other law firm.

Mr. Clayton has a wide-ranging corporate practice spanning mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, corporate governance, and investment advice for high-net-worth families. Other matters that Mr. Clayton has worked on include advising Morgan Stanley on the sale of its physical oil-trading division and Bear Stearns on its sale to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . two deals shaped heavily by the financial crisis and its aftermath and the 2014 IPO of Moelis & Co ., a boutique advisory firm. He's also represented an ownership group for the Atlanta Hawks and British Airways in its 2010 merger with Iberia.

Mr. Clayton would take over the SEC at a time when congressional Republicans are pressuring the agency to loosen fundraising rules for smaller public companies, lighten its oversight of private-equity firms, and repeal executive-compensation rules opposed by corporations.

He would be one of at least three new members to join the SEC this year. The agency has two unfilled commissioner posts in addition to the chairman's role, which Ms. White will give up on Jan. 20.

Two other securities lawyers who have advised the Trump transition team, Paul Atkins and Ralph Ferrara, also have been viewed as possible candidates to run the SEC. Mr. Atkins, the chief executive officer of Patomak Global Partners, met with Mr. Trump in late November and is also regarded as a candidate to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Democrats Gather Ammo Against Treasury Pick Steven Mnuchin

By Gabriel T. Rubin

Liberal groups and Democratic senators are zeroing in on the record of Steven Mnuchin , President-elect Donald Trump 's pick for Treasury secretary, aiming to pressure Republicans into voting against his nomination. The campaign is part of a larger effort by Democrats to derail some of Mr. Trump's nominees.

The senators and groups are painting Mr. Mnuchin as an executive who oversaw thousands of foreclosures during the financial crisis while at the helm of OneWest Bank . Buying the bank, formerly known as IndyMac, eventually earned Mr. Mnuchin hundreds of millions of dollars. It is now part of CIT Group Inc .

The liberal group Allied Progress is launching a six-figure television ad campaign in Arizona and Nevada to call on Sens. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) and Dean Heller (R., Nev.) to vote against Mr. Mnuchin's nomination.

"Mnuchin made millions after his bank foreclosed on homeowners," the ads say. They also accuse the bank of discriminating against prospective Latino home buyers, citing a complaint filed in November with the Department of Housing and Urban Development by two California-based housing organizations.

Both Sens. Heller and Flake criticized Mr. Trump for some of his conduct during the presidential campaign, and both face re-election campaigns in 2018 in states with rapidly growing Latino populations. Both states were hit particularly hard with foreclosures during the financial crisis.

Representatives for Mr. Flake and Mr. Heller didn't respond to requests for comment.

Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Mr. Mnuchin, said that he had "tirelessly worked to help families stay in their homes" during his time at OneWest. The bank was a "modification machine," not a "foreclosure machine," as Democrats allege, she said.

"The complaints filed by two California housing groups are grossly misleading since they rely on lending figures for time periods after OneWest sold its primary mortgage business," Ms. Bradshaw said. "During the time period the groups focus on, OneWest originated only a very small number of mortgages to anyone, because during that time period OneWest had sold its primary mortgage platform."

Opponents also are poring over records related to OneWest's activities while Mr. Mnuchin was there, particularly with regard to the legality of its foreclosure practices.

OneWest is under civil investigation by HUD for loan-servicing practices. CIT , OneWest's parent company, has said it is "committed to fair-lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve."

The campaign against Mr. Mnuchin comes as Senate Democrats plan out how to proceed with Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees and try to exact political damage on the new administration, even if they can't block any of the nominations.

"Looking at the cabinet, which is stacked with billionaires, corporate executives, titans of Wall Street, and those deeply embedded in Washington's corridors of power, it seems that many of his campaign themes are quickly being abandoned," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Tuesday.

Late last year, Senate Democrats led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont launched a website to solicit the stories of homeowners who were foreclosed on by OneWest during Mr. Mnuchin's time at the bank.

They have drawn attention to particular examples of aggressive foreclosure practices by the bank, including a case in which a Minneapolis homeowner was locked out of her home during a blizzard.

Ms. Warren has been particularly vocal in her criticism of Mr. Mnuchin, writing in a statement last month that "Mnuchin swooped in after the crash to take a second bite out of families by aggressively and sometimes illegally foreclosing on their homes," after "peddling the kind of dangerous mortgage-backed securities that eventually blew up the economy."

Additionally, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, wrote to Mr. Mnuchin asking him questions on a variety of banking and housing policies, including several related to his time in the financial services industry.

Mr. Mnuchin won't be providing written answers to those questions, Ms. Bradshaw said.

"The American public deserves to know where Mr. Mnuchin stands on these basic, straightforward questions about important housing and finance issues that he'll oversee," a spokesman for Sen. Brown said.

Mr. Brown will have an opportunity to question Mr. Mnuchin as a member of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Treasury secretary's nomination.

CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad to Step Down Jan. 20

By Dave Michaels and Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON Timothy Massad plans to step down as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Jan. 20, after nearly three years at the helm of the top U.S. derivatives regulator, the agency said Tuesday.

The departure, which was expected, is set to coincide with the end of the Obama administration. Mr. Massad, a Democrat, has sought to complete stricter rules for the multitrillion-dollar swaps market. His departure opens the door for a Republican successor who could ease or unwind some of his efforts.

President-elect Donald Trump will appoint the CFTC's next leader, adding to the bounty of financial appointees who could loosen the reins on Wall Street after years of tighter supervision under Democrats. Mr. Trump also is expected to appoint a new SEC chairman, a vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve as well as a new comptroller of the currency.

J. Christopher Giancarlo, the CFTC's sole Republican member, is expected to succeed Mr. Massad, at least on an interim basis. Mr. Giancarlo is also under consideration to fill the top CFTC role on a permanent basis, according to people who have spoken with the Trump transition team.

Mr. Massad's resignation plans mirror the exit of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White , who announced in November that she would leave the top U.S. markets regulator at the close of the Obama administration.

Mr. Massad has said the CFTC is underfunded given the scope of its oversight. His departure will leave the agency with just two commissioners: Mr. Giancarlo and Sharon Bowen, a Democrat. That will make it even harder for the undermanned agency to get anything done, given government sunshine laws that prevent commissioners from making decisions outside of public meetings.

The remaining commissioners will at least have a neighbor for a bit longer. While Mr. Massad plans to step down as chairman, he will stick around for a "few weeks in order to close out his office and handle administrative matters," the agency said in a news release.

In the press release Mr. Massad laid out a number of policy priorities he spearheaded, including the regulatory framework for trading and reporting swaps, products that accelerated the damage from the 2008 financial crisis. "I came to the CFTC with a number of priorities, and I am proud we have made significant progress in every area," he said.

Mr. Giancarlo may seek to ease some of the CFTC's postcrisis rules particularly swaps-trading requirements that he says have sent trading business overseas. But he has backed broad mandates for overhauling the swaps market, including the requirement that many be processed through clearinghouses, entities that guarantee trades in case one side defaults. He also could push for the introduction of examinations for swaps traders and brokers.

Mr. Massad took over the CFTC in June 2014, succeeding Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc . executive who gained a reputation as an aggressive regulator. European policy makers repeatedly chafed at Mr. Gensler's efforts to quickly and aggressively impose U.S. rules for derivatives overseas. Mr. Massad made smoothing those relations a priority after he took over.

In one of his biggest accomplishments, Mr. Massad succeeded last year in ending a lengthy impasse between the U.S. and Europe over the regulation of clearinghouses.

But in other areas he fell short of his own expectations. Last month, for instance, he failed to complete controversial curbs on commodities trading. Instead of finishing the position-limit rules, Mr. Massad opted to rewrite the proposal for the third time since 2011. That will allow the Trump administration, which has said it would dismantle the Dodd-Frank law calling for the rules, to finish them.

Mr. Massad told reporters he didn't want to complete rules that a commission under Republican leadership would be unlikely to implement or enforce.

Republican lawmakers were cordial with the CFTC chairman but refused to boost the agency's budget above $250 million for the past three years. Mr. Massad has said the agency lacks the resources to advance priorities such as testing the cybersecurity controls of firms it oversees.

He also clashed with members of his own party over bank-safety rules completed a year ago. The measure eased proposed requirements that banks set aside cash to offset the risk of losses on certain swaps trades, bucking objections from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats who wanted a stricter approach.

Mr. Massad defended the rules, which covered collateral known as margin, as "very strong," and said they were nearly identical to restrictions imposed by fellow U.S. regulators and similar to those imposed overseas.

Fidelity International Gets Nod to Sell Investment Products in China

By Rachel Rosenthal

Chinese financial regulators have given Fidelity International the green light to offer local investment products to wealthy mainland investors, making it the first major foreign fund manager to get such a permission.

The company's Chinese operation, FIL Investment Management (Shanghai) Co., has this week registered with the Asset Management Association of China as a private fund-management company. That step allows the firm to create investment products to sell to Chinese institutional and high-net-worth investors, the firm said Wednesday.

The move marks China's latest effort to open up its financial markets to foreigners, and could herald further opportunities for global money managers to set up shop without an onshore partner.

"This is a very significant milestone in our expansion into the world's second-biggest economy," said Daisy Ho, managing director, Asia Pacific ex-Japan, at Fidelity International . "The potential for the onshore market is huge."

To date, only a handful of global investment firms have gained approval to operate wholly-owned investment companies in China, allowing them to operate as stand-alone money managers. The list includes J.P. Morgan Asset Management , U.S. hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and U.K.-based Aberdeen Asset Management . Fidelity 's registration with AMAC, an industry body that is supervised by the country's securities regulator, will allow it to actually sell products in China, the next step in the process.

Since 2001, most asset managers looking to do business in China have set up joint-venture arrangements with partners onshore. Roughly 40 fund managers have established such relationships.

The benefit of going solo is that "you finally get to control your own destiny," said Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of Shanghai consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. "You can hire who you want to hire, and won't have to spend time on negotiating politics. What you can do in your businesses in Boston, New York or Hong Kong, you can now do in Shanghai."

Fidelity International has a six-month window to launch its first product onshore. The platform will be available only to institutional clients and high-net-worth investors, which includes individuals with financial assets of no less than 3 million yuan ($430,000) or personal annual average income of no less than 500,000 yuan for the past three years.

The firm's registration is the latest development in China's recent effort to welcome foreign investors to its markets. In December, China launched a trading link between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets, and last February officials lifted restrictions on foreign investors in China's main bond market.

Still, investors have met these efforts with caution. China's yuan has weakened sharply against a resurgent U.S. dollar falling nearly 7% against the greenback in 2016, and is approaching the psychologically important level of 7 yuan per U.S. dollar. China's bond market has been rattled by regulators' recent campaign to deleverage and tighten monetary conditions, and its stock market was one of Asia's worst-performing last year.

"We understand there will continue to be volatility in China's markets," said Ms. Ho. "But because of our nature, our vision is for long-term growth."

Fidelity International will have to compete with Chinese peers, who have a well-established presence on the ground. Still, the firm has more than a decade of experience operating in China, with a staff of 400 employees there.

The firm has mainly offered domestic institutional clients and retail investors the ability to invest offshore. The firm also has a quota of $1.2 billion under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor Scheme, a program that allows international investors to buy Chinese stocks and bonds with yuan raised outside China. That is one of the largest amounts held by any fund manager globally.

Established in 1969 as the international arm of Fidelity Investments , Fidelity International split from the U.S. organization in 1980, and is today owned mainly by management and members of the original founding family.

WSJ Pro: U.K. Regulator Raises Competition Concerns Over Mastercard 's VocaLink Buy

By Ian Walker

LONDON The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday Mastercard Inc .'s acquisition of VocaLink gives rise to competition concerns, and it is seeking undertakings from the companies to address these issues.

They have until Jan. 11 to offer a solution or the regulator will refer the deal for an in-depth investigation, it said.

Last July Mastercard said it was buying 92.4% of VocaLink Holdings Ltd. in a deal valued around $920 million. If the deal is completed, a majority of VocaLink's current owners will retain a 7.6% stake for at least three years.

Mastercard U.K. Holdco Ltd., a unit of Mastercard , already owns and operates credit- and debit-card schemes Mastercard , Maestro and Cirrus, and has bid to supply infrastructure services to U.K. interbank payment systems.

VocaLink's technology provides the backbone for non-card transactions such as employer-payroll deposits and consumer-bill payments, processing over 90% of salaries, more than 70% of household bills and almost all state benefits in the U.K.

It also unites the infrastructure of Britain's automated-teller-machine network among its participating banks via the LINK network. VocaLink reported $240 million in revenue last year and processed more than 11 billion transactions.

The regulator said its main concern is the LINK ATM network as VocaLink and Mastercard are two of the three most credible providers of infrastructure services to the network across the U.K. As such, it believes the merger would reduce the number of bidders and limit the ability of the LINK scheme to obtain good value when tendering for an infrastructure provider.

"The LINK ATM network provides an essential service for millions of customers. It's important that LINK has a good choice of providers when it comes to supplying the necessary infrastructure so it can take advantage of the opening up of payment systems to competition," Andrea Coscelli, acting chief executive of the CMA, and decision maker in this case, said.

"These concerns warrant a closer investigation in the event that Mastercard cannot address them at this stage," she said.

Mastercard said it would address this concern within the time frame provided.

VocaLink is owned by a consortium of 18 banks and building societies, with the four biggest being Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC , Barclays PLC , HSBC Holdings PLC , and Lloyds Banking Group PLC .

Last July, after the deal was announced, the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator said the four largest shareholders of VocaLink should sell all, or part of their holdings in the infrastructure provider if its acquisition by Mastercard doesn't go ahead, to open up the market and boost competition.

At the time of the deal, RBS confirmed it would sell its 21.4% shareholding in VocaLink and book a 150 million ($183.6 million) pretax gain in its accounts. Barclays also said it sold 13.68% of its shareholding in VocaLink for 104 million, leaving it with a 1.5% stake.

U.S., Europe Spat Over Bank Risk Set to Drag On

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine and Max Colchester

BRUSSELS A fight between U.S. and European authorities over how banks should calculate the riskiness of their assets will drag out into 2017, extending lingering uncertainty over the health of lenders' balance sheets.

After months of intense lobbying by European banks, the international standards setter, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , Tuesday delayed a key meeting.

European authorities complained that new proposed rules would force their banks to thicken capital cushions and stymie lending.

"The committee came to recognize the initial set of proposals was an overshoot," said a person familiar with the discussions.

Indonesia's Message to J.P. Morgan : Accentuate the Positive

By Carolyn Cui, Emily Glazer, Ben Otto and Rachel Rosenthal

Indonesia's decision to cut business ties with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . after a downgrade highlights the fine line banks and ratings companies walk.

In the banking world, securities analysts are supposed to provide independent, unvarnished investment advice to their commission-paying clients, but a negative word can alienate clients on the other side the stock and bond issuers that pay banks large fees to help them raise capital. That can cost bankers' access to corporate executives or government officials, and lose them business from the offended issuers.

Emerging-country governments often react strongly to sovereign-ratings downgrades, which can raise the cost of borrowing in international capital markets. The offense in this case, though, was a downgrade of Indonesia's stocks, partly occasioned by Donald Trump 's U.S. election win a ratings change that the country's finance ministry said could destabilize the financial system.

The ministry responded by ending all partnerships with J.P. Morgan as of Jan. 1, including the bank's role as a government-appointed primary dealer in certain bond auctions. For a nation to completely cut off a bank that way appears rare. It was a first for Indonesia.

The decision was the product of several run-ins between Southeast Asia's biggest country and the largest U.S. bank by assets, the ministry's director of debt portfolio and strategy, Schneider Siahaan, told The Wall Street Journal.

It was the third time a J.P. Morgan ratings call threatened to exacerbate selloffs, Mr. Siahaan said in 2008 and 2015 Indonesia issued warnings to the bank after its research division downgraded the government's rupiah bonds and the government believes J.P. Morgan has a conflict of interest.

"As a bonds dealer, J.P. Morgan was tasked to find buyers, but at the same time they issued a recommendation to sell," Mr. Siahaan said. "We see they're no longer effective in carrying out their obligations."

J.P. Morgan reiterated that its Indonesia business is operating as usual and that it is working for a resolution with the finance ministry. It declined to comment on possible conflicts of interest.

The bank was working toward improving its relationship with the country, according to a person familiar with the matter, when U.S. voters elected Mr. Trump. Then, in a Nov. 13 report about the global repercussions of Mr. Trump's victory, J.P. Morgan downgraded Indonesian equities to underweight from overweight, saying that a rise in bond-market volatility "increases emerging-market risk premiums."

The report, authored by six analysts led by veteran Asian strategist Adrian Mowat, also made smaller downgrades to Brazilian and Turkish equities.

Mr. Mowat wasn't available for comment.

The next day, the yield on Indonesia's 10-year government bond shot up 0.466 percentage point, its biggest intraday jump since January 2011, to 7.895%. Yields rise as prices fall.

While Indonesia's debt leverage is relatively low for Asia, its external debt is among the highest when measured against foreign-exchange reserves, according to Standard Chartered . That essentially makes Indonesia more vulnerable than other Asian countries to a stronger dollar and higher U.S. interest rates, as does the relatively high proportion of government debt held by foreigners nearly 40% of rupiah bonds and almost 90% of U.S. dollar bonds.

In some cases, banks under fire for negative opinions have sought to placate issuers or make amends for analysis that could be seen as unfair by firing employees or rewriting reports after publication.

Ratings firms can face similar heat.

The U.S. Treasury called Standard & Poor's decision to strip the country of its top credit rating in 2011 "flawed." When Standard & Poor's cut Poland's credit rating to BBB-plus from A-minus a year ago, citing its new government's radical policies, the finance minister at the time, Pawel Szalamacha, called the decision "incomprehensible &from economic and financial-analysis point of view."

 It is nonsense that Japan's national strength is lower than African countries to which Japan is providing assistance.'

 Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2002

When Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook for China's sovereign rating last March, citing a slowing economy and shrinking foreign reserves, state-run news agency Xinhua answered with an editorial accusing it of "practices that are damaging its own reputation" namely, holding emerging and developed economies to different standards. Moody's declined to comment.

In the early 2000s the government of Japan blasted all three of the major credit-rating companies for downgrades, including one from Moody's that rated the country's yen debt riskier than Botswana bonds. "It is nonsense that Japan's national strength is lower than African countries to which Japan is providing assistance," said then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at the time.

A government outcry over an equities call, like Indonesia's response to J.P. Morgan , is much rarer.

"There's instances of sovereigns railing against rating agencies where formal ratings are applied, which do have more real financial or economic consequences," said Mark Baker, emerging-markets portfolio manager at Standard Life Investments in Hong Kong. "I don't ever recall seeing an instance where a change of outlook from a bank elicited such a response."

Equifax , TransUnion Settle CFPB Claims of Deceptive Marketing

By Rachel Witkowski

WASHINGTON Top credit-reporting companies Equifax Inc . and TransUnion have agreed to pay more than $23 million over federal claims that they deceptively marketed and sold credit scores to consumers.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday that Atlanta-based Equifax and Chicago-based TransUnion  two of the three largest credit-reporting firms falsely advertised how lenders use credit scores and deceptively charged consumers for subscriptions to check their own score.

Credit reporting firms are required by law to provide one free credit report to consumers every year. Consumers typically end up seeing their credit score or report when applying for a loan, and some banks now offer the score free as part of a bank account.

Equifax and TransUnion collectively have agreed to pay more than $17.6 million in restitution to consumers and $5.5 million in fines, without admitting or denying the CFPB's findings.

"TransUnion and Equifax deceived consumers about the usefulness of the credit scores they marketed, and lured consumers into expensive recurring payments with false promises," CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in written statement.

Equifax and TransUnion in separate statements said they already have fixed many of the issues raised by the CFPB. The cited activities occurred as early as July 2011 for both companies, and for Equifax continued through March 2014, according to the CFPB.

The CFPB said both companies and their subsidiaries falsely advertised a credit score to the consumer as the same score lenders use when underwriting a loan. A lender typically uses several different scores that can sometimes include those provided by Equifax and TransUnion to determine the interest rate and eligibility for a consumer credit.

The CFPB also accused Equifax of offering a free credit-score trial and TransUnion of offering a similar trial for $1 after which the companies would automatically enroll the consumer into a subscription once the trial ended. The result was that consumers who didn't cancel their subscription during the trial period were then charged a recurring fee, typically $16 or more a month, the CFPB said.

Equifax agreed to pay $3.8 million in consumer restitution and $2.5 million in civil penalties. TransUnion has agreed to pay more than $13.9 million in consumer restitution and a $3 million penalty.

"The CFPB's investigation into these matters has been ongoing for nearly three years, and Equifax implemented changes addressing the CFPB's concerns shortly after the investigation began," Equifax said. "While Equifax does not believe it has violated any laws and has not admitted any liability, Equifax determined it was in its best interest to resolve the matter."

"We continue to believe that our consumer marketing has been clear and has complied with the law and other government guidance," TransUnion said. "However, we are committed to making improvements to our consumer experience, and over the past several months we have worked cooperatively with the CFPB to be the industry leader."

The CFPB estimates about 700,000 consumers had enrolled in TransUnion 's trial subscription then canceled it within two billing cycles but didn't get a refund.

"We have agreed to fund a generous program to fully compensate any consumer who may not have understood that his or her trial program would convert to a subscription," TransUnion said.

WSJ Pro: Senate Republicans Name Three More Lawmakers to Banking Panel

By Rachel Witkowski

WASHINGTON Republican leaders named three more lawmakers to the Senate Banking Committee as the new Congress convened on Tuesday.

Sens. John Kennedy (R., La.), David Perdue (R., Ga.) and Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) will join the panel, which will play a key role in deciding on potential changes to financial regulation considered in Congress this year.

Mr. Perdue, a former chief executive of Dollar General Corp. and Reebok International Ltd., has called for a repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, saying it is "one of the most onerous, overreaching pieces of legislation in my lifetime." He also has served on the board of Cardlytics Inc ., a banking data analytics company.

Mr. Tillis and Mr. Kennedy also have advocated for changing Dodd-Frank, according to past interviews.

The incoming Republicans on the committee join several Democrats who are also new to the panel: Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.

Republicans have a majority on the committee, one of the primary congressional committees with oversight of the financial industry. They are likely to face aggressive opposition from Ranking Member Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are staunchly opposed to Republican attempts to change the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.

Incoming Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) replaces Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), who will remain on the committee in a senior role. Mr. Shelby has advocated for changes to Dodd-Frank, including making the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's budget subject to congressional approval.

Mr. Brown has said he expects to have a better working relationship with Mr. Crapo than he did with Mr. Shelby.

"It will be a better day with Sen. Crapo," Mr. Brown said at an affordable housing conference on Dec. 1 in Washington. "Sen. Crapo is an honorable guy, way more conservative than I am. That's fine. The point is that he will work with us. I am optimistic that we can do things together."

Jesse Litvak, A Symbol of the Government Crackdown on Wall Street, Goes on Trial Again

By Sara Randazzo

A securities-fraud case that triggered widespread changes to sales tactics on Wall Street is once again in the spotlight as a former Jefferies Group LLC bond trader goes back on trial Wednesday in New Haven, Conn.

A jury in 2014 found the former trader, Jesse Litvak, guilty of fraud for misleading customers about the price he paid for residential mortgage-backed bonds. A federal appellate court cast doubt on the conviction a year ago, throwing out parts of the case and ordering the securities-fraud charges to go before a new jury.

The case, first brought by the Connecticut U.S. attorney's office in January 2013, accused Mr. Litvak of swindling customers out of $2 million by inflating the prices he said he paid for securities. Those misstatements violated securities laws, prosecutors claim, and caused hedge funds and professional investment managers to overpay for bonds.

The case caused many banks to re-evaluate their policies and cast a harsher eye toward negotiating tactics often considered commonplace sales puffery. Federal prosecutors have since brought civil and criminal charges against several other bond traders for similar sales tactics. A second conviction of Mr. Litvak could further bolster those efforts.

Jury selection is scheduled to begin Wednesday in the three-week retrial. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office and Mr. Litvak's lawyers at Williams & Connolly LLP declined to comment.

The Second U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in December 2015 that a judge unfairly blocked Mr. Litvak from introducing testimony that could have assisted his defense. That testimony, Mr. Litvak contends, would have shown that bond buyers don't rely on the price a broker paid for a security when making deals. Unlike stocks or other securities sold on open exchanges, bonds are sold in an opaque market, with prices negotiated through brokers.

"It's certainly fairer to defendants to put this expert testimony in," securities-law expert John Coffee of Columbia Law School said. "On the other hand, I think juries may give more weight to an investor saying,  We really want to know this [pricing information] for the following reasons.'"

The jury will hear details of trades Mr. Litvak made between 2009 and December 2011 while employed in the Stamford, Conn., office of brokerage firm Jefferies. Prosecutors say that, on average, he made $100,000 more in profits for Jefferies on each transaction than his customers were led to believe.

Mr. Litvak was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $1.75 million. He has been out on bail since his arrest, and he relocated to Florida in 2015, court filings show.

The appellate court, while ordering the retrial, didn't discount the underlying legal theory of the case: that misleading customers on bond prices could be considered fraud. "Without knowledge of Litvak's actions, the financial consequences of negotiations colored by false representations were virtually undiscoverable in the opaque RMBS market," the court wrote, referring to residential mortgage-backed securities. Defaults on mortgages that underpinned some of these securities were a major driver of the 2008 financial crisis.

Unlike in the first trial, the jury won't be asked to find that Mr. Litvak defrauded the government, charges that were dismissed by the Second Circuit. Because of that, Mr. Litvak has argued that the jury shouldn't be able to hear that many of his customers were funds backed by the U.S. government 's banking bailout, called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which authorized private money managers to use taxpayer funds to buy troubled securities. U.S. District Judge Janet Hall disagreed, ruling that prosecutors can say government money was used.

At the first trial, one prosecution witness was Michael Canter, a public-private investment fund manager who used Treasury money to buy bonds. According to court filings, Mr. Canter testified that, when he found out Mr. Litvak misled him, he called Mr. Litvak and said, "[A]re you freaking crazy doing this to the United States Treasury Department . Because of this, I'm going to have to report this."

While the jury will be able to hear some broader context on the bond market, the judge ruled that Mr. Litvak can't present testimony that broker-dealers at other firms similarly inflated bond prices, or show evidence of changes to compliance programs on Wall Street after his indictment. Mr. Litvak has argued that showing standards were tightened only after his indictment supports his point that the kinds of misrepresentations he made weren't previously viewed as a problem in the industry.

"At the end of the day, this case is about Jesse Litvak," Judge Hall wrote in a June pretrial ruling. "It is not a trial of the entire RMBS industry."

Analysis: Making Banks Safer Waits for Another Day

By Paul J. Davies

U.S. and European banks have long had their differences, nowhere more so than over how much capital they need to stay safe.

In American eyes, Europeans have long looked both undercapitalized and overly reliant on complex models that minimize requirements. The negotiations over changes to global rule changes meant to narrow those differences are proving harder than expected. The final agreement was due to be signed off by the Basel Committee this coming Sunday but has been postponed, perhaps until March.

This is a shame because the outline deal that emerged in December looked set to narrow the capital gap substantially while giving European banks plenty of time to adjust, which is the only practical way to ensure the availability of bank credit in Europe was preserved. A slow transition would also benefit European bank investors by protecting dividends and coupons on junior bonds.

The rule changes, known among bankers as "Basel IV," are meant to limit how much banks can minimize capital requirements by using sophisticated risk models.

The simple way to see the potential effects is to look at risk density, which shows how much banks rely on modeling. The measure is expressed by giving the proportion of assets that attract a capital charge.

The best measure of risk density uses the leverage exposure measure of balance sheet size, because that irons out most of the differences in U.S. and international accounting over how to measure derivatives exposure. Done this way, European banks' average density is 33%, compared with the U.S. average of 49%.

Now, look at the potential Basel IV impact. The changes outlined in December were expected to be less painful than was originally feared after noisy protests from Germany and other countries. However, they would still make a difference. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate average European risk-weighted assets will increase 21%, although the inflation will be much greater in some countries than others.

The average risk density for big European banks could rise to more than 40%, based on Morgan Stanley forecasts for individual countries. That is much closer to the U.S. average. Deutsche Bank 's density would be almost 35% compared with 48% for J.P. Morgan Chase .

The capital gap would still exist; it always will because European banks don't sell their prime mortgages. But those Basel IV changes would have made it much smaller and European banks better capitalized.

Analysis: How China's Insurance Crackdown Spawns More Risks

By Anjani Trivedi

It was only a matter of time before Beijing realized that giving its insurers a free rein was going to be a plan steeped in risk.

Following a year in which Chinese insurers aggressively built risky and illiquid portfolios, acquired real estate, companies and stakes in companies at home and across the world, under loose regulation, China's insurance regulator has taken to severe tightening measures in recent weeks. Regulators have effectively barred insurers from making risky investments and banned certain insurers and insurance products with high cash value and low protection.

The repercussions could cause trouble far and wide. Almost 60% of China's wealth-management products are invested in bond and money-market funds and a growing portion of these products are backed by bonds. And, they account for almost 20% of banking-system deposits. Chinese insurers' nonstandard investments a bundle of debt plans, wealth-management products and the like rose to more than a third of their assets toward the end of last year. Tightening too fast could turn some insurers into forced sellers and expose a larger-than-expected heap of credit risk on insurers' balance sheets. Shares of Chinese insurers are down 9% since December, after ending last year down 15%, on average.

China's unlisted insurers infamous among them, Anbang will now see their wealth-management, product-backed financing platforms squeezed under new rules that bar investing cash raised from investment products. With policyholder deposits accounting for more than 70% of written premiums, more asset-selling may be on the cards.

Taming its financial giants, Beijing will find, is bound to spawn more chaos in China's intertwined financial system.

Blackrock Executive Joins Trump's Treasury Department  Landing Team'

A Blackrock Inc . executive has joined President-elect Donald Trump 's"landing team" managing the handover of power at the U.S. Treasury Department . The presidential transition website says Craig Phillips, managing director and leader of Blackrock's financial markets advisory and client solutions teams, will work on the Treasury landing team as a volunteer. It is not clear how much influence, if any, Mr. Phillips would have over setting policy priorities for a Trump administration, but his appointment underscores Blackrock's reach in Washington.

China's insurance regulator moves to curb gimmicky property insurance products

China's insurance regulator warned against gimmicky property insurance products, in fresh guidelines for the sector late Tuesday. Insurers shouldn't be issuing products that protect against an event that will either happen or won't happen for certain; they also shouldn't be issuing products that don't offer any real protection for the policyholder. The guidelines appear to be part of broader moves to rein in risky practices in the domestic insurance sector. Last week, the regulator proposed to reduce the upper limit that one shareholder can own of an insurance company, in a move to curb the conduct of insurers. (chao.deng@wsj.com)

Senate Republicans Name Three Additional Lawmakers to Banking Panel; Sens. John Kennedy, David Perdue and Thom Tillis join Senate Banking Committee

WASHINGTON Republican leaders named three more lawmakers to the Senate Banking Committee as the new Congress convened on Tuesday.

Sens. John Kennedy (R., La.), David Perdue (R., Ga.) and Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) will join the panel, which will play a key role in deciding on potential changes to financial regulation considered in Congress this year.

Mr. Perdue, a former chief executive of Dollar General Corp. and Reebok International Ltd., has called for a repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, saying it is "one of the most onerous, overreaching pieces of legislation in my lifetime." He also has served on the board of Cardlytics Inc ., a banking data analytics company.

Mr. Tillis and Mr. Kennedy also have advocated for changing Dodd-Frank, according to past interviews.

The incoming Republicans on the committee join "http://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-add-fresh-faces-to-senate-banking-committee-1482441066": Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.

Republicans have a majority on the committee, one of the primary congressional committees with oversight of the financial industry. They are likely to face aggressive opposition from Ranking Member Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are staunchly opposed to Republican attempts to change the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.

Incoming Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) replaces Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), who will remain on the committee in a senior role. Mr. Shelby has advocated for changes to Dodd-Frank, including making the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's budget subject to congressional approval.

Mr. Brown has said he expects to have a better working relationship with Mr. Crapo than he did with Mr. Shelby.

"It will be a better day with Sen. Crapo," Mr. Brown "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sen-brown-hopes-sen-crapo-helps-to-set-fannie-and-freddie-free-1480620048" in Washington. "Sen. Crapo is an honorable guy, way more conservative than I am. That's fine. The point is that he will work with us. I am optimistic that we can do things together."

Business News: SoftBanks Fund Hits Its $100 Billion Goal

SoftBank Group Corp. has lined up chip maker Qualcomm Inc. as an investor in the Japanese firm's new technology fund, helping the vast portfolio reach its $100 billion goal, according to people familiar with the matter.

San Diego-based Qualcomm has moved toward completing its commitment in recent days, the people said. It joins Apple Inc., which previously agreed to invest in the fund, the people said. The amounts to be invested couldn't be determined.

Together, the pair brings a Silicon Valley imprimatur to what would be one of the world's largest pools of private capital.

SoftBank -- the conglomerate whose chief executive, Masayoshi Son, has spoken of a coming technology revolution -- plans to invest in next-generation technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The SoftBank Vision Fund was announced in October and thrust back in the public eye last month, when Mr. Son met with President-elect Donald Trump in New York and pledged to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create thousands of jobs. That money is expected to come from the new fund.

The telecom company's fund has gathered the $100 billion in commitments it was seeking and is set to formally launch in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.

SoftBank said when it announced the fund that it will contribute $25 billion of its own cash over the next five years. Saudi Arabia's government fund has agreed to invest up to $45 billion over the period.

The Wall Street Journal reported Dec. 12 that Apple and the sovereign-wealth fund of Abu Dhabi have also discussed investing. Those negotiations have since advanced and are near being completed, people familiar with the matter said.

The Qatar Investment Authority, the wealth fund of another oil-rich nation, is also in discussions to invest, the people said.

Apple and the Qatar Investment Authority declined to comment. A representative of the Abu Dhabi wealth fund couldn't be reached.

SoftBank is the third-largest mobile carrier in Japan, but Mr. Son has been expanding its reach through deal making. SoftBank in 2013 bought majority control of U.S.-based Sprint Corp. and in 2016 spent $32 billion to acquire ARM Holding PLC, which designs microchips.

That takeover, SoftBank's largest ever, is a bet on the so-called Internet of Things, in which millions of everyday devices are connected online. Mr. Son has predicted that in the next 20 years, one trillion chips will go into gadgets from thermostats to watches.

Buyouts

CenterGate Capital, Austin, Texas

CenterGate Capital wrapped up its first fund at its hard cap with $350 million in investor commitments. Founded in 2014, the firm completed fundraising for CenterGate Capital Partners I LP, which had a $300 million target, after about a year of fundraising, said a person familiar with the matter. Combined with general-partner commitments, the fund will have $365 million to invest, people familiar with the fund said. CenterGate targets businesses with $8 million to $15 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, one of the people said.

Deerfield Management Co., New York

Deerfield Management Co. collected at least $2.39 billion toward a $2.5 billion goal for Deerfield Private Design Fund IV LP, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The fund's predecessor raised about $1.6 billion in 2014. Fund III invests in health-care sectors including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, health-care services and animal health. Among the investments from Deerfield's third Private Design fund is Recovery Centers of America, a behavioral health operator in which the firm initially injected $231.5 million in late 2015 and invested an additional $100 million in 2016.

KarpReilly, Greenwich, Conn.

KarpReilly collected at least $200 million for KarpReilly Capital Partners III LP, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It isn't clear whether the fund has officially closed. KarpReilly, named after co-founders Allan Karp and Chris Reilly, makes equity investments of $3 million to $75 million in sectors including the retail, e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, restaurant, branded consumer product, apparel, natural product and food and beverage markets. The firm in 2013 said it held a final closing of its second fund at $210 million and of a co-investment vehicle at $150 million. KarpReilly in 2016 invested in Lifeaid Beverage Co., a Santa Cruz, Calif., maker of nutritional beverages; San Francisco juice producer Zola; and BoxyCharm Inc., a Miami Gardens, Fla., business that sends subscribers boxes containing beauty products each month.

KKR & Co., New York

KKR & Co. closed its first dedicated fund for taking stakes in technology, media and telecommunications companies. The firm said KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund LP collected $711 million and exceeded its original target, which KKR declined to disclose. The vehicle is expected to make equity investments of less than $100 million in sectors including software, information technology, security, digital media and the Internet of Things. The firm will make investments from the fund averaging $40 million to $50 million, said David Welsh, a KKR managing director who heads the firm's growth-equity program for TMT. Its growth-capital deals will be done within a group led by Herald Chen, Richard Sarnoff and Philipp Freise.

L Catterton, Greenwich, Conn.

L Catterton closed its latest flagship fund at $2.75 billion. The amount raised for L Catterton VIII LP surpassed the $1.68 billion the firm gathered for its previous fund, Catterton Partners VII LP, which held a final closing in 2013. Through the latest pool, L Catterton will invest $60 million to $500 million at a time in midmarket consumer companies throughout North America and Europe. The initial hard cap for the newest fund was $2.5 billion, said a person familiar with the fund, adding that the vehicle has a broad group of investors ranging from sovereign-wealth funds to strategic investors. No single investor accounts for more than 10% of the fund's total commitments, the person said. L Catterton was formed through the merger of consumer-focused Catterton with the private-equity arm of LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Groupe Arnault in 2016. The firm last year closed L Catterton Growth Partners III LP at $615 million to invest in consumer-facing companies.

Pamlico Capital, Charlotte, N.C.

Pamlico Capital closed Pamlico Capital IV LP with $910 million to invest in lower midmarket companies within the business and technology services, communications and health-care sectors. The capital raised exceeded an original $750 million target as well as the $650 million Pamlico raised for the fund's predecessor in 2013. Pamlico expects to begin investing the new fund in the second or third quarter of 2017 after it finishes deploying Fund III, which is about 80% invested, said Partner Eric Eubank. Although the new fund is larger than the firm's previous pool of capital, Pamlico expects to keep its investments in the same range, about $20 million to $100 million, and make about 15 or 16 investments, a few more than the previous fund, Mr. Eubank said. The vehicle will target companies with enterprise values of $50 million to $250 million.

Providence Equity Partners, Providence, R.I.

Providence Equity Partners, through growth-focused affiliate Providence Strategic Growth Capital Partners, closed Providence Strategic Growth II LP at the fund's $640 million hard cap. An April filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated the vehicle had an offering amount of $600 million. Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System committed up to $75 million to the fund, according to an October news release from the pension. Fund II so far has invested in six companies, including payment and business services software company PaySimple Inc.; LogicMonitor Inc., which manages and automates information-technology infrastructure for businesses; and life-sciences software platform Anju Software Inc. The fund's predecessor closed at $315 million in 2015, surpassing its $250 million target. Providence's growth-equity arm invests in lower midmarket software and technology-enabled services companies, primarily in North America.

Rock Hill Capital, Houston

Rock Hill Capital raised at least $128.5 million so far for Rock Hill Capital III LP, which is aiming to collect $175 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm, which closed its previous vehicle in 2013 with $87.7 million, invests in industrial companies in the south and southeast U.S. with enterprise values of up to $60 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of less than $10 million. Rock Hill in 2016 sold liquid waste management company SouthWaste Services Holdings LLC and Tideland Signal Corp., a maker of marine-navigation products. In December 2015, it acquired Big City Access Inc., which makes scaffolding equipment.

Wind Point Partners, Chicago

Wind Point Partners is more than halfway to the amount it is seeking for its eighth fund, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. A pair of related Wind Point Partners VIII vehicles have gathered a total of at least $434.7 million and have a $750 million offering amount, according to the filings. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board committed $50 million to Fund VIII, pension documents show. Wind Point wrapped up the fund's predecessor at $915 million in 2009. The firm invests $30 million to $150 million in companies that have at least $10 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The firm in 2016 acquired companies including plastics manufacturer Aurora Plastics Inc., warehouse-logistics services provider St. George Logistics and pork-rind maker Evans Food Group Ltd. The firm also in November announced plans to sell packaging company Novolex to Carlyle Group LP.

Distressed/Turnaround

Solace Capital Partners, Los Angeles

Solace Capital Partners wrapped up fundraising for its first vehicle, Solace Capital Special Situations Fund LP, at $576 million, above a $500 million target. The firm, which typically invests $10 million to $75 million per deal, has invested or committed more than $120 million from the fund across five portfolio companies. Solace targets distressed debt and special situations private-equity deals, seeking U.S. and Canadian companies that generate annual revenue of $50 million to $1 billion. Solace, whose formation Private Equity Analyst initially reported in 2013, formally launched in 2014, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm began raising its inaugural vehicle in late 2014, Private Equity Analyst previously reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The vehicle had collected at least $388.9 million as of late April, according to a separate SEC filing.

Z Capital Group, New York

Z Capital Group plans to raise at least $1 billion for a fund to prop up smaller companies and businesses in need of cash. The firm could round up as much as $1.25 billion for Z Capital Partners III LP, according to a November letter to investors viewed by Private Equity Analyst. Z Capital expects the pool to surpass the $750 million collected for its last private-equity fund in 2014. The firm has drawn demand of close to $1 billion so far, said a person familiar with the matter. Z Capital officially will launch marketing efforts in 2017 and plans to wrap up fundraising by the second quarter. As with its previous pool, Z Capital expects to continue targeting equity investments of roughly $100 million in total size and focusing on companies with enterprise values of less than $1 billion. The firm's private-equity team takes control stakes in companies in a variety of ways, from snapping up assets in bankruptcy auctions to spinning them off from corporations, participating in balance-sheet restructurings and taking them private. The firm in 2016 launched fundraising for Z Capital Credit Tactical Fund LP, a new offering to pursue noncontrol investments and provide senior secured debt. Z Capital is seeking up to $500 million for the vehicle and closed on roughly $100 million as of the beginning of December, said a person familiar with the matter.

Funds of Funds

HarbourVest Partners, Boston

HarbourVest Partners collected at least $245.1 million for its latest real-assets vehicle, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund-of-funds manager didn't indicate a total offering amount for HarbourVest Real Assets Fund III LP and a related pool, HarbourVest Real Assets III Feeder Fund LP, in the filings. HarbourVest, through its real-assets program, focuses on investments in sectors such as energy, power, infrastructure and natural resources. The firm in 2015 hired Kevin Warn-Schindel as a managing director on its secondary investment team to lead the program. In addition to its real-assets fundraising efforts, HarbourVest in November said it held a final close for its latest secondary fund, Dover Street IX LP, at $4.77 billion. The vehicle exceeded a $3.6 billion target. In April, the firm said it collected 375 million Canadian dollars for HarbourVest Canada Growth Fund, a venture-capital fund of funds that invests in vehicles from Canadian managers as well as U.S. managers that invest in Canadian businesses.

Mezzanine & Other Debt

Angelo Gordon & Co., New York

Angelo Gordon & Co. gathered at least $1.08 billion for its latest direct-lending vehicle, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It isn't clear from the filings whether the firm has held a final closing for AG Direct Lending Fund II LP and four affiliated vehicles. The firm's direct-lending group finances leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, add-on acquisitions and other private-equity transactions, generally lending to companies with $3 million to $50 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Angelo Gordon in 2014 hired a pair of senior executives from Madison Capital Funding, a subsidiary of New York Life Investment Management LLC, to establish its direct-lending business. The group began raising its first direct-lending fund in 2015, though it is unclear from regulatory filings how much the vehicle ultimately gathered.

CRG, Houston

CRG is approaching a final close on its third credit fund, said two people familiar with the matter. The health care-focused firm collected $1.1 billion of commitments for the fund, above its target of $1 billion, one of the people said. The vehicle has a $1.25 billion hard cap, the person added. One of the people said the firm's third fund will invest globally as it continues to identify opportunities throughout North America, Asia and Europe. CRG raised $805 million of equity for Capital Royalty Partners II LP in 2013 and said it expected total investible capital for the vehicle to exceed $1 billion with debt. The firm primarily provides structured debt investments, underwrites senior-secured loans and invests in companies that reduce health-care costs or provide health-care services that cater to personalized medicine and shifting demographics. It targets investments of $20 million to $300 million.

Lone Star Funds, Dallas

Lone Star Funds completed the final closing for debt funds Lone Star Fund X (U.S.) LP and Lone Star Fund X (Bermuda) LP with a total of about $5.6 billion. Commitments to the pool exceeded the Dallas firm's original target of $5 billion.

The group pledged  90.3 million to Clessidra's third fund, Mr. Pesenti said, adding the fund size would enable the team to focus on companies with enterprise values of  150 million to  1 billion.

IK VIII will seek majority stakes in companies worth up to  500 million across IK's core markets: Scandinavia, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Benelux region. The vehicle, which held a first close on  1.3 billion in August, has made three investments to date.

VC Profile: Space Could Be the Next Frontier for Venture Investors

Starburst Venture, a new firm focused on aerospace and aviation startups, has raised $200 million for its first fund, joining an increasing number of investors launching into the sector.

The fund, which will be based in San Francisco, is affiliated with Starburst Accelerator, the aerospace and aviation accelerator with locations in Los Angeles, Paris, Munich and Singapore. The accelerator doesn't take equity stakes in its startups.

Francois Chopard, the founder of Starburst, will be one of the general partners, along with another GP yet to be named and an expected staff of 15 people, Mr. Chopard said. The fund expects to start investing in the first quarter of 2017.

"We're just at the beginning of a new trend," Mr. Chopard said. "Aerospace is in a phase of maturity like biotech was 15 years ago."

Space investing has drawn increased interest recently from investors, from existing technology investors to others focusing more specifically on space tech or frontier tech more generally. Seraphim Capital is one firm focusing on space, while other established firms such as Founders Fund and Draper Fisher Jurvetson have invested in Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. also known as SpaceX. Lux Capital has made investments in startups Planet Labs Inc., Kymeta Corp. and Orbital Insight Inc. Y Combinator has also backed space startups.

Starburst Venture

The Firm

San Francisco-based Starburst Venture is affiliated with Starburst Accelerator, a space-focused accelerator active in Los Angeles, Paris, Munich and Singapore.

The Strategy

The firm seeks to invest in a range of aerospace- and aviation-related startups, which could range from components or software related to flight or actual space companies.

The Fund

The firm raised $200 million for its debut fund.

More generally, tech executives have shown massive interest in space. Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has Blue Origin, a rocket startup that in October had a successful rocket launch test. Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic aims to offer space tourism.

In the past, investors have been wary of the high capital costs and risks of space startups. But costs are dropping and an ecosystem of commercial space technology is forming to help startups develop, said Jude Gomila, an angel investor who has invested in four space startups. Google's acquisition of Skybox Imaging for $500 million in 2014 also showed that large exits are possible in the sector. "Now it's more on the mind of someone who comes to Silicon Valley," Mr. Gomila said. "There is a changing mindset with entrepreneurs. Also the web is hitting maturity in some capacities. People are looking for new frontiers to do companies."

Leonie Hill Capital, a Singapore-based private-equity firm, is the anchor investor in Starburst Venture, said Mr. Chopard, who declined to disclose the amount invested. Leonie Hill has invested as a fund of funds in other firms such as 500 Startups, Mr. Chopard said.

Starburst Venture, which will have its fund registered in Singapore, will invest in Series A and B deals in anything space- or aviation-related as well as supporting technologies such as artificial intelligence or big data. Starburst will invest in companies beyond those in its accelerator.

Starburst is seeking additional limited partners, mainly in high-net-worth family funds and sovereign-wealth funds, as well as potentially some of its existing corporate partners.

At an accelerator demo day this past June at the NASA Ames Conference Center in Moffett Field, Calif., startups pitched companies in areas such as deep space mining, supersonic aircraft, vertical landing hybrid helicopter-jets, rocket-launching technology, new satellite communications systems, drone anticollision technology and even a new type of airline seat to give travelers more "elbow room."

Originally from Paris, Starburst Accelerator, which launched in October 2015, holds events for its companies to pitch in Munich, Paris, Los Angeles and Singapore. When startups pitch at these events, the experts in attendance score the companies, and Starburst uses this data to determine which companies it accepts into its program. Attendees included executives from corporations such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Co., venture-capital firms and public research agencies.

VC Outlook: IPO Outlook Might Not Be All Rainbows and Unicorns; Will Wall Street ride Sand Hill's unicorns to the end of the rainbow? Venture-capital investors will certainly be watching how bankers price the likes of Spotify and Dropbox for IPOs.

Here's the billion-dollar question: Will Wall Street discount Sand Hill's once-hot startups in initial public offerings?

For investors in billion-dollar "unicorn" startups companies facing cash burns and liquidity demands from all directions the question looms as pressure for some to go public runs high.

Spotify AB raised convertible debt in March, agreeing to terms that set the clock ticking on an IPO in return for the $1 billion in financing that enabled the $8.5 billion-valued company to take money without a valuation reset.

"It's not only huge, but it had some terms that they had to go public," said Matt Murphy, a managing director at Menlo Ventures.

About 151 companies are valued at a billion dollars or more, according to The Wall Street Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club, and many that raised late-stage funding in a frothy investing environment over the past several years now face cash concerns and potential lowered valuations.

Investors will be closely watching Spotify and other highly valued startups to move forward with IPOs for whether their share pricings come in below their last private financing prices. Many face this splash of cold water as a hangover sets in following recent venture investor euphoria.

"There's a disconnect between the private venture capital-type markets and the public markets," said Martin Wellington, a managing partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP in Palo Alto, Calif.

Dropbox Inc., the 10-year old cloud storage startup, is another company with a heady valuation, raising $500 million in debt financing in 2014. Dropbox was valued at $10 billion in its last funding round, but publicly traded private-equity investor BlackRock Inc. has since written it down 45%.

Amid renewed market skepticism, flat and down private financing rounds are more in vogue these days, reflecting the desire by venture investors to come to grips with valuation compression.

Still, the 2017 IPO market is expected to see offerings from highly valued startups including Snap Inc., Blue Apron Inc. and Bloom Energy Corp. Many more likely have filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission under a provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and remain under the radar.

But the IPO market remains a concern. The 37 U.S. venture-backed IPOs through Dec. 14 put 2016 on pace for the lowest level of public offerings since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, according to data from VentureSource, a unit of Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co.

Many investors remain unworried about how heated valuations play out in public markets, saying that those who invested earlier made money. But the late-stage investors who helped fuel the valuations frenzy for startups in 2014 and 2015 are the ones positioned for less stellar gains.

"If the unicorn valuation is disconnected from what the market valuation will be and it's too high, then somebody is gonna get hurt," said Mr. Wellington.

Mutual funds and other institutions who bought in at rich valuations might see their shares underwater on the public markets, triggering ratchet protections to be made whole if written into the investing terms. Venture investors say the institutional set of investors has become more selective on backing companies recently in the wake of valuation concerns.

That factor already has been borne out on investments in startups. The median premoney valuation for late-stage rounds fell to $148.6 million in the first half of 2016 from $269.3 million in 2015, according to VentureSource. The median premoney valuation for Series D or higher rounds dropped to less than $200 million in the second quarter of 2016 from a peak of about $400 million in the third quarter of 2015, according to law firm Cooley LLP.

Megavaluation startups have fallen out of favor in IPO markets. The U.S. median postmoney valuation of startups at IPO plummeted to $139.6 million in 2016 as of Dec. 14, 69.3% lower than the 10-year high of $455.2 million in 2011, according to VentureSource.

Indeed, venture-capital investors have throttled back on late-stage funding. In the third quarter of last year, the median size of later-stage rounds declined to $8.45 million, the lowest since the third quarter of 2010, according to VentureSource. In the same period in 2015, the median amount invested was pushed up to $18 million in the clamor to give cash to companies with valuations of $1 billion or more.

Crossover investors aren't the only ones chasing unicorns. Venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, whose megahits include the likes of Airbnb Inc. and Dropbox, holds the title for the largest stable of unicorns, according to data from the Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club. Sequoia is trailed by the likes of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Accel Partners and Andreessen Horowitz in billion-dollar startup stakes.

To be sure, many investors see the megavaluations of startups such as Uber Technologies Inc., Snap and Airbnb and plenty of others as the next big ticket. Some of the late-stage investors who picked up golden lottery tickets in these companies could expect to see rewards at the end of the rainbow.

The question is whether 2017 will be more receptive for tech IPOs. A handful of IPOs went out in recent months that have done well, offering hopes for the return of the public markets. Shares of Crispr Therapeutics AG, Coupa Software Inc. and Nutanix Inc. have stayed aloft in post-IPO trading, up 39.4%, 46.6% and 79.6%, respectively, as of Dec. 16, according to data from the WSJ Pro Venture-Backed Post-IPO Index.

"Hopefully, your private valuation is not completely out of line with how the public markets might view your company," said Eric Paley, a managing partner at Founder Collective.

Private markets are showing some signs of IPO-related interest in shares, too. On the secondary market for private shares, demand has soared for companies thought to be planning an IPO. "The companies that are being discussed as potential near-term IPO companies are seeing increased interest on our platform," said Greg Brogger, chief executive of private securities broker SharesPost Inc.

But even when unicorns see a strong public pop, gains don't always hold. The 21 U.S. unicorns that went public between 2011 and 2015 saw their shares close an average of 45% above the offer price on the first day of trading. Six months after the IPO, their shares traded only 33% above the offer price on average, according to data provider Dealogic Ltd.

"The question is what happens when a private investor wants to get out," said Kathleen Smith, co-founder of IPO researcher Renaissance Capital.

Venture firms, often mandated to get liquidity soon after a company goes public, hope those gains will hold through the six-month lock-up period after an IPO or at least long enough for them to cash out in an authorized secondary public offering before the lock-up ends. Some recent highly valued companies have seen a big drop when they announce that venture-capital firms plan to sell.

When Twilio Inc. hit the market in May as the first large tech IPO in months, its stock surged in part because it attracted interest from retail investors. In October, the company announced plans to let private investors sell shares in a secondary offering, and its share price fell 12% in one day, then continued to slide. Four weeks later, the stock traded 45% below its price before it announced the secondary offering.

Who can make it to an IPO is the question. IPO veterans expect only those unicorns with the strongest business fundamentals will take chances in the first few months of 2017.

"It's much harder to market a growth-at-any-cost kind of deal [since 2016] than it would have been in 2015 or 2014," said Mike Tuchen, chief executive of Talend Inc., a big-data integration company that went public in July with positive cash flow.

Two unicorns known to be waiting in the wings Snap and Blue Apron are expected to have numbers in line for Wall Street. Snap told investors last year it expected revenue between $250 million and $350 million in 2016. Blue Apron says it ships 8 million meal kits per month. At $10 each, that's nearly $1 billion in annual revenue.

Some unicorns are dropping IPO hints, saying their business is sound. In June, Dropbox Chief Executive Drew Houston announced the company was cash-flow positive. With that news, Dropbox signaled to the markets that its business was working, said Menlo Ventures' Mr. Murphy, who is not an investor in the company.

"There's going to be more pressure for them to go public. The question is can they get comfortable with going out with a down value?" he said.

LEE GARDELLA, managing director and head of risk management, Adveq

What surprised you the most in 2016?

How conventional wisdom lacks wisdom.

What do you think will be the biggest challenge your corner of the industry will face in 2017?

GPs staying disciplined on valuations in this market, given the need to deploy capital.

How do you see the abundance of dry powder affecting LP commitments to the asset class?

Will have no effect on LP commitments. Allocations to private equity are increasing and more capital will be coming into the market. Dry powder levels will continue to increase in 2017.

JENNIFER RINEHART, partner and chief executive, Acalyx Advisors Inc.

What surprised you the most in 2016?

More institutional investors have become strikingly quick to decide which GPs they will seriously pursue. In a congested market where everyone has a sense of urgency, investors have been compelled to take a more binary early view, which they subsequently confirm or refute by dedicating resources to an extensive diligence process. Triage often weighs portfolio fit, runway for diligence and potential allocation as key factors in an initial decision. This diverges from the traditional approach wherein limited partners reviewed a broad set of facts and required longer lead time with a GP before committing to intensive diligence.

What do you think will be the biggest challenge your corner of the industry will face in 2017?

The general commoditization of PE ownership today is concerning a GP can outsource everything from the IT in your office, the data analytics to India, the search firms that find executives and the consultants who draft 100-day plans. Finding GPs who have their own point of view, approach and execution but who can also demonstrate potential to repeat, evolve and institutionalize is the challenge for 2017 and beyond.

How will the fundraising environment look different in 2017?

While I believe [2017] is likely to be similar [to 2016], the fundraising environment will change for the worse at some point in the future. I believe GPs who are actively building a better practice, being good partners to their constituents in all parts of the cycle and thinking about how to continually improve their platform will prevail.

GREGORY STENTO, managing director, HarbourVest Partners

What surprised you the most in 2016?

The resilience in private-equity fundraising. Despite market events and volatility, we're headed for a third straight year of more than $200 billion raised globally, levels we haven't seen consistently since 2008. The low-return environment is attracting more institutional and individual investors to the asset class.

What do you think will be the biggest challenge your corner of the industry will face in 2017?

Capital flowing into the industry could put pressure on returns and lead eager or inexperienced investors to overpay for deals. The best response is to focus on strong secular trends, build diverse portfolios and select high-quality managers who are price-disciplined.

What will be the biggest point of contention between limited partners and general partners going forward?

As both a GP and an LP, we have a unique view into this relationship. The real point of contention may actually be among LPs and the growing number of new investors trying to gain access to the best-performing GPs. This two-tiered market where some gain access and some don't is reflected in the rapid fundraising by certain managers who are able to raise larger funds and can find additional capital in the form of co-investment.

ASHBEL WILLIAMS, executive director and chief investment officer, State Board of Administration of Florida

What surprised you the most in 2016?

General partner discipline! The last few years have been characterized by record amounts of capital distributed back to limited partners and very successful fundraisings by GPs. Yet, in general, GPs have shown discipline when making new investments, evidenced by lower than expected deal volume and increasing amounts of dry powder in the industry.

What do you think will be the biggest challenge private-equity limited partners will face in 2017?

Can private equity maintain its discipline? Do GPs eventually succumb to the "lower for longer" (low growth, low interest rates) train of thinking and begin to rationalize paying record purchase price multiples for new investments? Does this come at the exact wrong time?

What will be the biggest point of contention between limited partners and general partners going forward?

Probably not anything new, but the alignment of interests will always be an area of concern and focus for LPs. Improved transparency will go a long way toward alleviating this concern.

ZAVAIN DAR, principal, Lux Capital

What surprised you the most in 2016?

We started making artificial intelligence-related investments in 2014. 2016 surprised even the most bullish AI evangelists with exponential growth in [the] pace of commercial adoption, Fortune 500 recognition, entrepreneurial activity and venture investment in the emerging technology. If software is eating the world, artificial intelligence is serving it up on a silver platter indeed!

What do you think will be the biggest challenge your corner of the industry will face in 2017?

Mobile, social, on-demand, cloud and big data have proven to be the winning investment theses of the last 10 years. We're hitting diminishing returns in these saturated investment trends, and 2016 proved to be the inflection point as investor appetite and interest turned increasingly so to hardware, artificial intelligence and deep tech more broadly. With record levels of investment capital raised this last year, there's an increasing urgency and challenge on managers and the community at large to find this economic cycle's emerging opportunities to deploy capital with an eye for outsized potential.

A couple of science-focused startups were knocked off their pedestals in the past few months, including Theranos Inc. How did that influence your investing or the market for science-based tech overall?

Science-based investing lies in the DNA of our firm, arguably more so than any other existing active generalist venture firm. We didn't go chasing social when Instagram sold or Snapchat emerged, and we won't shy from true technology and science breakthrough when our peers and entrepreneurs misstep or falter. Regardless of where Theranos and others go and independent of where their historical legacies fall, the current situation is proving to be a healthy reminder for entrepreneurs and investors alike that true technology and science breakthrough is hard and requires thoughtful, diligent and oft difficult work.

MANSION --- Disaster Recovery Plan --- Catastrophic events can wreak havoc on a home, but owners with the resources and the fortitude to rebuild can end up with an even better house than before

When a 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck Napa, Calif., on Aug. 24, 2014, it pushed Jill and Steve Matthiasson's 110-year-old farmhouse off its foundation. The couple was unhurt, but their home -- set on 5 acres of vineyards for their winery -- suffered significant damage.

"We thought it was the end of our house and the end of our business," says Ms. Matthiasson, who is 54 years old.

Instead, friends, neighbors and a cousin who is a contractor all stepped up to help them rebuild their home even better than before. This one is bolted to its foundation with steel structural beams that can withstand seismic shaking and has an electrical system upgraded to meet code and new plumbing with flexible pipes instead of rigid pipes that could snap off in an earthquake.

The home also got a nicer kitchen, designed for Mr. Matthiasson as the "ultimate kitchen for cooking." In all, the project took about six months and cost $350,000.

"We are ready for the next earthquake," she says.

Hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, floods. An average of 120 major disasters have struck somewhere in the U.S. every year since 1996, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Catastrophic events can wipe out entire neighborhoods and cost millions of dollars in property damage. But those with the resources and the fortitude to rebuild can end up with an even better house, one that has stronger defenses against acts of nature and is more suited to families' changed needs.

The Memorial Day Flood of 2015 dumped more than a foot of water into Jennifer and Ben Deneen's one-story home in the Meyerland neighborhood of Houston. The couple and their two young children spent eight hours atop the kitchen counters until floodwaters receded. They used their swimming-pool raft to float their kids to a friend's house around the corner. Meanwhile, their furniture, carpets and anything else on the floor were ruined.

The Deneens considered repairs to the damaged floors and cabinets, but quickly realized they wanted a house that could withstand future floods. They also felt it was the right time to tear down the house and build a new one with the extra space they'd long wanted. The next week, work started on a house with two stories, five bedrooms and a price tag of around $1 million. After a week in a hotel and a year and a half in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom rental apartment, the family is back home.

"We decided if we were going to do it, we were going to do it right," says Ms. Deneen, 39, a hospital administrator.

The flood inundated 800 of the 2,400 homes in Meyerland and led to the construction of 150 new homes, according to Ed Wolff, president of Beth Wolff Realtors who lives around the corner from Ms. Deneen. A study his firm did of the effects of the 2001 tropical storm Allison in Southeast Texas found that the values of homes in the affected neighborhoods dipped sharply initially, but after two years were substantially higher than before the flooding, with the square footage of the homes up significantly.

Based on that, Mr. Wolff decided to renovate his damaged house, a three-bedroom, 3,600-square-foot, ranch he and his wife bought for $389,000 in 2005. Removal of the damaged sheetrock and cabinets allowed them access to update electrical and plumbing systems. The newly configured kitchen got new cabinetry and flooring, as well as a pantry. They added drainage around the exterior of the home (about $10,000) to help guard against future water penetration in the home.

Initial improvements cost about $30,000. Then, with the $175,000 they got from insurance, plus another $70,000 of their own money, they undertook larger projects. Today, Mr. Wolff estimates his home is worth $700,000.

"We took advantage of the opportunity," he says.

Emergency assistance and insurance payouts typically require extensive paperwork that can delay reconstruction. And new building codes implemented after a natural disaster can further complicate rebuilding efforts. FEMA assistance is generally no more than a few thousand dollars and is just for initial help, not to "make people whole again," says Rafael Lemaitre, the agency's head of public affairs. "We're not going to redo a rec room," he adds. As a result, homeowners planning sweeping renovations know they'll need to personally finance many of the upgrades.

FEMA's goal is to transfer the risk of natural disasters away from taxpayers and toward the private sector, so it urges everyone to get insurance. That's not always so easy, says Tom Larsen, chief product architect for CoreLogic, a data-analytics company. While fires and tornadoes are usually covered under standard homeowner's policies, earthquakes, mudslides and flooding from extreme weather are generally not. These separate policies are often exorbitant and provide minimal payouts, Mr. Larsen says.

Stephanie Lofgren, 53, a retired college professor, and her husband, Craig, a management consultant, had to wait 18 months before they could start construction on their new vacation home on New Jersey's Long Beach Island after superstorm Sandy struck in 2012. At the time of the storm, they had just razed the $1.1 million home there they purchased in 2010, and construction was about to begin on their new home. The storm left them with what Ms. Lofgren calls "an expensive sandbox."

New structural and flood-level requirements enacted after the storm meant starting from scratch with the design. Instead of what architect Scott Specht calls a "pristine white modern" home, the second design of the house, though still decidedly modern, has more beach-durable cedar cladding and incorporates boat-building materials like a fiberglass roof. Exterior materials include stainless steel, stucco and concrete. What were three levels of living space became two, the media room shrunk and the swimming pool got scratched. "It forces you to reflect and prioritize," says Ms. Lofgren. The final square footage was 2,400 square feet instead of 2,900, and the cost went down about two-thirds, despite having to pay about $40,000 for redesigning and re-permitting.

Superstorm Sandy also drastically changed Bill Meyer's 2,000-square-foot ranch home in Monmouth Beach, N.J., when it split the foundation in two. It was declared beyond rehabilitation by FEMA. So Mr. Meyer, a 73-year-old marketing entrepreneur, hired architect Michael Graves to design something completely different: a 6,000-square-foot contemporary home with two master bedrooms and several decks. The design made it handicapped accessible in case the need arose in the future, Mr. Meyer says.

Architect Bernice Chen of Michael Graves Architecture, who took over the project after Mr. Graves died in 2015, says the need to protect against future storms, which required researching new materials, and the different zoning and environmental clearances made the house a challenge. Mr. Meyer collected various forms of assistance, including federal and local grants that totaled more than $150,000. The new house cost about $1 million to build.

Lynn and John Stasz had only minutes to evacuate the home they'd lived in for almost 30 years in the foothills of Boulder, Colo., during the Fourmile Canyon Fire of September 2010. The fire destroyed 70 homes, including their 1970s-era, 3,000-square-foot traditional home. The new house they built two years later, which cost about $1 million, is completely different. Architect Mark Alan Gerwing created a single-level, modern home with lots of floor-to-ceiling glass and patios to take advantage of the expansive mountain and city views that resulted after the fire wiped out the trees on their 35-acre lot. There is no wood on the exterior (it's all stone, stucco and metal) and no fireplaces; instead there's a courtyard with a water feature at the center.

The fire changed more than just the architecture of their house: It transformed the dynamic of the neighborhood, says Ms. Stasz, a 70 year-old business consultant. Before, the couple barely knew the names of their neighbors because the trees kept them isolated. After the fire, nearby families bonded over recovery efforts, going to community meetings about filing insurance claims and building codes.

Now they have lifelong friends. "We lost our home but we discovered community," says Ms. Stasz.
