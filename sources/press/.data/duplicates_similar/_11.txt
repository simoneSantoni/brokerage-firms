Salesforce Posts Rising Revenue, Lifts Outlook; Business software provider says it will reach $10 billion in annual revenue by January 2018

Salesforce.com Inc. continued to post strong revenue growth and offered an optimistic forecast, even as it posted a loss in the most recent quarter.

The business software provider said it would reach $10 billion in annual revenue by January 2018, setting a time frame for reaching one of the company's longstanding goals.

The company, reporting third-quarter results on Thursday, also said it would generate record operating margin and operating cash flow in the current fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2017.

The quarter's performance, which included a 25% rise in revenue over the year-earlier period, put Salesforce on track to meet its long-term goal, the company said.

"This was a third quarter that was one of the best quarters we've had in the history of the company," said Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Keith Block in an interview. "We closed a record number of these seven-figure-plus transactions and in a third quarter, we typically don't see that as a big deal quarter."

During the quarter, Salesforce.com signed seven financial customers including Citigroup Inc. and PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Mr. Block said.

However, those sales aren't bringing consistent profit. The company reported a net loss of $37.3 million compared with a net loss of $25.2 million during the year-earlier period.

The company's share price rose more than 5% to $79.01 in after-hours trading.

The quarter was a sign of strength after a disappointing performance in the prior quarter. "They had some weakness in the U.S., and they cleaned up that weakness," said UBS Group analyst Brent Thill.

Most of the company's revenue growth has been organic, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Hawkins, even though Salesforce has been on an acquisition spree lately, acquiring at least 11 companies since December 2015. The company expects 26% revenue growth in the current fiscal year, from a year earlier, in constant U.S. dollars. Only 1% to 2% will be attributable to mergers and acquisitions, he said.

For the 12 months ending Jan. 31, 2018, Salesforce forecast revenue of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion, an increase of 21% over the year-earlier period.

Salesforce for the quarter reported revenue of $2.14 billion, compared with $1.71 billion in the same period a year earlier.

The company posted a net loss 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of 4 cents a share a year earlier. Excluding certain expenses, Salesforce said it would have earned 24 cents a share.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected revenue of $2.12 billion, and earnings per share excluding certain items of 21 cents a share.

NThrive Health Inc., a patient-to-payment services company backed by Pamplona Capital Management, said it agreed to acquire Adreima, a health-care software provider backed by Waud Capital Partners.

Based in Downers Grove, Ill., Adreima offers services to health-care providers to help improve their cash flow and reimbursement, keep payers accountable and identify reimbursement trends, and resolve complex health-care reimbursement matters.

Chicago firm Waud acquired Adreima, formerly known as Advanced Reimbursement Management LLC, in 2008 and subsequently completed add-on deals, including the acquisitions of Hospital Inpatient Services in 2010, Optimum Outcomes LLC in 2013; Accounts Receivable Management and Data Services Inc. in 2012; and HealthCPA in 2015.

Barclays Bank PLC arranged financing for the deal. Additional terms of the transaction, expected to close before the end of the year, weren't disclosed in a news release. NThrive was advised on the transaction by William Blair and received legal advice from Kirkland & Ellis LLP.

London firm Pamplona Capital formed nThrive this year with the merger of three portfolio companies MedAssets Inc., Precyse Solutions LLC and Equation. Based in Alpharetta, Ga., NThrive provides technology, advisory expertise, services, analytics and education programs to health-care organizations.

Swaps industry balks at joining Trump in gutting Dodd-Frank

For much of the past decade the derivatives industry has been caught in the gravitational pull of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping piece of legislation meant to contain the risk of another financial crisis.

Six years after its passage, US president-elect Donald Trump wantsto dismantlethe law. The industry, however is not racing to join him.

At this week s Global Financial Leadership Conference, a gathering of derivatives traders, discussions dwelled on topics such as the UK s Brexit vote and artificial intelligence, not repealing Dodd-Frank.

 You can t dismantle something after it was just put into law, when the country was basically almost knocked into the Stone Age in 2007 and 2008,  says Terry Duffy, chief executive ofCME Group, the world s biggest futures exchange and host of the conference.

Dodd-Frank contained specific remedies for over-the-counter derivatives markets, blamed for exacerbating the last crisis and the reforms sparked robust lobbying from banks and brokers at the start of the decade.

Gary Gensler, then chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission soughtto break the bank-dominated dealer model and cut the web of interbank exposures.New rules mandated that generic swaps, with notional values in the billions, had to be traded on electronic marketplaces known as swap execution facilities (Sefs). More of the market, with a gross market exposure of $20tn, was pushed through central clearing houses and reported to data warehouses.

 I haven t seen calls to dismantle Title 7 [the derivatives section of Dodd-Frank]. Quite the contrary   what I ve seen is a growing consensus that the reforms made sense,  says Timothy Massad, the current CFTC chairman.

For some in the swaps industry, Mr Trump s victory offers hope of minor but significant tweaks. Michael Spencer, chief executive of ICAP, callsthe rules well intentioned but  overdesigned and overengineered 	. 	. 	. 	a repeal or review of Dodd-Frank would be a good thing for the market as a whole .

Even so, many executives think abolishing the law is a step too far.  I think there s some fringe things that he can do on Dodd-Frank, [but] there s no way in my opinion that he can go in there   I think it would even scare the Republicans   and say we re going to dismantle it and have no laws and go back to what we had in 2007 and prior,  says Mr Duffy.

One reality is that Dodd-Frank and a push to electronic trading have become embedded in markets.

 In some respects it will be just as costly to take out as put in,  says the chief executive of a swaps trading venue who declined to be identified.  People have changed their methods for interacting with the market. Regulations have helped drive the changes. In Treasuries it took 10 years [to go electronic] but in swaps it was just one year. 

There are also potentially limits to change as the mandate was part of a global G20 commitment to bolster over-the-counter markets with clearing and trade reporting. Many have recognised the US s rules asequivalent.

Complaints around the rules are legion, particularly for Sefs. Many market participants complain that these venues havesplit the global swaps market, particularly as traders in Europe shy away from interacting with US counterparts.

Trading between European and US dealers comprised 28.7 per cent of market share at the time of the introduction of Sefs in September 2013. That had fallen to 7.6 per cent by the end of last year, according to data from Isda, the trade association.

That bifurcated market creates pricing problems. Brokers atICAP s London-based Sef talk to dealers about prices  on-Sef  and  off-Sef .  Every day there s a conscious decision to switch trading to a Sef from a European platform,  says one broker.

Others say Sefs are not the lightly-controlled markets they were intended to be.  There s not a big gap between running a Sef and running a futures market,  says the chief executive of another Sef, who declined to be identified.

But industry executives say it s possible for regulators to fix problems without ripping apart the law. Annette Nazareth, partner at Davis Polk in Washington, points out that  there s an awful lot an agency can do outside the legislative process, via rules interpretations or amendments. 

 Right now the US is on the bleeding edge in implementing this part of the 2009 G20 agreements 	. 	. 	. 	so the swaps execution mandate would be the easiest to roll back and most at risk,  says David Weiss, an analyst at Aite Group, a capital markets consultancy.

Furthermore, a blueprint for reform already exists. Two years ago Christopher Giancarlo, a commissioner at the CFTC, published an 89-page "http://www.cftc.gov/idc/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/file/sefwhitepaper012915.pdf" advocating reforms. As the sole Republican commissioner, he has also been widely discussed as a possible new CFTC chairman under a Trump administration.

While he backed central swaps clearing and reporting trades to repositories, he also strongly criticised trading rules. They were overly prescriptive, had significant policy changes buried infootnotes, and had failed to achieve their goals by misapplying the futures market model to the swaps market.

More critically, he argued that the rules had overstepped their mandate from Congress. Instead, he advocated more flexible regulation based on existing practices and allowing for greater choice for dealer and brokers.  It would promote healthy global markets by regulating swaps trading in a manner well matched to the underlying market dynamics,  he argued.

Putting significant policy rulings into footnotes makes them easier to change, lawyers say.

However, the changes may have other effects, particularly for global efforts to harmonise financial regulations to similar standards. The European Commission says it is too early to tell what the priorities will be and is continuing its daily contacts with counterparts in the US.

 We very much hope that the future US administration will work with the EU to help consolidate the G20 financial reform agenda,  a spokesperson said.

Domino Data Lab Raises $10M

Domino Data Lab Inc. has raised $10.5 million in Series B funding for its data-science platform. The round, led by Sequoia Capital, will help the company whose employee came from Bridgewater Associates to expand its service's scale. The company provides a platform that makes it easier for data scientists to collaborate and share.

San Francisco-based Domino counts Allstate, Mashable, Instacart, Carnival Cruise and Lending Home among its customers.

Bryan Schreier, a Sequoia partner, said the big-data market category had become crowded with companies providing data-science tools. He said Sequoia was attracted to Domino because it is not a tool, but rather a system of record.

"It's more like the Github for data science than just another tool company," he said.

The company's previous investors also returned for the round, including Zetta Venture Partners, Bloomberg Beta and In-Q-Tel.

Correction: Domino Data Lab employees came from Bridgewater Associates. A previous version of this article incorrectly said that Domino Data spun out from Bridgewater Associates.

This is one of several recent sales KGR has made to the Boston-based Advent, which closed a $13 billion fund in May. Advent has also bought label-maker "http://www.wsj.com/articles/advent-buying-labels-maker-fort-dearborn-from-krg-1470954177", and physical-therapy company "http://www.wsj.com/articles/advent-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-ati-physical-therapy-from-krg-1459364269" from KGR in recent months.

This month Advent also agreed to buy "http://www.wsj.com/articles/advent-buying-culligan-from-centerbridge-for-about-915-million-1478126301" from Centerbridge Partners LP.

Advent was advised on the deal by AdMedia Partners, a merger and acquisition advisory business for the media and marketing sectors.

Handshake, Now in 170 Colleges, Raises $20M for Student Job Search

College recruiting has been an inefficient process, with many schools using different career center technologies in attempts to get the best employers to hire its students.

Startup Handshake aims to change this, particularly for students not in what are traditionally considered the "top" schools.

The quickly growing startup is used by 3 million students at 170 universities, up from 60 last fall and five two years ago. It is used by 100,000 employers.

Handshake has raised $20 million in Series B financing led by Spark Capital. The round had participation from existing investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, True Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Lowercase Capital, Annox Capital and Charlie Cheever. The company has raised $34 million total. Spark's Megan Quinn is joining Handshake's board.

Students can use Handshake to search and apply for jobs. For companies, once vetted by Handshake, they can post once to as many as 170 schools, target certain majors, and reach schools they wouldn't otherwise. Previously, companies would have to separately post on many different college sites.

Handshake has also helped Citi diversify its recruiting classes and reach a wider range of universities, said Courtney Storz, Citi's head of global campus recruitment and program management, in an email.

Handshake helps college career offices connect with companies that had not recruited there or only in certain majors, said Garrett Lord, co-founder and chief executive at Handshake. "Our mission is for students to get great jobs no matter where they're from, what their parents know or what their socioeconomic status is," said Mr. Lord.

Colorado State University saw a quick increase in companies recruiting from and visiting the campus after signing up with Handshake, said Jeremy Podany, executive director of career and corporate services at Colorado State. "That was fantastic for us," Mr. Podany said.

At universities, all students are automatically given Handshake accounts. In addition to finding job postings and applying through the system, the service is used for booking appointments with career counselors, organizing career fairs and the like. At Princeton, 90% of students are actively using the service, said Evangeline Kubu, director of Princeton's office of career services.

As a result of the recession and high student debt, colleges are under pressure to show return on investment for students and are focusing on software like Handshake that can improve students' job prospects, said Eric Feng, a partner at Kleiner Perkins.

Colleges pay an annual license fee. Companies don't pay for job postings, but Handshake is testing a premium service with additional branding and analytics.

Mr. Lord, who grew up in Michigan and attended Michigan Technological University, knew the challenges students from lesser-known schools faced when he started the company with two classmates.

Some other startups, such as Piazza and WayUp in college job search, have gone direct to students and not worked through universities, but Handshake's approach, while challenging, has resulted in a large network of students, Mr. Feng said.

Tech
IBM CEO Offers Donald Trump Advice; Open letter offers recommendations on issues including infrastructure and health care

International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump outlining her recommendations on health care, infrastructure spending and other issues.

The letter is her first comment on the prospect of a Trump administration since Mr. Trump, shortly before the election, criticized IBM and other companies for shifting U.S. jobs overseas.

The letter offers support for some of Mr. Trump's policies and advice on national issues adding along the way that IBM is the largest technology employer in the U.S. Last year IBM hired more U.S. employees than in the five years prior, the letter said, and it has thousands of open positions.

The Donald J. Trump for President organization didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

Silicon Valley generally has viewed Mr. Trump's victory as a blow to the tech industry, as the president-elect has been a critic of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as IBM.

Among other technology executives, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered Mr. Trump congratulations in a message on Twitter, as did Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, while Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella"https://www.linkedin.com/hp/update/6202273201033216000", with a link to a longer "http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2016/11/09/moving-forward-together-thoughts-us-election/#sm.00002f4492gmve9asnz1b2q7p50br".

Mr. Trump, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, said IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. Mr. Trump also called out Ford Motor Co. and MoneyGram International Inc. for laying off workers and moving jobs overseas.

"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States &we will make them pay a 35% tax," he said.

Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-ceo-looking-forward-to-working-with-president-elect-trump-1479234267" but would continue to discuss the situation with the incoming administration. A 35% tariff "would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions," Mr. Fields said.

The letter from IBM's Ms. Rometty offers support for another of Mr. Trump's proposals, to end tax-code incentives for businesses to keep their overseas earnings out of the country. "Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system," Ms. Rometty wrote.

The change would "free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs," the letter continues.

IBM in 2015 spent more than half its annual $5.4 billion annual research and development budget in the U.S.

IBM also supports Mr. Trump's proposed investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities, Ms. Rometty wrote, adding that the infrastructure's performance would benefit by the inclusion of networked sensors and artificial intelligence, technologies that IBM offers.

Similarly, Ms. Rometty in her letter suggested reducing health-care costs through the use of information technology and data analytics. IBM said it operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the U.S. Health-care costs could be reduced by analyzing data to detect fraudulent Medicare claims, she wrote, citing a 2009 IBM position paper.

Ms. Rometty's letter also called for giving veterans the best health care possible. IBM recently announced a pilot program to help Department of Veterans Affairs oncologists treat 10,000 veterans using genomic analysis powered by Watson, the company's artificial-intelligence computing system.

Henderson Park Buys Largest Hotel in Paris; London-based property firm buys Le Mridien Etoile for  ¬365 million

Henderson Park, a London-based property firm, said Wednesday it bought the largest hotel in Paris, signaling strong demand for hotels across Europe.

Henderson Park said it bought Le Mridien Etoile from U.S. group Mount Kellett Capital Management and U.K.-based Cedar Capital. Henderson Park paid  ¬365 million ($392 million) for the hotel, a person familiar with the matter said.

Le Mridien Etoile, less than a mile from the Arc de Triomphe and with 1,025 rooms, is the largest hotel in Paris. The recently-refurbished hotel is near the Paris Convention Centre and operated by Starwood Hotels.

The deal is one of the biggest hotel deals this year in Europe, where hotels were the only real-estate sector in which investment volumes increased during the third quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics. The  ¬4.3 billion invested between July and September was up 20% compared with the period in 2015.

Overall, commercial real-estate deal volumes were down 38% in the third quarter from last year, Real Capital data show. The drop was concentrated in the region's biggest markets: the U.K., France and Germany. While Britain's decision to leave the European Union played a role, caution after a multiyear property boom also had an impact.

Soaring values in some markets have pushed down returns. In a hunt for yield, investors have increasingly shifted away from traditional property assets like offices and shopping centers into other areas like hotels, warehouses, student housing and even garden centers.

Buying hotels is in part a bet on tourism and business travel. In Paris, tourism suffered in the first half of this year, partly due to the terror attacks in late 2015.

"The Paris hotel market has gone through a tumultuous time," said Nick Weber, founding partner of Henderson Park. "Le Mridien Etoile is poised to take advantage of a recovering hotel market."

Le Mridien Etoile was the first transaction for recently-launched Henderson Park, which raised $500 million from U.S. private-equity firm Stone Point Capital, Kuwait's sovereign-wealth fund and Wafra Investment Advisory Group, which is part-owned by the Kuwaiti government.

"Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world. That's not going to change," Mr. Weber said.

Henderson Park invests in Europe across all real-estate sectors, with a focus on major cities.

AnalyticsMD Raises $13M to Bring AI to Hospitals

Hospitals are large operations with constantly changing conditions and patient issues.

To help hospitals manage their staffing and operations, startup analyticsMD says it its artificial intelligence-based technology acts as a virtual "air-traffic control" that pulls in data from around the hospital and then recommends on-the-fly actions to staff.

Palo Alto, Calif.-based AnalyticsMD has raised $13 million Series A financing co-led by Mayfield and Norwest Venture Partners. The company had gone through Y Combinator and Start-X programs.

AnalyticsMD focuses on operations, not medical care, though it may move in that direction later. Opportunity for improvement is greater not in medicine but in "all the processes around it," said Mudit Garg, chief executive of the company.

"We train clinicians for decades, but everything around that prevents the best care from being delivered," Mr. Garg said.

AnalyticsMD uses patient data to predict which are at a higher risk of falling, which can cause some patients serious injury. It then sends text or other messages to the relevant staff members to suggest that they help the patient if they need to go somewhere. At El Camino Hospital, this reduced falls by close to 40%, the company said.

In a surgical waiting area, analyticsMD can determine if an operation is taking longer than expected, based on data from the surgery, and then get word out to a family member in the waiting room.

Hospitals see improvements in patient waiting times and customer satisfaction, Mr. Garg said. The company said the technology is used at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif.; Sutter Auburn of Auburn, Calif.; St. Joseph's Medical Center of Stockton, Calif.; Natividad Medical Center of Salinas, Calif.; and Mercy Hospital of Fort Smith, Ark.

AnalyticsMD uses machine learning so the technology doesn't just suggest more staff when there are too many patients in a certain area. It also takes into account factors like the time of day and year, patient populations, which staff are available, and their capabilities.

Medical care providers are inundated with clerical tasks, forms and electronic dashboards, so analyticsMD helps cut through this noise and "understands what needs to happen and makes it happen," said Ursheet Parikh, a partner at Mayfield.

Hospitals operate in a "chaotic environment," yet labor costs are high, said Dr. Robert Mittendorff, an emergency physician and partner at Norwest. "The idea is that using technology to semi-automate labor and more efficiently apply the labor we have to patients is a requirement for us to succeed in the U.S. health-care system."

Intel Corp. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich on Tuesday arrived at his first car show as a speaker to deliver the message that his semiconductor company's computing muscle and big-data prowess are just what auto makers need as they prepare for vehicles that can drive themselves.

In his speech at the annual Los Angeles car show, he announced a $250 million commitment by Intel Capital to invest in autonomous-car technology during the next two years.

Mr. Krzanich faces increased competition as chip companies position themselves to provide the computing power for what are becoming data centers on wheels.

Qualcomm Inc., the dominant vendor of smartphone chips, agreed to acquire the Dutch automotive chip leader NXP Semiconductors NV for $39 billion, while Nvidia Corp. provides chips for the latest generation of electric cars offered by Tesla Motors Inc.

"We see the world of cars shifting from something that uses computers to enhance the drive to something that uses compute to really power the drive," Mr. Krzanich said before his speech.

Intel's automotive business is involved in 30 vehicle programs on the road currently, and is slated to increase that number to 49 by 2020 with orders valued at $1 billion, the company said.

Several auto makers including Ford Motor Co. and BMW AG are targeting 2021 to buildself-driving vehicles.

The Los Angeles extravaganza, which opens to the public on Friday, has been rebranded during the days leading up to the event -- traditionally devoted to presenting vehicles to the press -- as Automobility LA in an effort to showcase technology in autos.

Even without building fully self-driving cars, auto makers need increasing computing power for advanced safety features and entertainment systems. The average new car contains 616 chips compared with 550 in 2013, research firm IHS Markit says, to perform tasks as mundane as controlling headlights and as sophisticated as warning when a car strays out of a lane.

"We see the world of cars shifting from something that uses computers to enhance the drive to something that uses compute to really power the drive," Mr. Krzanich said during an interview before his speech. "More and more, it's going to be that compute capability that's going to drive a lot of the differentiation of the car of the future."

Intel's automotive business is involved in 30 vehicle programs on the road currently, and is slated to increase that number to 49 by 2020 with orders valued at $1 billion, the company said. Intel doesn't break out its automotive business in its financial results.

Several auto makers including Ford Motor Co. and BMW AG"http://www.wsj.com/articles/autonomous-car-proliferation-decades-away-u-s-regulator-says-1479233888".

Mr. Krzanich's job increasingly involves courting auto makers. During a recent trip to Europe, for example, he spent nearly two-thirds of conversations with auto executives.

"I love cars they're a passion of mine," he said before sheepishly adding that he drives a staid Toyota Prius. His garage, however, stables a couple of Porsches.

The Los Angeles extravaganza, which opens to the public on Friday, has been rebranded during the days leading up to the event traditionally devoted to presenting vehicles to the press as Automobility LA in an effort to showcase technology in autos.

Even without building fully self-driving cars, auto makers need increasing computing power for advanced safety features and entertainment systems. The average new car contains 616 chips compared with 550 in 2013, research firm IHS Markit says, to perform tasks as mundane as controlling headlights and as sophisticated as warning when a car strays out of a lane.

Tesla, the Silicon Valley electric-car maker, is shipping vehicles with all of the hardware needed to drive themselves with the addition of software that is still in development. The software needs to be validated and approved by regulators, but Tesla's move underscores the rapid advance of a car industry that typically has judged innovation in terms of incremental improvements in fuel efficiency and radio systems that seem antiquated compared with a smartphone.

Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang told investors last week that Tesla's self-driving hardware put the auto maker far ahead of competitors.

"Anybody who was talking about autonomous capabilities and 2020 and 2021 is, at the moment, re-evaluating in a very significant way," Mr. Huang said.

Intel's relationship with BMW could serve as a model for the chip giant's approach to other auto makers. The companies, along with parts supplier Mobileye, are working to bring out an autonomous car in 2021, they said earlier this year.

The Intel-BMW partnership demonstrates the changing role that chip makers have in the automotive industry, where chips have been regarded as commodities. Auto makers, unlike computer and smartphone vendors, haven't bragged about a vehicle's processing power. They have touted horsepower.

But vehicles that generate and consume large amounts of data raise new challenges, such as privacy and cybersecurity. Mr. Krzanich sees a place for his company to help auto makers sift the data flood to make sure some is kept private, some is shared to help update autonomous systems and some is available to advertisers. He pointed to the company's work in health care with Cancer Cloud, a collaborative project with Oregon Health and Science University that lets medical researchers share data while keeping parts of it private.

The typical car today puts out little data, Mr. Krzanich said, while the typical autonomous car will generate 4,000 gigabytes a day in 2020. Car companies are going to need help managing that.

"It is a marriage of bringing what I call automotive skills together with data-center and high-compute skills," he said.

KKR Holds $687 Million Close on First Technology Fund

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. has held a $687 million close on its first global technology fund, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investors committed $449 million, while KKR, its affiliates and "parallel vehicles" contributed the rest, the filing showed. The filing did not indicate whether the closing represented a final or interim closing for the fund.

The close comes more than a year after the firm began sounding out investors over the fund, which will be led by KKR's global technology, media and telecommunications team.

It will look to take both majority and minority stakes in companies and invest between $25 million and $80 million of equity in deals.

Though this is the first fund KKR has raised targeting deals of this size in the technology sector, it has experience investing in tech startups.

In September 2015, the firm raised $1.3 billion for a tech buyout fund as part of a joint venture with Accel, one of Silicon Valley's best-known venture capital firms. Tech companies KKR has invested in include UK cybersecurity company Darktrace Ltd and Israeli data analytics company Optimal+.

KKR is not alone among large-cap buyout firms looking to raise smaller funds to make investments in the booming technology markets.

EQT Partners raised  ¬566 million for its first VC tech fund in May, while CVC Capital Partners raised $1 billion for its first tech-focused fund in February.

US election boosts BlackRock biotech ETF; Exchange traded funds

Confidence grows that price restrictions will not be imposed

Investors ploughed a record $745m into BlackRock's biotechnology exchange traded fund last Wednesday after Donald Trump 's presidential election victory fuelled confidence that draconian pricing restrictions will not be imposed on healthcare and pharmaceutical companies.

The Nasdaq Biotech ETF run by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, registered trades worth $3.2bn on Wednesday alone, and attracted a record one-day inflow of around $745m.

Direxion, a Milwaukee-based provider of leveraged ETFs, which multiply daily returns or losses, also experienced unprecedented demand for its biotech ETF.

The Direxion Biotech 3x Bull ETF registered trades worth almost $400m on Wednesday after the price of the fund soared 33.5 per cent on the day. Some investors chose to take profits as the price of the fund spiked, resulting in net outflows of around $60m.

"Users of leveraged ETFs think tactically, and their tactic after this substantial gain was to take some profits," said Sylvia Jablonski, a managing director at Direxion.

Drugmakers had been repeatedly criticised by Hillary Clinton , the Democratic candidate, who threatened to fine them for excessive price rises. In contrast, Mr Trump said little about pharmaceutical pricing during his campaign.

Mr Trump's victory was therefore seen as a boon for the pharmaceutical sector, triggering a spike in demand for ETFs tracking biotechnology, healthcare and pharmaceutical stocks .

Some emerging market ETFs have had enlarged trading volumes and substantial outflows since the election, mirroring fears that growth in global trade will decline if Mr Trump imposes protectionist measures. Investors pulled around $1.6bn from BlackRock's largest emerging markets ETF following the election.

Samara Cohen, US head of capital markets at iShares, BlackRock's passive investment arm, said: "ETFs offer investors a way to get sector exposure very quickly and precisely. They are also very useful indicators of where money is in motion."

ETFs tracking US financial stocks registered inflows, reflecting hopes that regulations affecting US banks and asset managers could be loosened.

Ian Schaad, managing director at Jane Street Capital, a New York-based trading company, said: "We have seen extremely elevated trading volumes across quite a number of ETFs, two to five times their normal daily averages, that seem to indicate Trump election-related positioning. We also saw the trend continue into Thursday."

Investors concerned that Mexico's economy will suffer as a result of the president-elect's protectionist trade and immigration policies have placed substantial bets via BlackRock's Mexico ETF.

Short positions in the ETF, an indication of investors betting Mexico's stock market will fall, reached $833m on the day of the US election, according to S3 Partners, a New York-based financial analytics provider.

The price of the ETF has fallen 16 per cent since the election, closely tracking movements in Mexico's stock market in dollar terms.

Trump Trade Stance With Mexico Could Press Gas Prices; Southern neighbor has become an increasingly important outlet for the fuel

Donald Trump's presidency is widely viewed as a boon for the U.S. energy industry, but some of his planned policies could pose problems for the natural-gas business.

Mr. Trump has won plaudits from energy executives for saying he would peel back government regulations on oil companies, oppose global efforts to curb climate change and review a recent agreement that lifted sanctions on Iran, a major oil exporter.

Yet some of his other proposals could be detrimental to natural gas. He has pledged to tear up trade pacts and wall off Mexico, which could hurt the flow of U.S. natural gas to its southern neighbor. Mexico has become an increasingly important outlet for the fuel that has helped buoy domestic prices amid a glut of shale gas, analysts say.

"Mexico has been one of the few bright stories for prices and demand," said Nicholas Potter, an analyst at Barclays PLC, which warned clients on Election Day that Mr. Trump's "trade policies would likely curb or at least limit incremental U.S. gas exports to Mexico."

A reduction in sales to Mexico could worsen the gas glut and weigh on prices. It could also penalize the companies building pipelines to Mexico and the drillers, primarily in Texas, shipping their gas across the border.

Mr. Trump has also proposed rolling back regulations on the coal industry that he has said have cost mining jobs. Analysts say that doing so could help coal retake market share from natural gas at U.S. power plants.

Mr. Trump's representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.

Shipments to Mexico reached an all-time high in August and accounted for almost 6% of total U.S. gas production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. These exports have risen dramatically in recent years as U.S. prices have plummeted on abundant supplies of shale gas and because of new pipelines that have been built across the border.

This summer, Mexico's imports of U.S. gas for the first time eclipsed its domestic production, which has declined more than 25% since 2010, according to Platts Analytics, a unit of S&P Global Platts.

Meanwhile, demand for natural gas in Mexico has risen roughly 20% since the beginning of the decade as power plants have switched from burning more expensive fuel oil and the country has tried to decrease pricey deliveries of gas from overseas, says Platts, which expects demand to continue to rise.

"Barring some kind of bizarre trade war, it's one of the more certain areas for natural-gas demand growth," said Ross Wyeno, a Platts analyst.

U.S. gas prices have been under pressure in recent years as energy explorers used new drilling techniques to unleash a market-swamping glut of the heating and power-generation fuel.

On Friday, U.S. natural gas futures for December delivery fell 0.5% to $2.619 a million British thermal units, and prices are down 22% over the past four weeks.

Domestic demand has risen as U.S. power producers switched from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas in part to comply with environmental regulations and the first shipments of liquefied natural gas were shipped overseas from a new Gulf Coast terminal this year.

But analysts say the market would be badly unbalanced without exports to Mexico.

Brandon Blossman, an analyst with Houston investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., estimated that an immediate cessation of exports to Mexico would cut about 75 cents per million British thermal unit from U.S. prices, or about 30% of the current price.

An all-out and immediate halt is highly unlikely. But Mr. Blossman's calculation shows the importance of the Mexican market to U.S. energy producers that are already struggling to produce gas economically. The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. has fallen to 115 from about 900 five years ago, according to Baker Hughes Inc.

Analyst say drillers in Texas would feel the most pain if exports were interrupted. Mr. Blossman estimated that gas producers drilling the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas save about 25 cents per million cubic feet by sending gas in pipelines to Mexico instead of more distant U.S. trading hubs.

"Not having Mexico as an outlet for natural gas is very bad economically for Texas, particularly south Texas," he said.

Pipeline owners could also suffer from reduced business with Mexico. Pipeline projects that are under way will boost export capacity by 90% by 2020, according to Platts. Major U.S. investors have also spent big on gas-distribution projects in Mexico, which is privatizing its energy sector.

BlackRock Inc. and First Reserve Corp., for example, last year paid $900 million for a 45% stake in a 430-mile pipeline that carries U.S. gas to Mexico City.

Mexico's own investment has been geared more toward building the pipelines needed to distribute U.S. gas than it has on drilling for its own. The country has added more than 6,000 miles of pipelines in the past five years, according to David Shields, a local industry analyst who publishes the newsletter Energia a Debate.

"It doesn't make much sense for Mexico to do much exploration for gas if the opportunity exists to import it very cheaply from Texas," Mr. Shields said.

Former Microsoft veteran Sheila Gulati has hauled in additional capital to top off funding at Tola Capital to nearly $300 million for investments in enterprise software startups.

Seattle-based Tola Capital focuses its investments on cloud-based software startups, particularly those working with artificial intelligence.

"It's pervasive across everything we're doing," Ms. Gulati said of investing in artificial intelligence.

Ms. Gulati, who led developer and platform evangelism at Microsoft, is managing director of Tola Capital, which has now raised $295 million. The amount raised for its fund, dubbed Tola Ventures LP, previously stood at $202.7 million, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Ms. Gulati said that Tola Capital invests in companies anywhere but that its proximity to Microsoft and Amazon make it an ideal partner-investor in cloud startups. Some of the venture-capital firm's portfolio investments have forged business relationships with Microsoft, she said.

"I have immense respect for my former colleague and friend Satya Nadella and the tremendous success they are making in the cloud," she said of Microsoft's chief executive.

Ms. Gulati said that Tola Capital plans to continue to invest in cloud-based enterprise software companies, but it is looking at the influence of AI on marketing, the supply chain and manufacturing.

In addition to Ms. Gulati, Tola's investing partners include Aaron Fleishman and Stacey Giard. Tashi Schmidt is the firm's chief financial officer.

With the additional funding, the firm is seeking another investing partner who fits with its team.

Tola Capital investments include Sitecore, 3Scale, Opera Solutions, ShiftMobility and Wercker.

CrowdTangle Inc., a provider of social-media analytics, said it has been acquired by Facebook. Financial terms of the deal were undisclosed.

CrowdTangle, which was founded in 2011, helps publishers to identify relevant social posts and measure performance, along with other insights. Entertainment companies, nonprofits and sports teams use its tools as well.

The deal comes as Facebook comes under pressure for allowing fake news to fester on its platform; CrowdTangle's tools have allowed reporters to track the flow of fake news on the social-media network.

In a blog post announcing the deal, CrowdTangle says partners can expect higher-quality products and support. Facebook says the CrowdTangle deal would allow it to deliver "more insights to more publishers."

CrowdTangle raised $2.17 million of venture funding from Advancit Capital, Lerer Hippeau Ventures and New Media Ventures in 2014, with a pre-money valuation of $9.42 million, according to an estimate by PitchBook Data Inc.

CrowdTangle said the brand will remain in operation as part of Facebook.

Congratulations Donald Trump. In an incredibly close contest you have been elected president of the US , the world's most powerful economy. What you do in your first 100 days in office, together with what you refrain from doing, will have an enormous impact on the wellbeing of America and global economies.

And what you communicate in the next few days, in addition to whether you do it in a reassuring and unifying manner, will be crucial to calm financial markets that are shaken by the higher possibility of protectionism, economic unpredictability and hostility towards the US Federal Reserve.

The mixed health of the US economy - and, more specifically, the economic insecurity felt by individuals - were among the top issues in the minds of voters, and for good reasons.

Despite outperforming most other countries since the dark days of the global financial crisis, "average" Americans have seen their standard of living stagnate while the better-off have captured an even greater share of the country's income and wealth.

No wonder so many are losing faith in the "American dream", sensing that opportunities are narrowing especially for the middle and lower classes. With that comes a growing mistrust of the "establishment", both government institutions and large companies, and concern that the next generation may, for the first time in a very long time, be worse off than their parents.

If your administration does not react quickly, the economic shortfalls of yesterday and today will amplify those of tomorrow.

Persistent low growth, together with its non-inclusive nature, drags down future economic potential. A highly unbalanced policy stance that is over-reliant on central banks is delivering fewer benefits and risking greater collateral damage and unintended consequences. And all this would be amplified by continued financial market volatility that further damages sentiment and economic activity.

But there is also good economic news . You inherit a relatively robust labour market, a safer banking system, a highly entrepreneurial economy, and a cash-rich corporate sector.

Meanwhile, the beneficial impact of exciting innovations - particularly those powered by the combination of artificial intelligence, big data, mobility and individual empowerment - is going from being company and sector-specific to having broad economic effects.

You will also find a relatively broad consensus in the economic profession on what is needed to propel the economy to higher and more inclusive growth. As such, there could well be a window in the first quarter of 2016 to work with Congress to implement your campaign promises on an infrastructure programme, corporate tax reform and eliminating the excessively low taxation of carried interest.

Markets will be less nervous if you are able to signal your intention to move quickly on these measures, which already command a high degree of bipartisan support. Their implementation would jump-start a virtuous economic-financial-political cycle that helps corporate cash engage more productively in economic activities rather than be held on corporate balance sheets or used for share buybacks and defensive mergers and acquisitions - thereby also lowering the risk of future financial instability.

And with wages finally rising but productivity struggling, you may also find more companies eager to enter into public-private partnerships to enhance the functioning of the labour market.

A midyear budget process would restore responsible activism to a fiscal policy that has been undermined by congressional gridlock. You may also be able to capitalise on growing concern about student debt and the threat it poses to economic dynamism. All this would serve to strengthen the US leadership that global economic policy co-ordination needs.

Equally important is what you refrain from doing. Slapping tariffs on China and Mexico will do little to help the US economy and could trigger a damaging trade war and amplify unsettling financial market instability. Cutting taxes on the wealthy is also inadvisable as it will drain the budget without much hope of a beneficial growth response.

Rethink your campaign promises to repeal immediately Obamacare and the North American Free Trade Agreement, especially as there are at present no credible alternatives. And please avoid unnecessary attacks on the Fed's political autonomy and competence.

Finally, do not underestimate the importance of how you communicate - the third vital element of your first 100 days in office when it comes to the economy.

An unusually unsettled and divided US yearns for a clear vision of where the economy is going, and one that supplements the usual economic indicators with a feel for what lies ahead for wage growth, health services and education for their children.

Copper plays catch-up with November surge

A wave of speculative buying has helped pushed copper to its highest level in more than a year, helping to reverse its underperformance against other industrial metals.

After going nowhere for most of the year, copper has surged 20 per cent over the past two weeks, attracting the attention of momentum trading funds. It has also forced short sellers to buy back their positions.

 Speculators are finally returning to the copper market,  said Xiao Fu, head of commodity markets strategy at Bank of China International.

Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange climbed almost $200 to $5,607 a tonne on Thursday, a level it last reached in July 2015.

Copper s burst higher has also electrified the shares of copper producers such as London-listed Antofagasta, which climbed 12 per cent on Thursday.

The metal is a key commodity for some of the world s largest miners, including Rio Tinto, Glencore and BHP Billiton, but rising production and ample stocks have seen it lag behind other metals such as zinc and nickel this year.

They have benefited from fresh stimulus measures by the Chinese government and supply cuts. In the case of zinc, used to galvanise steel, it has climbed almost 60 per cent to $2,518 a tonne this year helped by the closure of several large mines and Glencore s decision to mothball 500,000 tonnes of production capacity.

Traders said the election of Donald Trump as US president, who has promised to invest in infrastructure, had triggered another burst of speculative interest in copper even though other commodities would probably be bigger winners from any spending splurge on roads, railways and bridges.

 Without specific details it is hard to quantify the impact on commodity demand, however such policies would support steel, iron ore, zinc, nickel, diesel and cement demand in the US,  said analysts at Goldman Sachs, noting that copper demand was tied more closely to housing starts than spending on infrastructure.

Analysts said sentiment towards copper started to improve during LME Week this month, helped by positive economic data from China.

Over the past three weeks, the number of live derivative contracts in copper   or open interest   on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has surged 28 per cent, according to the Bank of China. Meanwhile, open interest on the LME and Comex has jumped 8 per cent and 13 per cent respectively from late October.

A total of 1m lots of metal were traded on the LME on Wednesday, the second-biggest day of trading this year, the exchange said.

 This move has been very much dominated by activity out of Asia as base metals had been lagging some of the other China-sensitive commodities,  said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at commodities broker Marex Spectron.

Another factor boosting speculative demand for copper is moves by policymakers in China to try and damp down domestic coal prices, which have surged in recent months. This has pushed retail investors into other commodities such as copper.

Donald Trump's Surprise Victory Sent Global Markets on a 12-Hour Thrill Ride; Sleepless traders from New York to Hong Kong were whipsawed by huge swings as election results trickled in

As Americans headed to the polls Tuesday morning, sales staff at Deutsche Bank s London offices circulated a lighthearted message on their terminals to gauge the chances they'd be able to turn in early that night.

"If Clinton wins Florida, GO TO SLEEP. If she wins Georgia, definitely GO TO SLEEP," the message said. If Donald Trump were to win Pennsylvania and Michigan, which the message described as "both leaning to Clinton," then "GET READY FOR WORK."

By early Wednesday morning U.S. time, Mr. Trump had captured at least three of the four states in route to a stunning presidential victory that shook the political establishment to its core and sent shock waves through global markets.

Over a 12-hour period, markets for stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities plunged before ricocheting back toward all-time highs. The roller coaster ride spawned winners, losers and more than a little heartburn in trading centers world-wide. And while Wednesday ended on a bullish note, the turbulence is likely to continue as the particulars of Mr. Trump's administration and agenda come into focus.

In the U.S., stock futures tumbled nearly 900 points overnight before the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied to close near a record high. Brent crude oil, meanwhile, initially fell more than 3% before rising nearly 1%. Gold prices shot up 5% before retreating to be roughly unchanged on the day.

The following is an hour-by-hour account of how the U.S. elections whipsawed the markets. Unless otherwise indicated, times are for the American East Coast.

7:00 p.m.

Ray Attrill, the Sydney-based global head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank, stepped away from his computer screens to get lunch. When he returned 20 minutes later, he was stunned to see the U.S. electoral map glowing red and currencies like the Mexican peso in sharp decline. "Brexit, Trump coming to a country near you," he said.

7:30 p.m.

In Hong Kong, traders at Parry International Trading Ltd. had been at their desks since 6 a.m. local time to track the markets. Mounted televisions blasted the news across the trading floor as the state results rolled in. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, a regional bellwether, began to slide.

Gavin Parry, the firm's managing director, was surprised but not shocked. Traders remained in good spirits, even as markets started to swoon. "The joke on the desk was basically 2016 is the year to bet on the underdog," Mr. Parry said. "You have Leicester City winning soccer, you have the Cubs win, you have Ireland beating New Zealand [in rugby] for the first time in 115 years this weekend, and now you've got Trump!"

8:30 p.m.

David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., was watching results roll in from the comfort of his home library. As Mr. Trump's results looked stronger and stronger, Mr. Kotok's phone started buzzing with a flood of text messages from clients asking what they should do. As the night progressed, his advice grew simpler: "You should probably get some sleep." Nobody knew what the next day held in store.

9 p.m.

Mark Dowding, co-head of investment-grade debt at BlueBay Asset Management, woke up at 2 a.m. in London to check the election results. He had planned to return to bed. But when he saw Mr. Trump had clinched key swing states, "sleep was off the agenda," he said.

Two hours later, Mr. Dowding headed to his local railway station on the northern outskirts of London. The train failed to show and Mr. Dowding ended up crowding into a taxi with a group of other finance professionals. "Everyone was tapping away on their phones" during the hour-long ride into the capital, he said.

John Hardy, a Texan who works on the London trading floor of Saxo Bank as head of foreign-exchange strategy, spent the night in the office. As he surveyed exit polls and early-voting data, he concluded Mrs. Clinton's swelling deficit was too great to overcome. At 2.37 a.m., hours before major U.S. TV networks called the race for Mr. Trump, Mr. Hardy sent a message to other traders via the bank's internal chat: "Trump wins it."

A response came back: "That's crazy."

A continent away, in Newport Beach, Calif., Pimco's chief investment officer, Dan Ivascyn, left the office around 6 p.m. local time. That didn't mean he was calling it a night. As bond markets started swinging as early results pointed to a possible Trump victory, Mr. Ivascyn instructed his traders to use the after-hour gyrations to buy up bargains in bond and currency markets.

Pimco might have been anxious about trying to catch a falling knife, but Mr. Ivascyn had in mind the relatively swift rebound that took place in the U.K. following the June vote to leave the European Union. "Pimco expects these bouts of volatility to be ongoing and was looking to take advantage of last evening's volatility," Mr. Ivascyn said.

9:35 p.m.

In San Antonio, the head of a little-known data analytics team sent a flurry of messages to the Trump campaign's New York war room. The firm, Cambridge Analytica, had designed complex election-predicting algorithms, and they had just tilted in Mr. Trump's favor.

Cambridge, part-funded by Robert Mercer, a computer scientist and co-CEO of secretive quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, has been a pivotal behind-the-scenes force working to elect Mr. Trump. The firm's 12-person team used sentiment analysis to see whether potential voters were more receptive to positive or negative advertising, which helped drive the high-stakes tone of the Trump campaign.

Now, a couple hours after polls closed, data were pouring in from roughly 300 battleground counties. Quickly, Florida became the center of attention, as rural counties in northern and central Florida started to show a strong skew toward Trump.

"We were just zoned into Florida for a long time," said Matthew Oczkowski, Cambridge's head of product. "As soon as we saw those counties start coming in, we knew it could happen. We knew the odds were more than 50%."

10 p.m.

At a results-watching party at a hedge-fund trader's loft apartment in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, golden "USA" balloons were affixed to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The mood started off jovial. But as early results pointed to an increasingly likely Trump victory, traders there were glued to their phones, which showed stock futures plunging.

Instead of drinking wine and chatting with other attendees, they paced the apartment, with some placing bearish futures trades from their phones, anticipating chaos in the markets due to the unexpected results.

As markets kept souring, partygoers filtered out to either get a few hours' sleep or to hail Uber cars to take them straight to their Midtown offices to brace for what looked like a wave of carnage.

10:30 p.m.

Andrew Beal was loving it. The prominent banker, one of Donald Trump's first public backers in finance, spent the evening at Mr. Trump's celebration in a midtown Manhattan hotel. Mr. Beal, who founded Dallas-based Beal Bank, helped set up a super PAC backing Mr. Trump and is on his economic advisory team. He walked across Midtown to the event with a group of fellow supporters. They made a pit stop to buy Trump buttons from a street vendor.

The mood at the event had turned positive early on. As he sipped vodka and sodas, Mr. Beal, a noted math whiz, eventually evaluated the returns and gauged that his candidate was going win before Florida was called for Mr. Trump. "This election is over," he jubilantly predicted to anyone who would listen.

11:30 p.m.

Investors and companies seemed to be panicking. At Cambridge Global Payments, which manages currency risks for companies, traders' phones were ringing off the hook with calls from antsy corporate executives who were watching the violent gyrations in global foreign-exchange markets. "There was a wave of treasurers and CFOs calling in and saying  we need to make sure we're stable for the evening,' " said Karl Schamotta, the Toronto firm's head of enterprise risk.

The panic crested shortly after 11 p.m., and some semblance of stability crept back into the vast currency markets. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso began to bounce back relative to the U.S. dollar, prompting some Canadian and Mexican firms with operations in the U.S. to take "opportunistic" actions such as selling the dollar and buying back their own currencies.

11:45 p.m.

Kevin Daly, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up at 4:45 a.m. in London and turned on the TV. He was wearing his pajamas when Mr. Trump was crowned winner of Florida and Ohio. "I had to pinch myself a couple of times because of what I was seeing," Mr. Daly said. Still in disbelief, he checked dozens of emails he had received overnight from colleagues all over the world. "I needed a second source," he said.

Mr. Daly showered, changed and then went to wake his six-year-old son. "He won," Mr. Daly told his son. "He had me repeat it. Twice."

1 a.m.

Pennsylvania had just been called for Mr. Trump. It was early morning in London, and Graham Sharpe, a director at bookmakers William Hill PLC, realized his industry had once again made an awful wager. British gambling houses had been swamped with votes anticipating a Trump victory, and now they were on the hook for huge payouts.

"Bloody awful," he said, listening to the results come in over the radio from his northwest London home. "It was like deja vu," he said, referring to the Brexit vote, which cost William Hill about 400,000. After estimating Mr. Trump's chances of winning the presidency at around 20%, they are set to lose around 250,000 more.

One of those winners was John Mappin, who won 110,000 after placing 35 bets on a Trump victory. Mr. Mappin spent election night at the vast Victorian hotel he owns in Cornwall, southern England, surrounded by computer screens. Mr. Mappin placed the bets based on the results of a predictive algorithm he designed. He spent Tuesday night working on mathematical formulas while eating large quantities of chicken consomm.

2 a.m.

Robert Murray, a prominent Trump backer and the controlling owner of the nation's largest privately held coal miner, had turned down perhaps two dozen invitations to election-watching parties, instead opting to be at his home in Ohio's Appalachian foothills. By 2 a.m., with Mr. Trump on the brink of victory, the 76-year-old had turned to prayer, keeping in mind tales of Biblical characters who were imperfect but used by God for good.

God "didn't pick saints to carry out his will," Mr. Murray said. "He picked people who were rough around the edges and tarnished to carry out his will. That's Donald Trump."

3 a.m.

President-elect Trump declared victory. Bob Doll, chief equity strategist with Nuveen Asset Management, had predicted back in January that any Republican nominee would win and that the GOP would control both houses of Congress. He expected that markets would tank as much as 5% if his predictions came true. Now that seemed to be happening.

Mr. Doll was poised to pounce, preferring "to be a buyer when other people are running for the hills." But the buying opportunities never materialized. Mr. Trump's conciliatory victory speech seemed to calm the fears of traders. Stock indexes recovered much of their losses. In the coming hours, as the bounce grew more pronounced, Mr. Doll would decide it was time to sell. He was looking to trim his holdings of some health-care stocks that had surged on Mr. Trump's victory and on the defeat of a California ballot initiative that was viewed as hurting the industry.

"Is Pfizer 9% better today than it was yesterday?" he asked. The answer, he reckoned, was no.

4 a.m.

Emails kept landing in Karen Altfest's inbox. The executive vice president of Altfest Personal Wealth Management in New York had turned her TV off seven hours earlier, unable to stomach the sight of another commentator "stand over another map." Stunned by Mr. Trump's upset win, she tried to calm herself by reading the arts and style sections of a few newspapers.

By dawn on Wednesday, she was getting emails from similarly sober clients. Many were asking about buying opportunities. "I was very proud of them for taking the long-term view," she says. Few were looking to sell.

Her message to clients: "Things will be all right and these things have a way of working out," she says.

4:30 a.m.

Scot Vorse was at home in Los Angeles when his cellphone rang. The 56-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump's campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon. Now, as he anxiously watched results trickle in with his son, Mr. Vorse was reminded of the times he worked alongside Mr. Bannon on mergers and how his friend's intense focus helped get deals done.

It had been more than an hour since Mr. Trump had declared victory, and Mr. Vorse had turned in for the night. His phone woke him up. It was Mr. Bannon calling from New York.

"You guys did it!" Mr. Vorse exclaimed.

"It's pretty crazy," Mr. Bannon replied.

6 a.m.

Justin Wiggs, managing director in equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus, arrived at his Baltimore office, expecting chaos. To his surprise, things were calm. Trading was orderly. Stock futures, which had fallen by as much as 5%, were now trading down roughly 1.5% ahead of the market open.

"Would you think I was crazy to think the market might be up today?" one client asked him in an early-morning phone call.

7:30 a.m.

Morgan Harting's eight-person team squeezed into his office. The group of portfolio managers at AllianceBernstein's emerging-markets group, had been in the office until 2 a.m. and reconvened four hours later. Now they were scrambling to figure out how to position for when markets opened.

Mr. Harting's advice: "Don't stare at the screen, take a moment" to think. They filled a white board with expected winners and losers. Potential winners included coal companies and gun makers. There were lots of question marks, including the potential geopolitical implications. "The last 24 hours have been humbling," Mr. Harting said. "The market and the forecasts got this wrong."

9:30 a.m.

"And we're up!"

About a dozen traders at JonesTrading Institutional Services had spent the morning trying to talk down jittery clients on the phone ahead of the stock market open. The firm's global market strategist, Yousef Abbasi, had been fielding calls about how to position for Mr. Trump's expected policies. Private-prison companies' shares are suddenly popular. Coal shares should be up, renewable energy down. "You're talking about a whole new regime here," he said.

Now Mr. Abbasi was surprised to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average get off to a fast start a stunning reversal after looking like it was due to plunge just hours earlier. "That was quick," he exclaimed.

Phones started ringing across the trading floor. "We are making America great again," someone on the floor quipped, as United States Steel Corp.'s stock jumped higher. "Steel is definitely in the wall," another trader said with a smile.

"Why is Smith & Wesson down 12% today?" shouted another trader across the room.

"Because you don't need to buy your gun today," Mr. Abbasi replied. "The dust has settled and people are jumping in."

Bessemer Venture Partners' Byron Deeter is betting that artificial intelligence will drive the next wave of human resources software startups.

His firm has led a $10 million Series C extension in Glint Inc., a startup that develops software that uses artificial intelligence to help companies understand how to engage and motivate employees in hopes of improving productivity and retention. Bessemer co-led the company's $27 million Series C along with Meritech Capital Partners in August.

"The first wave of HR technology was just bringing it to the cloud," said Mr. Deeter, who led the firm's investment in "https://www.glintinc.com/". The next wave of human resources software will be "people analytics," he said, bringing artificial intelligence into the equation. "When you think of a HR product when in theory every employee in a company could touch the product that's a powerful entry point for AI."

Glint is one of several startups trying to lead the next generation of human resources technology, after a previous generation of startups brought HR functions online. One such example is talent management software startup SuccessFactors, which raised over $50 million in venture capital before going public in 2007. It was bought by SAP for $3.4 billion in 2011.

The startup, based in Redwood City, Calif., has raised $60 million to date. Its customers include United Airlines. The new funding makes it one of the best-funded startups in the area. Cloud-based human resources software platform Namely has raised over $100 million from investors including True Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures and Sequoia Capital.

Trump Has Bank Stocks Singing  Hail to the Chief'; Banks will likely face fewer regulations, but could be harmed by protectionist policies

Investors in bank stocks greeted Donald Trump's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-clinches-presidency-after-key-battleground-wins-1478676844?tesla=y"with cheers, reflecting hopes for stronger growth and a lighter regulatory burden. But analysts warned the stocks still face threats from increased political risk or a rise in U.S. protectionism.

Shares in big U.S. banks were up markedly Wednesday morning. Stock in Bank of America Corp. jumped around 5%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. were all up more than 3%.

While Mr. Trump's potential handling of "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/11/09/donald-trumps-stunning-win-upends-u-s-economic-forecasts/", trade deals and financial regulation remain open questions, the immediate issue for banks is how they will contend with a second spurt of volatility this year in reaction to a surprise populist-leaning vote in a major economy.

While rapid, post-election market moves can prove dicey for investors, trading-intensive banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley could benefit from heightened volatility. As investors adjust portfolios to reflect the electoral outcome and market reaction, trading revenue should benefit.

Because Mr. Trump hasn't held elected office before and because his campaign eschewed detailed policy proposals, there is likely to be greater uncertainty for banks and other industries coming out of this vote than past presidential elections. But that also offers opportunity, especially when it comes to the regulatory environment.

For financials, "everything is in play," noted FBR & Co. analyst Edward Mills in a note Wednesday morning. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-trumps-win-means-for-the-fed-1478691327"to the outlook for the Dodd-Frank Act and regulation to the fate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its head Richard Cordray, he noted.

Still, Mr. Trump's victory could help bank stocks outperform other sectors, some analysts say. Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Autonomous Research, said that if the volatility seen on election night persists, "you could have some significant interest rate and stock market activity. If they're within reason, rather than a collapse in valuations, you could see a pretty active fourth quarter and first quarter next year, during the critical first 100 days of any presidency."

Goldman and Morgan Stanley, among other banks, benefited from volatility in the third quarter after the U.K.'s Brexit vote. Mr. Moszkowski said potential policy implications of the election are harder to predict, and likely wouldn't factor into near-term trading.

A Trump victory could lead to "a more business-friendly political climate," said Bill Smead, who leads Seattle-based Smead Capital Management and has invested in bank stocks like J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo for years. "We like being owners of these banks despite the overnight selloff in common stocks."

He added: "Bank stocks have been besieged by Dodd-Frank regulations and a climate not conducive to supporting a stronger level of economic growth."

Mr. Trump's victory might turn bankers more hopeful of some relief on Dodd-Frank rules that have crimped some of their business lines. But there is also concern a protectionist turn in the U.S. under a Trump presidency would be a negative for the industry. Such a move could also force investors to take a tough look at banks with large international businesses.

"Dodd-Frank is done for," Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics wrote in a research note Wednesday. While she said the law would only change over time, its structural assumptions about regulation are "smashed."

For big banks, though, this could prove a threat. Populist forces on both sides of the political aisle could squeeze them, Ms. Petrou added. Mr. Trump's campaign, for example, had spoken of a Glass-Steagall Act for the 21st century. That was the Depression-era law that created a wall between commercial- and investment-banking activities.

A decline in cross-border capital flows could hurt banks that focus on serving companies rather than individuals, as would restrictions on people movement and immigration, this person said. On the other hand, if Mr. Trump makes good on promises of U.S. infrastructure investment and lower taxes, it could boost the economy and steepen the yield curve, which could help banks, as more firms issue bonds and interest income rises, said Mr. Moszkowski.

Currencies were expected to react the most to the Trump victory, according to a J.P. Morgan strategy report last week, since "his protectionist trade measures (tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports) are easiest to implement via executive order" than a fiscal program requiring congressional approval.

The note added: "Although Trump fiscal proposals are negative for Treasurys over the medium term, his bellicose trade rhetoric probably dominates near-term to weaken risky markets, so would push back expectations of Fed tightening."

Any delay in Fed tightening would hurt profitability prospects of a host of Main Street banks that collect interest income that generally rises along with Fed interest rates.

But banks stocks, despite a bounce earlier this week, remain relatively cheap versus other sectors, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase. He added that financial shares could benefit from higher interest rates, which are expected in the long term. And if Mr. Trump follows through on reducing regulations, financials could also benefit.

The main driver of bank shares, though, will be economic growth and it will take time to see if the new political reality produces that. "Clearly populism is a very successful political strategy," Mr. Kelly said. "But whether it turns out to be a very successful economic strategy is another question entirely."

Warren, In Statement, Offers to Work With Trump

One person who isn't a candidate but suffered a big loss on election day is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.), who could've seen her influence significantly expanded with Democrats still in the White House. On Wednesday the Wall Street critic issued a statement saying she was frustrated that a Democrat nominee had won the popular vote but lost the presidency, which also occurred in 2000. But she held her criticism for now:" President-Elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task."

FSOC Meeting Next Week to Discuss Asset Managers

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, headed by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, is set to meet next week to review asset management products and activities. At the Nov. 16 meeting, staff by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will give a presentation on stress tests of central counterparties, according to a public notice of the meeting released Wednesday. That portion of the meeting will be held privately in executive session due to confidential information that will be discussed tied to the council's review of asset management products and activities. The open session will include an update on alternative reference rates and revisions to the council's regulations under the Freedom of Information Act. (donna.borak@wsj.com, @donnaborak)

Former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair Praises Donald Trump

President-elect Donald Trump gained support from a former top bank regulator Wednesday morning when Sheila Bair, who chaired the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., tweeted: "Gracious and unifying victory speech. Congratulations Mr. Trump." Ms. Bair, a Republican, is president of Washington College in Chestertown, Md., and had served as FDIC chairman from June 2006 through 2011. Her tweet immediately got a question back from another follower on whether she would consider a position in the next administration or at the Federal Reserve. She has yet to respond.

Trump presidency will see end of global bank regulator, risk-weights

The G20's Financial Stability Board will become obsolete under a Trump presidency, says a veteran Washington DC policy adviser close to Republicans. Peter Wallison, a senior fellow at the free-market American Enterprise Institute, said a Trump administration effectively spelt the end of the global body, which was created in the wake of the financial crisis to co-ordinate implementation of post-crisis reforms designed to make the financial system safer. "The Financial Stability Board is out of business. They can't do anything until they have a partner in the US, and they aren't going to have one," he said in an interview. Mr. Wallison, who has been a key adviser to Congressional Republicans, said a Trump administration would bring "new thinking" to financial regulation, which would probably include dumping the complex system of risk-weights that underpinned the current rules. "We need a strong and simple set of capital regulations that are based on the ideas in the Hensarling bill," he added, referring to a bill favored by House Republicans he has advised on.

Analyst: Trump Administration Could Rescind AIG, Prudential  Sifi' Tags

A Trump administration could rescind the "systemically important financial institution" labels from American International Group Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc., Capital Alpha Partners analyst Ian Katz said in a note to clients. The tag, applied under the Obama administration to the two large insurance companies, comes with stricter oversight from the Fed. Mr. Trump will have the power to appoint a Treasury Secretary and regulators who vote every year on the designations. These new appointees may take months to act, but will probably eventually look to deregulate the large insurers, Mr. Katz said. (Ryan.tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

Election Leaves Future of Fed's Tarullo Uncertain

Of all the financial regulators whose moves will be watched in the coming months, one of the most important will be Fed governor Daniel Tarullo. The architect of the central bank's regulatory policy for the last eight years now sees those policies in jeopardy. A Trump administration could appoint regulators who want to tear them down. Will Mr. Tarullo retire? Could he stick around longer into his term, which ends in 2022, to fight to preserve his legacy? A Fed spokesman had no comment Wednesday. (ryan.tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

Credit Unions Bid to Reduce Regulation

The head of a trade group for U.S. credit unions said in an email to its members Wednesday morning that he was "launching credit unions' attack to reduce regulatory burden now." Investors have bid up the shares of bank stocks following Donald Trump's win partially because of an expected rollback of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which may also benefit credit unions, too. Jim Nussle, president of the Credit Union National Association, added in the email that credit unions spent "upward of $7 billion" on "excessive" regulatory demands and that he would work with President Trump ease those costs. (peter.rudegeair@wsj.com; @rudegeair)

Financial Analyst Warns "Dodd-Frank Done For"

A top financial analyst on Wednesday warns that the 2010 regulatory reform law signed into law by President Obama will be unwound under President-elect Donald Trump. "Dodd-Frank is done for," Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner of the policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc. wrote clients. "Although the law is the law and will only change over time, its systemic, structural assumptions are as smashed as those behind post-crisis Federal Reserve policy." In her post-election forecast, Ms. Petrou said U.S. banks will face the "most acute political challenge" next year with populists forces on both sides of the aisle. She also believes Republicans will seek to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Stability Oversight Council through administration action and then by law. (donna.borak@wsj.com, @donnaborak)

Dodd-Frank Under Pressure: FSOC Challenged -- Capital Alpha's Katz

"One of the key questions is how far Republicans will go to gut Dodd-Frank," writes Ian Katz of Capital Alpha Partners. "We would expect a move to either eliminate or severely restrict the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council," as well as a attempt to raise "the $50 billion threshold that makes banks systemically important and subjects them to Federal Reserve oversight." Even with the GOP victory, he says, it's unclear they have enough votes in the Senate to pass those rules -- or how much banks, heavily invested in Dodd-Frank compliance, want dramatic changes. (jacob.schlesinger@wsj.com)

Big Policy, Personnel Changes in Store At CFTC

Donald Trump's victory Tuesday means J. Christopher Giancarlo, the sole Republican member of the CFTC who has spent much of his two-year tenure at the top U.S. swaps regulator as a voice of dissent, will likely become the regulator's acting chairman by mid-January. It also means a series of Democratic-backed regulatory initiatives, such as a proposal to rein in high-frequency trading firms, will be significantly scaled back or scrapped altogether, according to regulatory sources. (andrew.ackerman@wsj.com; @amacker)

Financial Trade Group Urges Donald Trump To Improve U.S. Economy, Innovation

The Financial Services Roundtable on Wednesday pressed President-elect Donald Trump to "act swiftly" to propose new policies to improve the U.S. economy and protect both consumers and taxpayers. "Our country faces big challenges, but it also has incredible opportunities for innovation and growth," said Tim Pawlenty, chief executive of the trade group, which represents 100 of the biggest U.S. financial firms, in a statement. Top priorities for the trade include: regulatory transparency, housing finance reform and cybersecurity. (donna.borak@wsj.com, @donnaborak)

SEC Agenda In Doubt, "Victory For Asset Managers" -- FBR's Mills

The Republican sweep Tuesday "changes the balance of power" at the Securities and Exchange Commission, writes Edward Mills of FBR & Co. This comes as the agency "is pursuing a variety of rules related to the asset management industry," which are now in doubt. "A Trump victory changes the balance of power at the Commission, likely ending this effort, a victory for asset managers," he adds. (jacob.schlesinger@wsj.com)

Trump Win Heralds Weaker CFPB, Possible Fannie Privatization, Mixed Bag for Banks -- Cowen's Seiberg

The clean Republican sweep in Tuesday's elections is "a clear positive for consumer banking" as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau likely "will be weaker," writes Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Washington Research Group. The election also "has to open the door for the government to return Fannie and Freddie to private ownership." Dodd-Frank, he predicts "will not disappear but it will become less onerous for big banks." Yet he sees the new GOP as "pro-business," not pro-mega bank," and risks remain for higher capital requirements and "a modern version of the Glass-Steagall Act." (jacob.schlesinger@wsj.com)

What a Trump Presidency Means for Chinese Financial Regulation

What impact a Trump presidency will have on Chinese financial regulation likely depends on the two countries trade ties. Mr. Trump has pledged to raise both import and export tariffs on China, a major U.S. trading partner. Such moves could weigh on China's economy and get leaders here evermore focused on a growth agenda, away from their reform goals, says Jonas Short, policy analyst at NSBO Research in Beijing. But, "I must stress that that's a worst case scenario... Beyond trade, China is more sheltered than people think from global events. If market sentiment is weak, then the [People's Bank of China] is likely to add more liquidity through discreet operations... but I doubt China's financial risk policy will change as that is clearly a long-term goal from the very most senior members of government," he adds.

US
Analysts on Trump Administration: Less Regulation, With a Measure of Uncertainty; Trump White House, GOP Congress seen scaling back Dodd-Frank, ousting CFPB Director Cordray

WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory left Wall Street analysts scurrying to assess how a Republican administration with a Republican-led Congress might oversee financial institutions.

Throughout the 2016 election, Mr. Trump has sidestepped the subject of regulating Wall Street, limiting his remarks to closing the carried-interest tax loophole and temporarily freezing all new agency rules. The New York businessman has repeatedly said he would "http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-took-aim-at-dodd-frank-on-the-stump-1478691726", but hasn't offered details on what would replace it.

Financial services analysts widely predicted a Trump White House and a GOP Congress would scale back Dodd-Frank, and open the door to a "break up the banks" bill pitched as regulatory relief for community banks.

"Dodd-Frank is done for," Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics Inc., wrote to clients in her postelection forecast on Wednesday. "Although the law is the law and will only change over time, its systemic, structural assumptions are as smashed as those behind postcrisis Federal Reserve policy."

KBW Inc. analyst Brian Gardner doesn't see Republicans fully unraveling Dodd-Frank, largely because it will be difficult to move such legislation through the Senate, where Democrats will hold 47 seats enough to block legislation. "Chances for wholesale changes" to Dodd-Frank "are still low," he wrote to clients. "Consensus will be the only way to pass bills."

Large U.S. banks are likely to face the "most acute political challenge" from populist forces on both sides of the aisle, Ms. Petrou wrote. Mr. Gardner suggested there is support for legislation to give smaller-size banks some regulatory relief, but he warned that could be "a vehicle for a  break up the banks' bill," which Mr. Trump has said he would support.

A number of analysts predicted that newly empowered Republicans will take steps to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, including ousting Director Richard Cordray next year. A federal appeals court ruling in October opened the door for the next president to remove the bureau's director at will and closely supervise and direct the agency.

"Our sense is that president-elect Trump could choose to dismiss Director Cordray and fill the post with someone more ideologically aligned with his world view," Isaac Boltansky, an analyst for Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, an investment firm focused on the financial-services sector, wrote in a note to clients.

Two potential candidates to head the consumer watchdog agency under a Trump administration are Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer, who didn't run for re-election, and Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.

A Trump administration is also likely to delay, rewrite or scrap the Labor Department's fiduciary rule, analysts predict. The rule requires advisers to act in their clients' best interests when making recommendations on retirement accounts. Doing so, Mr. Gardner writes would be a net positive for brokers, life insurers and asset managers.

"There is now a path for Congress to block the rule in addition to Trump acting unilaterally to freeze it," Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote to clients.

Still, he cautioned that firms must prepare for the new rules until any changes are made, which wouldn't happen any earlier than February. He also noted that a number of Republican lawmakers have advocated for the Securities and Exchange Commission to require all financial advisers to act in the best interests of clients.

"That would suggest there will be a replacement that imposes this standard without the same litigation threat as the Fiduciary Duty rule," Mr. Seiberg wrote.

Staples Tests Technology

Staples Inc. is ready to test a technology that lets companies order office supplies by voice.

Developers and e-commerce experts at the company worked with International Business Machine Corp.'s Watson artificial intelligence system to build the Easy System, which Staples expects to test with customers before the end of the year.

The retailer joins a range of large companies, including Facebook Inc., Automatic Data Processing Inc., and Humana Inc., using AI to build intelligent software agents that understand natural language and field multifaceted requests. Some see bots as the next user interface beyond swiping and clicking. Staples, for example, wants to let business customers order supplies that it may not carry, offering to find and deliver such products, said Faisal Masud, executive vice president of global e-commerce at the office-supply retailer.

The Easy System users initiate by pressing a red "easy" button is designed to learn with each interaction, said Mr. Masud. The cognitive computing scheme behind Watson lets Staples' algorithms learn the habits of individual customers. Eventually, for example, the system will understand that a customer's reference to "blue pens" means an 18-pack of Pentel ballpoints.

Staples uses application programming interfaces to connect its inventory and ordering systems to Watson, via IBM cloud technology. The system checks contracts and business processes set up for each customer to ensure an order meets appropriate approvals, he said. If an order exceeds a spending threshold, for example, it could be routed by text or email to a supervisor for an override.

If there is an issue the Easy System can't resolve, it will automatically invoke a live link to a human customer-service agent.

Parent of News-Aggregation App Toutiao Seeks $10 Billion Valuation; Beijing Bytedance Technology considers raising about $1 billion in latest funding round

HONG KONG Investors are considering hanging a valuation of more than $10 billion on a highflying news-aggregation app known as Toutiao that has quickly become one of the hottest startups in China.

The news app's parent company, Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., is considering raising about $1 billion in its latest round, according to people familiar with the situation. The new valuation target of more than $10 billion, including the fresh funds for Beijing Bytedance, is a sign of the company's rapid progress after it was valued at just $500 million in June 2014.

Bytedance has started discussions with potential investors about the new fundraising round, but the situation remains fluid and terms could change as the company negotiates with prospective investors.

The Chinese startup's new fundraising bucks a trend of slowing appetite among investors for putting money into the industry. Investment in startups backed by venture capital fell 14% globally to $24.1 billion in the third quarter from the previous quarter, according to KPMG LLP. That was the lowest quarterly funding total since the third quarter of 2014. In China, venture-capital investments fell by nearly one-third to $3.9 billion in the third quarter from the second, KPMG said.

Toutiao, or "headlines" in Chinese, is a personalized news app that pulls together customized third-party content for users based on their interests. It does this by analyzing data taken from users' social-networking accounts, and keeps tabs on a user's interaction with the app so content becomes more tailored.

The bulk of Toutiao's revenue comes from advertising. Toutiao offers targeted advertising, and the company is able to use data analytics to break down user segments by age, location and interest. This allows advertisers to reach very specific consumer segments, according to a company presentation. Toutiao declined to provide revenue figures.

In September, Toutiao struck a partnership with Chinese e-commerce website JD.com that enables Toutiao users to directly browse and pay for products on the shopping site via the app. JD.com and its online merchants will also benefit from Toutiao's targeted advertising service, the companies said at the time.

The fresh funding round could come in handy as Bytedance seeks to expand overseas. Apart from Toutiao, the company also owns an English-language news app called TopBuzz and it led a $25 million funding round in October for Indian news aggregator Dailyhunt. It is also considering expanding into markets including the U.S., Brazil and Japan.

Its most recent publicly announced funding round was in June 2014, when Nasdaq-listed microblogging service Weibo Corp. invested in Toutiao. The tie-up gave the news aggregator greater access to Weibo's data trove. That round valued the company at $500 million. The company's other existing investors include venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital China and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, who made his name with early bets on Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc.

Toutiao recently scored a high-profile hire when it reeled in Liu Zhen, Uber Technologies Inc.'s former China strategy chief. She joined the Beijing-based startup's senior management ranks in October, according to a company spokesman. Ms. Liu joined after China's homegrown ride-hailing champion, Didi Chuxing Technology Co., "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403".

Toutiao was founded by 33-year-old serial entrepreneur Zhang Yiming in March 2012. As of Oct. 31, Toutiao claimed it had activated 600 million users and said it serves 66 million daily active users.

Business News: SoftBank Seeks to Ease Its Debt Load

By Alexander Martin

TOKYO -- SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said Monday he would ease SoftBank's debt load by using a $100 billion fund he is establishing with other investors as his vehicle for large investments.

The comments by Mr. Son break with his longstanding willingness to use SoftBank's own funds for large investments such as Sprint Corp., the unprofitable U.S. wireless carrier SoftBank bought for $22 billion in 2013.

Last month, SoftBank said it would join Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to create the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund.

SoftBank is set to provide around $25 billion, while the Saudi fund said it was looking to contribute up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank said it was in talks with several potential investors to provide the rest of the war chest.

"From now on, investments that exceed tens of billions of yen will in principle be made through the investment fund. SoftBank will be insulated from risk," Mr. Son said.

He said the company aimed to lower its debt relative to operating cash flow. As of Sept. 30, SoftBank had 10.7 trillion yen ($102.42 billion) in net interest-bearing debt.

Mr. Son said the new fund would help SoftBank stay ahead in a future where artificial intelligence and the so-called Internet of Things dominate everyday life, thanks to the rapid evolution of processors.

He described SoftBank's recent $32 billion acquisition of British chip maker ARM Holdings PLC as the first step in what he described as "SoftBank 2.0." But SoftBank had too much debt to continue investing at this pace, he said.

"How do we remain aggressive while improving our balance sheet? The answer is the SoftBank Vision Fund," he said.

Mr. Son's comments came as SoftBank reported solid earnings, thanks to its strong domestic mobile-phone business. Turnaround efforts appear to be taking root at Sprint, which last month reported a narrower loss in the latest quarter.

Sprint continued to add customers and posted year-to-year revenue growth for the first time since its takeover by SoftBank.

For the July-September quarter, SoftBank posted a net profit of 512 billion yen, compared with 213 billion yen the year before, boosted by gains from the sale of stakes in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Finnish game maker Supercell Oy. Revenue fell slightly to 2.14 trillion yen.

Investors bet against Mexico in case Trump wins; INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Three-quarters of the assets of BlackRock's ETF are being shorted

Investors have placed bets worth around $745m that Mexico's stock market will fall in the closing days of the US presidential race as opinion polls suggest Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton 's lead over Donald Trump , the Republican candidate, has narrowed.

The bets against the Mexican stock market have come via BlackRock's $1bn Mexico exchange traded fund. Approximately three-quarters of the ETF's assets are being shorted, suggesting some investors are preparing for a Trump win .

Around 80 per cent of Mexico's exports go to the US. The economy is expected to suffer if Mr Trump wins the White House, due to his protectionist trade and immigration policies.

The ETF bets against the Mexican stock market increased substantially following the FBI's decision to open a new probe into Mrs Clinton's use of a personal email server during her time as secretary of state.

"We have seen a big surge of demand for [Mexico bets via this ETF] in recent weeks," said Simon Colvin, a senior researcher at Markit, a data provider in London.

The price of the iShares ETF has declined around 6.7 per cent over the past two weeks, tracking the Mexican stock market in US dollar terms.

"[The ETF] and Trump's polling numbers have been moving in tandem," added Matthew Unterman, a director at S3 Partners, a US-based financial analytics provider.

Mr Unterman said that bets against Mexico's stock market via the ETF had shrunk in the first half of 2016 to around $315m by mid-June, coinciding with weakness in Mr Trump's ratings. But as support for Mr Trump rose in the second half of the year, so too did the short positions against Mexican equities.

Investors have pulled around $1.2bn in the first nine months of this year from the 30 Mexico ETFs listed in the US and on the domestic Mexico stock market, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy. Assets held in the 30 ETFs stood at $3.9bn at the end of September.

Volatility in the Mexican currency has also reached a five-year high, mirroring the twists and turns of the US presidential campaign.

Edward Glossop, a Latin America analyst at Capital Economics, a London-based consultancy, said victory for Mr Trump would have "significant repercussions" for Mexico, but a weaker peso should help to cushion the economy from the worst effects.

"The manufacturing sector and the states in the north-east where industrial activity is most concentrated would clearly have the most to lose. But the tourism sector should benefit from a weaker peso," said Mr Glossop.

Who will win tomorrow s US election? According to Mexico s peso and stocks, Hillary Clinton is home and dry.

The peso, which has been a top barometer of election sentiment in recent months and is widely used as a proxy for emerging market risk, rallied 2.2 per cent to 18.6 per greenback on news over the weekend that the FBI has found nothing new in its 11th-hour investigation of Mrs Clinton s emails.

The stock market joined in the party: Mexico s blue-chip IPC index was around 2.6 per cent higher on Monday, the biggest one-day jump since late January, writes Jude Webber in Mexico City.

Mexican exchange traded funds also bounced back sharply: the US-listed iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF, which has been used by foreign investors to use as a proxy to bet on the Mexican equity market, jumped more than 5 per cent to 51.82   its biggest one day advance in nearly five years. That jump takes the ETF back above the level it was sitting at prior to the FBI s shock announcement on October 28 that it was opening a new investigation into Mrs Clinton s use of a private email server.

But has the market jumped the gun? What if Donald Trump triumphs tomorrow? What then?

Capital Economics is warning that the central bank might have to hike rates by a massive 100 to 200 basis points to steady the peso, which some in the market predict could crash to as low as 25 to the dollar on a Trump win.

To put that in perspective, Banxico has raised rates by 125 basis points in total since last December   including an extraordinary 50-point increase in February that was out of the usual calendar of policy meetings.

In the event of a Trump victory we would expect the central bank to react by hiking interest rates to support the peso, probably at an emergency meeting as soon as Wednesday morning. Banxico has past form in this regard. It held an emergency meeting in February when the peso was depreciating sharply and hiked interest rates by 50bp. It also held an impromptu press conference in the immediate aftermath of the UK s vote to leave the European Union in June, when the peso sold off again, at which Governor Carstens strongly hinted they would use the scheduled policy meeting in the following week to raise interest rates   the policy rate was then hiked by a further 50bp at that meeting. The exact size of the increase in interest rates this time around would depend on just how far the peso falls. But we suspect a hike in the region of 100-200bp, from 4.75% now, would be needed to provide meaningful support to the currency.

There seems to be a bit of a difference of opinion among Mexican policymakers about what to do. Agustn Carstens, the central bank chief, appears to think action is unavoidable   in recent days he has talked about a contingency plan being readied. Jos Antonio Meade, the finance minister, has played down such suggestions however, saying Mexicans would not need to wake up to a  precipitous  government reaction on Wednesday.

Mr Carstens has, in recent months, played down the prospect of more off-calendar emergency rate rises, but then, he has also likened Mr Trump to a hurricane for Mexico s economy. Banxico s next scheduled policy meeting is on November 17 and Capital Economics reckoned Mexico could follow up with a second post-election hike if the peso remained under pressure.

Capital flight and heightened uncertainty would weigh on growth and could well tip Mexico into recession, warned Alfredo Coutio, director for Latin America at Moody s Analytics USA. If that happened, he also saw the need for a fiscal and monetary policy to be tightened  more severely  and suggested more drastic budget cuts, higher taxes and the acceleration of some privatisations.

Higher rates, meanwhile, would squeeze Mexico s already unstellar economic growth and would  take the steam out of the services sector  which has been driving growth for the past year, Capital Economics said.

That picture for Mexico is not pretty. The markets want to believe there is no risk of that any more. We shall see.

Add to Cart: Warehouses Are Hot Property Thanks to Internet Shopping; Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund will pay $2.66 billion for P3 Logistic Parks and its warehouses, a sector that is thriving thanks to internet shopping

Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund has agreed to pay  ¬2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) for a portfolio of European warehouses, a sector that is thriving as investors bet on internet shopping.

GIC Pte. will buy P3 Logistic Parks, which owns and manages 163 warehouses in nine countries, from private-equity firm TPG Capital and Ivanho Cambridge, the property arm of Quebec's state pension fund, the firms said in a joint statement on Monday.

With online shoppers expecting quick deliveries, industrial warehouses have become increasingly important to retailers. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/etfs-load-up-on-real-estate-1478487720" have noticed.

The sale of P3 is one of the biggest "http://www.wsj.com/public/page/news-real-estate-commercial.html"in Europe this year.

And while transactions involving industrial property fell in the U.K. and Germany in the first nine months of this year compared with the 2015 period, they remain above their long-term average, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics. Transactions rose in smaller economies such as the Netherlands, Italy and Norway.

A big draw of warehouses over office towers is that the returns are better. The average capitalization rate a measure of income on property for European warehouses was 6.5% in the third quarter, compared with 5.9% for retail properties, Real Capital data show.

In addition to returns, the limited number of high-quality warehouses in Europe and the increasing need for them has bolstered demand, according to Anand Tejani, partner at TPG Real Estate.

"The e-commerce thing is real," Mr. Tejani said. "If you start to think about major companies like Amazon needing to deliver to consumers in a matter of hours, that highlights the important role that these warehouses are playing."

This isn't GIC's first foray into industrials. In 2014, the sovereign-wealth fund bought IndCor Properties, a U.S. warehouse platform, from Blackstone Group LP for $8.1 billion.

Blackstone has built another industrial property company in Europe. Logicor, set up in 2012, owns 660 warehouses in 18 European countries.

The company has hired two banks, one to explore the sale of the business and the other to study an initial public offering, a person familiar with the matter said.

Formerly niche real-estate sectors have been moving toward the mainstream. Historically, offices and shopping malls were the mainstays of property investors. They remain far larger sectors in terms of invested capital.

But warehouses, student housing, care homes and even garden centers have gained traction in recent years.

As investors pile in, returns have fallen. For instance, the return on European warehouses in 2013 was about 2% more than shopping malls, whereas that figure is now just 0.6% more, Real Capital data show.

It isn't just real estate that has crept higher on the wish list for global investors. Demand for other alternative assets, such as private equity, has been surging.

Ultralow interest rates and loose monetary policies at central banks around the world have sent returns on assets such as bonds lower, making alternative assets more attractive.

TPG and Ivanho Cambridge bought P3 in 2013. Since then, the firm has doubled in size, the joint statement said.

"We are confident of the long-term potential of the European logistics sector, and look forward to expanding this attractive platform," said Lee Kok Sun, chief investment officer at GIC Real Estate.

Draper Venture Network to Offer LPs Direct Investments in its Growth-Stage Companies

The Draper Venture Network, a global group of funds that includes Tim Draper's Draper Associates, is launching a program to give limited partners, including those outside the network, an opportunity to invest in later rounds for some of its most-promising companies.

The idea is to syndicate deals for six to 10 companies during the next year that are raising growth capital in later-stage rounds mostly larger than $30 million. Shares for DVN Select investors would come mainly from pro rata investment rights that network venture firms, who are mainly early-stage investors, can't fully execute. The companies might offer additional shares to DVN Select participants.

"The vision for the Draper Venture Network is to eventually form a different kind of fund, a  meta-fund' that contributes capital to its member VCs and to double down on the best companies in their portfolios," Mr. Draper said in an email.

DVN named six companies participating in the program, including home-services marketplace Thumbtack Inc., backed by Draper Associates. The others are data analytics specialist Ayasdi Inc., Middle Eastern ride-hailing company Careem FZ LLC, cybersecurity startup Cylance Inc., fashion website Lyst Ltd. and business-reviews site Trustpilot Inc. They are planning to raise capital in the next one to 10 months, according to Gabe Turner, the network's director.

Co-investing is popular in private equity but limited partners need the capability to independently evaluate deals quickly, something many lack, especially small endowments and family offices. Special purpose vehicles that enable VCs to syndicate pro rata rights in later rounds have "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFPEA0120150202eb22f5vu9" in the past several years.

"Through this program, investors get access to unique investment opportunities that are pre-emptively sourced by some of the best fund managers internationally," Mr. Draper said. "Since we are doing this deal-by-deal, they can participate only in companies that are compelling for them."

Mr. Draper said LPs in network funds increasingly want to invest directly in companies with a high probability of staging a successful exit within two years. Most have little exposure to later-stage companies through DVN funds. The program also gives investors the opportunity to invest in companies internationally.

For companies, DVN Select is advantageous because it broadens their investor base, Mr. Draper said.

Investors pay a 3% administrative charge to participate in each deal. Carried interest is waved for network LPs, but from outsiders DVN stands to collect a 10% carry, which rises to 20% if performance of the investment is 3X or greater.

DVN is launching the program at an LP meeting on Tuesday. The network has nine member firms. Besides Draper Associates they are 3TS Capital Partners, Dalus Capital, Draper Athena, Draper Esprit, Draper Nexus Ventures, Draper Triangle, Wamda Capital and Wavemaker Partners.

The network has been around since the early 1990s but "http://www.wsj.com/articles/garlands-take-drapers-global-vc-network-rides-on-1466422204" three years ago and is looking to expand.

GTCR said it acquired RevSpring Inc., which provides billing and communications services to the health-care and financial services sectors.

The Chicago firm also announced it will commit up to an additional $400 million of equity to the company for its growth. Other terms of the deal, including the purchase price for RevSpring, weren't disclosed in a news release.

Wixom, Mich.-based RevSpring provides a payment technology platform, which includes revenue cycle management for health-care customers and online negotiation and bill payment technology for financial services businesses.

Aaron Cohen, a managing director at GTCR, said the firm purchased RevSpring from CIP Capital, which exited its investment as a result of the deal. CIP first invested in a company that would become RevSpring in 2011, according to the firm's website.

Mr. Cohen said GTCR will target acquisitions of various sizes to expand the business. In terms of potential tuck-in deals, the firm will look to purchase companies in the software and data analytics spaces, especially those centered on the health-care billing process.

Along with tuck-ins, Mr. Cohen said there are "a couple" of larger potential transformational deals, including mergers, that could be a good fit for the company. He added that the firm has helped its previous platform companies to make both tuck-ins of between $20 million and $50 million in size and larger buys that sometimes eclipsed the size of the original deal.

CIP Partners, formerly known as Compass Investment Partners, in August 2012 formed RevSpring by combining its portfolio company Dantom Systems Inc., which provides outsourced document management and customized data services to the revenue cycle management markets, with PSC Info Group, which makes technology-enabled tools for consumer payments, according to a news release at the time.

Jefferies LLC, Madison Capital, Newstone Capital Partners and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. provided financing for GTCR's RevSpring deal, according to the release.

GTCR makes investments in such sectors as financial services and technology; health care; technology, media and communications; and business services. The firm last month exited its investment in aviation software company Camp Systems International Inc., in a sale to media giant Hearst Communications Inc. A person familiar with the transaction told WSJ Pro Private Equity the deal was valued at $2 billion.

CIP Capital invests in businesses within the health-care, software-as-a-service, data and analytics, compliance and energy sectors. The New York firm invests $50 million to more than $200 million in companies with revenue between $25 million to $125 million-plus and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $7 million to more than $20 million, according to the firm's website.

Investors have placed bets worth around $745m that Mexico s stock market will fall in the closing days of the US presidential race as "https://ig.ft.com/us-elections/polls" suggest Democratic candidate "https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Hillary_Clinton" s lead over "https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Donald_Trump", the Republican candidate, has narrowed.

The bets against the Mexican stock market have come via BlackRock s $1bn "https://www.ft.com/topics/places/Mexico" exchange traded fund. Approximately three-quarters of the ETF s assets are being shorted, suggesting some investors are preparing for a Trump win.

Around 80 per cent of Mexico s exports go to the US. The Latin American economy is expected to suffer if Mr Trump wins the White House, due to his protectionist trade and immigration policies.

The ETF bets against the Mexican stock market increased substantially following the FBI s decision to open a new probe into Mrs Clinton s use of a personal email server during her time as secretary of state.

 We have seen a big surge of demand for [Mexico bets via this ETF] in recent weeks,  said Simon Colvin, a senior researcher at Markit, a data provider in London.

The price of the iShares ETF has declined around 6.7 per cent over the past two weeks, tracking the Mexican stock market in US dollar terms.

 [The ETF] and Mr Trump s polling numbers have been moving in tandem,  added Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a New York-based financial analytics provider.

Mr Dusaniwsky said that bets against Mexico s stock market via the ETF had shrunk in the first half of 2016 to around $315m by mid-June, coinciding with weakness in Mr Trump s ratings. But as support for Mr Trump rose in the second half of the year, so too did the short positions against Mexican equities.

Investors have pulled around $1.2bn in the first nine months of this year from the 30 Mexico ETFs listed in the US and on the domestic Mexico stock market, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy. Assets held in the 30 ETFs stood at $3.9bn at the end of September.

Volatility in the Mexican currency has also reached a five-year high, mirroring the twists and turns of the US presidential campaign.

Edward Glossop, a Latin America analyst at Capital Economics, a London-based consultancy, said victory for Mr Trump would have  significant repercussions  for Mexico, but a weaker peso should help to cushion the economy from the worst effects.

 The manufacturing sector and the states in the north-east where industrial activity is most concentrated would clearly have the most to lose. But the tourism sector should benefit from a weaker peso,  said Mr Glossop.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Are your online accounts safe with biometrics?

Fake fingerprints, selfie masks and voice tapping mean the wealthy should be worried by the latest mobile methods of accessing money. Martin Arnold and Hugo Greenhalgh report

Anyone who has struggled to remember the password for their banking app or fumbled with a card-reading device can appreciate the sheer joy of using their fingerprint, voice or face to access their bank account quickly via their smartphone.

Most big high street lenders now use the latest biometric technology to give customers a more convenient way to check their account balance or make payments. However, a big question remains unanswered: is it safe?

A cyber security expert from consultancy NCC recently visited the Financial Times to give a demonstration of how to hack into a smartphone's biometric authentication software.

Matt Lewis, NCC research director, showed how to make a copy of his own fingerprint using wood glue, candle wax and a printed circuit board that allowed your correspondent to hack into his smartphone.

He also tricked voice-recognition software by playing back recordings of his own voice and produced a 3D-printed mask of his face based on photos of himself, which was then worn by your correspondent to hack into his phone.

While you cannot forget your voice or face - making them a simpler way to check your identity - they are also much harder to change than your password if they are ever stolen by cybercriminals. This means that if biometrics becomes the dominant form of authentication it is likely to be much more damaging if the systems are hacked.

As more financial service providers launch biometric identity-checking schemes - such as MasterCard's so-called "selfie pay" service that lets people make mobile payments by photographing themselves, Wells Fargo's eye vein scanning system, or HSBC's Voice ID - experts say security will be a more pressing issue.

" Biometrics aren't the same as passwords - they aren't secret," says Mr Lewis, a former technology specialist at GCHQ, the government's electronic intelligence agency. "You need other elements to ensure fraud is prevented. If a database of fingerprints is hacked into, that could compound the problem."

Batten the hatches

Cyber security has already shot to the top of the boardroom agenda for banks, particularly after 76m customers at JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank, were shocked to learn that some of their personal data were stolen two years ago.

The seriousness of this threat was underpinned by one of the biggest bank robberies in history, carried out by cyber thieves in an audacious raid on the Bangladesh central bank in February. The crooks made off with $81m that was on deposit at the US Federal Reserve.

"It is a very intimate game between organised crime innovating attack methods and the banks coming up with defences against these," says David Ferbrache, technical director at KPMG and former head of cyber and space for the UK ministry of defence.

He reckons that organised crime groups are making so much money from hacking traditional password-based bank systems, that for now they will be in no rush to switch their attention to the challenge of cracking biometric controls. "But over time they will start to spend more time looking at biometric identity."

Most UK banks allow customers to log on to accounts using their smartphone's fingerprint reader. This has the advantage of keeping the biometric data on the phone, rather than stored centrally by the bank on a database that could become a target for hackers.

Robert Capps at NuData, which tracks people's behaviour through their phone to authenticate them, says most biometric checks are no safer than a traditional password. If hackers gain access to your password, they can set up a new mobile account pretending to be you. "It all comes down to the enrolment process - and that is back to the username and password," he says. "This is not the great panacea."

Several big financial institutions are now focusing on voice-recognition systems to identify their customers. Unlike phone-based fingerprint scans, these typically involve a customer's digital "voiceprint" being stored by a bank and used to verify who they are when they call.

Voicing the issue

Voice biometrics has a long history. The concept can be traced back to Alexander Melville Bell, father of Alexander Graham, who in 1867 published a book called Visible Speech, The Science Of Universal Alphabetics: Or Self-Interpreting Physiological Letters . Bell's focused not so much on the spoken word, but on how they were said.

Further developments by Russia and the US saw voice biometrics gain greater traction - and accuracy - in the 1970s and 1980s, but a series of false starts meant that the technology has not been widely adopted until today.

Now it is set to become big business - and not just for the banks. Research by Tractica, the market intelligence firm, suggests that revenues from voice biometrics could top $5bn by 2024, up from just $245m in 2015. It sees the greatest adoption among consumers using their mobile phones, as well as benefits for call centres and healthcare providers.

Other banks, such as Capital One, are using voice technology to enhance their services: its customers can now check balances and pay off credit card bills by speaking to Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant, which sits on voice command devices such as Echo.

But the telephone is also a popular medium for fraudsters. According to Financial Fraud Action UK, British consumers and financial institutions lost more than 750m over the course of last year - a jump of 26 per cent from 2014. Telephone banking fraud almost doubled over the same period, up by 92 per cent to 32.3m.

One out of every 2,500 calls to call centres run by banks and other financial services companies is fraudulent, data from Infiniti Research recently revealed.

How it works

The technology has improved greatly in recent years. Gone are the frustrations of repeatedly saying "yes" or "no" into an automated system that cannot understand your accent. Today's programmes can determine who is speaking as well as working out what they're saying.

There are nonetheless different technical approaches. Lloyds has agreed a deal with Pindrop, a voice fraud prevention and authentication company, to offer what the tech firm calls " phoneprinting " to its customers from the beginning of December.

This is not technically biometrics, but works in a similar fashion. The customer makes a call, and the programme analyses 147 different call features that range from the type of phone you're using to the type of background noise. "It adds a layered picture - everything outside the voice," explains Matt Peachey of Pindrop.

The key function is to deter phone fraud and improve customer security by highlighting unusual activity. Lloyds intends to take a further step and introduce full voice biometrics by the summer of 2017.

HSBC has opted for technology that cross checks 100 unique characteristics of a person's voice - including speed of delivery, natural cadence or pronunciation - as well as certain physical aspects that listeners cannot discern, such as the shape of the customer's larynx or their nasal tracts.

"The technology measures the way your muscles produce the sound rather than the sound itself," explains Francesca McDonagh, head of retail banking and wealth management at HSBC. "It will then record a voice print - my voice is my password."

It is a development that will be welcomed by those with many online accounts and an array of passwords. But concerns have been raised over whether customers will be happy divulging this information. Will they really be happy for their bank to know the shape of their larynx?

"The key perceived disadvantage for customers relates to privacy," says Anthony Duffy, UK director of retail banking at Fujitsu. "Some individuals are not comfortable with organisations - particularly large companies - holding biometric data.

If the "nightmare scenario" is that a large depository of biometric data - such as fingerprints - could be stolen, something approaching this has already happened: last year, hackers stole 5.6m sets of fingerprints from the US Office of Personnel Management, which oversees civil servants in the federal government.

"If a customer is logging on to check their balance face-recognition may be enough, but for a high value transfer they may say it has to be multi-touch identification where both fingerprint and face are required," says George Avetisov of Hypr, a biometric data encryption company.

Andr Malinowski, head of international business at Computop, says biometrics will never be watertight and customers should always insist on a secondary ID measure, such as an old-school password or Pin. "[With biometrics] we are talking about something you cannot change. And if it is compromised, it is compromised."

Behavioural systems

Ultimately, making mobile banking convenient while reassuringly secure is likely to rely on even more sophisticated systems using hundreds of data points - from how fast we type to where we are - to build a unique profile that can be used to recognise us whenever we use our phone.

These behavioural biometric systems are being piloted by several banks and have the advantage of being much harder to fake while not being usable across multiple accounts of the same person. "Wind the clock forward five years and you will see a combination of behavioural biometrics and quite sophisticated analytics and risk -scoring on each transaction," says Mr Ferbrache at KPMG.

If they can crack the security problem once and for all, the potential for savings by the banks and other financial services providers is huge. For example, MasterCard, the payments processor, has spent $1bn on security over the past three years alone. "More than 50 per cent of the global fraud in our ecommerce business is digital," explains Ajay Bhalia, MasterCard president of global enterprise risk and security.

With more than 2bn cardholders, MasterCard is ramping up its defences against fraud, investing in voice technology, but also looking into security measures based on fingerprints, facial recognition, heartbeat technology, eye veins and irises. It is running a pilot scheme with ABN Amro in the Netherlands and is looking to roll it out to 12 European markets, including the UK, in early 2017.

The hassle factor

In strengthening the barriers to fraud, though, banks and card providers are exercising an unspoken trade-off between efficiency and security. Customers become frustrated if it takes too long to go through the authentication process; banks then lose custom as people just put the phone down.

Yet given how time-consuming most biometric hacking techniques appear to be - such as copying someone's fingerprint or making a mask from their photo - some experts believe they are likely only to be worth doing for targeted attacks on wealthy people.

Most banks and financial institutions will retain several hurdles for wealthier customers to clear before allowing them access to their accounts. It may be more hassle, but if it's a question of ensuring fraudsters do not have access to your money, it is a price many will be willing to pay.

"When it comes to protecting consumers from cyberthreats, the greatest challenge is balancing security with convenience," says Keiron Shepherd, senior security specialist at F5 Networks. "However, these often lie down divergent paths. Like all things in security, voice biometrics is not the silver bullet, but another tool to defend against cybercriminals."

Voice training

Why a strong accent shouldn't be a problem

What happens if my voice changes? Or I have a strong regional accent?

Siri, an automated voice recognition personal assistant introduced by Apple on its iPhone 4S back in 2011, struggled at first with regional accents. Tabloid journalists gleefully reported that one particularly salty Scottish phrase was repeated by Siri as "Eurobond bank" - not quite the intention of the speaker.

But voice recognition services - and Siri - have improved greatly. Biometrics covers more than just the spoken word; it delves into how these words are articulated.

"There have also been concerns that voice biometrics might be undermined by factors such as regional accents, background noise or people having colds," says Anthony Duffy, UK director of retail banking at Fujitsu. "However, the latest iterations of such software make such concerns redundant."

Indeed, the majority of them gauge factors such as inflection and intonation; and take into account your accent.

"It's a pot pourri of factors," says Bruce Bomphrey, sales and business development director at Soitron UK.

This means it will take account of regional accents - and learn the way in which you speak. And if you have a heavy cold, it will compensate for those factors, by matching variables other than intonation, for example.

Research is being conducted on whether this holds true for another group: those undergoing - or having completed - transitioning from female to male or vice versa.

"It's a question of whether [transitioning] could affect the fundamental aspects of the voice," says Dominic Watts, senior lecturer in forensic speech science at the University of York. "The length of the vocal tract shouldn't change, but I suppose the difference could be if somebody was seeking to develop a lower- or higher-pitched voice."

While that might affect whether the voice recognition software works, the solution is simple: re-record your voice password.

CenturyLink Inc. said it plans to sell its data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners for $2.3 billion, which it will use in part to fund its planned tie-up with Level 3 Communications Inc.

Under the terms of the agreement announced Friday, CenturyLink has agreed to sell the data centers and colocation business for $2.15 billion in cash. It will also receive a $150 million minority stake in the consortium's new global secure infrastructure company.

Shares rose 2.2% to $23.50 in premarket trading.

CenturyLink last week reached a $25 billion cash-and-stock deal to buy Level 3. The deal would turn CenturyLink which has grown from a small Louisiana phone provider by scooping up the former Qwest and Sprint Corp.'s landlines into an even more corporate-focused service provider. The combined company would also keep millions of home internet subscribers, most of whom use slower digital subscriber lines.

The consortium buying the data centers includes Medina Capital Advisors and Longview Asset Management.

Under terms of the agreement, the consortium led by BC Partners and Medina will assume ownership of CenturyLink's portfolio of 57 data centers, which includes about 195 megawatts of power.

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.

BC Partners and Medina also said Friday they agreed to acquire Brainspace Corp., a machine-learning and analytics company in Addison, Texas, as part of a new joint venture to create a cybersecurity company providing software, services and infrastructure.

The venture combines a portfolio of data centers and the associated colocation business to be acquired from CenturyLink, along with the acquisition of Medina's security and data analytics portfolio, according to a news release.

Hiring a woman as an investing partner still makes headlines in Silicon Valley in 2016.

Sequoia "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sequoia-adds-first-woman-to-its-u-s-investing-team-1476995607", and many of the largest firms still have no female or nonwhite partners. Now in a year in which the U.S. could elect Hillary Clinton as the first female president venture capitalists say diversity remains a low priority, according to a new survey.

Only 4% of those investors in the survey ranked diversity as one of their top concerns, citing economic conditions and portfolio-company revenue growth higher on the list, "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/startup-founders-investors-think-techs-diversity-solve-fairchild"

In 2014, Alphabet Inc.'s Google published its first diversity report, prompting a flurry of technology companies to follow suit. In 2015, Ellen Pao's gender-discrimination case against Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers proved to be a lightning rod in venture capital for a wider discussion about sexism on Sand Hill Road.

But 2016 seems to be the year that venture capitalists are more likely to tweet, "I'm with Her" than to create initiatives that would help them hire or invest in her. Indeed 63% of the venture capitalists surveyed by LinkedIn say they're unaware of any official initiatives to increase the diversity among founders in their portfolio or employees.

Silicon Valley has long prided itself on its breakneck pace of innovation and change. Venture firms that began investing in computers in the 1970s are today pouring millions into frontier technologies like artificial intelligence, space travel, augmented reality and robotics.

And yet the gender and racial makeup of venture capital's most prominent firms has barely budged. A recent survey from PitchBook Data Inc. shows women make up 6.3% of investment professionals with board seats at U.S. firms.

Venture capitalists told LinkedIn they believe close to 30% of the investment partners they hire in the next five years will be female and racially diverse. But as today's dismal diversity numbers show, the problem won't solve itself without action.

Almost half of the venture capitalists surveyed by LinkedIn say they faced a "pipeline" problem: Too few startups they look to invest in have diverse founders. Another 35% said they saw no obstacle at all, 7% said diverse founders don't seek them out as investors and 6% said diverse founders typically don't start the type of companies they traditionally invest in.

In the list of obstacles preventing venture capitalists from investing in startups with racially diverse or female founders, they left out a big one: apathy.

FANNIE MAE

Treasury to Receive $3 Billion Dividend

Fannie Mae said it would send a $3 billion dividend payment to the U.S. Treasury in December. It also reported that revenue declined in its latest quarter but profit soared due to accounting benefits and fluctuating interest rates.

The mortgage-finance company posted net income of $3.2 billion for the third quarter, up from $1.24 billion a year earlier. Revenue dropped 4.1% to $5.61 billion.

Fannie and Freddie's regulator and some lawmakers have expressed concern over their dwindling capital reserves. Under the terms of the companies' bailout agreement with the Treasury, they send profits above their established capital reserve to the government, but these buffers are slated to wind down to zero dollars by 2018. So far, that drop in reserves hasn't caused Fannie or Freddie to require more bailout money. Fannie reported net worth of $4.2 billion as of Sept 30.

Still, any blip in the housing market or volatility in the derivatives values could cause Fannie or Freddie to need taxpayer funds.

HSBC

French Prosecutors See Tax-Evasion Case

French prosecutors recommended that HSBC Holdings PLC should stand trial for allegedly helping people evade taxes in France, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

If French judges decide to follow prosecutors' advice, HSBC could stand trial in Paris in the first half of next year. The judges also could dismiss the case.

Prosecutors began investigating HSBC in 2014 as part of a widening probe into whether the bank helped recruit customers in France, possibly breaching laws authorizing only French-registered lenders to sign up customers in the country. The investigation also examined whether the bank was complicit in laundering the proceeds of any tax evasion.

"We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously," a spokeswoman for the British bank said Thursday.

S&P GLOBAL

Sale of J.D. Power Drives Up Profit

S&P Global Inc.'s bottom line more than tripled in the third quarter, boosted by the sale of J.D. Power, and the financial-information and analytics firm again raised its outlook for the year in anticipation of continued strong bond issuance.

S&P Global, formerly McGraw Hill Financial, reported third-quarter profit rose to $923 million, or $3.36 a share, from $281 million, or 92 cents, a year earlier.

Excluding a gain on the sale of J.D. Power and other items, adjusted earnings rose to $1.43 a share, topping analysts' expectations of $1.34. Revenue reached $1.44 billion, just above estimates.

For 2016, the company raised its adjusted earnings estimate to $5.15 to $5.25 a share based on strong year-to-date results.

CIO Journal: Developers, Companies Latch On to 'Chatbots'

By Kim S. Nash

Six months ago, Facebook Inc. said it would open its Messenger service, making it possible for businesses to build virtual assistants that can chat with the one billion-plus real people who use the communications platform each month.

Since then, developers have created more than 33,000 such "chatbots," which have icons and nicknames that at first glance might not appear that different from a friend or relative in a user's contact list.

Last month, MasterCard Inc. launched Kai, a bot for banks that makes it possible for Facebook Messenger users to check activity on their credit, debit and loan accounts and set up financial-management tools. Another Mastercard bot for merchants lets customers make purchases by sending a Facebook message and paying with Mastercard's digital wallet.

Such capabilities may be just the beginning for bots. A range of companies are betting that the convergence of messaging platforms, chatbots and increasingly powerful artificial intelligence will lead to the creation of a more natural interface between machines and humans.

"We are thinking of an intelligence center that will help you get to the right bot at the right time so you don't have to have a sea of icons that are sitting there that you don't know how to use," says Stan Chudnovsky, vice president and head of product for Messenger at Facebook.

Facebook is using its power to accelerate the growth of messaging and bots. In 2014, it pushed users to employ Messenger for direct messages, and the platform now has more than one billion users. That same year, Facebook acquired for $19 billion messaging service WhatsApp, which also now has one billion users.

April's debut of development tools for building Messenger bots has appealed to startups and established brands alike. Some users have complained that initial Facebook Messenger bots are slow, with limited conversational capabilities.

"There are growing pains," said Robin Chan, chief executive of Operator, a startup that makes shopping bots.

Facebook is meeting with developers and recently updated its tools to, for example, further customize conversation threads.

A Facebook user planning a vacation, for example, could send his criteria to Messenger, which would match the information to bots from travel-company partners. Partners would reply with offers. Some bots, learning the habits of their human masters, may anticipate work. "Your monthly golf date isn't yet scheduled. Would you like to call Kiawah Island?"

This is beyond today's simple bots that answer trivia questions or reorder laundry detergent based on data from prior purchases, says Roberto Masiero, senior vice president of innovation labs at Automatic Data Processing Inc.

"It's a tectonic shift in how we interact with computers," Mr. Masiero said.

Mr. Masiero predicts that bots will become the new interface for corporate software. Rather than launching individual software programs to change health benefits, say, or start a retirement account, employees could consult with bots that have learned their habits and use algorithms and machine learning to make suggestions, he said.

ADP software engineers are working with social anthropologists and copywriters to tinker with bot behavior. Tests show that for bots to earn human acceptance, they must not act too much like people or too much like computers.

Germany benefits as investors frown on UK; Property

Germany has overtaken the UK to become Europe's most popular destination for property investment since the Brexit vote.

More investment flowed into German than British real estate in the third quarter for the first time in four years, with  ¬13.6bn committed against  ¬10bn for the UK, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

Meanwhile, a survey of 800 leaders in Europe's property industry found that Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt were the top three prospects for real estate investment among European cities - with London ranked 27th.

The UK vote to leave the EU had prompted investors to reconsider whether British bricks and mortar could still be considered a haven, said the report by the Urban Land Institute and PwC, the professional services firm.

"The fallout from the Brexit vote gives an extra boost to the already-strong German real estate market," said Lisette van Doorn, ULI's European head.

"Many real estate investors are willing to sacrifice some yield in return for lower risk. In this risk-off environment, the stability of German cities becomes even more attractive."

Some 90 per cent of those surveyed said UK property values would decline in the coming year.

Real estate investment trusts in Germany and Scandinavia had risen to trade at premiums to the value of assets, a sign that investors felt their cash was safer there, the report said.

UK Reits are trading at discounts of about 20 per cent to net asset value, according to Jefferies.

Real estate investment is declining across Europe. The total value of transactions in the third quarter was down 38 per cent from a year earlier to  ¬46bn; investment into the UK dropped 51 per cent, according to the RCA figures.

The hunt for German investments had boosted smaller cities such as Leipzig, which had attracted more than  ¬1bn this year, RCA said.

Political turbulence was the main worry for property investors, according to the ULI/PwC survey.

UK surrenders top spot to Germany in European property investment

Germany has eclipsed the UK to become Europe s most popular destination for property investment since the Brexit vote.

In the third quarter of 2016, more investment flowed into German real estate than UK for the first time in four years. Some  ¬13.6bn was committed to the German market against  ¬10bn for the UK, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

Meanwhile, a survey of 800 leaders in Europe s property industry found that Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt were viewed as the top three prospects for real estate investment among European cities   with London languishing at number 27.

London s decline came after the UK s vote to leave the EU prompted investors to reconsider whether British bricks and mortar could still be considered a safe haven, the report by the Urban Land Institute and PwC, the professional services firm, found.

 The fallout from the Brexit vote gives an extra boost to the already-strong German real estate market,  said Lisette van Doorn, European chief executive of ULI.

 With considerable political and economic uncertainty in Europe, many real estate investors are willing to sacrifice some yield in return for lower risk. In this risk-off environment, the stability of German cities becomes even more attractive. 

Some 90 per cent of those surveyed said UK property values would decline in the coming year.

Meanwhile, real estate investment trusts in Germany and Scandinavia have risen since the Brexit vote to trade at premiums to the value of their assets, a sign that investors feel their cash is safer there, the report said.

In comparison, UK reits are trading at discounts of about 20 per cent to net asset value, according to Jefferies, the investment bank.

However, the shift in Germany s favour took place in a context of declining real estate investment across Europe. The total value of transactions in the third quarter was down 38 per cent from a year earlier, at  ¬46bn; investment into the UK dropped 51 per cent, according to the RCA figures.

Even as it took over the top spot, Germany saw a 34 per cent drop in real estate investment from a year earlier, although the previous year s total was boosted by corporate takeovers.

The hunt for German investments has helped boost smaller cities in the country: Leipzig, for example, has attracted more than  ¬1bn of investment so far this year, a record for the city, RCA said.

International political turbulence, including forthcoming elections in France and Germany, was the main worry among property investors, according to the ULI/PwC survey, along with concerns about migration and terrorism.

Analysts have also suggested that the current property cycle may have peaked. Prices for core real estate   the properties most in demand   are  considered too high in many markets , ULI said.

Companies Rally to Build Chatbots for Messaging Services; Banks, airlines and others are developing virtual-software assistants to interact like humans

Mr. Chudnovsky joined Facebook almost two years ago from PayPal Holdings Inc., where he was vice president of global strategy.

Mr. Chudnovsky has played a role in Silicon Valley since the 1990s, and has launched or helped fund startups sold to Monster Worldwide, Amazon.com Inc. and PayPal.

Facebook is using its power to accelerate the growth of messaging and bots. In 2014, it pushed users to employ Messenger for direct messages, and the platform now has more than one billion users. That same year, Facebook acquired for $19 billion WhatsApp messaging service, which also now has one billion users.

"There are growing pains," said Robin Chan, chief executive of Operator, a startup that makes shopping bots.

Facebook is meeting with developers and recently updated its tools to, for example, further customize conversation threads. "It's very early days for bots," Mr. Chudnovsky said. He predicts that within perhaps two years, people and bots powered by artificial intelligence will conduct complex dialogs.

A Facebook user planning a vacation, for example, could send his criteria to Messenger, which would match the information to bots from travel-company partners. Partners would reply with offers.

The goal for many companies is to build intelligent software agents that understand natural language and field multifaceted requests such as, "Help me rent a car in Philadelphia two Saturdays from now." Some bots, learning the habits of their human masters, may anticipate work. "Your monthly golf date isn't yet scheduled. Would you like to call Kiawah Island?"

This is beyond today's simple bots that answer trivia questions or reorder laundry detergent based on data from prior purchases, says Roberto Masiero, senior vice president of innovation labs at Automatic Data Processing Inc.

ADP software engineers are working with social anthropologists and copywriters to tinker with bot behavior. Tests show that for bots to earn human acceptance, they must not act too much like people or too much like computers. Bots that refer to themselves in the third person sound unnatural, Mr. Masiero said. "I" and "we" work better. Bots that fire replies in milliseconds are unnerving, he said. His team has programmed delays into response time so that a bot replies no sooner than two seconds after a question.

"These emotional triggers are things we need to care about now," he said.

ADP aims to pilot bot interfaces on some of its human-resources software next year.

At American Airlines Group Inc., Chief Information Officer Maya Leibman said bots may improve customer service by providing faster access to information and a more consistent experience for fliers.

Developers at a recent tech conference at the airline demonstrated how to use Amazon's Echo, a voice-activated bot device, to check in for flights and retrieve other information. "We're a ways away from production but we are definitely excited about the future of [bot] technology," Ms. Leibman said.

"Companies need to see,  Oh my god, the convergence of bots and AI is an important investment for us to make,'" Mr. Chudnovsky at Facebook said. "There is a lot of work ahead but we feel like this is happening."

Regulator Compares Banks to Taxi Business Rattled by Uber

18:49 ET - The head regulator for national banks, Thomas Curry, during a speech in London, drew parallels between how emerging financial technology is disrupting the banking system to how Uber "upended" the taxi business. "If Uber turned your smartphone into a taxi dispatch, fintech is turning your phone into a financial advisor, a loan officer, a money transmitter, and an automated teller," he said in remarks prepared for a conference. There are more than 4,000 fintech companies and 99 million millennials in the US and United Kingdom who "are more open to new technologies and more willing to switch providers," he noted. "The US federal banking system is strong and vibrant, but to remain capable of serving the changing needs and preferences of customers, banks--and the banking system--must adapt."

Analyst Ties Income Inequality Problems to Fed

18:27 - The Federal Reserve should stop studying how its monetary and regulatory policies may exacerbate income inequality and start acting. That's according to a speech expected to be delivered tomorrow by Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics. Petrou, in remarks prepared for a conference hosted by the Chicago Fed, outlines how she believes financial regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, are having the unintended effect of depressing bank lending and hurting economic growth, which is worsening the gap between rich and poor Americans. Regulators should "act incrementally to solve problems," and continue making adjustments rather than taking a wait-and-see approach, Petrou argues. (Ryan.tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

Ally In Settlement Talks With DOJ

17:05 ET - Ally says in a securities filing that it is "in advanced settlement negotiations" with the Justice Department over mortgage-backed securities issued by the lender's former mortgage subsidiary. It said that it has a $52M reserve for the settlement of such litigation. (rachel.ensign@wsj.com)

SEC to Host FinTech Forum

14:16 ET - Executives of robo advisers Betterment and BlackRock (BLK)-owned Future Advisor will meet with regulators Nov. 14 to discuss advances in financial technology and innovation, the SEC says. It's closely monitoring fin-tech firms and Chairman Mary Jo White has urged online lenders to provide more information about loans they originate and then sell to investors. The meeting, which is open to the public, will include other industry participants who will talk about crowdfunding and the role that digital-recordkeeping technology can play in tracking the ownership and transfer of securities regulated by the SEC.

MetLife CEO:  Artificially Low Rates' Hard to Swallow

13:01 ET - MetLife CEO Steven Kandarian had tough things to say about monetary policy in 3Q earnings call this morning after noting that new money being put to work by the insurer is yielding 2.89% compared with 4.78% for investments rolling off. "A prolonged period of artificially low interest rates would be easier to accept if it were achieving the stated goal of boosting economic growth [but] the US economy continues to muddle along... Continuing to rely exclusively on unconventional monetary policy will only prolong a massive transfer of wealth from savers to borrowers." (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

Regulators Still Seek Solution on Living Wills

12:20 ET - FDIC Vice Chair Hoeing says regulators have yet to solve the problem of successfully mapping out how banks on the brink of failure can resolve themselves without putting the economy at risk. "We don't have a solution yet," he tells Handelsblatt. "We will have to work through it." Five major banks last month, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), resubmitted so-called living-will plans after initial ones were deemed insufficient by bank regulators.

FDIC Official: Difficult to Restore Glass-Steagall

12:08 ET - Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Thomas Hoeing tells German business newspaper Handelsblatt it would be "very difficult" to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separates commercial banking and securities activities at Wall Street banks. "Could you do it? Of course, you can do it." But he said there's still not enough support to break up the largest US financial institutions. "I don't see that as the likely path forward," he says. Instead, there will still be large institutions that are "very complex." (donna.borak@wsj.com; @donnaborak)

Brexit Court Ruling Won't Derail Bank Preparations in Frankfurt

1444 GMT The U.K. High Court's decision that the U.K. government can't kick off the process of leaving the European Union without a vote from Parliament complicates things, but won't derail banks' preparations for it, says Hubertus Vath, managing director of Frankfurt Main Finance, an initiative aimed to promote Frankfurt as a financial hub in Europe. "That ... will not prevent banks from preparing," says Mr. Vath. Frankfurt is hoping to get a big piece of the cake if bankers, companies, EU institutions and related services relocate from London after Brexit. (ulrike.dauer@wsj.com)

Keep Eligible Buyers of Bail-In Debt Broad, Says Banker

1451 GMT The list of those who can buy securities that would take a loss when a bank fails should be kept broad, says Mark Venus, Head of Recovery and Resolution Planning at BNP Paribas Thursday in Berlin. "Bail-in is an intelligent form of insolvency for banks," he says. "Insolvency hurts. It should hurt for all the stakeholders." He stresses that insured depositors "deserve complete protection," but those who are using the banks for investments, rather than simply for payments don't deserve special protection. If the list of those who can buy such securities is kept too narrow, then the loss risk would get concentrated on too small a group, raising the prospect that it would be declared too painful on that group to take the loss. (Todd.Buell@wsj.com, @ToddBuell)

Shanghai Central Bank Branch Warns Banks on Real Estate, Again

0717 GMT [Dow Jones] The Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) warned that banks should adhere to rules when financing the property sector. Its statement, dated Wednesday, was the latest sign that authorities here are continuing to take a tightened stance on credit flow to real estate. Their aim has been to keep a cab on prices and limit risks to China's financial system. Several cities have raised down payment requirements and the stock authorities are making it hard for property firms to issue bonds. The Shanghai PBOC has warned its banks before. This time, it stressed banks should be reviewing the source of peoples' down payments and verifying their incomes. (chao.deng@wsj.com)

China Construction Bank Agrees to Its Third Debt-Equity Swap

0702 GMT [Dow Jones] China Construction Bank (0939.HK) has agreed to swap debt for equity with Xiamen CCRE, the latest move to further the China State Council's aims to ease debt burdens on corporations, according to a statement by the bank. Authorities released details earlier this October on such loan-relief arrangements, saying that it would leave banks and companies to work out deals. Critics see the plan as controversial, akin to bailing out debt-laden state firms. CCB has been a leader in such swaps, with this one being its third, according to a policy report by NSBO Research. It has also agreed to swaps with Wuhan Iron and Steel Group and Yunnan Tin Group. Xiamen CCRE is a state-owned enterprises with businesses spanning manufacturing and real estate. (chao.deng@wsj.com)

AudienceView Ticketing Corp., which provides e-commerce software for events and entertainment companies, said it received a growth investment from Rubicon Technology Partners.

Toronto-based AudienceView offers products for ticketing, customer relationship management, fundraising, e-commerce, marketing and analytics, among other services. The company serves customers in the sports, arts, live event and educational campuses areas.

AudienceView has more than $2 billion in annual transactions, according to a news release about the investment. The company serves 550 venues across 15 countries with ticketing and e-commerce services for events.

In 2014, AudienceView said it closed a new round of equity financing led by Canadian venture-capital firm Five Corners Capital. Another Canadian venture firm Ventures West Capital lists AudienceView as an investment on its website.

AudienceView retained Pagemill Partners as its financial adviser, according to a news release about the investment, terms of which weren't disclosed.

Rubicon, which has offices in Menlo Park, Calif., and Stamford, Conn., makes control equity investments of between $30 million to $75 million in lower midmarket enterprise software companies with revenue between $25 million and $100 million, according to the firm's website.

The ticketing and live event sector has been an area of investment for private-equity firms this year. In January, Vista Equity Partners said it would invest in Vivid Seats Ltd., a secondary tickets retailer. In early October, CVC Growth Partners and New Amsterdam Growth Capital announced they would invest $75 million in DTI Management, which provides live event ticket technology to partners including StubHub Inc. and Ticketmaster.

Next SEC Chief Could Face Confirmation Fight

The end of a turbulent presidential campaign next week promises to invigorate the next source of conflict in Washington: White House appointments to lead federal departments and agencies.

While lawmakers sometimes clash over Supreme Court appointments or candidates for high-profile cabinet roles, it's uncommon to see divisions over lesser-known nominees, such as whoever is chosen to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.

But that could be an outgrowth of next week's election. Depending on who occupies the White House and which party controls the Senate, the SEC nomination could spark a fight over an issue that incites passions in both parties: requiring public companies to disclose the funds they spend on politics.

Senate Democrats have insisted that political expenditures fall into the category of information that shareholders should know about a company, along with items such as its financial statements, the identity of its board of directors, and legal settlements with the government. The SEC has broad powers to tailor disclosure requirements, but Congress has intervened and required specific reporting on matters such as a company's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/schlesingers-take-how-the-sec-boosted-mine-safety-1464348472" or its use of "http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2012/09/20/secs-conflict-minerals-rules-open-companies-to-activists/".

Opponents of a political-spending rule say the expenses are trivial for companies and immaterial to investment decisions. Laws that govern what information must flow to shareholders turn on the concept of materiality, meaning investors would consider the information within a decision to buy or sell the stock.

Friction over using the SEC to reveal more about corporate political spending has already bogged down the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-nominee-caught-in-crossfire-over-corporate-political-spending-1460410963" to join the agency as commissioners. In mid-October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) "http://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-to-obama-fire-sec-chief-mary-jo-white-1476439200" over her unwillingness to write such a regulation.

"Due to investor demand and Senate pressure this rule has justifiably become a linchpin issue and it is now one of the things that is and should be a test," said Lisa Gilbert, director of the Congress Watch division at the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen, who supports the call for a rule. "It seems clear that any plausible candidate for the SEC would need to have the right answer to this to get through this process."

That will certainly be the case if Hillary Clinton becomes president and Democrats gain control of the Senate. (Mrs. Clinton "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-unveils-campaign-finance-plan-1441684802" that she would support the SEC writing such a rule.) On the other hand, the issue could be moot if Donald Trump wins.

If Mrs. Clinton prevails but Republicans still control the Senate, GOP senators would be highly motivated to reject a nominee who appears friendly to the regulation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a longtime opponent of campaign-finance restrictions who has equated political giving with free speech.

If Republicans hang on to the Senate, "the SEC can no longer become the playground of political polarization," said Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, which opposes SEC involvement in campaign-finance disclosures.

Pro First: The Barred Brokers in Our Midst

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-barred-brokers-in-our-midst-1478165406" who were permanently or temporarily barred by regulators from working at a brokerage firm have begun new careers as investment advisers. The transition is legal, but the nuances between the professions of broker and investment adviser can be lost on mom-and-pop investors, experts say, potentially exposing them to bad actors.

The former brokers, whose alleged misdeeds run from violations of brokerage-industry rules to outright fraud, can benefit from the fragmented landscape that governs investment advice in the U.S. Brokers are overseen by an industry self-regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and have to give only "suitable" advice on investments. Investment advisers are overseen by state regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission and are held to a "fiduciary" standard that requires them to put clients' interests ahead of their own.

WSJ Pro Interactive: How the Election Could Reshape Financial Policy

The 2016 election has the potential to influence financial policy in significant ways, from new laws to new officials deciding how existing rules are implemented. Since first winning the presidency in 2008, Democrat Barack Obama, along with Congress, has rewritten the rules for American finance. His administration and appointees have continued to do so, even after Republicans gained new clout to shape the debate by taking the House in the 2010 elections and full control of Congress by winning the Senate in 2014.

Explore how different outcomes in the Nov. 8 elections could affect how Washington handles key financial regulatory issues.

The pound surged against the dollar following the decision. The government could now be forced to get parliamentary approval to trigger Article 50, the formal mechanism that begins a two-year window for exit negotiations.

SEC Probing Wells Fargo Around Sales-Practice Disclosures

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-probing-wells-fargo-around-sales-practice-disclosures-1478127877" whether Wells Fargo & Co. violated rules around investor disclosures and other matters relating to its recent sales tactics scandal, people familiar with the matter said.

The SEC sent requests for information to the bank asking for documents in recent weeks, following three Democratic senators' calls in late September for the SEC to investigate whether Wells Fargo misled investors and violated whistleblower protections while allegedly engaged in illegal sales practices, one of these people said. The probes are in an "early stage," this person added.

New Mortgage Rule Irks German Banks

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-mortgage-rule-irks-german-banks-1478165403" have come under fire from critics who say they choke off the flow of home loans in Europe's biggest economy and represent an overreaction to the 2008-09 financial crisis.

Lawmakers say the European Union's Mortgage Credit Directive protects consumers. Still, Berlin is considering a change following data indicating a sharp decline in mortgages since a German version of the rule took effect in March. European authorities agreed to the rules in February 2014 and Germany had until March of this year to make them national law.

U.K. Banking Watchdog to Set New Rules for Current Accounts

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-banking-watchdog-to-set-new-rules-for-current-accounts-1478160561" Thursday announced a plan to improve competition in the market for current accounts at retail banks, following a series of recommendations by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its investigation into retail banking.

The regulator said it will consider rules needed to improve transparency for overdraft users and plans to start collecting data next year. It will also look into promoting innovation in the sector, as well as improving service and prompting increased customer engagement.

The two defendants, Douglas MacKinnon and Mark Gray, directed the network of debt-collectors to intimidate consumers to get them to pay inflated debts or amounts they may not owe, according to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

Futures Exchanges Shift Rules on Block Trades in Win for Energy Companies

Block trades are big futures transactions negotiated between two companies. They are crucial to U.S. energy markets, where a significant portion of trading in recent years has shifted away from over-the-counter swaps into block trades. Both are private deals often agreed over the phone, but in block trades, the two companies doing the deal allow a futures exchange to step in as a middleman.

Variable annuities are widely used for retirement saving. The contracts at the heart of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's action are so-called L-shares, a type of mutual fund shares that are held in variable annuities and are designed for short-term investors, offering shorter surrender periods in exchange for higher fees.

French Prosecutors Say HSBC Should Stand Trial for Alleged Tax Fraud

Magistrates placed HSBC under formal investigation last year as part of a widening probe into whether the bank helped recruit customers in France, possibly breaching laws authorizing only French-registered lenders to sign up customers in the country. The investigation also examined whether the bank was complicit in laundering the proceeds of tax evasion.

Technology
China Circuit: For Safety's Sake, Venture Investors Go Offline

By Li Yuan

With a cooling and uncertain market for tech startups, Chinese venture investors who once searched for China's GrubHub or Uber are hunting for China's Starbucks.

Heekcaa Lab, a chain of 50 upscale teahouses based in southern Guangdong province, in August received 100 million yuan, or about $15 million, from a pair of backers including IDG Capital Partners, one of the most well-known venture firms in China thanks in part to early investment in search giant Baidu and video site Tudou. Nie Yunchen, Heekcaa's 25-year-oldfounder, has grand ambitions to make traditional tea hip with the young masses the way Starbucks did for coffee in China.

One of Heekcaa's rivals in that effort is Inwe Cha, which a month earlier received 500 million yuan in funding from Richard Liu, founder and chief executive of Chinese e-commerce company JD.com.

Nontech companies aren't a new concept for venture investors in China, but they have recently drawn much more interest for several reasons.

As with their Silicon Valley counterparts, China's venture firms have raised large amounts of capital they need to deploy. While some technology areas, such as artificial intelligence, remain hot, investors generally in the past year have grown cautious regarding tech startups after years of intense interest.

Restaurant chains and other traditional consumer companies also offer a play on China's young, free-spending consumers. In a slowing economy, many of these companies also boast something tech startups often lack: strong revenue and a clear path to profit.

Mr. Nie, for instance, says his Heekcaa chain, which operates under the company name Shenzhen Magcc Catering Management, brings in revenue averaging more than one million yuan a month per store and has never been unprofitable. Its tea drinks sell for 20 to 25 yuan apiece.

With Wheat, a high-end bakery chain in Beijing that received an undisclosed amount of funding from investor Sinovation Ventures in March, says it never opens a store unless it can garner revenue of at least one million yuan a month.

The business is profitable, says co-founder Ye Jiazhi.

Gao Hongqing at Fortune Venture Capital, which manages 20 billion yuan, says the "crazy hot" investments in the past few years in startups that use subsidies to acquire users for ride-hailing and other sharing-economy services aren't sustainable, because their customers are bargain hunters and have no loyalty. "Low prices and subsidies are passe," he says. "It's time to return to the fundamentals." Fortune has invested in a chain of handmade-candy stores and an indoor-playground chain, among others.

Such offline plays can be "safer projects for investors as we're looking for the next big trend," said Wu Shichun, founding partner of Plum Ventures. Mr. Wu's firm, an early-stage investor focused on technology and media, has invested in nontech startups including a custom ice-cream shop in Beijing.

Venture capitalists say domestic investors who put money into yuan-denominated funds increasingly prefer less-risky investments. Zhang Ying, a partner at Sinovation Ventures, says that for investors seeking to exit by having their portfolio companies list on China's A-share markets, strong financial performance is crucial because Chinese securities regulations have profitability requirements for public listing. Besides With Wheat, Sinovation has backed a hair-salon chain and a hotpot-delivery service.

Investors in these nontech businesses are considering access to relatively wealthy -- but picky -- young consumers. A report by consultants BCG and Alibaba Group Holding's AliResearch Institute projected that by 2020, the number of upper-middle-class and affluent households in China -- those with annual disposable income of $24,000 or higher -- would double to 100 million and account for 30% of all urban households. That compares with 17% in 2015 and 7% in 2010.

Growth in Chinese consumption over the next five years would roughly equal a market 1.3 times the size of Germany or the U.K., said the December report. It also found that upper-middle-class Chinese consumers 35 and younger spend an average of 40% more than previous-generation consumers with similar incomes, while being more brand- and health-conscious.

Zhang Haiyan, a partner at Tiantu Capital, a private-equity firm known for its consumer-related investments, says he is surprised by how freely his younger colleagues spend. "Sometimes I worry if we pay them enough to support their lifestyle," he jokes. "Other times I wonder if we overpay them."

Zeng Xi, a 27-year-old product manager at a smartphone maker in the southern city Shenzhen, says he made several trips to Heekcaa outlets outside Shenzhen before the chain opened in Shenzhen, drawn by its hip decor and innovative drinks.

"Heekcaa meets a uniquely Chinese demand," he says.

Goldman takes stake in derivatives start-up; Equities

A US financial technology company that aims to keep derivative traders out of trouble has won the backing of Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and high-speed trader DRW Holdings in its first fundraising.

New York-based Droit Financial Technologies has secured $16m to accelerate marketing of its software, which automates compliance with complex regulations in the derivatives market introduced in the wake of the financial crisis.

Droit's fundraising underlines a wave of interest from market participants in so-called "regtech" or regulation technology in trading that apply artificial intelligence and data crunching to real-time monitoring of financial services.

It is the first time Droit, founded in 2012 by a group of former derivative traders, quantitative analysts and technology specialists, has needed outside funds. The company had been profitable for the past 18 months, according to its chief executive Satya Pemmaraju , a former fixed income and derivatives trader at UBS.

Waves of rules covering all aspects of trading , from advanced risk checks to business conduct and reporting, are forcing banks and asset managers into significant IT overhauls. At the moment, most banks carry out compliance with their fragmented IT systems.

Reading data rapidly, the software will ensure that each trade has met a checklist of compliance requirements. Droit has "an excellent opportunity to become the industry standard for regulatory-compliant decision engines," said Joanne Hannaford, managing director of technology at Goldman.

Droit will focus on the industry's preparations for Mifid II, a sprawling piece of European legislation designed to toughen investor protections and make bond and over-the-counter markets more transparent. The rules will come into force from the start of 2018 . It also wants to open an office in Singapore.

"It's a very fast scaling over the next 18 months and we've got the backing of some very strategic partners," said Mr Pemmaraju.

Financial regulations apply to every single transaction, and those deals are executed in thousandths of a second, so rules needed to be applied to data in real-time, and in differing legal jurisdictions, Mr Pemmaraju said.

Pivot Investment Partners, a US venture capital firm, also participated in the fundraising. The four will collectively take a minority stake in Droit.

Citi takes a small step towards cracking the glass ceiling

ET, hero of the 1982 blockbuster celebrating otherness and openness to new experiences, was not a boy or a girl. ET was a plant.

Nearly 35 years later Citigroup spinners are celebrating the bank s openness through the promotion of Ebru Pakcan, a woman and a Turkish national. She is to head up treasury and trade finance in Europe and will sit on the bank s top executive committee in the region.

Ms Pakcan is not a plant but she is  other  in Citi. FT figures suggest more than four-fifths of the bank s senior employees are men.

And while she has not risen out of the testosterone-soaked, Ferrari-driving divisions such as investment banking, she has come up through another stereotypically blokish route   IT.

Banks are inching gingerly through the glass ceiling. Next stop for executives at corporate top tables is a seat on main boards.

That said, it is not quite a full hurrah. Ms Pakcan will be the fourth woman on a 22-member exec committee in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

The fact remains that there are still too few female bosses   about 26 per cent of the directors of UK s top 100 listed companies are daughters of Eve. And that is only part of the bigger drive to opening out British boards and freeing them from the  male, stale and pale  stereotype.

A government-backed report on diversity from Sir John Parker, chairman of miner Anglo American, shows that just 8 per cent of directors of the UK s biggest and most global businesses are other than white. Shame, in part because it underrepresents the 14 per cent of the British populace who don t define themselves as white. But the main point is to stop boards being comfortable billets for clubby types swapping war stories over the port and cigars. There is a clear business case for creating heterogenous boards to mirror the diversity of companies  customers.

Companies need to broaden the outlook of top teams, whether by recruiting from Mars or Venus   or indeed photosynthesising organisms, as long as they are not vegetables or wallflowers.

Scent of Persimmon

To the list of investment bubbles   which has included 19th century railways, 18th century South Sea merchants and 17th century tulips   may now be added another play on transport, trade and bulbous fibrous things: Chinese garlic. FT colleagues report that snowy weather and speculators have almost doubled its price in a year, writes Matthew Vincent.

But no one has ever suggested the bubble list should contain condensing boilers despite a similarly short-term spike in demand. That is largely because this demand was state engineered. In 2010, boiler sales leapt when 125,000 householders were given 400 vouchers to buy more efficient central heating (one over-enthusiastic Glaswegian plumber was fined 180,000 for making 2m unsolicited sales calls).

How, then, should investors treat a 19 per cent increase in Persimmon s new home sales in the last quarter, when 45 per cent involve the government s Help to Buy loan scheme, compared with 36 per cent nationally? Some say it explains why Persimmon has bucked a slowing mortgage market and architects  disdain for its  rabbit-hutch  homes. However, with operating margins nearing 24 per cent and not forecast to rise much higher, the forward indicator is perhaps not so much government largesse as patience with Persimmon s  cautious  land use. New-build prices, like that of garlic, are more about supply than taste.

Admiral red-Facebooked

Admiral became a big company through cheesy, cheap TV adverts and shaking up the staid world of insurance. On Wednesday it was itself shaken.

It had planned a big product launch that would mine the Facebook posts of 17 to 21 year olds   with their permission   to assess their risk as drivers.  Firstcarquote  sounded like an undergraduate s social science thesis: too few full stops or comments written in the pub would prompt premium quotes to soar.

But on launch day, Facebook became suddenly queasy about giving the insurer access to the data for commercial use and blocked the product. Perhaps the prospect of a public relations disaster loomed.

Or was Facebook trying to save the youth of today from their poor punctuation and inexperience? Lombard lost 20 at college by being the last one into the ubiquitous pyramid scheme decades ago. If Facebook had been around then, Lombard s lesson might have been less painful. Today, the big data question is who owns and controls information and what if users of social networks and customers don t want to be saved?

One of Heekcaa's competitors in that effort is Inwe Cha, which a month earlier received 500 million yuan in funding from Richard Liu, founder and chief executive of Chinese e-commerce company JD.com.

Nontech companies aren't a new concept for venture investors in China, but they have recently drawn much more interest for several reasons.

As with their Silicon Valley counterparts, China's venture firms have raised large amounts of capital they need to deploy. While "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-gears-up-in-artificial-intelligence-race-1472054254", investors generally in the past year have grown "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startups-face-dwindling-funding-1473263749" after years of intense interest.

Restaurant chains and other traditional consumer companies also offer a play on China's young, free-spending consumers. In a slowing economy, many of these companies also boast something tech startups often lack: strong revenue and a clear path to profit.

Mr. Nie, for instance, says his Heekcaa chain, which operates under the company name Shenzhen Magcc Catering Management, brings in revenue averaging more than one million yuan a month per store and has never been unprofitable. Its tea drinks sell for 20 to 25 yuan apiece.

With Wheat, a high-end bakery chain in Beijing that received an undisclosed amount of funding from investor Sinovation Ventures in March, says it never opens a store unless it can garner revenue of at least one million yuan a month.

The business is profitable, says co-founder Ye Jiazhi.

Gao Hongqing at Fortune Venture Capital, which manages 20 billion yuan, says the "crazy hot" investments in the past few years in startups that use subsidies to acquire users for ride-hailing and other sharing-economy services aren't sustainable, because their customers are bargain hunters and have no loyalty. "Low prices and subsidies are pass," he says. "It's time to return to the fundamentals." Fortune has invested in a chain of handmade-candy stores and an indoor-playground chain, among others.

Such offline plays can be "safer projects for investors as we're looking for the next big trend," said Wu Shichun, founding partner of Plum Ventures. Mr. Wu's firm, an early-stage investor focused on technology and media, has invested in nontech startups including a custom ice-cream shop in Beijing.

Venture capitalists say domestic investors who put money into yuan-denominated funds increasingly prefer less-risky investments. Zhang Ying, a partner at Sinovation Ventures, says that for investors seeking to exit by having their portfolio companies list on China's A-share markets, strong financial performance is important because Chinese securities regulations have profitability requirements for public listing. In addition to With Wheat, Sinovation has backed a hair-salon chain and a hotpot-delivery service.

Investors in these nontech businesses are considering access to relatively wealthy but picky young consumers. A report by consultants BCG and Alibaba Group Holding's AliResearch Institute projected that by 2020, the number of upper-middle-class and affluent households in China those with annual disposable income of $24,000 or higher would double to 100 million and account for 30% of all urban households. That compares with 17% in 2015 and 7% in 2010.

Growth in Chinese consumption over the next five years would roughly equal a market 1.3 times the size of Germany or the U.K., said the December report. It also found that upper-middle-class Chinese consumers 35 and younger spend an average of 40% more than previous-generation consumers with similar incomes, while being more brand- and health-conscious.

Zhang Haiyan, a partner at Tiantu Capital, a private-equity firm known for its consumer-related investments, says he is surprised by how freely his younger colleagues spend. "Sometimes I worry if we pay them enough to support their lifestyle," he jokes. "Other times I wonder if we overpay them."

His firm led a 400 million yuan funding round in September 2015 in Baiguoyuan, which produces and sells fruit in over 1,200 stores around China. Its investment in the packaged-duck-meat company Zhouheiya Food, which went public in Hong Kong this year, is often cited as a successful example of investing in nontech companies in the internet era.

Zeng Xi, a 27-year-old product manager at a smartphone maker in the southern city Shenzhen, says he made several trips to Heekcaa outlets outside Shenzhen before the chain opened in Shenzhen, drawn by its hip dcor and innovative drinks. "Heekcaa meets a uniquely Chinese demand," he says.

While bitcoin promises to provide a secure and anonymous way to make payments, analytics companies, many of whom are working with government research grants, have gotten "really good at exposing users' identities," "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-01/bitcoin-isn-t-anonymous-enough". The U.S. government has an interest in decoding cryptocurrency user identities for various law enforcement reasons, including stopping money laundering, drug dealing and tax evasion. But since that undermines one of the primary purposes of cryptocurrency privacy other digital currencies have entered the market promising decentralized, anonymous transactions, writes Ms. Ou, a blockchain engineer at Global Financial Access, a fintech company in San Francisco. They are not doing so to facilitate criminal activity, she says, but rather to meet that market desire for private transactions. Criminal activity will continue to occur whether or not the government manages to unmask certain cryptocurrencies, she says.

Business News: Humana Calls on Artificial Coach

Humana Inc. has deployed artificial-intelligence software trained to detect conversational cues to coach call-center agents and supervisors in real-time, when calls with customers are going awry.

The software, built with AI tools from Cogito Corp., can, for example, recognize increasing agitation by "listening" for markers such as a steady rise in the pitch of a customer's voice or instances of a customer and an agent talking over each other. The digital coach, called Cogito Dialog, will then send an electronic alert, such as "speaking quickly" or "frequent overlaps," to prompt the agent to change technique.

Empathy, said Geeta Wilson, director of consumer experience, is a competitive advantage.

"Usually when folks are interacting with us, it's about procedures and medications," she said. "A health-care company has to have empathy and compassion."

As AI advances spur the first generation of commercial applications, called chat bots, based around natural-language processing, researchers and technology companies are studying how such systems can better detect conversational cues. One goal is to develop a better rapport with users.

Increasingly affordable artificial intelligence tools are also making possible software to help with customer service beyond systems that respond to keywords, said David Nichols, a principal at Ernst & Young LLC.

At Humana, Ms. Wilson is trying to build systems that learn and can predict customer behavior.

"We want to know what the consumer is going to do before they do it, so it feels like we know them," she said.

To build digital coaches, Humana developers earlier this year fed data from 100,000 customer service calls into the AI system, to analyze for such markers as pauses, key words and interruptions, then associated them with the outcomes of the interactions. Now digital coaches, built with tools from machine-learning startup Cogito Corp., listen for stress in live conversations and send real-time suggestions to an agent to talk less, for example, or moderate his tone.

"Those alerts help agents determine how they should change the conversation to make sure the member feels like they're being heard." Ms. Wilson said.

Spotify Snaps Up Preact in Pre-IPO Focus on Customers

Spotify AB has agreed to acquire Preact Inc., a cloud-based customer acquisition and retention service, a move that comes as the music-streaming behemoth is grabbing customers ahead of an expected initial public offering.

Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Wall Street is waiting for Spotify to file for an IPO. The music-streaming company's IPO efforts will be widely watched because rival Pandora Media Inc.'s performance has been rocky since its 2011 public debut. Both companies share margin pains from licensing music.

Spotify "http://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-raises-1-billion-in-debt-financing-1459284467" in convertible debt financing in May. Under that financing deal, the streaming music company agreed to terms that set the clock ticking on an IPO. The massive cash infusion, which enabled the $8.5 billion-valued company to tap financing without setting a new valuation, gives Spotify some runway.

"It's not only huge but it had some terms that they had to go public," said Matt Murphy, a managing director at Menlo Ventures, last month.

Stockholm-based Spotify in September said it had "http://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-remains-tops-in-music-subscriptions-1473910164", up about 33% from six months earlier.

Preact's service offers analytics that tap into machine learning. With use of its analytics, the service is intended to help its customers learn about behaviors that could identify subscription sign-ups and upgrades.

Founded in 2011, Preact raised $16.7 million from investors, according to industry tracker PitchBook Data Inc. The company last raised funding in July 2015 at a $30.1 million post-money valuation, according to the researcher.

San Francisco-based Preact was backed by investors including Atlas Venture, Trinity Ventures, Boldstart Ventures, Root Ventures, Launchpad LA and Bee Partners.

The Preact group will be located in Spotify's New York and San Francisco offices.

Chatbot Platform Octane AI Raises $1.5M

By Cat Zakrzewski

Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

Octane AI Inc. on Wednesday launched its service that aims to make creating a chatbot for Facebook Inc.'s Messenger as simple as creating a website with WordPress.

The startup has partnered with the artists 50 Cent, Aerosmith and KISS as well as the Justin Bieber-backed Shots Studios.

To interact with an Octane-powered bot, people can go to one of the Facebook pages of Octane's partners and send a message.

The startup also said it has raised $1.5 million in funding led by General Catalyst Partners and others, including Boost VC, Dimension 6, Ustream Inc. founder Brad Hunstable, Hired Inc. co-founder Allan Grant and angel investor Lawrence Braitman.

The number of chatbots has ballooned in recent months, yet some people have remained unimpressed with the technology because most bots are unable to handle conversations. They rely on technology such as natural language processing that requires many conversations to train the bots.

Social media managers at Octane's partners can choose and customize plugins for a dashboard of features, such as merchandise to offer. Octane then allows its partners to quickly offer merchandise from the chatbots or even send notifications or schedule meetings.

For instance, the 50 Cent bot provides links to new music or videos, or allows users to buy G-Unit hats. The bot includes fire and gun emojis in its messages.

Octane's customers can also write the text of the automated messages to reflect their brands. The Octane-powered Aerosmith bot allows people to find tour dates or join the band's fan club, Aero Force One. It says phrases like "Hope you're havin a ROCKIN day!"

Octane's push to be the underlying bot platform comes about six months after Facebook showed developers how to build chatbots at its F8 Conference. Chatbots allow people to ask simple customer service questions or order goods through a conversational interface.

Facebook Messenger had zero bots in February 2016 and more than 18,000 by July 2016, according to Forrester Research Inc.

Octane's founders say that chatbots will become essential to every business. "Over time messaging apps are probably going to be the most popular way that people communicate, over email or anything else," said Octane co-founder Matt Schlicht. "And if that's the case, then it makes sense that every business is going to need to figure out how to interact with those people."

Mr. Schlicht, a former Ustream product manager, has been closely watching chatbots, and he launched the online publication Chatbots Magazine earlier this year. He also manages the largest Facebook group of chatbot developers. Mr. Schlicht launched Octane in May with former Mashable co-editor Ben Parr and Omegle creator Leif K. Brooks.

Octane AI isn't the only company attempting to be the backbone of chatbots. Y Combinator-backed Chatfuel also has a bot-building platform, supporting bots for companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and tech industry publication TechCrunch.

Mr. Schlicht joked that he wishes Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had set people's expectations lower and said, "Today, bots are stupid" when he announced support for third-party chatbots on Facebook Messenger.

People have come to think that chatbots are a form of artificially intelligent business representative that is very capable, he said. The reality, he added, is that businesses need to readjust their expectations and treat chatbots like lightweight mobile applications.

"They're very basic, they're very simple, but they can still provide a lot of value for you, even if they're not like AI," Mr. Schlicht said.

Jitters on Inflation Batter Bond ETFs

By Chris Dieterich

The bond market's October retreat fueled record withdrawals from some popular exchange-traded funds, the latest sign of investor anxiety over inflation.

Investors pulled $998 million last Thursday from iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, the oldest and largest junk-bond ETF. That is the largest daily withdrawal on record, said BlackRock Inc., the ETF's provider.

Investors also pulled $1.7 billion last week from the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, the biggest weekly outflow since its inception in 2002.

The redemptions coincided with a global rout in government bonds that sent the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to its highest levels since late May. On Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.822%, as prices rose.

Bond investors are bracing for an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve and grappling with signs of rising inflation, which erodes the fixed value of bond payouts over time, in the U.S. and globally.

The BlackRock funds weren't the only ones under pressure. All told, investors pulled $2.2 billion from junk-bond ETFs last week, the most in six weeks, according to XTF, a market-analytics firm.

The withdrawals follow large gains this year in bond funds, reflecting a sharp rise in corporate-bond prices.

In 2016 through Monday, the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF has returned 11.3%, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF has returned 8.8%, according to Morningstar. These compare with a 5.9% return, including dividends, for the S&P 500.

"The market has been seduced into this reach-for-yield mode, and a lot of this is central-bank-policy driven," said Thomas Urano, head of taxable fixed-income portfolio management at Sage Advisory Services. "Reaching for yields blinds investors to what's happening with fundamentals, and it seems to me prudent for investors to lock in gains."

For some investors such as Mr. Urano, 2016's snapback in high-yield bonds smacked more of investors chasing big payouts than it did meaningful improvement in corporate health for junk-bond issuers.

Fund investors' piling into corporate bonds has some market watchers on edge, worried that spates of fund-related selling could exacerbate market swings. Fully 70% of the high-yield bond market, or $922 billion in assets, is held by mutual funds and separately managed accounts, an investment structure favored by financial advisers, according to recent research from Stephen Caprio and Matthew Mish, credit strategists at UBS Group AG.

Some 46% of the U.S. investment-grade market, or $2.7 trillion, is controlled by funds and SMAs. At the same time, high-profile investors, including Bill Gross, Howard Marks and Carl Icahn, have voiced concerns about potential liquidity mismatches between fast-trading ETFs and hard-to-trade corporate bonds.

Fund companies have long maintained that ETFs create more liquidity for the bond market at a time when traditional dealers -- banks -- find it increasingly unprofitable to hold bond inventories and match buyers and sellers.

"Outflows were orderly and [the high-yield and investment-grade ETFs] performed as clients have come to expect," a BlackRock spokeswoman said.

More broadly, recent large outflows are a sign investors are taking chips off the table as uncertainty about central-bank policy looms, said Chris Johnson, head of U.S. ETF distribution at RBC Capital Markets. Mr. Johnson said that, unlike earlier in the year, when corporate-bond ETF outflows were accompanied by hedging activity, recent withdrawals "signal that big, real money is thinking that this could be a tipping point for the asset class and are moving out or trimming their positions."

Jeff Knight, global head of investment solutions at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said he isn't yet selling corporate credits because be believes they will hold up better than Treasurys after interest rates march higher. Still, he said that the rally for high-yield and investment-grade bonds is likely nearing its end.

"For us, it's too late to buy and too early to sell," Mr. Knight said. "I can see the case for risk-averse investors shifting away because there's not a lot of upside left."

Short Sellers Circle China's Alibaba Group

Shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. have surged 76% from a low hit in September 2015, but many investors are selling the company short, anticipating trouble ahead for the Chinese e-commerce giant.

Alibaba, which has posted a string of quarterly revenue gains, has appealed to investors as a way to profit from what has been up to now buoyant consumer spending in China. Still, there are concerns the company's profitability is overstated, alongside broader uncertainty about China's economy, said Wedbush Securities Inc.'s Gil Luria. After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probed Alibaba's accounting practices in May, the company said it is providing greater financial information.

Given the run-up in the stock's price and lofty expectations for growth, short sellers have been targeting Alibaba before Wednesday's quarterly earnings report and China's Singles' Day on Nov. 11, the biggest online shopping day.

Short interest in Alibaba has surged 49% this year, a rise equivalent to about $3.9 billion, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners show.

"When the Chinese economy decelerates, Alibaba will decelerate as well," said Mr. Luria.

Election 2016: Wall Street Targeted in Races

Eight years after the financial crisis, anti-Wall Street rhetoric remains a staple of congressional campaigns across the country, with Democrats and Republicans alike launching bank-bashing television ads in nearly three dozen competitive races.

In the hotly contested Indiana Senate election, for example, Democrat Evan Bayh's recent stints as an asset manager and as a regional-bank director are being used as reasons not to vote for him. "Evan Bayh went from the Banking Committee to a big bank boardroom. . . .," says the narrator of a 30-second ad paid for by the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). The spot brands Mr. Bayh "Wall Street's dream senator."

"That's pretty rich," said Bayh spokesman Ben Ray. "Evan voted for the toughest Wall Street reform since the Great Depression," he said, referring to the politician's backing for the 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul act during his previous Senate term.

Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group, an analytics firm that monitors advertising in close contests, identified for The Wall Street Journal 34 Senate and House races in 25 states where candidates have used "Wall Street" or "banks" as invectives to try to tarnish their opponents.

That is a decline from the past two presidential-election cycles, said Steven Passwaiter, a Kantar vice president. Still, he added, "Wall Street is always a convenient tool. In these tightly contested races, portraying candidates as catering to the big banks can be used to swing enough votes."

Similar sentiments have coursed through the presidential race this year. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders regularly criticized Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary for the close ties he said she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had cultivated with the financial industry.

Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has echoed that rhetoric, blasting her during their final debate for her ads "paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them."

Mrs. Clinton has made strengthening financial regulation a core plank of her platform, while also pledging to enforce rules aimed at curbing Wall Street pay and giving enforcement agencies more resources to "prosecute wrongdoing."

While Mr. Bayh and Mrs. Clinton are both under fire for their finance connections, most of the targets are Republicans. Like Mr. Bayh, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey also faces harsh television ads alluding to his career before politics as an investment banker in the 1980s, calling him a "Wall Street wheeler-dealer."

"While on the Senate Banking Committee, Pat Toomey voted to rewrite rules to help bankers like him and voted to eliminate protections put into place to stop Wall Street's risky practices," says an ad released Oct. 7 by his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty.

Toomey campaign spokesman Ted Kwong said the ad gives a misleading impression of the Republican lawmaker's record,saying that Mr. Toomey "led the fight in the Senate to end taxpayer bailouts of big banks" by voting in 2012 against extending a crisis-era program offering unlimited deposit insurance for certain accounts.

One of the embattled House Republicans, Bruce Poliquin of Maine, is taking heat for working at a Chicago savings and loan after college and then a New York fund-management company. In September, House Majority PAC, a group aimed at helping Democrats pick up House seats, released a 30-second ad with the narrator branding Mr. Poliquin a "Wall Street millionaire who puts himself first," adding: "People like that don't fit in up here."

Poliquin spokesman Michael Byerly said that when the lawmaker was in the financial industry, "he worked to help protect workers' pensions, including those at Bath Iron Works," a storied Maine shipyard.

Other lawmakers are being criticized for backing policies portrayed as benefiting the financial industry while they have taken contributions from employees in the sector.

Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman has weathered such attacks from his challenger, former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland. "Wall Street has given Rob Portman millions in campaign contributions, and he pushed a plan to privatize Social Security and risk your retirement in the stock market," a narrator says on a 30-second Strickland ad released in July. "Maybe Rob Portman should be running for the senator of Wall Street, not Ohio?"

A Portman campaign spokesman didn't respond to requests for comment.

A US financial technology company that aims to keep derivative traders out of trouble has won the backing of Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and high-speed trader DRW Holdings in its first fundraising.

New York-based Droit Financial Technologies has secured $16m to accelerate marketing of its software, which automates compliance with complex regulations in the derivatives market introduced in the wake of the financial crisis.

Droit s fundraising underlines a wave of interest from market participants in the use of so-called  regtech  or regulation technology in trading that apply artificial intelligence and data crunching to real-time monitoring of financial services.

It is the first time Droit, founded in 2012 by a group of former derivative traders, quantitative analysts and technology specialists, has needed outside funds. The company had been profitable for the last 18 months, according to its chief executive Satya Pemmaraju, a former fixed income and derivatives trader at UBS.

Waves of rules covering all aspects of trading, from advanced risk checks to business conduct and reporting, are forcing banks and asset managers into significant IT overhauls. At the moment, most banks carry out the compliance with their own fragmented IT systems.

Reading data rapidly, the software will ensure that each trade has met a checklist of compliance requirements. Droit has  an excellent opportunity to become the industry standard for regulatory-compliant decision engines,  said Joanne Hannaford, managing director of technology at Goldman.

Droit will focus on the industry s preparations for Mifid II, a sprawling piece of European legislation designed to toughen investor protections and make bond and over-the-counter markets more transparent. The rules will come into force from the start of 2018. It also wants to open an office in Singapore.

 With the fundraise we want to scale very quickly. It s a very fast scaling over the next 18 months and we ve got the backing of some very strategic partners,  said Mr Pemmaraju.

Financial regulations apply to every single transaction and those deals are executed in thousands of a second, so rules needed to be applied to data in real-time and in differing legal jurisdictions, Mr Pemmaraju said.

 You can t do [compliance] just in the US. Your clients are global, your trading and sales are global, you can t treat it locally. We approach law from a mathematical point of view,  said Mr Pemmaraju.  It s an incredibly complex world. We spent two-and-a-half years just planning and build out the infrastructure. 

Pivot Investment Partners, a US venture capital company, also participated in the fundraising. The four will collectively take a minority stake in Droit.

Fellow founding partners Anup Menon had senior technology roles at Barclays and Lehman Brothers while Brock Arnason headed fixed income e-commerce at Morgan Stanley.

UK-based InsurerAdmiralhas come up with a way to crunch through social media posts to work out who deserves a lower premium. People who seem cautious and deliberate in their choice of words are likely to pay a lot less than those with overconfident remarks.

So ditch the exclamation marks and enthusiasm, and replace them with caution, hesitancy and carefully composed lists. The language you use in your Facebook comments might be worth a lot more than you realise.

Admiral is set to tryout the system on a new product called firstcarquote, which will provide car "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/UK_insurance_industry" to 17 to 21-year-olds. If customers agree to let the company look through their Facebook posts they could be eligible for discounts of up to 350 although the trial has not yet been launched.

 The way you write and the things you post online are shaped by your personality,  said Yossi Borenstein, an independent adviser, who helped develop the software.

 If you are a super-organised person, you are likely to take more time travelling so you are not likely to be in a hurry. An organised person might write things in a list or might be more specific rather than vague when it comes to arrangements.

 An overconfident person will use phrases such as  always ,  never  and exclamation marks rather than  maybe ,  perhaps  and  let me think about it . An overconfident person might be a risky driver. 

The type of language that Admiral will use is not fixed, however. Over time, it might find that some phrases are more relevant than others.  We are trying to link the data to actual driving outcomes. The algorithm will find links,  added Mr Borenstein.  It is a big data game. The more data we have, the more the things that we look for will change. 

The insurer said that drivers aged 21 or younger are 70 per cent more likely to be involved in an accident that causes an injury. However, younger people also lack the sort of long record that can help the insurers distinguish the safer drivers from the riskier ones. Using social media to assess younger drivers is, said Admiral executive Dan Mines, one way to redress the balance.

Admiral believes it is the first insurer to use Facebook data in this way. But insurers have been using social media for other purposes such as fraud detection for years.

In one recent example, Admiral said it received a claim for an accident involving two people who said they did not know each other. However, after examining Facebook posts, the insurer found out they were boyfriend and girlfriend.

Twitter has been used in a similar way. Aviva recently investigated a whiplash claim and found that the claimant had been tweeting about finishing seventh (out of 2,000 people) in a 10km race while he was supposedly injured.

Short Sellers Circle Alibaba Ahead of Earnings Report and Key Chinese Sales Day; Many investors see trouble ahead despite Chinese e-commerce giant's past revenue gains and surging share price since September

Corrections & Amplifications:

SoftBank Group earlier this year sold about $3 billion in Alibaba shares and used another $7 billion worth of shares as collateral to raise additional money. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said SoftBank had sold its $10 billion stake in the company. (Nov. 2)

Although shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. have surged 77% in price from a low in September 2015, many investors are selling the company short, anticipating trouble ahead for the Chinese e-commerce giant.

Alibaba, which has posted a string of quarters showing revenue gains, has appealed to investors as a way to profit on what has been to now "http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-consumers-could-feel-pinch-of-debt-1475811848"in China. Still, there are persisting concerns the company's profitability is overstated, alongside broader uncertainty about China's economy, said Wedbush Securities Inc.'s Gil Luria.

And after a run-up in the stock's price and lofty expectations for growth, short sellers have been targeting Alibaba before "http://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-earnings-what-to-watch-1477986939" and China's Singles' Day on Nov. 11, the biggest e-commerce shopping day that last year netted the company a blockbuster $14.3 billion in sales.

Short selling involves an investor selling stock he or she doesn't yet own in a company, hoping to buy the shares and deliver them later when the price has fallen, thus netting a profit.

Short interest, or the volume of shares sold short and not yet covered, in Alibaba has surged 49% this year, an increase equivalent to about $3.9 billion, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.

Most of the bearish wagers were made in the second half of the year, as such bets against the company reached a record $12.9 billion at the end of September. The level of short interest has since slipped to $11.6 billion, data from New York-based S3 show.

Growing concern about the company has come as fresh doubts emerged on Oct. 19 over the reliability of official Chinese statistics after the country said the economy grew 6.7% for third consecutive quarter. Economists noted it is rare for a fast-growing economy to clock the same growth quarter after quarter.

"When the Chinese economy decelerates, Alibaba will decelerate as well," said Mr. Luria, who has a hold rating on Alibaba, setting him apart from the large number of analysts who advise investors to buy the shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Mr. Luria doesn't see the Chinese economy continuing to grow at rates seen in the past.

Waning enthusiasm about the Chinese economy might also have been evident "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-logistics-company-zto-express-drops-in-trading-debut-1477579281" Inc. The Shanghai-based logistics company that gets most of its business from Alibaba tumbled 15% from its initial public offering price in its debut on Oct 27.

Adding to the nervousness, SoftBank Group Corp. cashed in earlier this year on the rally in Alibaba shares, selling about $3 billion in shares and using shares worth $7 billion as collateral to raise additional money, according to a spokesman for the Japanese company.

Meanwhile, the options market is indicating a 5.4% price swing in Alibaba after the company reports earnings on Wednesday, in line with the 5.3% fluctuation the shares posted on average over the last eight quarters, data from Trade Alert show. The expected volatility in the stock has climbed to the highest level since February, FactSet data, based on options, show.

U.S. companies reporting quarterly financial results in the past couple of weeks have shown mixed results in China. Apple Inc. reported on Oct. 25 that fourth-quarter revenue from the greater China region tumbled 30% from the same period a year ago, though some of the decline was due to competition from local smartphone makers.

Kynikos Associates founder Jim Chanos is among the most outspoken bears on Alibaba and China. While Alibaba's stock has rallied 22% since he first publicly disclosed he was shorting the company's stock in November 2015, Chanos reiterated his view on CNBC last month, saying corporate governance and transparency issues still permeate the Chinese conglomerate.

Still, while the U.S. retail giant Amazon.com Inc. launched its "http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-delivers-prime-program-to-china-1477647637" on mainland China, Needham & Co.'s Kerry Rice doesn't see the Seattle-based company successfully stealing market share away from Alibaba.

Alibaba is "ingrained in the way consumers purchase goods in China. It's very hard to break that pattern of behavior," Rice said, who has a buy rating on the shares.

U.A.E. Fund Bags Brexit Bargain in Scotland Yard Building; Devaluation of the pound gives Abu Dhabi Financial Group a significant discount

An Abu Dhabi investment company notched a huge discount Monday when it closed a London property deal first agreed to nearly two years ago.

It has "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-vote-stunned-britons-awake-to-a-new-era-for-u-k-1466768937" to thank.

In December 2014, Abu Dhabi Financial Group LLC agreed to buy New Scotland Yard, the former headquarters of London's police force, for 370 million ($451 million). A new development with high-end condominiums, offices and shops is in the works for the central London site.

The deal officially closed Monday, when 90% of the money was paid to the Metropolitan Police, according to a spokesman for ADFG. The two-year gap came about because the police had to move into a new space.

A 10% deposit was paid when ADFG first agreed to the sale. Over those 22 months, sterling has fallen 22.7% against the United Arab Emirates dirham, mostly because the pound has plummeted since Britons voted to leave the European Union in late June.

"When you're transferring 90% of a big number, you're saving quite a lot," said Niccol Barattieri di San Pietro, chief executive of Northacre, the U.K. developer that will be spearheading construction.

For investors that agreed to buy U.K. real estate before Brexit, the discount from weakened sterling has been significant.

Wells Fargo & Co. completed the purchase of a London office building in July, just weeks after the Brexit vote, for nearly 300 million. The price was "http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargos-discount-u-k-deal-is-the-new-normal-1473189057?tesla=y". But the drop in sterling knocked off another 12% off the price.

The post-Brexit fall in sterling has spurred bargain hunting among foreign real-estate investors. But "http://www.wsj.com/articles/european-property-investors-look-beyond-london-1477274461?tesla=y". Real-estate investment volumes in the U.K. were down 51% between July and September compared with the period in 2015, according to property data company Real Capital Analytics.

While the initial panic that rattled the real-estate sector in the weeks after the referendum has subsided, uncertainty about how the U.K. government will extricate itself from the EU and the potential for sterling to fall further has limited deal making.

In 2014, when the London property market was booming, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-property-investors-tap-london-1418184434" for the New Scotland Yard site.

The new development in Westminster will include six buildings with homes and commercial space. ADFG and London-based Northacre plan to complete the project by 2021.

The sale was part of a drive by London officials to reduce costs. By selling the old headquarters and moving into a new space, "we have been able to make savings to invest in front-line policing, improving the technological capability of the force and develop facilities," said Helen King, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, in a statement Tuesday.

Wall Street Plays Villain in Congressional Campaign TV Ads; Democrats and Republicans alike are targeting opponents with bank-bashing television ads

Eight years after the financial crisis, anti-Wall Street rhetoric remains a staple of congressional campaigns across the country, with Democrats and Republicans alike launching bank-bashing television ads in nearly three dozen competitive races.

In the hotly contested Indiana Senate election, for example, Democrat Evan Bayh's recent stints as an asset manager and as a regional bank director are being used as reasons not to vote for him. "Evan Bayh went from the Banking Committee to a big bank board room &," says the narrator of a 30-second ad paid for by the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). The spot brands Mr. Bayh "Wall Street's dream senator."

"That's pretty rich," said Bayh spokesman Ben Ray. "Evan voted for the toughest Wall Street reform since the Great Depression," he said, referring to the politician's backing for the 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul act during his previous Senate term.

Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group, an analytics firm that monitors advertising in close contests, identified for The Wall Street Journal 34 Senate and House races in 25 states where candidates have used "Wall Street" or "banks" as invectives to try to tarnish their opponents.

That's a decline from the past two presidential election cycles, said Steven Passwaiter, a Kantar vice president. Still, he added, "Wall Street is always a convenient tool. In these tightly contested races, portraying candidates as catering to the big banks can be used to swing enough votes."

Similar sentiments have coursed through the presidential race this year. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders regularly criticized Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary for the close ties he said she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had cultivated with the financial industry. Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has echoed that rhetoric, blasting her during their final debate for her ads "paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them."

Mrs. Clinton has made strengthening financial regulation a core plank of her platform, while also pledging to enforce rules aimed at curbing Wall Street pay and giving enforcement agencies more resources to "prosecute wrongdoing."

While Mr. Bayh and Mrs. Clinton are both under fire for their finance connections, most of the targets are Republicans. Like Mr. Bayh, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey also faces harsh television ads alluding to his pre-politics career as an investment banker in the 1980s, calling him a "Wall Street wheeler-dealer."

"While on the Senate Banking Committee, Pat Toomey voted to rewrite rules to help bankers like him and voted to eliminate protections put into place to stop Wall Street's risky practices," says an ad released Oct. 7 by his Democratic challenger Katie McGinty.

Toomey campaign spokesman Ted Kwong said the ad gives a misleading impression of the Republican lawmaker's record, saying that Mr. Toomey "led the fight in the Senate to end taxpayer bailouts of big banks" by voting in 2012 against extending a crisis-era program offering unlimited deposit insurance for certain accounts.

One of the embattled House Republicans, Bruce Poliquin of Maine, is taking heat for working at a Chicago savings and loan after college and then a New York fund management company. In September, House Majority PAC, a group aimed at helping Democrats pick up House seats, released a 30-second ad with the narrator branding Mr. Poliquin a "Wall Street millionaire who puts himself first," adding: "People like that don't fit in up here."

Poliquin spokesman Michael Byerly said that when the lawmaker was in the financial industry "he worked to help protect workers' pensions, including those at Bath Iron Works," a storied Maine shipyard.

Other lawmakers are being criticized for backing policies portrayed as benefiting the financial industry at the same time they have taken contributions from employees in the sector.

GOP Rep. Joe Heck, locked in a tight race for an open Senate seat in Nevada, has been hit with ads sponsored by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest government worker trade union, for his support for proposals allowing Americans to invest Social Security funds.

"In Washington, Congressman Joe Heck supports privatizing [Social Security], turning our savings over to Wall Street, and risking it on the stock market," the ad says. "Heck's plan means billions more for Wall Street, and they've donated over half a million dollars to his campaign."

The securities and investment industry has donated $552,580 to Mr. Heck, according to data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics. "The implication that funds raised from the banking industry were an  investment' in Heck is highly misleading," says a statement provided by his congressional staff.

Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman has weathered similar attacks from his challenger, former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland. "Wall Street has given Rob Portman millions in campaign contributions and he pushed a plan to privatize Social Security and risk your retirement in the stock market," a narrator says on a 30-second Strickland ad released in July. "Maybe Rob Portman should be running for the senator of Wall Street not Ohio?"

A spokesman for Sen. Portman's campaign didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.

Mr. Strickland used a similar tactic during the 2010 gubernatorial race against his Republican challenger, John Kasich, running an ad claiming, "John Kasich helped Wall Street predator Lehman Brothers destroy the world economy." Mr. Kasich joined Lehman Brothers' investment banking division after leaving Congress in 2001, and worked there until the firm's collapse in September 2008.

At least in Mr. Strickland's races, the Wall Street-bashing hasn't seemed effective. He was ousted by Mr. Kasich in that race. And polls show him trailing far behind Mr. Portman this year.

Markets
Inflation Jitters Spark Retreat From Bond ETFs; Investors pulled almost $1 billion from BlackRock fund in one day

The Wall Street Journal Online

The bond market's October retreat fueled record withdrawals from some popular exchange-traded funds, the latest sign of investor anxiety over inflation.

Investors pulled $998 million last Thursday from iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, the oldest and largest junk-bond ETF. That is the largest daily withdrawal on record, said BlackRock Inc., the ETF's provider.

Investors also pulled $1.7 billion last week from the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, the biggest weekly outflow since its inception in 2002.

The redemptions coincided with a global rout in government bonds that sent the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to its highest levels since late May. On Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.822%, as prices rose.

Bond investors are bracing for an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve and grappling with signs of rising inflation, which erodes the fixed value of bond payouts over time, in the U.S. and globally.

The BlackRock funds weren't the only ones under pressure. All told, investors pulled $2.2 billion from junk-bond ETFs last week, the most in six weeks, according to XTF, a market-analytics firm.

The withdrawals follow large gains this year in bond funds, reflecting a sharp rise in corporate-bond prices.

In 2016 through Monday, the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF has returned 11.3%, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF has returned 8.8%, according to Morningstar. These compare with a 5.9% return, including dividends, for the S&P 500.

"The market has been seduced into this reach-for-yield mode, and a lot of this is central-bank-policy driven," said Thomas Urano, head of taxable fixed-income portfolio management at Sage Advisory Services. "Reaching for yields blinds investors to what's happening with fundamentals, and it seems to me prudent for investors to lock in gains."

For some investors such as Mr. Urano, 2016's snapback in high-yield bonds smacked more of investors chasing big payouts than it did meaningful improvement in corporate health for junk-bond issuers.

Fund investors' piling into corporate bonds has some market watchers on edge, worried that spates of fund-related selling could exacerbate market swings. Fully 70% of the high-yield bond market, or $922 billion in assets, is held by mutual funds and separately managed accounts, an investment structure favored by financial advisers, according to recent research from Stephen Caprio and Matthew Mish, credit strategists at UBS Group AG.

In February, when U.S. crude futures plunged under $30 a barrel, the amount by which yields on junk debt exceeded those on Treasury debt, called the spread, reached 9 percentage points. Yield-seeking investors stepped in quickly, and the spread narrowed to about 4.6 percentage points in October, when oil prices traded back above $50, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Some 46% of the U.S. investment-grade market, or $2.7 trillion, is controlled by funds and SMAs. At the same time, high-profile investors, including Bill Gross, Howard Marks and Carl Icahn, have voiced concerns about potential liquidity mismatches between fast-trading ETFs and hard-to-trade corporate bonds.

Fund companies have long maintained that ETFs create more liquidity for the bond market at a time when traditional dealers banks find it increasingly unprofitable to hold bond inventories and match buyers and sellers.

"Outflows were orderly and [the high-yield and investment-grade ETFs] performed as clients have come to expect," a BlackRock spokeswoman said.

More broadly, recent large outflows are a sign investors are taking chips off the table as uncertainty about central-bank policy looms, said Chris Johnson, head of U.S. ETF distribution at RBC Capital Markets. Mr. Johnson said that, unlike earlier in the year, when corporate-bond ETF outflows were accompanied by hedging activity, recent withdrawals "signal that big, real money is thinking that this could be a tipping point for the asset class and are moving out or trimming their positions."

Jeff Knight, global head of investment solutions at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said he isn't yet selling corporate credits because be believes they will hold up better than Treasurys after interest rates march higher. Still, he said that the rally for high-yield and investment-grade bonds is likely nearing its end.

"For us, it's too late to buy and too early to sell," Mr. Knight said. "I can see the case for risk-averse investors shifting away because there's not a lot of upside left."

Behavioral Analytics  Company Interana Raises $18 M

Behavioral analytics company Interana Inc. said on Tuesday it has raised $18 million.

Vertex Ventures led the round, with participation from Battery Ventures, Data Collective, Allen & Company, Fuel Capital and Index Ventures. The Redwood City, Calif., startup has raised $46.2 million to date.

For clients ranging from Microsoft Corp., with its search engine Bing, to Sonos, Interana provides analytics on any data that has a time stamp. Interana Chief Executive Ann Johnson said the company's have relied on their experience from Facebook Inc. and Intel Corp. to build technology that employees in many different positions within a company will be able to use.

Ms. Johnson explained the Interana technology by talking about the company's customer Tinder, a dating app owned by Match Group Inc. On Tinder, people swipe right to express they find another Tinder user attractive. Ms. Johnson said men were indiscriminately swiping right, causing women to lose interest and use the app less.

"It was threatening their business model," Ms. Johnson said.

Using data from Interana, Tinder was able to add a number of features to cut down on this behavior. The app began to limit the number of right swipes a user could make and introduced features like "super like," a feature that can only be used once a day to show more interest than a regular right swipe.

Many of the four-year-old company's customers have been in the Silicon Valley technology sector. But Ms. Johnson said the company has recently closed some larger deals, and they're moving into more mature companies, particularly in telecommunications, cable, manufacturing and retailers.

Relayr Powers Up $23M Series B for Industrial IoT Sensors

Venture capitalists are placing more bets on the promise of the industrial Internet of Things.

If industrial companies that operate heavy machinery use sensors to monitor their equipment's performance and predict when their machines need maintenance, they can prevent a costly or dangerous breakdown and do wonders for their insurer's bottom line.

That's why the corporate venture-capital arm of German reinsurance company Munich Re Group has made a $23 million strategic investment in relayr, a startup creating technologies for industrial customers to harness the Internet of Things.

Berlin-based relayr makes sensors that monitor industrial equipment to gather data or predict when machines will need maintenance, along with software and consulting services to help enterprise customers use them.

Schindler, the maker of elevators and escalators, uses relayr's sensors to monitor its machines. Other customers include Bosch and Dell. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which led relayr's Series A last year, and Munich Venture Partners, participated as returning investors in the Series B round.

"Just imagine a car that you never maintain. It doesn't tell you if you need more gas. You just drive until it's dead," said Kleiner partner Wen Hsieh, who led the firm's investment. "We don't drive cars until they die. So why do we do it with everything else?"

Even more promising for venture capitalists, industrial IoT infrastructure customers will be loyal, Mr. Hsieh predicted. "Once you install the sensor and connect to the cloud, no one's going to rip it out. So it's very sticky," Mr. Hsieh said.

Taking a similar view, several other startups doing related work have gathered funding recently.

Andreessen Horowitz led a $25 million Series A in Samsara Networks, which links sensors to machinery, in May 2015. Manufacturing analytics platform Sight Machine raised a $15.5 million Series B in March. In September C3 IoT, which offers software to build large systems of connected devices, raised a $70 million Series D led by its own founder, billionaire Thomas Siebel.

Munich Re's HSB subsidiary will become a relayr partner to offer customized insurance products for industrial customers who use relayr's sensors. The partnership will give relayr's customers "financial assurance that they will benefit from their IoT investments," said Greg Barats, president and chief executive of HSB.

The Berlin-based startup will use the new funding to help its engineering and product teams to grow, and to beef up its sales operation in the U.S. and Europe. It may also make small acquisitions or acqui-hires of companies that produce IoT technology complementary to its own stack, co-founder and Chief Executive Josef Brunner said. He said he wanted the company's current staff of about 100 to reach 150 by the end of the year.

Creighton's Take: Theresa May's Financial Bona Fides Are Good Sign for Fintech; The Wall Street Journal's financial regulation newsletter for Tuesday, November 1, 2016.

Theresa May's Financial Bona Fides Are Good Sign for Fintech

The U.K.'s push to become a fintech hub might have a little-known ally: Its new prime minister, Theresa May, is probably the world leader most knowledgeable about financial affairs in at least a generation.

Few people are aware that Mrs. May, who succeeded David Cameron in the wake of Britons' historic vote in June to leave the European Union, worked on financial policy full time for almost 20 years before she was elected to the House of Commons in 1997. From 1977 to 1983 she was at the Bank of England, and from 1986 to 1997 at the Association of Payment Clearing Services, where she was head of the European Affairs Unit.

"It's like it never happened," said Sandra Quinn, who worked closely with Mrs. May, now 60 years old, at the Association of Payment Clearing Services for five years in the mid-1990s. "It's partly journalist ignorance, but also when Theresa first became an MP she didn't talk about it either," she added in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

Mrs. May used her financial acumen Monday when she "http://www.wsj.com/articles/boes-carney-to-extend-term-by-one-year-to-june-2019-1477937474" for Bank of England governor Mark Carney in a rebuke to Brexit hardliners. Still, the decision comes just weeks after an apparent disagreement with Mr. Carney over monetary policy when she highlighted the impact of quantitative easing on inequality.

Mrs. May is probably good news for British fintech firms, too. The APCS, which was succeeded by the UK Payments Administration in 2009, was a not-for-profit trade group representing British banks' interests in the payments system, an area in which fintech firms are active.

"No one would need to brief her massively on these issues. All the basic stuff she'll never lose. You don't stop knowing how payments work once you learn it because it's so blooming complex," said Ms. Quinn, who still works in the finance industry.

The prime minister's office declined to comment.

The U.K. is already "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-takes-novel-approach-on-fintech-1460370600"in removing regulations that might stifle fintech firms' growth.

"The big thing we worked on was the regulation on cross-border payments in Europe, which back then was really more about linking domestic systems to other domestic systems," Ms. Quinn said.

Such experience could also be useful as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The extent to which British banks have access to EU financial markets will be a key negotiating chip.

"It's ironic she's taken power at the time all the talk is getting out of the EU," Ms. Quinn said.

So far the prime minister's experience doesn't appear to have helped the City of London much, with bankers saying they haven't had much of a chance to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-financial-firms-beef-up-contingency-plans-ahead-of-brexit-deadline-1475746698" for retaining EU access.

William Ahern, former deputy director for financial markets at the Bank of England, said he knew the prime minister in the early 1980s when she worked on monetary policy. "It was difficult to get hired by the Bank of England &.It was a good place to work and they had a lot of applicants," he added. Earlier, she had been a secretary to the Wilson committee on the functioning of financial institutions, Mr. Ahern said.

"She's the best boss I've ever worked for. She doesn't talk about herself. She can be really empathetic and very aware, keen to know what drives you, a fantastic role model," Ms. Quinn said.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

WSJ Pro First: Wall Street Plays Villain in Congressional Campaign TV Ads

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-plays-villain-in-congressional-campaign-tv-ads-1477994402", anti-Wall Street rhetoric remains a staple of congressional campaigns across the country, with Democrats and Republicans alike launching bank-bashing television ads in nearly three dozen competitive races.

In the hotly contested Indiana Senate election, for example, Democrat Evan Bayh's recent stints as an asset manager and as a regional bank director are being used as reasons not to vote for him. "Evan Bayh went from the Banking Committee to a big bank board room &," says the narrator of a 30-second ad paid for by the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). The spot brands Mr. Bayh "Wall Street's dream senator."

"That's pretty rich," said Bayh spokesman Ben Ray. "Evan voted for the toughest Wall Street reform since the Great Depression," he said, referring to the politician's backing for the 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul act during his previous Senate term.

Deutsche Bank Problems Could Prompt Higher Capital Requirements

Deutsche Bank's ongoing difficulties provide support for additional bank capital requirements beyond those established in Basel III, says William Cline of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "https://piie.com/system/files/documents/pb16-19.pdf", Mr. Cline estimates that solvency issues at Deutsche Bank and other large European banks lend support to optimal capital levels of 7% to 8%, about one-third higher than the target set in Basel III for global systemically important banks.

Clinton Could Push Postal Banking Plan

If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, there is a good chance she will endorse the idea of turning the U.S. Postal Service into a retail bank, "http://www.fedfin.com/blog/2204-karen-petrou-on-how-clinton-goes-postal" of Federal Financial Analytics, a consulting firm. The politics of the proposal may actually be manageable for a President Clinton, she argues. Progressives are strongly in favor of postal banking as an alternative to high-interest small-dollar loans, and big banks may decide it's not worth their while to fight a proposal that deals with products that they "don't want anymore."

Squeezed budgets put focus on measuring value for money

In 2007, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg predicted that trust would be the basis for marketing to consumers in the future.

 As people share more, they have access to more opinions from the people they trust about the products and services they use. This makes it easier to discover the best products and improve the quality and efficiency of their lives,  "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9055830/Facebook-IPO-Letter-from-Mark-Zuckerberg.html" as the technology company launched its initial public offering.

Nine years on, Facebook has become one of two dominant forces in new media. According to a recent study from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the US venture capital fund, Facebook and fellow tech group Google now receive 75 per cent of all new spending on online advertising.

Ad industry executives initially expected the explosion in digital marketing to transform the way media agencies and brands measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. A wealth of new data would allow them to get closer to customers and to improve accuracy of measurement. Instead it has raised more questions for an industry grappling with the structural shift away from traditional media such as TV, radio and newspapers.

In September, Facebook apologised after admitting it had wrongly calculated viewing times for its online videos, which led to renewed calls for the company, which has 1.6bn users, to change the way it measures advertising data. Until recently, Facebook had counted only video views of more than three seconds when it calculated its  average duration of video viewed .

The Facebook controversy followed an investigation into online ad fraud in the US by the Association of National Advertisers, a US trade body. More recently, in Japan the dominant advertising agency Dentsu apologised for overcharging the car company Toyota for online advertising.

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world s biggest advertising group, WPP, "https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/08/24/sir-martin-sorrell-brands-are-starting-to-question-if-they-have-over-invested-in-digital/" among media buyers in August when he called for better measurement  not just offline but online too . He added:  The answer is not Facebook or Google data, we can t have the players being the referees. There has to be independence in terms of measurement. 

Facebook says it will give marketers more choices on measuring effectiveness by "https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-ad-viewability-partners?__mref=message_bubble" with companies such as Nielsen, the US media researcher.

According to the research firm eMarketer, online advertising will this year "https://www.emarketer.com/Article/US-Digital-Ad-Spending-Surpass-TV-this-Year/1014469" to take the biggest proportion of the $600bn spent across the global industry in total each year.

Some industry commentators argue that the dominance of digital advertising has only underlined the need for a deep rethink on the way online data are measured if they are to help marketers work out best value for money.

Bob Hoffman, "http://adcontrarian.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/data-facts-and-principles.html" blogger, recently lamented:  The online advertising industry is drowning in data, but has generated almost no useful facts or principles. The encyclopedia of things we don t know about online advertising since we started collecting  big data  is comical. 

For chief marketing officers, the uncertainty is another challenge at a time when global and political instability is already putting a squeeze on budgets.

Peter Field, a UK marketing consultant, says there is a disconnect between the standards people expect from digital and traditional media.

 The big question is what do people think they are getting when they buy a digital slot?  he says.  With TV or the press there are oversight bodies and legal frameworks which measure and give executives a clear picture. Suddenly marketers are prepared to throw away all that learning they have built up over decades. 

A growing band of tech companies is, though, offering new ways of measuring the impact of campaigns.

For instance, research firm Kantar Millward Brown, owned by WPP, uses techniques such as brain scanning and face tracking to assess human reaction to brands and advertising content. However, they are part of a mix of tools the company provides, points out Louise Ainsworth, its UK chief executive.

The power of digital advertising means marketing officers and agencies should take an integrated approach to how they spend their budgets, she says.  With any kind of measurement there are pros and cons   and digital measurement is particularly complex. 

Mark Ritson, a business school academic and branding consultant, is more forthright:  More than half of all UK advertising spend now goes into digital. [A majority] of that half goes to Google and Facebook. And these two companies are making it up as they go along.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
'Japanese equities will be interesting again'; FACE TO FACE: David Semaya

The chairman of Nikko Asset Management loves soba noodles and robots

David Semaya is a man of contrasts.

Wearing a white shirt and no jacket, the chairman of Nikko Asset Management, the $165bn Japanese fund house, strikes a relaxed pose. Beneath the calm veneer, however, there are signs of nervousness: his leg shakes under the table and at times he rushes his words.

The father of three is humble, almost apologetic when answering questions about his life and career. And yet this modesty belies some exceptional talents: he is a polyglot who was in a programme for gifted students while growing up in the US.

The 54-year-old says he had an "alternative education" when asked how and why a Floridian ended up learning Japanese and Chinese more than three decades ago. (He also studied Spanish and French.)

It is only when pushed about what an alternative education involves that he admits he was one of Florida's brilliant young people. "It is embarrassing, because I don't like to talk about myself, but I was in what we call - it is a terrible name - the gifted programme," he says.

It is hard to know whether this modesty is innate or whether Mr Semaya has developed it during his almost two decades in Japan - a country where humility is venerated.

Mr Semaya, who first visited Japan as a 17-year-old in 1978, is clearly a fan. During a follow-up phone call after our meeting, the keen trekker gushes about Japan's mountains and food, especially its soba noodles.

He worked in education when he first moved to Japan. He cast aside plans to become a lawyer after a friend he bumped into in Tokyo advised him to "get into finance".

At the time, Japan was booming. But in the decades since, growth has stagnated, thanks to a greying population, falling demand for goods, both domestically and for export, and stubborn debts.

Then came Abenomics - the "three arrows" of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms espoused in 2012 by Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, to get the country back to growth.

But almost four years later, Abenomics has disappointed many. Some argue it has failed.

Yet Mr Semaya defends the country's growth plans. "My view is to give it a bit of time. You are seeing progress. Maybe it is slow for the outsider but for Japan we are moving at a rapid pace," he says.

He highlights attempts to improve corporate governance at listed Japanese businesses, seen as a vital way to attract foreign investment and grow the economy.

"A number of external directors [are] coming on to boards; [there is] real soul searching and navel gazing around what is good about the system that is in place, what some of the challenges are and how to move things forward. So we are seeing not only talk, but action," he says.

By focusing on governance, and issues such as the best use of capital over time, the outlook for Japanese businesses will improve, he adds. "You will see that the Japanese equity market will be an interesting one again, especially given the number of companies that have global exposure in their businesses."

Mr Semaya is dismissive of suggestions that the Bank of Japan will soon be forced to resort to helicopter money - an alternative to quantitative easing, where money is given to consumers or spent on infrastructure - to kick-start growth.

"It is much too early to speculate around that. Tourism is doing well. We are seeing demand for university grads go up. There is tightness in the labour markets here," he says. "[Helicopter money] is something for the future."

Although much of his career has been spent in Japan, the University of Florida graduate left the country in 2007 to become Europe, Middle East and Africa chief executive of Barclays Global Investors. During his time in London, the asset management arm of the British bank was sold to BlackRock, the world's largest fund house, for $13.5bn. The 2009 deal included a crown jewel in the form of iShares, the passive manager that has since become the world's largest exchange traded fund provider.

When questioned if selling BGI and the hugely profitable iShares was the right course of action, Mr Semaya will not say much other than that he was not involved in the decision. "Hindsight is very easy," he says.

He is also reluctant to discuss his departure as head of UK private banking at Barclays Wealth Management in 2013. Soon after his departure was announced, the private bank pulled out of more than 100 markets. "I had other ideas about the strategy of the business," he says simply.

He is more willing to discuss the future. Mr Semaya was hired in 2014 to help grow Nikko, which ranks as the third-largest Japanese asset manager, outside of its home market. Currently, about 30 per cent of Nikko's assets are managed for international clients.

"Over the next three to five years, we would love to get the balance to 50-50," says Mr Semaya, who returned to Japan two years ago. To do so, the Tokyo-based company has been acquiring stakes and teams around the world, including a global equity team based in Scotland.

Nikko has also been behind one of the most high-profile fund launches of recent years. In August 2015, it unveiled an actively managed robotics fund , one of just a few in the world looking to monetise the trend for artificial intelligence. The fund attracted 300bn ($3bn) in just three months.

The man whose hobbies all seem to revolve around the natural world - hiking, fly fishing, snorkelling - gets excited when talking about the potential offered by technology.

Mr Semaya believes robotics will mean big changes for the world. Just as cars replaced horses and buggies more than 100 years ago, many jobs and products can be replaced by robots, he argues.

"If I were a buggy maker in the 1880s, then I would have been dislocated within 20 years. I think we are going through that today. It is not comfortable for many people, but the opportunity set is obviously huge.

"It is the new industrial revolution."

Top Japanese insurers tune products for self-driving era;  " New age set to redefine premiums  " Looming risks include cyber attack

Japan's top insurers are studying new products to brace themselves for the age of self-driving vehicles , which may redefine insurance premium burdens for global carmakers as well as component makers and technology companies.

Studies have forecast a steep decline in insurance premiums as the number and severity of accidents fall with the emergence of autonomous vehicles.

But Japanese insurers MS & AD and Tokio Marine say the transition to driverless technology also brings opportunities with the increasing costs to repair cars , the emergence of new risks such as cyber attack and changes in the way insurance will be bought.

"We expect the weight of new types of insurance products for new risks such as cyber attacks will increase significantly," said Hideyuki Sakashita, manager at Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance.

Motor is one of the most important markets for the global insurance industry, accounting for $700bn of premiums every year, or 42 per cent of total property and casualty insurance.

Japanese insurers are seeking to stay ahead of the race by setting up teams - dubbed "epoch-maker's section" at MS & AD and "future technology team" at Tokio Marine - to collect research data on autonomous vehicle technology to plan new products.

The emergence of self-driving vehicles means insurance will be bought less by consumers and more by carmakers and producers of other technologies packed inside the car. One of the biggest challenges, officials say, is determining who is responsible in the case of a car accident or malfunction.

"The cause of an accident - whether it is the carmaker, the supplier, the internet provider, the electronic maps, software or artificial intelligence - could be countless [for self-driving vehicles]," said Kazuaki Kutsuzawa, manager at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance.

The debate over responsibility among carmakers and their suppliers has already intensified in recent years even with existing vehicles. In the case of the mass recall of Takata-made airbags , the top carmakers and the airbag manufacturer are debating how to split the costs to repair the faulty airbags.

In the case of a cyber attack, insurance insiders say it would be difficult to determine who was to blame, making it difficult for consumers to claim. The longer it takes to settle the issue, the bigger the financial burden on car owners, especially with components inside connected cars becoming more expensive.

For carmakers building self-driving vehicles, the creation of insurance products to address the risks and responsibilities is critical to ensuring that consumers embrace the technology.

"Even if the technology is developed, it would be meaningless if consumers feel too uncertain to use the self-driving vehicles. Autonomous driving will only be accepted when there is assurance that there is insurance to provide a safety net," Mr Kutsuzawa said.

Pro Private Markets
Rising Star: Anika Agarwal Brings Problem-Solving Prowess to Insight

Anika Agarwal learned the art of problem solving at a young age.

Thanks partly to her father, who was a professor of computer science and engineering at Canada's McGill University when she was a child, the 35-year-old vice president at technology-focused private-equity firm Insight Venture Partners has cultivated critical thinking skills and a passion for technology.

Her ability to tackle even the thorniest challenges that face growing technology companies, combined with an enthusiasm for all things tech, has earned her the respect of her colleagues and placed her among a rising generation of potential leaders at her firm.

Anika Agarwal

Education

Ms. Agarwal received a bachelor's degree in computer science from Stanford University. She also holds a M.B.A. from Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Select Board Seats

Ms. Agarwal sits on the board of oil and gas software provider Drilling Info Inc., public safety software provider Appriss Inc., workplace wellness software provider Virgin Pulse, public safety software provider TriTech Software Systems Inc. and B2B-Center, an e-marketplace for corporate procurement in Russia.

Like many private-equity professionals, Ms. Agarwal began her career in banking, initially at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and later in the principal investment unit at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where she got a taste of private-equity investing across a variety of industries. But her desire to get more deeply involved with technology companies ultimately drew her to private equity, starting at Vista Equity Partners, before she moved to the East Coast to join Insight in 2014.

"At Lehman I was in a two-year banking program," said Ms. Agarwal. "I liked being a banker but was definitely still on the sidelines. It's very different when you're putting your own capital at risk and to get to see [companies] from beginning to end."

At Insight, Ms. Agarwal's ability to juggle complex problems proved critical to helping one of the firm's portfolio companies Appriss Inc. navigate a complicated series of deals that almost fell through.

Insight first invested in Louisville, Ky.-based Appriss in 2014. As part of the deal, Ms. Agarwal joined the board of the company, which provides software that helps track criminal offenders, monitor public safety and check buying patterns and behaviors of users of certain over-the-counter medications that could be used to make illegal drugs, among other products.

Her drive and ability quickly impressed Michael Davis, the co-founder and chief executive of Appriss.

"I've never worked with someone who is available 24/7," Mr. Davis said. "I used to ask her  When do you sleep?' We would be exchanging emails at midnight."

Mr. Davis said Ms. Agarwal was instrumental in helping the company successfully complete two simultaneous transactions earlier this year. The company was working on the divestiture of a unit that provides technology to collect crash reports and electronic citations. At the same time, it was working to acquire Sysrepublic Inc., a retail analytics provider.

Among the biggest challenges Appriss faced in the deals were a series of complicated negotiations and structuring the deal financing from the banks.

The complicated divestiture almost fell through on three separate occasions, but Ms. Agarwal's deft handling of the situation ultimately helped steer them to the finish line, said Deven Parekh, a managing director at Insight who joined the firm in 2000. LexisNexis's Risk Solutions division bought the crash and project unit, and Appriss announced its acquisition of Sysrepublic in April.

Mr. Parekh said that the deals were among the more complicated situations that he has seen over the course of his many years of investing. But Ms. Agarwal's ability to dig in and solve problems for Appriss and other companies has put her among the first people that portfolio company management teams reach out to for help.

"The ultimate sign of when someone has developed as a professional in private equity is when the management team calls them first," he said. "They call her first. She's the first call, and that's true on a lot of the companies that I work with her on. The management team uses her as a thought partner and a management partner."

Will Kobe Bryant Score Again? The former basketball star talks about his venture-capital fund and what it takes to succeed

Kobe Bryant's stunning achievements in basketball are known the world over. Now he is out to prove himself anew, through Bryant Stibel, the venture-capital fund in which he is a general partner, and Kobe Inc., a multimedia content company. Mr. Bryant talked about his new challenges with Wall Street Journal Finance Editor Dennis Berman. Edited excerpts follow.

Talking percentages

MR. BERMAN: What was your field-goal percentage, 45% or so? Are you ready to shoot 5% as a good venture capitalist might be lucky to?

MR. BRYANT: No. I'm going to shoot higher than that. I'm used to having this patient approach. Because when you start training camp, you're building the tools necessary to win a championship. You have to have the patience.

MR. BERMAN: You're a student of footwork, right? To use a basketball analogy. What is the footwork of the craft you're building today?

MR. BRYANT: Focus. Focus. You have to go with things that you understand. Businesses that you know.

MR. BERMAN: Tell us about your fund. Tell us an investment or two you are excited about that shows the focus you've described.

MR. BRYANT: About three years ago, I started looking at what comes next. I started looking in the investment space. So Jeff Stibel and I started our fund and started investing our own capital. We have a couple of our CEOs here. Cindy Mi, from VIPKID.

MR. BERMAN: Where English-language teachers in the U.S., primarily, are teaching kids in China?

MR. BRYANT: It's about inspiring the kids in China to understand there's a much bigger world out there. And helping them have opportunities.

I think Walter Driver is here from Scopely [the mobile game developer], who's absolutely crushing it. The Walking Dead has absolutely been killing it. Walter and Cindy both are strong, extremely smart CEOs. But they have an even stronger team with them. Those are things we look at. You want a CEO that understands they need to build a team around them that's sharper and smarter than they are.

MR. BERMAN: Do you think your life, being on teams, helps you understand the team in a business setting?

MR. BRYANT: They're completely different disciplines, but the core competencies are absolutely the same. You have to rely on others to have success as a group. I had to learn the process. Five championships later, you understand how that works. So I don't have to learn that approach now.

MR. BERMAN: But you have to identify it in other people.

MR. BRYANT: Yes, you do. For me it's really easy. You sit down and you talk with somebody. When I talk with Cindy, and she's telling me about VIPKID, she cannot stop. It's one idea after the other. The passion comes out of them. You don't have to search for it.

Empathy's edge

MR. BERMAN: You said recently, along the way, you wish you had been more empathic.

MR. BRYANT: When we lost in the finals to the Celtics in 2008, that was the turning point. I started thinking about it. Because it's on me. If I didn't feel like my teammates were aggressive enough, that falls on me. I had to understand what their journey was. How are they feeling as people? What are they going through? And when you do that, you have that empathy, it helps you be a better leader. Because you know how to reach them better and communicate to them better.

MR. BERMAN: But could you have been as good as you were if you had the empathy from the start?

MR. BRYANT: Better. Because it cuts both ways, right? When you have empathy toward your opponents, it helps you destroy them quicker. Because you understand exactly who they are. You understand what buttons to push. You understand if they're insecure, if they fear embarrassment. And you can really hit those buttons to strike a nerve.

MR. BERMAN: Can you give an on-court example of that?

MR. BRYANT: Yes. There would be certain teams that had a player they just signed to a max contract, and a supportive player who was up for free agency who hadn't signed yet. So when we play them during the season, I'm saying, OK, we're going to double-team the guy that hasn't gotten the max contract yet. We're not going to let him get a shot off. And we're going to single-cover the guy that has the max contract. Then watch the guy that doesn't have the max contract bitch and complain about not getting the ball all night long and watch them divide each other.

MR. BERMAN: That's brilliant. The business equivalent?

MR. BRYANT: I don't know. Haven't been doing it long enough.

MR. BERMAN: Your celebrity has value. How do you personally separate what your celebrity brings and all the other thinking that you bring?

MR. BRYANT: It depends on the company. There's certain companies that line up with what the brand represents. There are other things that are more investment-focused.

Story lines

MR. BERMAN: Reed Hastings, the Netflix CEO, had this magical equation. He said, how do we translate the money that we invest into the joy for our users? So what is your secret sauce of human nature?

MR. BRYANT: You have to be true to who you are. Everybody has a different journey. But there's also a through line that connects all of us. And so the trick really becomes how do you communicate that? That's what I enjoy doing. That's the fun part.

MR. BERMAN: Another part of what you're doing is Kobe Studios, trying to get those story lines to people. Give us some examples of where you can give truth to people about themselves.

MR. BRYANT: Sports. For me, it's very easy to communicate that. I write all day and outline stories, a sports mythological universe.

MR. BERMAN: Do most kids today have the attention span?

MR. BRYANT: If the stories are good, kids will pay attention.

Clinton Could Push Postal Banking Plan; Progressives like the idea of postal banking, and big banks might not object, writes analyst Karen Petrou.

If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, there is a good chance she will endorse the idea of turning the U.S. Postal Service into a retail bank, "http://www.fedfin.com/blog/2204-karen-petrou-on-how-clinton-goes-postal", a consulting firm. The politics of the proposal may actually be manageable for a President Clinton, she argues. Progressives are strongly in favor of postal banking as an alternative to high-interest small-dollar loans, and big banks may decide it's not worth their while to fight a proposal that deals with products that they "don't want anymore." With big banks preferring to invest in financial technology rather than new brick and mortar infrastructure, they may not find it useful to fight over a plan that dovetails with their own changing business models. And if progressives are focused on postal banking, it could mean they are less focused on other regulatory matters that might affect big banks more, like bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act, Ms. Petrou writes.

Rising Star: Tomasz Tunguz Might Be Silicon Valley's  Where's Waldo?'

Regulars of San Francisco's South Park, the neighborhood where many venture-capital firms have set up West Coast outposts, often think they have spotted Redpoint Ventures Partner Tomasz Tunguz working late in the office.

But Mr. Tunguz always aims to be home for dinner with his family at 5:30 p.m. sharp. Passersby have been fooled by a cardboard cutout of him made for a technology conference that his co-workers place around the office to trick people.

It's understandable Mr. Tunguz could be perceived as being in two places at once. His experience as a Dartmouth College-educated engineer and his obsession with machine learning have led to a pace of six potentially promising investments at Redpoint.

Within Silicon Valley, the 34-year-old venture capitalist also has built a following as a writer. He has a popular VC blog and recently released his book, Winning With Data.

Tomasz Tunguz

Education

Mr. Tunguz earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, a bachelor's of engineering in machine learning and a master's in engineering management from Dartmouth College.

Career Path

After college, Mr. Tunguz worked as an engineer at Appian Corp., developing systems for the Department of Homeland Security. He then moved to Google Inc., where he managed the company's AdSense product for social networks. He joined Redpoint Ventures in 2008.

Board Positions

Mr. Tunguz sits on the boards of Axial Networks Inc., Electric Imp Inc., Expensify Inc., Looker Data Sciences Inc. and Dremio Corp. He's also a board observer at Quantifind Inc. and ThredUP Inc.

Every weekday at 5 a.m., Mr. Tunguz writes a data-driven blog post about startups. Many of his posts focus on cloud-based software companies or play off recent news, like Microsoft Corp.'s acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. Popular blog posts include "A Framework for Maximizing Startup Marketing Effectiveness" and a series called "Startup Best Practices."

Mr. Tunguz said the idea to start a blog came from attending board meetings. Entrepreneurs would ask questions about hiring or about what benchmarks they needed to hit before raising another funding round. He felt he needed to make that information available to more startups.

"As investors, we see all that data every day," Mr. Tunguz said. "We just haven't as an industry done a great job of aggregating it, collecting it and presenting it to entrepreneurs."

Mr. Tunguz said the blog has helped him build in-bound interest from entrepreneurs and given him an edge on competitive deals. Redpoint Partner Satish Dharmaraj said Mr. Tunguz has built such a strong reputation among founders that Mr. Dharmaraj often finds entrepreneurs want him on their board, even if Mr. Tunguz didn't bring the deal to Redpoint himself.

Mr. Dharmaraj has been a mentor to Mr. Tunguz and first called his idea for a blog "a yawn." He's been impressed, however, with how Mr. Tunguz has differentiated it from all the other VC blogs.

"He sets his mind to something and delivers with a ridiculous amount of hard work," Mr. Dharmaraj said.

Mr. Tunguz joined Redpoint eight years ago as an associate and rose through the ranks to general partner. He came to the firm after working as a product manager at Google Inc., overseeing AdSense for social networks.

Mr. Tunguz's bets include Looker Data Sciences Inc., Axial Networks Inc., Expensify Inc., Electric Imp Inc., ThredUP Inc. and Dremio Corp. Though they include both enterprise and consumer companies, Mr. Tunguz said the common thread among the companies is data. Looking ahead, he's interested in investing in other applications of artificial intelligence, like language processing.

Though he's proven he can edge out the competition on an investment, it remains to be seen if his unique data-driven approach will generate large returns for Redpoint. None of the companies he's invested in have exited yet.

Despite lacking a record of successful exits, he's proven he can still win competitive deals.

Looker Chief Executive Frank Bien said when his company was raising its Series A in 2013, the market was "hot" for business intelligence companies like his. He said many large venture-capital firms were interested in leading the round, but the company went with Redpoint because as a data company, they wanted to work with an investor who was so data driven.

"Venture capitalists always want to help you, Tom actually can help you," Mr. Bien said. "Tom is a long-view, build-a-business kind of a guy that's who you want around a table with you."

BUYOUTS

Arsenal Capital Partners, New York

Arsenal Capital Partners held a final closing for its fourth fund at the vehicle's $1.3 billion hard cap. The firm, which targets buy-and-build investments in midmarket health-care and specialty industrial companies, has backed two platforms from Arsenal Capital Partners IV LP. New investors in Fund IV include California State Teachers' Retirement System, PensionDanmark AS and Sentry Insurance. Arsenal typically focuses on platform investments with enterprise values of $100 million to $250 million.

Dyal Capital Partners, New York

Dyal Capital Partners, a unit of Neuberger Berman Group LLC, so far has collected more than $4 billion in investor commitments for a fund that takes direct minority stakes in private-equity managers, said two people familiar with the situation. The tally for Dyal Capital Partners III LP has surpassed the firm's initial target of $3 billion to $4 billion for the fund, which is structured as an evergreen vehicle with an indefinite life. The fund may close at $4.5 billion or even close to $5 billion at the end of the year, one of the people said. Dyal seeks to take minority interests of about 20% in private-equity managers, providing capital for the expansion of business offerings and commitments to their own funds in exchange for a piece of their management and carried interest fees.

EQT, Stockholm

EQT held a final closing for its first fund dedicated to investing in the U.S. The fund, EQT Mid Market US, raised $726 million. The vehicle will acquire midmarket companies with $5 million to $40 million in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization, said Matthew Levine, a partner at EQT Mid Market. EQT has invested from the fund in two companies: XP Solutions Inc., which makes drainage and flood-control software; and FocusVision Worldwide Inc., which provides technology services to market-research companies.

Falfurrias Capital Partners, Charlotte, N.C.

Falfurrias Capital Partners surpassed the $225 million goal for its third fund, closing on at least $237.3 million so far, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Falfurrias expects to hold another closing before the end of the year, which should take the fund closer to $275 million, said a person familiar with the fundraising. The firm plans to cap Falfurrias Capital Partners III LP at $300 million, the person said. The amount raised so far makes the fund nearly double the size of its prior fund, which wrapped up with $126 million in 2013. Falfurrias targets investments in companies with $3 million to $25 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The firm has invested from Fund III so far in one company: Marquis Software Solutions Inc., a Plano, Texas-based provider of data analytics software and services for financial institutions.

FTV Capital, San Francisco

FTV Capital, a growth-equity firm that invests in enterprise technology, financial-services and payments companies, completed fundraising for its fifth fund, FTV V LP, reaching its $850 million hard cap. The vehicle was seeking $700 million, according to a June 29 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm closed the fund's predecessor in 2014 at $700 million, exceeding a $500 million target. FTV added new investor Texas Municipal Retirement System to the latest fund and attracted returning investors including Skandia Mutual Life Insurance Co., Hillman Co., New York pension funds and funds and accounts managed by NB Alternatives Advisers, said Karen Derr Gilbert, a partner at the firm. FTV invests $10 million to $85 million in companies with annual revenue of $10 million to $100 million.

Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, Los Angeles

Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors collected $2 billion in investor dollars for its latest energy private-equity fund, which will target upstream oil and gas deals. Kayne Anderson Energy Fund VII LP was seeking $1.6 billion, Private Equity Analyst previously reported, citing a person familiar with the matter and an investment memorandum. The firm closed on its hard cap for the fund, above the $1.6 billion it collected for the fund's predecessor in 2012.

Metalmark Capital, New York

Metalmark Capital is in talks with investors in a bid to raise $1.5 billion for its third fund, said a person familiar with the matter. If the fund closes on target, it will be $1 billion less than the amount the firm collected for its second fund, Metalmark Capital Partners II LP, which closed at its $2.5 billion hard cap, Private Equity Analyst reported in 2012. Metalmark targets midmarket companies in industries such as energy, health care and industrials.

MTS Health Investors, New York

MTS Health Investors wrapped up its fourth fund at its $365 million hard cap to invest in the health-care services sector.

Renovus Capital Partners, Wynnewood, Pa.

Renovus Capital Partners wrapped up its second fund focused on education deals at $300 million, which includes leverage from the U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business Investment Company program. The fund, Renovus Capital Partners II LP, initially targeted $75 million for private investors with a $100 million hard cap, Private Equity Analyst previously reported, citing Founding Partner Jesse Serventi. The vehicle received backing from investors including the University of Texas Investment Management Co., Prudential Financial Inc. and SunTrust Banks Inc. Renovus initially raised $100 million for its debut effort in 2011 and later added commitments that brought the fund to a total of $185 million, including leverage from the SBA. The firm targets buyout and growth investments in companies with $2 million to $10 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in industries including the education, training and human-capital sectors.

Riverside Co., Cleveland

Riverside Co. raised $650 million for microcap deals. Riverside Micro-Cap Fund IV LP closed at its hard cap after about a year of fundraising, surpassing a $500 million target, said Riverside Managing Partner Loren Schlachet.

Investors in the latest fund include the State of Michigan Retirement System and investment manager Makena Capital Management LLC.

Riverside Acceleration Capital closed at its $50 million target and has begun investing.

Vista Equity Partners, Austin, Texas

Vista Equity Partners collected at least $8.9 billion in investor commitments for its flagship fund, Vista Equity Partners Fund VI LP, according to an investor memorandum. The firm, which could raise about $10 billion for the fund, passed the initial $8 billion goal for its largest-ever war chest for software and information-technology buyout deals. The firm's latest buyout fund is expected to focus on companies valued at $400 million to $5 billion. Although the fund will make equity investments of $200 million to $1 billion, Vista has the firepower to do bigger deals and to pool capital with co-investors. The fund's predecessor closed at $5.78 billion in 2014.

MEZZANINE & OTHER DEBT

Bain Capital, Boston

The credit arm of Bain Capital raised more than $500 million in equity commitments for its first business development company, which will target direct loans to small and midmarket companies, said a person with knowledge of the fund. Thanks to rules that allow BDCs to borrow up to one times the equity they collect, the credit unit, Bain Capital Credit, will have more than $1 billion in new money to invest. The firm previously raised about $400 million in equity commitments for a traditional private direct midmarket lending fund last year and manages a number of separate account vehicles focused on direct lending to midmarket companies. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the BDC will focus on direct loans to midmarket companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $10 million to $150 million. As with most BDCs, Bain must invest at least 70% of the vehicle's capital into U.S. midmarket companies, but can invest up to 30% of the portfolio into what are termed "nonqualified" investments. The firm intends to devote any of its allocation for nonqualified investments into loans to overseas companies, primarily in Europe or Australia, this person said.

KSL Capital Partners, Denver

KSL Capital Partners is preparing to market a new credit fund with an anticipated target of about $750 million to invest in travel and leisure businesses, said a person familiar with the matter. The firm raised $378.5 million for its debut credit pool, KSL Capital Partners Credit Opportunities Fund LP, Private Equity Analyst reported in 2014, citing Chief Executive Eric Resnick. The firm, which traces its roots as a KKR & Co. portfolio company that bought hotels and resorts, began talks with at least some existing investors about its second fund in the summer, the person said. KSL last wrapped up $2.68 billion for its fourth private-equity fund focused on tourism and recreation in 2015.

Monroe Capital, Chicago

Monroe Capital collected $800 million in limited partner commitments for Monroe Capital Private Credit Fund II LP, exceeding a $600 million target. Monroe also intends to leverage the fund, potentially giving it about $1.5 billion of capital to invest. The firm plans to use the new fund primarily to provide senior secured loans and unitranche loans to midmarket companies in the U.S. and Canada, both those with and without private-equity backers. Monroe expects to build a portfolio of 40 to 50 companies for the fund at any one time, said a person familiar with the fund. Over its four-year investment period, it may invest in a total of 70 to 80 companies due to capital recycling, the person said. According to a due diligence memo from Dallas Police & Fire Pension System, which was considering an investment in the fund, Monroe offered investors the option of two subfunds, one levered and one unlevered. As of July 30, the fund had deployed $457 million across 32 loans, according to the memo.

NXT Capital, Chicago

NXT Capital wrapped up its latest private-debt fund, which will have about $900 million to invest. The vehicle, NXT Capital Senior Loan Fund IV LP, held a final closing on about $312 million of equity and is expected to have access to an additional $600 million through a syndicated credit facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank NA. The vehicle invests in senior-debt transactions that are originated and underwritten by NXT's corporate finance group. It primarily provides capital to private equity-backed U.S. midmarket companies. The firm received commitments for the fund primarily from institutional investors, including pension plans, insurance companies and foundations. NXT announced the close of its previous fund with an $800 million investment capacity in 2015.

Penfund, Toronto

Penfund, which makes debt and equity investments in North American midmarket companies, completed fundraising for its fifth vehicle, Penfund Capital Fund V, with 724 million Canadian dollars ($551.6 million). The firm's previous vehicle gathered C$460 million in 2012. The fifth fund, which collected 90% of its capital from institutional investors, is the first Penfund raised with capital from outside Canada, said partner Richard Bradlow. The firm makes junior investments in midmarket companies in North America, providing second-lien, mezzanine and high-yield debt. The firm also makes equity investments, generally co-investing alongside other sponsors. The new fund gives Penfund room for larger transactions than it had previously targeted, said Mr. Bradlow. The firm, which can invest up to C$140 million from the fund, has so far committed about one-third of the vehicle's capital, he said. Penfund invests within the consumer, health-care and business-services sectors.

Seacoast Capital, Danvers, Mass.

Lower midmarket lender Seacoast Capital closed its largest fund to date at $239 million. The vehicle, Seacoast Capital Partners IV LP, was supported by more than 85% of the limited partners that invested in its previous vehicle, which wrapped up in 2013 with more than $150 million. As with the previous fund, Seacoast received a Small Business Investment Company license for Fund IV, giving the firm access to as much as $150 million in matching funds from the U.S. Small Business Administration. Seacoast makes noncontrol investments of $3 million to $20 million, generally through a combination of subordinated debt and preferred or common equity. The firm targets U.S. companies in the manufacturing, distribution, business-services and consumer sectors with annual revenue of more than $10 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization exceeding $2 million.

SECONDARY

Lexington Partners, New York

Lexington Partners plans to soon hold a first closing of its latest midmarket secondary fund that will take the vehicle about three-quarters of the way toward its $2 billion target, said a person familiar with the offering. The firm expects to close on about $1.5 billion for Lexington Middle Market Investors IV LP, which would put the fund ahead of the $1.07 billion the firm raised for its predecessor in 2014. Lexington invests its midmarket secondary funds in portfolios of limited partnerships managed by firms targeting deals with enterprise values of $1 billion or less.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Amino Capital, Palo Alto, Calif.

Amino Capital, a firm focused on artificial intelligence and big data startups, collected $50 million for its second fund, Amino Capital II LP. Formerly known as zPark Venture, Amino Capital previously raised a $4.4 million first fund from among its general partners. The latest fund includes large Chinese technology companies as limited partners. The first fund made 39 seed investments, while the second fund also will invest in some Series A and B deals. The firm seeks to make the first investment in a startup and often looks for companies that are spinoffs from university research. The firm looks for startups in artificial intelligence or big data areas of expertise for its general partners, said Larry Li, a founding partner of Amino. The firm also is interested in startups building on hard science, said Sue Xu, a founding partner at Amino.

Baker & Eastlack Ventures, Del Mar, Calif.

New firm Baker & Eastlack Ventures has raised $3.6 million toward a $25 million fund aimed at medical-technology startups. Partners Kenneth Baker and Robert Eastlack began raising Baker & Eastlack Fund I LP in September with initial investments from individuals. The partners also are in discussions with a medical-device company that has expressed interest in the fund, Dr. Baker said. The team plans to fund eight to 10 medical-device startups that require less than $10 million to secure regulatory clearance, Dr. Baker said.

BioVentures Investors, Wellesley, Mass.

BioVentures Investors closed its fourth fund, BioVentures Investors IV LP, at $87 million to invest in medical-technology companies. The new fund was seeking $100 million, according to an August filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since its first close, the fund has backed four companies: Deep Vein Medical Inc., which is developing a prosthetic venous valve; CoNextions Medical, a developer of technology for repairing tendons; Endotronix Inc., which is focused on advancing the treatment of heart failure; and Locemia Solutions, which the firm sold to Eli Lilly and Co. BioVentures has raised more than $220 million across its four funds.

Boost VC, San Mateo, Calif.

Adam Draper's startup accelerator Boost VC is raising a new fund, said two people familiar with the matter. The fund will be about $50 million in size and will target startups in such areas as virtual reality and blockchain technology, one person said. Boost, which raised a $6.6 million fund in 2014, invests $10,000 to $100,000 for a 7% stake in each of its accelerator participants.

Canvas Ventures, Portola Valley, Calif.

Canvas Ventures closed its second fund at $300 million, nearly double the size of the fund it raised three years ago. Canvas closed a $175 million fund in 2013 after the firm spun out of Morgenthaler Ventures to invest in early-stage software companies, with a focus on Silicon Valley. Canvas generally invests $5 million to $20 million in a company through Series A and B rounds. The firm will continue to look for financial technology and health-care information-technology companies to back, although it also is interested in hardware and artificial intelligence.

Compound Ventures, New York

Early-stage venture-capital firm Metamorphic Ventures has rebranded as Compound Ventures and raised a new $50 million fund, the firm said in a blog post. Compound's third fund will invest in early-stage startups, according to the post. Its second fund closed with less than $70 million in 2014. The firm has already made five investments out of the new fund in companies including video-conferencing company Pluot Technologies Inc. and loan provider Finova Financial.

Cultivation Capital, St. Louis

Cultivation Capital is seeking $100 million for a financial-technology fund, Cultivation Capital Fintech Fund LP, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm has so far secured at least $20.5 million for the fund, according to the filing. Cultivation Capital invests primarily in technology and life-sciences companies. The firm also backs accelerator programs focused on areas such as financial technology, agriculture technology and women-led companies.

Fifth Wall Ventures, Los Angeles

A new firm called Fifth Wall Ventures has raised more than $20.3 million for Fifth Wall Ventures SPV I LP, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Another SEC filing dated May 19 indicated the group was seeking to raise $150 million for a fund called Fifth Wall Ventures LP.

Firebrand Ventures, Kansas City, Mo.

A former managing director for Techstars is looking to collect $15 million to invest in early-stage startups in the Midwest. John Fein, who ran three Techstars accelerator programs in Kansas City, is the founder and managing director of Firebrand Ventures. No commitments were recorded for Firebrand Ventures LP in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Firebrand targets investments in cities including San Antonio, Minneapolis, Boulder, Colo., and Columbus, Ohio.

Foundry Group, Boulder, Colo.

Foundry Group closed a $500 million pool to make growth-stage investments in startups. The vehicle is the firm's second such fund, but unlike its predecessor, which financed companies Foundry Group initially backed from its early-stage funds, Foundry Group Next LP also will target growth deals in companies that are new to the Foundry family and will invest in other early-stage venture funds. The firm missed out on opportunities because its prior Foundry Group Select Fund LP couldn't make outside investments, Managing Director Lindel Eakman said in a blog post. The new fund is more than twice the size of the firm's $225 million Select Fund, raised in 2013.

Greenhouse Capital Partners, Sausalito, Calif.

Seed and growth-equity firm Greenhouse Capital Partners collected at least $5.8 million in new capital for Greenhouse Capital Partners II LP, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Greenhouse seeks companies that promote healthy lifestyles and positive environmental impact in industries ranging from consumer products to Internet-of-Things technologies. The firm wrapped up its first pool of capital in 2007 at $11 million.

Greylock Partners, Menlo Park, Calif.

The fund, Rev1 NCH Fund I LLC, will finance four to six businesses over about three years, said Rev1 Chief Executive Tom Walker.

Pro Private Markets
VC Focus: Venture-Capital Investment Stabilizes as Late-Stage Bubble Deflates

The age of the unicorn seems to be over in venture capital as fewer giant rounds for later-stage companies have caused investment levels to fall closer to where they were before the run-up began in 2014.

At the peak of the mini-bubble, investors, including mutual funds and private-equity firms, pumped money into startups with valuations of a billion dollars or more, dubbed unicorns. In the third quarter of 2015, equity financings for U.S.-based venture-backed companies hit $20.07 billion, more than double the amount from the same period two years earlier, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by Private Equity Analyst published Dow Jones & Co. This year, the third quarter posted total investment of $11.72 billion, closer to 2013 levels.

Later rounds accounted for $7.02 billion during the third quarter, a bit less than the second quarter's $7.34 billion, according to VentureSource. That is more than the $5.43 billion they garnered in the third quarter of 2013 but well below the $12.79 billion in later-stage capital raised in last year's third quarter at the peak of the unicorn phenomenon.

The median size of a later-stage round slipped to $8.45 million in the third quarter, the lowest level since the third quarter of 2010. A year ago, the median was $18 million as money poured into companies with valuations of $1 billion or more.

Comparing third-quarter deal lists for 2015 and 2016 drives home the sense that giant later-stage rounds have lost their magic. There were 36 financings of $100 million or more in the third quarter of 2015, according to VentureSource. Topping the list were Uber Technologies Inc. and Social Finance Inc., which each raised $1 billion.

From July through September of this year, there were 11 deals of $100 million or more. The largest was an $850 million round for Airbnb Inc.

Although the pace has slowed, highly valued companies that are performing well can raise big rounds, which can skew quarterly numbers. In the second quarter of 2016, two companies, Uber and Snapchat Inc., raised a total of nearly $4.8 billion, accounting for 30% of investment in U.S. venture-backed companies during that period.

"Some categories are getting significant capital and continuing to see a bid-up on valuation, and then there are other areas that are less interesting," said Aspect Ventures co-founder Jennifer Fonstad, speaking at the recent WSJ Pro Private Equity Analyst Conference in New York. "A lot of that's driven by an economic cycle, and so, for example, at the beginning of an economic cycle there's a lot more investment in consumer-oriented software and services and e-commerce &and at the end of the cycle, you tend to see investments in enterprise-oriented businesses, like security."

Venture firms aren't having trouble raising funds, so investors are ready to make investments, despite the slowdown at the later stage, said Keval Desai, a partner at InterWest Partners. Investors have been shifting their attention to new hot categories such as machine learning, computer vision, virtual reality and augmented reality, he said. "Early stage has been pretty healthy, and deals are getting done at the seed and Series A level," Mr. Desai said.

Investment in first rounds during the third quarter totaled $1.89 billion, according to VentureSource. That is slower than last year's pace but far from the drop off seen in later rounds.

Most of the later-stage money went to technology companies, and they have felt the brunt of the investment slowdown. Health-care investment has been steadier. Investors pumped $3.23 billion into health care in the third quarter, up from $3.05 billion in the second quarter and down slightly from $3.61 billion in the third quarter of 2015.

Early this year, some technology company stocks in the public markets dropped sharply and the venture market also slowed, said David Yuan, a general partner at growth-stage firm Technology Crossover Ventures. But that has started to shift with more reasonable valuations for private companies and with recent IPOs such as Nutanix Inc. and Twilio Inc., Mr. Yuan said. "I think we're in a transition phase here. We've seen activity pick up considerably."

"People faced a lot of headwinds over the last three quarters," said Ben Narasin, a partner at Canvas Ventures. "But now we've moved into a calm sea with an occasional gust of wind."

Fintech Investors Find Comfort in Insurance

By Yuliya Chernova

The unexpectedly large turnout at a recent insurance technology conference in Las Vegas speaks to the changes in the landscape of the financial technology sector.

Organizers of InsureTech Connect had to scramble to pump audio and video from the opening session into an overflow room after a security guard blocked entry to the main hall as it got full, said Jay Weintraub, founder of the inaugural conference. He said he had set an aggressive target of 1,000 attendees, but 1,500 showed up.

Lending startups ruled the roost a year ago, but now many are in retreat. Conversely, companies operating in the insurance industry are picking up steam and gaining more attention.

About $945.6 million flowed into fintech in the third quarter of 2016, according to VentureSource, a 57% drop from the same period a year ago, when VCs deployed $2.2 billion into the broader sector. The amount invested in the most recent quarter was also down from the second quarter, when fintech companies raised $1.04 billion.

Investment in insurance technology companies is on the rise. VCs put $167.8 million to work in insurance in the third quarter. The sector saw more funding in each of this year's quarters than in any of the similar periods last year.

"Over the past 18 months or so the number of startup founders interested in the insurance space has grown dramatically," said Rodolfo Gonzalez, a partner at Foundation Capital. For venture investors who are looking for the next sector and view lending as "saturated," Mr. Gonzalez said, developments in insurance are encouraging.

Where Are the Tech IPOs? Michael Grimes of Morgan Stanley says not to worry, they're coming back next year

As managing director and head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, Michael Grimes is one of the tech industry's most prominent bankers.

He sat down with Wall Street Journal Financial Editor Dennis Berman to discuss the dearth of tech initial public offerings and why he thinks that's about to change.

Here are edited excerpts:

Pent-up demand

MR. BERMAN: You're arguably the most important banker in Silicon Valley. So where are the IPOs?

MR. GRIMES: They're coming. There have been 14 so far this year in tech, which is down from an average of 35 to 40 and probably over 40 for multiple years since 2004. I'd say next year you're going to be back probably to triple the current volume, about 30 or 40. There's really robust, pent-up demand right now.

MR. BERMAN: Why haven't companies in 2016 been willing to sell their shares?

MR. GRIMES: I think there's a lag effect. If we look back to January-February, if we look back at the prior 12-month class of tech IPOs, 80% of them were trading below issue price. There was a paucity of demand, and that kind of slows the pipeline.

Probably around the April-May time frame, that changed. And it's taken a while to percolate through. Add in the fact that anybody who wanted to raise money privately in the 2013 to 2015 time frame could, so [many startups] have capital and some have said they can benefit by staying private.

But the market now is really healthy. Demand is probably as high as I've seen it. Supply will catch up.

MR. BERMAN: Is there a mismatch between what the price expectations are between the sale side and the buyers?

MR. GRIMES: There has been over the past 12 months, but the mismatch is shrinking.

MR. BERMAN: And where are they meeting? More on the buyer's side or more on the seller's side?

MR. GRIMES: They're starting to meet closer on the seller's side. It has been on the buyer's side, for sure. But it has been moving up and it will continue to move up because of the capital being returned to investors from all the M&A activity.

MR. BERMAN: You have some pretty shocking numbers about the amount of money that's come in, and the amount of money that needs to go out. Can you share?

MR. GRIMES: It's as wide of a disparity as we've seen in 20 years. There has been $125 billion returned through tech M&A, just the cash portion, into the hands of investors last year. Another $75 billion this year so far, so $200 billion or $205 billion cumulative over that year and a half.

If you add up new issuance of all IPOs in tech and all secondary offerings, it's about $25 billion to $26 billion. So an eight-to-one ratio, double or triple what it has been in a year in the last 15 years.

New buyers emerge

MR. BERMAN: So a big part of this whole equation is M&A. And something fascinating is happening there. Can you explain?

MR. GRIMES: It's really that the buyers for U.S. tech assets have changed quite a bit, maybe permanently, and this is really new news.

Five to 10 years ago, the tech giants or tech midcaps won most tech assets. What has happened quietly is that they've gone from winning 58% to 60% to half that as three new groups of buyers have [emerged].

Private-equity firms are buying public tech companies. They are outbidding strategic buyers, and that's new. It has upped their win rate.

Then there are foreign buyers. China has gone from $300 million to $40 billion in a $250 billion tech M&A market. That's a pretty big portion up from a very small portion, so they're winning, too.

And the most interesting [group is the nontech firms.] General Electric's Jeff Immelt said at the end of 2013 that if you went to sleep an industrial company, you woke up the next morning a software, data and analytics company. So they've always been kind of kicking the tires on tech assets when we have them for sale, but they hadn't been paying up. Look what has happened in the past year.

MR. BERMAN: They have no other choice, right?

MR. GRIMES: Now they have no choice. They see the imperative. So Verizon Communications wins Fleetmatics Group, and Wal-Mart wins web retailer Jet.com. And they paid up. So they're up 250% in terms of volume.

The State of the Tech Startup: A Bit of a Mixed Bag; Fan Bao and Bill Gurley say valuations have pulled back, but it's far from a collapse

Startup valuations have inflated to extraordinary levels witness the rise of "unicorns," or startups with valuations of at least $1 billion. But fears of a big slowdown are rippling through Silicon Valley and China.

To get a handle on the situation, The Wall Street Journal's editor in chief, Gerard Baker, spoke with the founder and chief executive of investment bank China Renaissance, Fan Bao, and Bill Gurley, general partner of venture-capital firm Benchmark. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation.

The valuation picture

MR. BAKER: Bill, a year ago, you talked with one of my colleagues about valuations for some of these unicorns and about how choppy some of them looked. There's been somewhat of an adjustment in the last year. Tell us what's going on.

MR. GURLEY: It's a bit of a mixed bag from what I've seen. You do have an increase in the number of bankruptcies, layoffs, downsizings. But you haven't had the kind of wholesale kaput that you had in 2001 that scared everyone out of the water. As a result, you simultaneously still have new money coming in. That new money is not as educated as the previous money.

MR. BAKER: There's concerns about a lot of overvaluations in the Chinese market. What's your sense of where the Chinese tech market is?

MR. BAO: I think the early-stage deals, the temperature cooled down a little bit. But the late-stage deals, they still attract a lot of liquidity. The banks are providing financing behind that.

MR. BAKER: One big difference between now and, say, 2000-2001 is the rate environment. In 2000, the rates were starting to go up. Even though you've had a bit of a backup of bond yields in the last month, you've still got this very low-yielding environment.

MR. GURLEY: I don't think there's ever been a time where global interest rates have been this low for this long.

I'll borrow from Stan Druckenmiller, who gave a speech a year and a half ago. He said, "You're just going to see asset bubbles everywhere." Certainly, real estate, energy. This is happening everywhere because money's looking for a home.

MR. BAKER: Venture-capital investment in the U.S. from China, that's something else that continues to drive up valuations or prevent them from falling back down to more earthly levels. Do you expect that to continue?

MR. BAO: I think on the demand side, definitely, there is a need. Just simply a lack of enough investment opportunities in China. Secondly, the currency issue, RMB's depreciation. And obviously there is more demand on the part of investors to diversify assets outside China.

MR. BAKER: We haven't seen the big IPOs that we'd seen over the last few years. Is the hunger for IPOs coming back?

MR. GURLEY: One of the things that is particularly unique about this moment is we have record venture returns and record-low liquidity.

I think of it as paper returns no different than you might have had in other financial bubbles where things get marked up, and they're not actually trading at their value.

People that invest in the venture funds, they make distributions to their endowments and foundations. And they get bonused based on those returns. Because they're clocking it and it's working, their boss says, "Maybe we should give more money to this sector." It's a system that can be self-reinforcing in a very negative way.

MR. BAKER: Let's talk about Chinese acquisitions in the U.S. Do you expect to see more of that in the next year?

MR. BAO: There's been a lot of deals on the content side. There should be more deals on the technology side as well. Because if you look at our national champions, I think they realized they aren't invested in core technology compared to their U.S. counterparts. So there is a lot of catch-up to do. The best place to pick it up is still in this market.

Picking up companies

MR. BAKER: What about M&A among Silicon Valley companies? Whenever anybody's in play, there's a rumor that Google is interested. Time Warner. Do you expect to see Google, Facebook, Apple going big there?

MR. GURLEY: I think from a venture capitalist's perspective, it's almost an ideal situation. Because you don't have a single kingdom.

When I first got started, Microsoft owned the world. You had to deal with what they did. Here, we've got five companies of significant market cap [Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft] who are all competing with one another. Many of them have large cash balance sheets. So that sounds to me like a perfect recipe.

LBO Focus: Tech Boom Helps Sponsors Recover M&A Ground in Third Quarter

After sputtering at the start of the year, private-equity deal makers hit the gas in the third quarter with the help of a jump start by the technology sector.

Tech was far and away the most popular area for deal making by financial sponsors in the third quarter, and a string of big deals in the sector helped private equity shake off the mergers and acquisitions lull that began the year.

Though the overall number of deals and total deal value slipped from the third quarter of last year, the tech sector more than pulled its weight, accounting for 46.2% of the total value of sponsor-backed M&A volume announced in the third quarter of this year, according to data tracker Dealogic Ltd.

"Dollar value and volume are both down from last year but not cratering, and we're also seeing an increase in both from [the first quarter of] this year," said Barry Curtis, who heads the private-equity group in Deloitte & Touche LLP's M&A advisory-services practice. "Tech is clearly leading the way."

Tech once was considered a bad fit for the leveraged-buyout model, but times have changed. Three of the five biggest private equity-backed deals from July through September were for technology companies: Apollo Global Management LLC's $4.4 billion purchase of Rackspace Hosting Inc., Platinum Equity's $4 billion deal for Emerson Electric Co.'s computing and power business and KKR & Co.'s $3.3 billion takeover of Epicor Software Corp.

This cluster of large deals made it an unusually good quarter for private equity-backed tech deals there were 40 deals announced, worth a combined $21.17 billion and is a reflection of private-equity firms' growing comfort in committing large sums to the sector, said Hugh MacArthur, a partner and the head of the global private-equity practice at consulting firm Bain & Co.

Private-equity firms have turned their sights from turnarounds to large, healthy tech companies, which often garner higher prices and lead to bigger deals. Other pricey private equity-backed tech deals in the third quarter were TPG's acquisition of a majority stake in McAfee, the computer-security unit of Intel Corp., and Vista Equity Partners' $1.61 billion take-private deal for network security company Infoblox Inc.

Tech could continue to be the major driver of sponsor-backed M&A for some time because of the amount of cash private-equity firms are preparing to deploy in the sector. Vista, of Austin, Texas, has collected at least $8.9 billion for its latest fund targeting software and information-technology buyouts and could gather as much as $10 billion, Private Equity Analyst previously reported. Thoma Bravo, a firm that invests in software and tech-based services, closed a $7.6 million fund in September.

All this fresh capital could help fourth-quarter sponsor-backed M&A activity approach or even exceed that of the third, industry observers say.

Along with their healthy appetite for tech, private-equity firms are beginning to dip their toes back into energy, betting that oil prices could be ready to rebound.

"There is a tremendous pipeline of deals [and] a tremendous desire to get things done and push things through," said Mr. MacArthur. "We can't tell what deals will go through, but we'd expect to see a [fourth quarter] that is ahead of even the [third-quarter] base."

The third quarter was strong overall compared with historical trends for private equity-backed M&A, though propped up somewhat by big tech deals. Sponsors announced 160 investments totaling $45.79 billion, the third-largest quarterly dollar figure since 2007, according to Dealogic.

Still, the number of deals and the total deal value were lower than the same period a year ago, when PE firms announced 215 acquisitions for a total of $56.74 billion. The decline in PE-backed deals mirrored a dip in U.S. M&A overall, with total announced deal value slipping to $371 billion, 43% lower than in the third quarter of 2015.

But the third quarter was an improvement from the early months of the year, when many firms found their deal pipelines empty after a year of frenetic activity, and economic anxiety abroad particularly over China's slowdown caused others to put deals on hold. In the first quarter, 157 U.S. sponsor-backed deals worth a total of $17.51 billion were announced, the lowest quarterly deal volume in four years. Deal volume rebounded to a healthy but unspectacular $33.95 billion in the second quarter.

M&A has been muted this year compared to last because of "pricing and a little bit of caution," as sponsors have begun to shy from the high prices some sellers are demanding, said Mr. Curtis. This is particularly true for larger acquisitions, which typically command higher multiples. The largest U.S. private equity-backed deal announced this year was Hellman & Friedman's planned acquisition of health-care services provider MultiPlan Inc. for $7.5 billion.

Instead of chasing whales, private-equity firms have sought to scoop up some smaller fish, focusing on deals in the $1 billion to $4 billion range or slapping together a series of small deals to gain scale.

"A lot of private-equity [firms], given the high valuations, are finding deals in the middle market and making a series of add-on transactions later to form a large company that they can exit successfully," said Mr. Curtis.

Apart from tech, other important sectors had muted quarters. The $21.17 billion in tech deals dwarfed the next most active sector, professional services, which had 23 deals announced totaling $6.07 billion in value, according to Dealogic. The largest was the purchase by Onex Corp. and Baring Private Equity Asia of Clarivate Analytics, Thomson Reuters Corp.'s intellectual property and science business, for $3.55 billion, according to Dealogic.

The second-biggest sponsor-backed deal last quarter, behind Apollo's purchase of Rackspace, was the $4 billion takeover of mixed-martial-arts fight organizer Ultimate Fighting Championship by the talent agency WME-IMG Hollywood, the investment firm of billionaire Michael Dell, and private-equity firms Silver Lake and KKR & Co.

Deals in health care, one of the most popular sectors for private equity over the past few years, slipped somewhat after a strong second quarter. It was the third most popular sector, with 23 deals totaling $4.53 billion, a dip from the second quarter's total announced deal volume of $11.56 billion in 16 deals. The largest health-care deals in the quarter were Advent International Corp.'s purchase of a 50% stake in InVentiv Group Holdings Inc. for $1.9 billion and Cinven's $1.4 billion acquisition of clinical-trial company BioClinica Inc.

Still, health care's long-term resilience and growth trends suggest private-equity interest won't wane any time soon, industry participants say.

"Health care has the recession-proof dynamic that private equity likes, and that allows firms to lean in a little more on pricing," said Andrew Cristinzio, the head of private equity for consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

Though private-equity firms are eschewing the $6 billion or $7 billion deals they sought before the financial downturn of the last decade, the M&A pace should remain robust through the next year, despite complaints about high multiples, observers say. With cost of capital low and stock prices high, the time "is very ripe for corporate acquisitions," and "private equity is definitely keeping its share" of the M&A market, said Mr. Curtis.

"It's putting capital to work and it's very active, but we're just not seeing the big public-to-privates that we've seen in the past," he said.

As businesses increasingly court international customers, they run into language barriers.

Y Combinator alum Unbabel Inc. is a software specialist that hopes to act as a multilingual liaison with a combination of artificial intelligence and human interpreters to help companies translate customer service requests quickly. It network of about 40,000 human editors supports 24 different languages.

Unbabel's software roughly translates a message from a customer service representative, and then one of Unbabel's contractors checks and makes any needed corrections. The San Francisco company announced on Monday it raised $5 million from lead investors Notion Capital and Caixa Capital, having raised $8 million to date.

Faber Ventures and Schilling Capital Partners also participated.

The three-year-old company initially focused on email requests and was able to translate questions from customers and responses from companies in less than 20 minutes.

But as customer service increasingly moves to chat and messaging platforms, Unbabel Chief Executive Vasco Calais Pedro says the company has sped up the time it takes to do a translation. It now can translate a message in less than 90 seconds.

Mr. Pedro said the company brought on London-based as Notion Capital as an investor because of its understanding of European markets.

"Europe is the biggest translation market," he said.

The company lists Oculus VR, Pinterest Inc., Trello Inc., Change.org Inc. and MyFitnessPal Inc. among its customers on its website.

Emarsys Inc., a provider of marketing-automation software, announced that it has received a $22.3 million debt investment from TPG Specialty Lending Europe, the European-focused specialty lending arm of TPG's dedicated credit and special situations platform.

Emarsys, which has offices in Vienna, provides business to consumer marketing software and a marketing cloud for retail and online-commerce. The company's marketing cloud collects data to create an overview of customers, crafts messages to customers, orchestrates marketing activities and reports back on customer behavior.

The new debt deal brings the company's total financing in the past 24 months to $55.3 million, according to a news release about the deal. In September 2014, Emarsys received $33 million in Series A equity round of funding from Vector Capital, a San Francisco-based private-equity firm.

Ohad Hecht, the chief executive of Emarsys, said the company decided to partner with TPG after receiving interest from over five different firms across private equity, venture capital and growth equity.

The company plans to use TPG's funding to help accelerate growth and make investments in research and development, artificial intelligence and data science, according to a news release. Emarsys will also look to increase market share in key geographies and vertical industries.

Mr. Hecht said that the company has been using artificial intelligence in its products, noting that machine learning algorithms have gradually replaced decision making by marketers over the years.

Additionally, Mr. Hecht said that the company will consider acquisitions in the space. The company had previously acquired Scarab Research, a machine learning company.

The company's customers include eBay Inc., Toys "R" Us, Nike Inc., Volvo, American Express and L'Oral, according to the release. Emarsys currently serves over 1,500 clients in 140 countries.

TPG Specialty Lending Europe is an investment platform of TPG Special Situations Partners, the credit and special situations platform of private-equity firm TPG. The unit makes investments in companies, sponsors and advisers based in the U.K., Ireland and continental Europe, according to the its website.

Vector invests in the technology space. Since its founding, the private-equity firm has invested $1.6 billion in over 40 technology companies, according to its website.

WSJDLIVE (A Special Report) --- Where Are the Tech IPOs? Michael Grimes of Morgan Stanley says not to worry, they're coming back next year

As managing director and head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, Michael Grimes is one of the tech industry's most prominent bankers.

He sat down with Wall Street Journal Financial Editor Dennis Berman to discuss the dearth of tech initial public offerings and why he thinks that's about to change.

Here are edited excerpts:

MR. BERMAN: You're arguably the most important banker in Silicon Valley. So where are the IPOs?

MR. GRIMES: They're coming. There have been 14 so far this year in tech, which is down from an average of 35 to 40 -- and probably over 40 for multiple years since 2004. I'd say next year you're going to be back probably to triple the current volume, about 30 or 40. There's really robust, pent-up demand right now.

MR. BERMAN: Why haven't companies in 2016 been willing to sell their shares?

MR. GRIMES: I think there's a lag effect. If we look back to January-February, if we look back at the prior 12-month class of tech IPOs, 80% of them were trading below issue price. There was a paucity of demand, and that kind of slows the pipeline. Probably around the April-May time frame, that changed. And it's taken a while to percolate through. Add in the fact that anybody who wanted to raise money privately in the 2013 to 2015 time frame could, so [many startups] have capital and some have said they can benefit by staying private.

But the market now is really healthy. Demand is probably as high as I've seen it. Supply will catch up.

MR. BERMAN: Is there a mismatch between what the price expectations are between the sale side and the buyers?

MR. GRIMES: There has been over the past 12 months, but the mismatch is shrinking.

MR. BERMAN: And where are they meeting? More on the buyer's side or more on the seller's side?

MR. GRIMES: They're starting to meet closer on the seller's side. It has been on the buyer's side, for sure. But it has been moving up and it will continue to move up because of the capital being returned to investors from all the M&A activity.

MR. BERMAN: You have some pretty shocking numbers about the amount of money that's come in, and the amount of money that needs to go out. Can you share?

MR. GRIMES: It's as wide of a disparity as we've seen in 20 years. There has been $125 billion returned through tech M&A, just the cash portion, into the hands of investors last year. Another $75 billion this year so far, so $200 billion or $205 billion cumulative over that year and a half.

If you add up new issuance of all IPOs in tech and all secondary offerings, it's about $25 billion to $26 billion. So an eight-to-one ratio, double or triple what it has been in a year in the last 15 years.

MR. BERMAN: So a big part of this whole equation is M&A. And something fascinating is happening there. Can you explain?

MR. GRIMES: It's really that the buyers for U.S. tech assets have changed quite a bit, maybe permanently, and this is really new news. Five to 10 years ago, the tech giants or tech midcaps won most tech assets. What has happened quietly is that they've gone from winning 58% to 60% to half that as three new groups of buyers have [emerged]. Private-equity firms are buying public tech companies. They are outbidding strategic buyers, and that's new. It has upped their win rate.

Then there are foreign buyers. China has gone from $300 million to $40 billion in a $250 billion tech M&A market. That's a pretty big portion up from a very small portion, so they're winning, too.

And the most interesting [group is the nontech firms.] General Electric's Jeff Immelt said at the end of 2013 that if you went to sleep an industrial company, you woke up the next morning a software, data and analytics company. So they've always been kind of kicking the tires on tech assets when we have them for sale, but they hadn't been paying up. Look what has happened in the past year.

MR. BERMAN: They have no other choice, right?

MR. GRIMES: Now they have no choice. They see the imperative. So Verizon Communications wins Fleetmatics Group, and Wal-Mart wins web retailer Jet.com. And they paid up. So they're up 250% in terms of volume.

Online Banks Sweat Over Thieves Posing as Clients

Silicon Valley banking upstarts have technology for almost everything, but they are still trying to catch up with thieves posing as customers.

New research shows that on an average day, about 4.5% of people who take an unsecured personal loan go back for seconds at other lenders later that day. The behavior, called "loan stacking," more than doubled from 2013 to 2015, according to credit-reporting firm TransUnion.

Here is why the lenders care: Borrowers who take out a second loan within 15 days are four times as likely to be later identified as fraudsters, the credit firm found. A third loan makes borrowers 10 times as likely to be frauds. "When money is moving out the door so quickly, people take everything in one shot and game the system," said Pat Phelan, senior vice president at TransUnion.

Online lenders sometimes have a tougher job than banks or credit unions to screen customers, especially because many tout the speed with which consumers can get loan approvals. It is also more common for online lenders to attract people they have never done business with before, because they don't offer other financial products such as checking accounts or credit cards. The web-based companies typically make decisions to lend people up to tens of thousands of dollars in as little as a day or two on the basis of a borrower's credit and income history.

Similar frauds, by contrast, are much less common with bank-issued credit cards. An earlier TransUnion study estimated that only 0.1% of credit-card applicants took a card, made a few payments, and then maxed it out and vanished, a scam known as a "bust-out."

Now, some of the biggest online lenders, including LendingClub Corp. and Avant Inc., are taking more steps to combat the problem by sharing data about who is taking out their loans as well as using new technology to verify borrowers' identity through mobile phones.

TransUnion this month launched an exchange where lenders can share data in real time about who is seeking loans, for the purpose of detecting multiple applications. Using a neutral party such as TransUnion, lenders can see if people are taking out multiple loans without directly sharing customer information. LendingClub and Avant are among those that have signed up.

Separately, LendingClub, Prosper Marketplace Inc. and other firms last week said they joined a consortium created by ID Analytics LLC to detect multiple loan applications. "Leveraging collective data . . . will further strengthen the experience for borrowers and lenders alike," a LendingClub spokesman said. He said the lender "relies on a variety of internal and external tools" to analyze fraud risk.

Mess Spreads at India Conglomerate Tata

India's most important conglomerate is in turmoil. Investors seem to be taking the news too lightly.

The board of Tata Sons ousted its first nonfamily chairman, Cyrus Mistry, earlier this week, reversing what investors had seen as a fresh start for the tightly controlled group of companies, which generates $100 billion in sales across 29 listed companies and other unlisted ones. Interests span tea and coffee, IT outsourcing and Jaguar automobiles.

Mr. Mistry fired back Wednesday in a letter, accusing his former employer of hiding $18 billion of potential write-downs over an unspecified period across five Tata companies, including Tata Motors and Tata Steel Europe. Mr. Mistry complained of split power centers and being cornered into being a "lame duck." Notably, he alleges potential financial issues at the various companies and that Ratan Tata's behind-the-scenes maneuvers reduced the board members to "mere postmen," whose actions risked the company's violating securities regulations.

Shares of Tata Motors, which owns luxury brand Jaguar Land Rover, have fallen 6% since Mr. Mistry's ousting but still are up 34% this year. JLR, which makes up about three-quarters of the unit's revenue, faces storm clouds in its best market, China. A string of recent quarterly earnings from Chinese car makers points to severe pricing pressures and a turning tide. Tata Motors gets a credit-rating lift from parent Tata Sons. If this is imperiled, things look less robust for its expensive capital structure.

The other major concern should be with Tata Steel. The highly indebted steel company -- with debt approximately 10 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Lucror Analytics -- remains fraught with issues including the contentious sale of its U.K. operations and a now-teetering plan to combine its European operations with Thyssenkrupp AG.

Shares of most of the Tata listed companies have fallen this week but not by much, given the dysfunction shown. Meanwhile, yields on Tata Motors and Tata Steel bonds due 2020 have ticked up since Mr. Mistry was ousted, as bondholders fret about whether Mr. Mistry's complaints are real or merely the ravings of a disgruntled ex-chairman.

It is worth noting that Mr. Mistry's family retains 18% of holding company Tata Sons, so his incentives to create value remain.

Back in 2012, it took the conglomerate a year to appoint Mr. Mistry as chairman when Mr. Tata, the family patriarch, supposedly stepped aside. With no heirs, Mr. Tata was, in effect, anointing Mr. Mistry, whose sister is married to Mr. Tata's half brother, as the next generation.

Now, Mr. Tata is officially back at the helm -- but with a huge mess on his hands.

-- Anjani Trivedi

U.K. Economy Can't Ignore Brexit Forever

The U.K. economy hasn't been knocked off course by Brexit yet. That will curb the Bank of England's appetite for action for now.

Thursday's data showed forecast-beating growth in the third quarter of 0.5%, certainly welcome news, and in line with the average pace of the previous four quarters, suggesting some momentum. Gross domestic product is now 8.2% above its precrisis peak, the Office for National Statistics said.

But there also are familiar reasons for concern. U.K. officials have talked a lot about rebalancing the economy to revive manufacturing and reduce reliance on services, but nothing has changed. Growth in the third quarter was all down to services, with agriculture, production and construction output declining.

GDP is backward-looking, and the Brexit debate has moved on since the end of September. The clash between the politics and economics over the U.K.'s departure from the European Union has only really just got going. Sterling has fallen by more than 5% against the dollar in October, shaken by rhetoric from U.K. politicians that has suggested a greater risk of economic disruption in the future.

That is likely to push inflation up further and faster than the BOE had been expecting. It also likely is to lead to real wages being squeezed again in 2017 -- a painful prospect for U.K. consumers. The lack of clarity over the shape and form of Brexit is likely to weigh on investment, too.

The BOE came in all guns blazing in August, cutting rates and restarting bond purchases. Next week's policy meeting looks unlikely now to lead to new action, as the economy has clearly been more resilient than policy makers feared.

The reaction of sterling, which has become the Brexit barometer, tells the story: It rose briefly against the dollar Thursday morning but then fell back. Good economic news is only worth so much in the face of so much political uncertainty.

-- Richard Barley

Deutsche Is

Missing Out

On Trading

Bond trading has given a big boost to Barclays and Deutsche Bank in the third quarter, but the recovery isn't nearly as spectacular as for U.S. rivals.

The difference in performance between the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean will add to the view that stronger and less distracted U.S. banks are continuing to take market share from European rivals, many of which are still restructuring and reshaping their businesses eight years after the financial crisis.

Deutsche's bond-trading revenue was up 14% in the third quarter from the same period last year, a much weaker recovery than at Barclays, which had 40% growth in credit and macro revenues combined.

Barclays is much more tilted toward U.S. markets, and its numbers were in line with U.S. peers, most of whose third-quarter revenues were up by 35% to 50% from the same quarter last year. However, Barclays reports its revenue in pounds, and so got a big boost from the fall in the British currency since the Brexit vote at the end of the second quarter.

With sterling down drastically against the U.S. dollar and the euro since the summer, Barclays's credit and macro revenues in constant currencies might actually have fallen quarter over quarter, depending on the mix of businesses between the U.K. and U.S., and be up only perhaps 20% compared with the third quarter last year.

Numbers like these show that even with a recovery in bond trading, European banks still seem to be falling behind.

-- Paul J. Davies

Overheard

One-time sports-apparel juggernaut Under Armour exhorts potential customers to "Protect This House."

The company itself racked up a formidable record in protecting its reputation for consistency.

It has strung together 24 consecutive quarters of beating analysts' consensus expectations and nearly that many of achieving at least 20% year-over-year sales growth.

But, like all sorts of impressive individual statistics, they pale in comparison to the scoreboard investors really care about: the share price.

They had no complaints about Under Armour for years as the share price surged over 30-fold in a little over six years through last September.

Since then, though, it has shed more than two-thirds of its value, including a 13% plunge Tuesday after the company reported its quarterly results.

No, Under Armour didn't lag behind expectations. In fact, it beat analyst consensus by 17%, according to FactSet.

Yet the stock has now dropped following eight of its past 13 results announcements, not counting a plunge after a surprise profit warning earlier this year.

With investors no longer impressed by the big numbers it is putting up, this house is in need of some remodeling.

Now, some of the biggest online lenders, including LendingClub Corp. and Avant Inc., are taking more steps to combat the problem by sharing data about who is taking out their loans as well as using new technology to verify borrowers' identity through mobile phones.

TransUnion this month launched an exchange where lenders can share data in real time about who is seeking loans, for the purpose of detecting multiple applications. Using a neutral party such as TransUnion, lenders can see if people are taking out multiple loans without directly sharing customer information. LendingClub and Avant are among those that have signed up; TransUnion says eight of the 10 largest online lenders are participating.

Separately, LendingClub, Prosper Marketplace Inc. and other firms this week said they joined a consortium created by ID Analytics LLC to similarly detect multiple loan applications.

"Leveraging collective data...will further strengthen the experience for borrowers and lenders alike," a LendingClub spokesman said. He said the lender "relies on a variety of internal and external tools" to analyze fraud risk.

The online lenders are expanding their methods to catch up with big banks, which Mr. Phelan of TransUnion said use voluminous data histories and vast compliance departments to try to spot people with fraudulent identities. Some banks are also using biometric technology, such as fingerprints and selfies, to double-check the identity of their existing customers.

From J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to Bank of America Corp., lending giants are increasingly competing with online upstarts. Both of those banks have more than 20 million users for their mobile applications, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence a channel they can use to offer new services to existing retail customers.

J.P. Morgan finance chief Marianne Lake said on the company's earnings call this month that the bank was working to clear anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer hurdles so it could sign up more customers digitally rather than in branches.

Online lenders are also ramping up security as they boost their loan growth and as they face scrutiny from investors, who in recent months have become more concerned about the quality of loans and their performance.

Kabbage Inc., an online business lender that launched in 2011, this year began allowing borrowers to apply entirely through a mobile app. This asks applicants to use their phone to take a picture of a government ID, such as a driver's license.

That photo of an ID is verified by Mitek Systems Inc., which charges a transaction fee for the service, a follow-on to a popular feature offered by the company that analyzes pictures of checks taken by mobile phones.

Before starting the new verification product, Kabbage had been rejecting as many as 3% of its daily online loan applications as potential cases of fraud, said the firm's CEO, Rob Frohwein. The firm feared it might be turning away some legitimate borrowers, he added.

Now, Kabbage anticipates getting that rate down to about 0.5%. "Additional technology doesn't mean fraud attempts will go down, but we'll be able to accept more applications" as the firm gets more adept at rooting out suspicious borrowers, Mr. Frohwein says.

Avant, the Chicago-based online lender, also recently began using its mobile app for new borrower applications, which allows it to capture the photo of the borrowers' ID as an element in its verification process, according to the company.

Not all online lenders use a mobile app for new borrowers. At LendingClub borrowers apply through a website, and are called on the phone to confirm information or request additional documents when the lender deems it necessary. Prosper works with software company The ID Co. to help confirm applicants' identities with their bank accounts, as one tool to identify customers.

Nissan Eyes Sale of Auto Parts Maker Calsonic Kansei Stake to KKR

Nissan Motor Co. has solidified plans to sell its interest in group auto parts maker Calsonic Kansei Corp. to KKR & Co., aiming to fund the development of cutting-edge technology, The Nikkei reported in its Friday morning editions.

KKR intends to acquire all outstanding Calsonic Kansei shares, including Nissan's 41.6% stake, via a tender offer. The total purchase price could reach around Y400 billion ($3.8 billion). Calsonic Kansei is listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Other bidders for Nissan's stake included MBK Partners an Asian fund investing in Chinese, Japanese and South Korean companies and Bain Capital. The automaker plans to grant preferential negotiating rights to New York firm KKR, which made the best offer in the recently completed second round of bidding. An official agreement will likely be signed within the year.

Calsonic Kansei is the largest parts maker affiliated with Nissan, with a product lineup including heat exchangers, air conditioners and exhaust systems. Employing roughly 22,000 people, it reported sales of Y1.05 trillion and an operating profit of Y38.2 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31. The company's market capitalization stands at Y281.4 billion based on Thursday's closing price.

Though results have been solid thanks to such factors as Nissan's sales growth in North America, Calsonic Kansei relies on the automaker for around 80% of sales. With self-driving cars starting to take off, funding is needed for artificial-intelligence-related development in such areas as sensors and image-recognition technology. Nissan will apply the proceeds from the sale toward related research as well as acquiring companies in the field.

Nissan is reshuffling its corporate family to orient it more toward developing next-generation vehicles. The automaker sold its roughly 20% stake in Kinugawa Rubber Industrial Co. to the Development Bank of Japan this summer and plans to unload its interest in battery maker Automotive Energy Supply Corp., a joint venture with NEC Corp. Meanwhile, Nissan and partner Groupe Renault recently announced that they would acquire French cloud computing startup Sylpheo.

Microsoft Corp.'s Bob Kelly is joining Ignition Partners to serve as managing director of its Seattle-area office.

The firm, which also operates in Los Altos, Calif., seeks to invest in enterprise IT, cloud computing and big data.

Mr. Kelly previously served as Microsoft's corporate vice president for cloud and enterprise business development, where he evaluated cloud startups to gauge how their strategies might align with Microsoft's.

He said that his Microsoft experience will help him as he joins the firm's office in Seattle which he called "cloud city" owing to its as Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc.

He also has served as an adviser at 9Mile Labs, a Seattle-based accelerator.

Mr. Kelly said that Microsoft's "best days are still ahead of it" and that he isn't running away from the company but rather, "I'm running to something."

Mr. Kelly says his move from Microsoft to venture capital is the second big career change that he has made.

Although Mr. Kelly's experience at Microsoft is more directly aligned with the kinds of work he will do in venture capital, he says his academic background will also prove valuable. He holds a doctorate in English literature from the University of Dallas.

Venture capital, he said, is all about the product, the market and the people behind the company. He said his 20 years at Microsoft taught him about market and product.

"Literature is all about people," he said. "My background in literature helped me understand people and motivations."

Ackerman's Take: Last Stand for New Jersey's Scott Garrett? The Wall Street Journal's financial regulation newsletter for Thursday, October 27, 2016.

Ackerman's Take: Last Stand for New Jersey's Scott Garrett?

Wall Street Braces for New Democratic Muscle in the Senate

TARP Official to Congress: Require CEOs to Confirm No Wrongdoing at Their Firms

Democratic Senators Call for Stricter Rules on Wall Street Pay

Market Volatility Has Currency Traders Abandoning a Tool to Stop Losses

Last Stand for New Jersey's Scott Garrett?

Should "http://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-braces-for-new-democratic-muscle-in-the-senate-1477564202" next month, Rep. Scott Garrett of New Jersey has a good chance of being one of the top Republican casualties.

Mr. Garrett, 57 years old, has generally been seen throughout his political career as an ally of financial firms and a harsh critic of financial regulators. He is a founding member of the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/house-conservatives-pose-a-hurdle-for-kevin-mccarthys-rise-to-speaker-1444154897", an alliance of hardline conservatives that last year led the drive to oust then-Speaker John Boehner. He is also chairman of an important House Financial Services subcommittee, a powerful post that oversees financial regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Yet Mr. Garrett's support among financial firms has all but dried up and now he's in the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/n-j-republican-congressman-scott-garrett-is-in-competitive-race-with-newcomer-1469654735" against Democrat Josh Gottheimer, a former Microsoft Corp. executive.

Mr. Garrett's change of political fortune stems from anti-gay remarks he reportedly made to Republican lawmakers in a closed-door meeting last year that were then leaked to the media. Almost immediately, big banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stopped contributing to him, as did the Big Four accounting firms.

The drop-off in contributions from financial firms has been stark, particularly in the accounting industry. While accountants and accounting political action committees have previously been among Mr. Garrett's top donors, they have donated only $17,008 to Mr. Garrett's campaign and his leadership PAC in the current campaign cycle, down from $78,999 in the 2014 cycle, according to data recently compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.

The Big Four accounting firms believe Mr. Garrett is now out to get them, according to people familiar with their thinking. Just before the House recessed last month, the New Jersey lawmaker "http://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-lawmaker-wants-to-allow-auditor-watchdog-to-disclose-disciplinary-cases-1474590364" siding with the firms' regulator in a fight about whether the regulator's enforcement actions should be made public. That legislation, which has been introduced by other lawmakers in prior years but never moved through Mr. Garrett's panel, is stridently opposed by the firms. In an interview, Mr. Garrett denied he was seeking retribution, saying the Big Four simply don't wish to have "transparency and accountability in their business dealings."

Meanwhile, Mr. Garrett "is in deep electoral danger and has no one to blame but himself," according to the Cook Political Report. A recent poll by Garin-Hart-Yang for the Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC finds Mr. Gottheimer surging ahead of Mr. Garrett 48% to 41% after a sustained barrage of ads accusing Mr. Garrett of bigotry and holding views of a "rural Alabama conservative," according to Cook.

Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), the famed civil-rights leader, "http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2016/10/civil_rights_leader_stumps_for_gottheimer_in_heated_congressional_race.html" in New Jersey this week, saying the candidate will bring people together.

In an unexpected twist, some top Republicans are supporting the Democrat. Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and a longtime Republican fundraiser, told The Wall Street Journal she is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hewlett-packards-whitman-shakes-up-new-jersey-house-race-1476147040" because she believes the incumbent lawmaker is a "Republican extremist." Mr. Garrett responded in the Journal by doubting Ms. Whitman's Republican bona fides.

Mr. Garrett could yet prevail, but the momentum in the race certainly appears against him.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Wall Street Braces for New Democratic Muscle in the Senate

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-braces-for-new-democratic-muscle-in-the-senate-1477564202" has Wall Street increasingly focused on the battle for control of Congress and bracing for a less friendly environment if Democrats retake the Senate and give new clout to the party's left wing.

"It's not Hillary Clinton we are worried about. It's the influence that the liberals have on her," said Richard Hunt, president and chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association trade group. He cited Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, particularly Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has regularly put the financial industry on the defensive, most recently during hearings over Wells Fargo & Co.'s scandal.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/rubins-take-progressives-set-terms-for-possible-clinton-appointments-1477394711"

TARP Official to Congress: Require CEOs to Confirm No Wrongdoing at Their Firms

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/tarp-official-to-congress-require-ceos-to-certify-that-there-is-no-wrongdoing-at-their-companies-1477490810?tesla=y" on Wednesday asked Congress to require chief executives on Wall Street and elsewhere to certify annually that they found "no criminal conduct or civil fraud in their organization."

The proposal could have far-reaching effects if adopted. Under current rules, prosecutors often have a hard time proving intentional wrongdoing on the part of senior officials, who are several layers removed from misconduct of lower-level employees.

Democratic Senators Call for Stricter Rules on Wall Street Pay

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/democratic-senators-call-for-stricter-rules-on-wall-street-pay-1477522126" urged federal regulators to strengthen proposed rules governing Wall Street pay practices, saying the recent scandal at Wells Fargo & Co. underscored the need to hold executives accountable for misconduct.

The request comes as policy makers rush to complete the rules before President Barack Obama leaves office in January. The senators laid out their ideas in a letter addressed to the heads of six federal agencies responsible for crafting the pay rules. The lawmakers who signed the letter include Sens. Robert Menendez of New Jersey; Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee; and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the leading congressional critic of Wall Street.

Market Volatility Has Currency Traders Abandoning a Tool to Stop Losses

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/market-volatility-has-currency-traders-abandoning-a-tool-to-stop-losses-1477560601", worried that events such as the pound's recent collapse could become more common, are abandoning an automated trading mechanism that was supposed to protect them from losses after big market swings.

The trading mechanism, known as a stop-loss order, is meant to sell an investor's position as soon as a currency hits a preset level against another currency. Banks and electronic trading platforms often struggle to execute the orders at exactly the level an investor requested, resulting in trades below the indicated price even when markets are relatively calm. The rise in "flash crashes" sudden drops that often quickly reverse has made the orders even more risky and ineffective, investors say.

WSJ Pro: OCC Offers to Restructure to Assist Innovation at Banks and Fintech Firms

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/occ-offers-to-restructure-to-assist-innovation-at-banks-and-fintech-firms-1477515650" on Wednesday released its plan for restructuring the agency to make it easier to work with banks and fintech firms eager to launch innovative financial products.

The changes to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency follow comments from the industry and consumers on how to regulate the emerging fintech sector. The final recommendations center on creating a stand-alone office next year to be the "clearinghouse" for all fintech requests, ranging from launching fintech pilot programs, training agency staff and coordinating with other regulators.

WSJ Pro: Brexit Won't Lead to Financial Regulation  Bonfire,' Says Bank of England Official

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-wont-lead-to-financial-regulation-bonfire-says-bank-of-england-official-1477491580" bankers Wednesday not to expect a post-Brexit bonfire of financial regulations.

Sam Woods, deputy governor for prudential regulation, said in speech in London's financial district that Britons' decision to take the U.K. out of the European Union wouldn't lead to a rolling back of postcrisis financial reforms. Regulators around the world have stuffed banks with extra capital and ordered them to hold piles of easily-salable assets to prevent a repeat of the banking blowup that by 2009 had led to a global recession.

SEC Proposal Eases Path of Dissidents Waging Campaigns for Corporate Boards

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-to-vote-on-proposal-easing-path-of-dissidents-to-corporate-boards-1477491499" a company's board of directors would get a boost for their campaigns under a proposal approved Wednesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The SEC's proposal, which passed on a 2-1 vote, would require companies to give shareholders a single ballot listing all candidates in a contested board election. The SEC would have to take public comments on the proposal and vote on it a second time before the new rule could take effect. Currently, voters typically receive two sets of ballots, each featuring a rival slate of board candidates.

Morgan Stanley Will Keep Commission-Based IRAs

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-will-keep-commission-based-iras-1477508411" brokerage customers keep commission-based accounts once new government conflict rules take effect, a move directly opposite the approach that its biggest rival on Wall Street, Merrill Lynch, is taking.

Under the move, Morgan Stanley will allow its nearly 16,000 brokers to use an exemption under the so-called fiduciary rule to continue offering individual retirement accounts that charge investors for each transaction made. The fiduciary rule, drafted by the Labor Department and set to start taking effect in April, requires brokers to put the interests of retirement savers ahead of their own and firms to justify varying levels of compensation in IRAs.

Lynn Tilton Loses Delaware Court Fight Over Zohar Funds' Records

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lynn-tilton-loses-delaware-court-fight-over-zohar-funds-records-1477518636" has found that turnaround executive Lynn Tilton's Patriarch Partners breached its duty to hand over business records when it surrendered control of the investment funds that fed cash to her collection of troubled companies.

Alvarez & Marsal, which stepped into the role of managing the $2.5 billion Zohar funds earlier this year, won a tug of war over information with Ms. Tilton, a former distressed-company financier who now manages her family office. The ruling comes as Ms. Tilton is on trial in New York on charges of civil fraud brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC contends that she hid losses in the investment funds, dubbed Zohar I, II and III, from investors. She has denied the SEC allegations.

Reaction to AT&T-Time Warner Deal Shows Presidency's Growing Reach

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/reaction-to-at-t-time-warner-deal-shows-presidencys-growing-reach-1477501112?tesla=y" they don't have much sway over the economy: Congress controls the budget, the Federal Reserve sets interest rates, global markets determine the price of oil.

But they do control one immensely powerful lever: a sprawling regulatory state. The rules the executive branch writes and how its appointees enforce them increasingly shape economic and business behavior. Democrats have long been the most enthusiastic proponents of the regulatory state, but in Donald Trump they have a fellow traveler, albeit one with different motives.

Wall Street Leads in Campaign Contributions

The financial sector has been the largest source of campaign donations to federal candidates and parties during this election cycle, "http://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/WallStreetMoneyOct2016.pdf", an advocacy group. Individuals and entities from the financial sector have donated nearly $800 million between January 2015 and Sept. 20, 2016. The sector spent another $667.2 million on federal lobbying from January 2015 through June 30, 2016, making it the third-largest spender on lobbying. More than 350 financial firms and trade associations spent at least $500,000 on both campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures during this period, the report finds.

What Would It Take to Cut 70% of Federal Regulations?

Donald Trump has said he would cut anywhere between 10% and 70% of all regulations if he were elected president. While they believe the 70% target is "far more ambitious and likely impossible," "https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/trump-regulation-70-percent-cut/" sketch out what such a plan might look like. Such sweeping changes to regulations could cut compliance costs by as much as $777 billion. They estimate that $36.3 billion would come from repealing Dodd-Frank, the second-largest single reduction besides repealing the Affordable Care Act, which they estimate would save $51.6 billion in regulatory costs.

Elizabeth Warren Helps Hillary Clinton, and Herself

Even while supporting a Clinton administration, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is likely to cause it headaches on a range of issues, "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/10/26/elizabeth-warren-helps-hillary-clinton-and-herself/". With Democrats projected to win a slight majority in the Senate, "a Clinton administration would need to compromise with Republicans to get the 60 votes necessary to get anything out of the Senate," he writes. And that may clash with "the left's desire to get as much as possible as quickly as possible."

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-housing-agency-raises-warning-level-on-conditions-1477501088" issued its strongest warning yet on the state of the country's real-estate markets as frothy conditions persist in some key cities.
