Silicon Valley's loss of innocence in politics highlights need for reform

It used to be said that Wall Street held the swing vote in US money politics. Defence and energy always plumped for Republicans while Hollywood and Silicon Valley were reliably Democratic. That is no longer entirely true.

With less than three weeks before the US midterm elections, big data companies are hedging their bets. More than half of Google's donations have gone to Republicans. The company has overtaken Goldman Sachs as the largest corporate donor in these elections.

Moreover, the US tech sector has shed its distaste for lobbying. Google's "Don't be evil" mantra signalled disdain for the business of politics. Nowadays it is heavily represented in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere.

Alongside oil and defence groups, big data is taking its place. Internet utopians and techie libertarians may decry Silicon Valley's loss of innocence. But businesses tend to respond to the world as it is rather than how it should be.

Big data's growing comfort with money politics is partly an acknowledgment of political reality. Republicans will almost certainly increase their majority in the House of Representatives next month and may well gain control of the Senate. That will enable them to set the agenda on issues that affect Silicon Valley's bottom line, such as skilled immigrant visas, research and development budgets and the National Security Agency's ability to snoop on their customers' data.

These are legitimate high-tech concerns. But companies such as Apple and Google are also teaming up with other corporations, notably in the pharmaceutical sector, to lobby for tax holidays on repatriated overseas profits. There is nothing idealistic about this. Nor is there anything nefarious. Those with high intellectual property content, such as big data, find it easier to shift profits to more lightly taxed jurisdictions via transfer pricing. It is the job of tax authorities to tighten up rules to stem large-scale avoidance. Companies in all sectors try to maximise shareholder return. "Don't be naive", should be Google's new motto.

That said, US politics is awash with corporate money and big data plays an important role. Last year, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg teamed up with counterparts at Microsoft, Google and others to create Fwd.Us, a Silicon Valley advocacy group with $50m in start-up cash.

Its purpose is to pressure lawmakers to pass immigration reform and other overdue bills. In practice, however, it is like any other moneyed advocate: funnelling money to pliable candidates and funding attack advertisements. Facebook and Google have set up political action committees - vehicles that magnify their influence on legislators.

Unsurprisingly, the public is more disaffected than ever with politics as usual. Approval ratings for Congress are at an all-time low. In contrast, the well-heeled denizens of "K Street" - the stretch of Washington where lobby firms are concentrated - have rarely squeezed such high returns out of Capitol Hill.

Silicon Valley firms are among K Street's most favoured clients. Politicians of all shades are lining up for tech industry handouts. Yet it makes no sense to single out big data for opprobrium. The US is crying out for sensible corporate tax reform. It also desperately needs a better way of regulating the role of money in politics. Neither problem originated with big data.

Companies such as Google are simply exploiting the loopholes available to fatten their returns and protect their interests. That is what companies do. It is for politicians to legislate in the public interest. Sadly, the reality in Washington is far removed from that ideal.

Mortgage Giants Set to Loosen Lending; Fannie, Freddie Near Deal to Lift Limits; Concerns Persist

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and mortgage lenders are nearing an agreement that could lower barriers and restrictions on borrowers with weak credit, a move that would expand access to home loans amid the sluggish housing recovery.

The move by the mortgage-finance giants and their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, would help lenders protect themselves from claims of making bad loans, according to people familiar with the matter.

Fannie and Freddie are also considering programs that would make it easier for lenders to offer mortgages with down payments of as little as 3% for some borrowers, the people said. That would be a reversal for the loan giants. The moves could be announced as soon as this coming week.

Regulators and White House officials have struggled to expand access to mortgages, which have been hard for some borrowers to get since the financial crisis despite a sharp rise in home prices. But the likely moves by Fannie and Freddie could provide kindling for critics who worry about repeating some of the mistakes that led to the housing boom and bust.

The agreements wouldn t end the debate over the future of Fannie and Freddie, which were taken over by the government near the height of the crisis in 2008. Earlier this year, a bipartisan Senate plan to replace Fannie and Freddie as part of a broader housing-finance overhaul stalled.

The latest moves underscore just how much the government is relying on Fannie and Freddie to help increase the supply of credit. Steps to reduce down-payment standards would further signal a turn away from previous efforts to shrink the influence of the two mortgage giants.

The potential agreement  would allow credit to flow more freely to lower- and middle-income households,  said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody sAnalytics.  That s vital to getting the housing recovery moving forward. 

But Mark Calabria, director of financial-regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said:  This is the sort of thing that gets people underwater. Three percent [down payments] can disappear and become zero real quick. 

While Fannie and Freddie don t make loans, they buy them from lenders, package the loans into securities and then give guarantees to make investors whole if borrowers don t repay.

Fannie and Freddie have recouped tens of billions of dollars in penalties from lenders in recent years over claims that the lenders made underwriting mistakes on loans they sold to the mortgage giants during the run-up to the housing crash. Lenders have blamed those penalties, in which lenders were required to buy back mortgages, for prompting lenders to make loans only to borrowers with near-pristine credit.

In previous years, Fannie s and Freddie s regulator had tried to shrink their outsize role in the mortgage market. However, under new director Mel Watt, who took office in January, the FHFA has turned to expanding mortgage access, partly to ensure that tight credit doesn t stifle the housing recovery.

The FHFA has made several previous attempts to ease lenders  concerns. Beginning in 2013, the agency said lenders wouldn t have to buy back most loans where the borrower didn t miss any payments for three years. In May, the FHFA said borrowers could miss two nonconsecutive payments within three years.

In both cases, the FHFA exempted some mistakes such as fraud. But without clear definitions of what mistakes met that threshold, lenders said they remained wary of expanding mortgage access.

The new agreement would clarify which mistakes should constitute fraud, giving greater confidence to lenders that they won t be penalized many years after a loan is made. Still, lenders and regulators must reach an accord on what to do if they disagree on some problems, which could involve using a third-party arbiter to resolve disputes.

Mr. Watt is scheduled to speak at a Mortgage Bankers Association conference on Monday.

 Assuming Director Watt announces some new framework to give better clarity for lenders to extend credit to more qualified families, this will be a good step forward for the housing market,  David Stevens, the trade group s president, said in a statement.

Analysts at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC said an agreement would reinforce  our belief that policy makers are willing to embrace initiatives aimed at increasing the flow of mortgage credit. 

Separately, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHFA are considering new programs that would allow the companies to guarantee some mortgages with down payments of as little as 3%. The program might be limited to certain kinds of loans, such as mortgages to first-time home buyers.

Fannie Mae stopped accepting loans with 3% down payments last year, except in certain circumstances, while Freddie stopped guaranteeing such mortgages years ago.

The companies already guarantee loans with down payments of as little as 5%, though loans with down payments of less than 20% typically require mortgage insurance.

Regulators and lenders have tried to walk a fine line between expanding mortgage access and moving too far toward the loose credit that led to the crisis.

In May, Mr. Watt said Fannie and Freddie should focus on making credit more available, rather than pull back from the mortgage market.

The potential impact of looser lending standards and low down-payment programs on the availability of mortgages isn t clear. One question: Will an agreement be enough to get lenders to boost their lending to lower-quality borrowers?

Meanwhile, the U.S. government and shareholders of Fannie and Freddie are continuing to fight in the courts over how to handle the companies  profits.

When the two companies were taken over in 2008 and put into a so-called conservatorship, the government didn t wipe out shareholders. Instead, it received warrants to buy as much as 80% of the common stock in Fannie and Freddie and a new class of preferred shares that initially paid a 10% dividend.

In August 2012, the government did away with the fixed dividend but required Fannie and Freddie to steer almost all of their profits to the U.S. Treasury.

Investors sued the government over the change in terms. A judge recently dismissed one of the most prominent cases, but others haven t been decided yet.

MANSION --- Jumbo Jungle: Score One for the Borrower --- Bullish mortgage lenders are lowering the minimum FICO scores borrowers need to qualify for a jumbo loan

As in any game, it helps to know the score.

Today a borrower may be able to get a jumbo loan with a FICO score as low as 680 out of a possible 850, though many lenders say they draw the line at anything below 720. The best terms go to borrowers with scores of 760 and above, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, which tracks mortgage rates.

In 2006 -- before the mortgage crisis -- jumbo borrowers could qualify with scores in the 600s. After the real-estate bubble, however, jumbo mortgages dried up. Typically, only home buyers with a FICO score of 780 or above qualified for one.

Now, lenders are feeling bullish about getting more jumbos on their books, which can be more profitable than selling the loans to investors as mortgage-backed securities, says Mr. Gumbinger. When loans are kept in a lender's portfolio, the lender can set its own borrower qualifications, he adds.

Jumbo mortgages exceed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conventional-loan limits of $417,000 in most places and $625,500 in some high-price areas.

Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage has been able to introduce one 30-year fixed jumbo product with a 680 minimum score because of one private-equity-fund investor who is comfortable with that risk level, says John Walsh, CEO of Total Mortgage. The loan amount goes up to $1.5 million, requires a 20% down payment and has an interest rate about 0.25 points higher than the rate a borrower with a 740 score would receive, Mr. Walsh says.

Jacksonville, Fla.-based EverBank issues few jumbo mortgages to borrowers with scores below 720, preferring scores in the 760 range, says Tom Wind, executive vice president of home lending. "Below that score, we'd be looking for significant compensating factors, such as a lower loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and maybe more cash reserves," he adds. The LTV weighs the loan amount against the value of the property being purchased.

EverBank holds the majority of its jumbos in its portfolio, so it can be more flexible with qualification terms, Mr. Wind says. For example, an otherwise creditworthy borrower may have damaged credit because of an extenuating circumstance, such as a divorce, he explains.

Some smaller lenders, including many credit unions, say they don't require minimum credit scores but look at the full credit profile of the borrower.

Still, even lenders with some leeway built into their underwriting models take a hard look at credit scores, says Bob Walters, chief economist for Quicken Loans. "These minimums aren't suggestions, they are hard lines," he adds. "If you don't have the score, you don't get the loan." Quicken's minimum credit score to qualify for a jumbo mortgage is 680.

Fair Isaac Corp., a publicly traded company, developed FICO, the most commonly used method for determining credit scores. FICO is used by TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, the nation's three biggest credit agencies. Its analytics software assesses the risk that a borrower will become 90 days or more past due in monthly loan payments.

Beyond using minimum scores for qualifications, lenders may sort borrowers into tiers to determine the interest rate of the mortgage. Tiers generally encompass 20-point ranges, such as 700-719, 720-739, 740-759, etc., Mr. Walters says. Another competing method of evaluating risk, called VantageScore, is used by some lenders and mortgage-backed securities.

Here are a few more considerations for jumbo borrowers applying for a loan:

-- Married while borrowing separately. In the case of a home purchase or refinanced loan with two borrowers, the lender will assess risk using the lower credit score. Lower scorers could be removed from the application if one person's score is significantly lower and the other person's higher score meets income qualifications.

-- Raise the score. Especially if the borrower has a score slightly below the next lending tier, it might be worth the time to delay a home purchase and take steps raise to the score.

-- Now and later. A borrower who can't delay a home purchase could qualify with a lower score and refinance later if the score improves. Regardless, a quarter-point difference between a 4.25% loan for a 740 FICO score and a 4.5% loan for a 680 FICO score on a $1 million loan is only about $146 a month -- not a significant amount for most jumbo borrowers, Mr. Walsh says.

Tech
KKR to Invest in Artificial Intelligence  Software Firm Arago; Private-Equity Firm Will Pay About $55 Million for a Minority Stake in German Startup

KKR & Co. is investing about $55 million in arago AG, a German firm that develops artificial intelligence software to replace information-technology workers.

The New York-based private-equity firm will buy a minority stake and plans to help develop the profitable startup into a global company. Arago s founder said his technology enables companies to cut IT workers and to reassign effective staff to more creative tasks.

 There will be jobs lost,  Hans-Christian Boos, arago s founder, said in an interview.  On the other hand, we see this massive demand for good IT people, and they re not around because they are busy. 

Global spending on IT services and software will grow about 4.9% to $1.35 trillion in 2015, according to research firm Gartner Inc. Arago competes with companies such as IPsoft.

To start globalizing arago s customer base, KKR will introduce the technology to managers among the more than 90 companies in which it owns stakes. Those companies spend a combined $10 billion a year on IT, according to KKR.

 Our goal is really to help him [Mr. Boos] to bring this to the U.S.,  Lucian Schnefelder, a director at KKR, said in an interview.  The problem you very often have with European, and in particular German companies, is they have a very, very strong underlying technology but they are not very sophisticated in selling and marketing it. 

Mr. Boos said arago s technology is the result of his 20-year quest to teach a machine human problem-solving behavior.  I think we are definitely the only ones that have brought it out as a commercial product,  he said.

After developing the problem-solving technology, arago s team decided to apply it to IT because  there are lots of problems in IT,  he said.

The technology could disrupt the outsourcing of IT tasks from Europe and North America to low-wage countries such as India.

 In India you have some people who have excellent educations and we make them waste their time by clicking the same three buttons every day. There will certainly be tasks lost for people who just stick to doing processes that machines can do better,  Mr. Boos said.  If you show us your staff costs we will say that every ticket that we do is half what your people will do.

Global Finance: Stock Dive Hits Hedge Funds

By Rob Copeland

The recent turmoil in financial markets is upending some of the biggest hedge-fund trades of the year.

A plunge in energy prices this month and a recent legal setback for managers making bets on shares of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as swings in technology shares, have wiped billions of dollars of market value from the stock market and wounded many hedge funds.

Losses this month compound the difficulties facing the industry after a quarter in which stock-focused hedge funds on average lost money even as broad stock indexes rose, according to fund tracker HFR Inc.

The damage is being amplified by many hedge funds' tendency to buy and sell the same stocks, analysts and traders said, a practice known as herding that can boost returns when markets are rising but lead to sharp drops when sentiment reverses.

"One person gets out, another sees the price move and then you've got a stampede," said Faryan Amir-Ghassemi of Novus Partners Inc., an analytics firm for institutional investors.

A closely followed list of the stocks most prized by hedge-fund managers has tumbled 8.1% since Sept. 1, compared with a 4.8% fall for the S&P 500, according to Goldman Sachs Group.

Claren Road Asset Management LLC, a unit of Carlyle Group LP with $8 billion under management, is down more than 10% for October, according to people familiar with its results, on track for the worst month since it was formed 19 years ago.

The firm has been bruised by pullbacks in energy firms such as natural-gas providers Cheniere Energy Inc. and Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd., as energy prices have fallen amid concerns about the pace of global growth. Cheniere is down 21% this month, after shares rose 326% from the end of 2012 to this past September.

Also hitting Claren Road: a sharp decline in Fannie and Freddie shares following an adverse ruling in an investor lawsuit. Claren Road, which owns shares in the mortgage-finance companies, called the ruling a setback in a message to clients.

Owl Creek Asset Management LP is down 5% in October and has doubled its losses for the year, following a tumble in technology stocks such as T-Mobile US Inc., people familiar with the fund said. Bets on firms such as Micron Technology Inc. have weighed on Coatue Management LLC, down 7% year to date, according to people familiar with the firm.

The hedge-fund exodus is causing some unlikely market moves. Airline stocks typically rally when oil prices fall, cutting their fuel costs. But shares of American Airlines Group Inc. have fallen 12% in October, while Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. dropped about 9% and 7%, respectively, in part, because of the heavy concentration of hedge-fund holders of the stocks, traders said. The steep decline mirrors an even sharper rise in the stocks earlier in the year as hedge funds and others piled into the industry.

One trader said a number of stock-focused funds went into negative territory for the year at the end of last week, prompting some to begin selling positions and turn defensive.

Hedge funds justify some of the highest fees on Wall Street by promising to make money even in volatile conditions. But as the industry has expanded -- nearing $3 trillion, a threefold rise over a decade -- managers have tended to cluster into the same trades. Many hedge-fund managers had lagged behind market indexes this year before the recent tumult, creating an incentive to buy or sell volatile stocks in the hope of catching a quick rise.

Tide Point Capital Management LP, the two-year-old hedge fund backed by industry veteran Christopher Shumway, surrendered one-third of its 2014 winnings in the first two weeks of October, dropping 8%, said a person familiar with the fund.

GTCR in Talks for Gorkana

Private-equity firm GTCR is in exclusive talks to buy media-monitoring company Gorkana Group, according to people familiar with the matter.

Gorkana, a U.K.-based firm that, among other things, maintains a database of journalists for use by public-relations professionals, could fetch more than GBP 150 million ($240 million), the people said.

Exponent Private Equity, which bought Gorkana in 2010, merged the business with Durrants Media Monitoring. Durrants previously acquired media analysis company Metrica Inc.

Chicago-based GTCR earlier this year acquired two public relations software companies, Sweden's Cision AB and Vocus Inc. Last month, Cision and Vocus said they would buy Visible Technologies, a social media engagement and analytics company.

MUTUAL FUNDS

Fidelity Appoints New CEO

Fidelity Investments has named Abigail "Abby" Johnson chief executive, according to an internal memo sent by the mutual-fund firm Monday and viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Ms. Johnson, 52, will take over the position from her father, Edward "Ned" Johnson III, who is 84 years old and has been CEO since 1977. Mr. Johnson, whose father founded the company in 1946, will remain chairman, according to the memo.

Ms. Johnson holds the position of president of FMR LLC, the parent company of Fidelity Investments, and she will keep that role. The firm, with about $2 trillion of assets under management, is the second-largest mutual-fund firm in the country, after Vanguard Group.

"Along with our senior team, we will work together to strengthen Fidelity's industry leadership and to innovate in ways that enhance the experience we provide to our customers," Mr. Johnson wrote.

ADVERTISING

Publicis Buys Matomy Stake

Publicis Groupe SA is buying a 20% stake in digital-advertising technology company Matomy Media Group Ltd., in the latest move by a large ad agency to add technology capabilities as more marketing dollars shift online.

The acquisition is part of the French group's strategy to expand, in part by making small acquisitions, after it abandoned a planned merger with U.S. rival Omnicom Group Inc.

Matomy, based in Tel Aviv but listed in London earlier this year, said Publicis would acquire 17.9 million of its shares, or 20% of the company, for 227 pence ($3.65) a share. Publicis also has an option to buy a further 4.4 million shares at the same price, meaning the deal could be valued at as much as GBP 51 million ($82 million) for a 24.9% stake.

The digital-ad tech company said the partnership would give it the benefit of the French ad giant's media-buying and digital-advertising capabilities. Matomy operates a technology platform assessing the performance of online advertising and charges advertisers based on the performance of their ads rather than upfront fees.

GTCR in Talks for Gorkana

Private-equity firm GTCR is in exclusive talks to buy media-monitoring company Gorkana Group, according to people familiar with the matter.

Gorkana, a U.K.-based firm that, among other things, maintains a database of journalists for use by public-relations professionals, could fetch more than 150 million ($240 million), the people said.

Exponent Private Equity, which bought Gorkana in 2010, merged the business with Durrants Media Monitoring. Durrants previously acquired media analysis company Metrica Inc.

Chicago-based GTCR earlier this year acquired two public relations software companies, Sweden s Cision AB and Vocus Inc. Last month, Cision and Vocus said they would buy Visible Technologies, a social media engagement and analytics company.

Private-equity firms have backed media-monitoring companies across the globe. Phoenix Equity Partners Ltd. in June sold a majority stake in U.K.-based Precise Media Group to WPP PLC s research arm Kantar, while Australia s Quadrant Private Equity in June sold a majority stake in media-intelligence company iSentia Ltd. through an initial public offering.

Fidelity Appoints New CEO

Fidelity Investments has named Abigail  Abby  Johnson chief executive, according to an internal memo sent by the mutual-fund firm Monday and viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Ms. Johnson, 52, will take over the position from her father, Edward  Ned  Johnson III, who is 84 years old and has been CEO since 1977. Mr. Johnson, whose father founded the company in 1946, will remain chairman, according to the memo.

Ms. Johnson holds the position of president of FMR LLC, the parent company of Fidelity Investments, and she will keep that role. The firm, with about $2 trillion of assets under management, is the second-largest mutual-fund firm in the country, after Vanguard Group.

 Along with our senior team, we will work together to strengthen Fidelity s industry leadership and to innovate in ways that enhance the experience we provide to our customers,  Mr. Johnson wrote.

ADVERTISING

Publicis Groupe SA is buying a 20% stake in digital-advertising technology company Matomy Media Group Ltd., in the latest move by a large ad agency to add technology capabilities as more marketing dollars shift online.

The acquisition is part of the French group s strategy to expand, in part by making small acquisitions, after it abandoned a planned merger with U.S. rival Omnicom Group Inc.

Matomy, based in Tel Aviv but listed in London earlier this year, said Publicis would acquire 17.9 million of its shares, or 20% of the company, for 227 pence ($3.65) a share. Publicis also has an option to buy a further 4.4 million shares at the same price, meaning the deal could be valued at as much as 51 million ($82 million) for a 24.9% stake.

The digital-ad tech company said the partnership would give it the benefit of the French ad giant s media-buying and digital-advertising capabilities. Matomy operates a technology platform assessing the performance of online advertising and charges advertisers based on the performance of their ads rather than upfront fees.

Matomy Chief Executive Ofer Druker said the tie-up shows big ad companies  understand the need to be more active in  furthering their technology.

 Big data  challenge perplexes fund managers

Asking new employees to hand over urine samples for drug testing might seem distasteful to some, or alarming to others, but it has become relatively normal practice in corporate America.

This fact has not escaped the notice of one of the world's biggest private equity companies, which has a majority stake in a large manufacturer of drug screening tests in the US.

The private equity company found that analysing sales data from the drug-test manufacturer could help it build an early picture of whether US employment rates were going up or down: the more people being hired, the more drug screens sold. This information could in turn be used to guide its investments in public equity markets.

This is just one example of how asset managers are beginning to realise the potential "big data" - analysing large amounts of information from previously inaccessible or overlooked sources - has for their investment processes, according to Craig Hapelt, a partner at Boston Consulting Group.

He says: "Everyone is analysing data, that is a given. But analysing it on a very wide scale and bringing in different pieces of data that have not been in place before, that is new."

Although fund managers recognise that big data could provide valuable insights, many remain uncertain about how to apply vast data sets from sources as disparate as Twitter, the social networking service, Starbucks, the coffee chain, or Google Flu Trends, which analyses internet search terms to track global flu activity, to their investment processes.

Nick Thomas, a partner at Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based fund house, says: "We are absolutely fascinated by the power of big data and how it makes Google a fantastic business, and we are some of the biggest holders of [companies] such as Amazon and Baidu, who are at the cutting edge of using data to build amazing internet businesses. But trying to fit some of those ideas into our investment process is difficult because we take a very long-term, slow approach to investing. We are thinking about it, but it is causing a lot of head scratching."

Schroders' head of investment, Peter Harrison, agrees that asset managers need to get to grips with big data in order to remain competitive, but a spokesperson for the company said it has "nothing set in stone" on this front.

Mr Harrison told FTfm in July: "Asset managers have got to get much smarter [and] work out how we can use the vast amount of data out there more effectively. Using data effectively will give you the vital, winning edge."

Mr Hapelt says he has worked with a large US pension fund and several sovereign wealth funds who are interested in how they can harness big data to improve their in-house investment processes. Many big investors have only started showing an interest in this area in the past 12 months.

The fact that fund groups have arguably been slow to realise the potential big data has to offer - both in terms of enhancing investment returns, and in understanding their own client base - has fuelled fears in the industry that internet companies with a better handle on data analytics, such as Facebook or Amazon, could easily enter asset management.

"I suspect that [Google's artificial intelligence] people could clone an asset management stalwart before breakfast," an FT reader recently wrote to this newspaper.

One branch of the asset management community ahead of the game is the macro hedge fund set that use a computer-driven investment process, according to Armando Gonzalez, chief executive of RavenPack, a data analytics company that works with more than half of the world's biggest quantitative hedge funds.

Mr Gonzalez says this section of the hedge fund industry has been purchasing his company's analytics, which attempt to draw out market-moving company information from social media and news feeds, for several years, but that there has been a "significant" uptick in business from mainstream asset managers in the last two years.

The obvious drawback of using big data sourced from areas such as social media to influence investment decisions is that public sentiment cannot detect events such as insider trading, or substantial changes to monetary policy.

But it can raise red flags on a company when others are perhaps too optimistic, Mr Gonzalez says. UK supermarket Tesco, for example, had a low score in RavenPack's metrics (just 20 out of 100) over the summer. The score is based on factors such as shifts in analyst and social media sentiment towards a company.

This insight might have proved useful to investors such as Warren Buffett, who made the unusual move of stating he regretted his investment in Tesco after it emerged the retailer had overstated its forecast profits by 250m.

Deciding whether to change positions when big data flags up interesting patterns is the next challenge for fund groups, according to Michael Hintze, chief executive of CQS, the $14bn multi-strategy asset management company.

He says: "One of the biggest challenges [in asset management] is how you filter and channel the 'noise' or 'unstructured data' and harness that. You also need the context and the ability to time the execution of the trade [based on that data] appropriately."

Professor David Hand, chief scientific adviser at UK hedge fund group Winton, agrees: "There is more and more data captured every second. But data alone does not give you the answers. You have to ask the right questions [as] we are looking for very weak signals in a lot of noise. Only then can you attempt to predict how markets might behave."

Winton's research department has 140 people who specialise in data analysis and the company is "constantly hiring new people" in this area, according to Prof Hand.

Making such a large commitment to assessing big data trends is a scary concept for more traditional asset managers, according to Mr Hapelt.

"Some [fund groups] say [their ability to assess data] is such a mess, they can't aspire to be any good. The hard part is [deciding whether to] invest in a whole load of stuff that might deliver in five years' time, or might not get there. That is the fear."

The consultant estimates that roughly 15 per cent of the asset management companies he works with have begun to organise their approach to big data to improve investment performance, and many are hiring specifically in this area.

To get on top of the opportunities big data can provide, Mr Hapelt believes fund groups need to establish internally who is responsible for data management. Appointing a "chief data officer" could be the first step.

Tianhe Requires

Convincing Catalyst

In the latest battle between short sellers and Chinese firms, the shorts so far have the upper hand.

When the secretive group Anonymous Analytics lobbed a fraud-allegation bomb on to Tianhe Chemicals a month ago, the Hong Kong-listed company halted trading in its shares and spent time building a defense. Yet Tianhe's 55-page rebuttal was lacking. When shares resumed trading Thursday, its shares plunged 40% and are now 23% below its initial-offering price from June.

Anonymous argues that the chemicals firm overstates sales and profits. The group, which has no identified members, produced local-government filings of Tianhe's two operating subsidiaries that called into question reported profit in the company's IPO prospectus. Tianhe has shot back saying that Anonymous's documents are the fabricated ones, and contends that the subsidiaries' numbers aren't at odds.

The key here is the subsidiaries' accounts and tax receipts. While Tianhe got letters from tax authorities after the allegations arose that confirm payments, it is disappointing that the company isn't making the original tax filings widely available. It says it will only show a copy to those who come to its office over the next two weeks with a physical share certificate, because the information is confidential and amounts to unwieldy binders of documents. This oddly excludes new potential investors.

Another bone of contention is Tianhe's sales of a special chemical called antimar that repels fingerprints from surfaces such as smartphones. Anonymous says the amount of antimar Tianhe purports to sell is too much given the global smartphone market, to which Tianhe responds that antimar is used in multiple industries, even casino slot machines, says Joseph Lee, the chief financial officer. Tianhe says it sells antimar to trading houses, and doesn't know the final customers. Investors looking for Tianhe to destroy these allegations might have expected more detail on who exactly uses its products.

That Tianhe didn't furnish more evidence is one reason investors exited the stock Wednesday. Equally, though, these arguments are inconvenient when the stock was highly valued. Tianhe's enterprise value is now 8.6 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, in line with peer Japan's Daikin Industries, but well below the 15.3 times it traded before the allegations. Investors are no longer willing to give the company credit for higher margins and faster growth.

Tianhe's shares may rise a bit since executives say they may buy them for their personal accounts. Yet a truly restorative rally will only come if the company makes more convincing arguments.

Fed Fear Imperils ECB Strategy

Somewhere at the European Central Bank, a warning light is flashing: The euro has bounced.

That is a problem. The ECB is counting on a weaker euro to boost inflation from its current nadir of 0.3%. True, the exchange-rate reversal is small: The euro has risen to $1.27 from just above $1.25 last week. But this is a departure from the near one-way movement in the single currency that started in May.

The ECB faces a battle on several fronts. The first is the Federal Reserve's apparent unwillingness to think about raising interest rates. Markets may have applauded the dovish tone of Wednesday's Fed minutes, but they won't have gone down well at the ECB. The Fed's worries about the dollar seem overdone; on a historical trade-weighted basis, the dollar remains weak. The U.S. central bank's concerns about a stalled European recovery are more valid, however.

But the ECB is partly relying on divergence in monetary policies between the U.S. and the eurozone to deliver a weaker euro. If the Fed puts off tightening, that force is diminished -- particularly as markets are skeptical of the ECB's efforts to boost its balance sheet. The risk is that if the Fed's worries about the dollar and Europe cause it to delay rate increases, it will generate more problems for Europe -- and more worries for the Fed.

Second, even as the euro has fallen, so has the price of oil. Brent crude has dropped to $91 a barrel from $115 in June. The slide in the euro has cushioned that: UniCredit recently calculated that if the euro were still at $1.40, the slide in oil prices would have pushed eurozone inflation to zero. A lower oil price should, of course, be a boon to consumers and businesses, reducing costs. But for eurozone inflation, further declines are bad news.

Of course, this may just be a correction for the euro, and the single currency may resume its fall. But the underlying problem for the ECB is it has to rely on other independent actors playing their part. In an ideal world for the ECB, the Fed would tighten policy, eurozone governments would undertake structural overhauls to boost growth, and the drag on inflation from energy and food prices would fade. For now, the world is far from ideal.

Oil Markets Fly Into a Perfect Storm

Oil bulls aghast at the recent slump in prices should avoid looking at airline stocks.

Airline investors usually love falling fuel prices. But in the past month, airline stocks have joined oil in its slide that extends back to late June.

Airlines have actually been doing well after a round of restructuring and consolidation. But their stocks have succumbed to wider fears about slowing economic growth. The International Monetary Fund just downgraded its global forecasts again.

Besides the eurozone, the IMF also cut projections across large parts of the developing world -- which accounts for the vast bulk of growth in demand. While the IMF didn't cut forecasts for China, oil demand there is growing slowly. As of August, demand in the year to date was up just 3.1%, according to Deutsche Bank estimates, setting up what could be the weakest year for growth in oil consumption there since 2005.

All this complicates things for oil bulls praying supply cuts will support prices. Hopes rest on Saudi Arabia unilaterally taking barrels off the market. But so far it has chosen to defend its market share and seems to be banking on lower oil prices forcing some higher-cost rivals offline instead.

One target: the U.S. exploration-and-production industry's rising output. But E&P firms don't necessarily turn the taps off immediately when prices fall; look at Wednesday's release of data showing a big build in U.S. oil inventories.

Hedges and productivity gains provide some protection for those companies and once capital has been sunk into land and infrastructure, they often try to ride out weaker prices before capitulating.

Energy economist Phil Verleger points out that in previous instances in which Saudi Arabia let prices fall, in the mid-1980s and late 1990s, oil dropped drastically before other producers fell into line. Right now, a weakening demand picture puts even more of an onus onto producing countries, ranging from Russia to Nigeria, to rein in output.

Eventually, the pain of falling prices will get too much for those producers to bear. Meanwhile, getting there likely will involve a lot more pain for anyone invested in oil.

Tianhe Stock Sinks After Halt Is Lifted

HONG KONG -- Shares of Tianhe Chemicals Group, the Chinese company accused by "hacktivist" group Anonymous Analytics of falsifying some of its financial reporting, fell 40% after a monthlong trading halt was lifted.

Late Wednesday, the company released a 55-page rebuttal to Anonymous Analytics' accusations. It said allegations by the group amounted to "twisted facts and intertwined fiction."

In early September, Anonymous Analytics released a report alleging that Tianhe, which had been a market darling after listing its stock in Hong Kong, falsified its accounting, revenue and margins and overstated sales of a lucrative chemical agent called anti-mar. Shares in Tianhe had been suspended since Sept. 2 and began trading Thursday.

Anonymous Analytics said on its website Thursday that the Chinese company hadn't responded to its satisfaction. It said it is sticking to its initial claims and issued a report countering the company's statement.

In a media briefing Thursday, Tianhe Chief Executive Wei Xuan said that he has started to buy Tianhe shares from the market for his personal account to restore investor confidence in the company. He also said that the company is looking into taking legal action against Anonymous Analytics, and will decide on whether to do so in the next few days.

"We were shocked by Anonymous Analytics' allegations, which are groundless. We believe these allegations have been made to undermine Tianhe's reputation and to manipulate the share price," Mr. Wei said.

Anonymous Analytics couldn't immediately be reached for comment on Mr. Wei's latest remarks.

Tianhe, which is partly owned by Morgan Stanley, fell as much as 47% Thursday morning to an intraday low of HK$1.22, which is 32% lower than the price it sold at in a Hong Kong initial public offering in June. The stock closed down 40% at HK$1.39.

The company raised US$748 million via the Hong Kong IPO. Between the offering and the initial report from Anonymous Analytics, Tianhe shares rose 28%, outperforming the benchmark Hang Seng Index, which rose 6.7% over the same period.

Mr. Wei said the Anonymous Analytics allegations haven't affected the company's operations. Tianhe's third-quarter gross profit rose 44% from a year earlier to 1.22 billion Chinese yuan (US$198.6 million).

Anonymous claimed last month that reported revenue for two Tianhe units, Jinzhou DPF-TH and Fuxin Hengtong, was much lower than the company said, citing accounts that the company submitted to China's State Administration of Industry and Commerce.

Anonymous Analytics, which calls itself an advocate for corporate transparency but doesn't disclose who its members are, said in its report Thursday that it wouldn't profit from its allegations.

A statement noted, though, that while it holds "no direct or indirect interest" in Tianhe, "you may assume that certain of Anonymous Analytics' research and due diligence contacts, consultants, affiliates and/or clients may have a short position in the stock."

On Wednesday, Tianhe said its shareholders can inspect the financial statements and tax receipts of the two units if they can prove they are registered stockholders.

"This type of anonymous and hyperbolic market discourse has no accountability for truth," the company said in its filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange. "The company, on the other hand, is fully responsible for every fact that we meticulously set forth in the pages to follow."

Tianhe also denied Anonymous' allegations that its key customers had ties to the company and that it overstated anti-mar sales. Anti-mar is a chemical agent used in products including smartphones and cameras.

"We have worked very hard in the past twenty years to come to this stage, but what Anonymous Analytics had done is spending little money to make false allegation to attack us and our shareholders," Mr. Wei said.

Calpers Aims to Boost Real-Estate Investment

SACRAMENTO -- As it pulls the plug on hedge funds, the country's biggest public pension is giving its property portfolio a $7 billion jolt.

The California Public Employees' Retirement System plans to increase its $26 billion of commercial-real-estate investments by 27%, according to its latest asset-allocation report. The boost would leave Calpers with its largest property holdings since before the financial crisis.

More than a decade ago, Calpers started loading up on funds investing in more speculative properties like shopping malls and office developments in a bid to boost returns. Those bets proved ill-timed, as the recession and commercial-property bust led to losses of about $10 billion, or about half the value of its portfolio during the downturn.

The latest move is different, Calpers says. This time it is focusing on investments such as fully leased office towers and apartments in big cities, which it argues are safer because there is established demand for these properties. In another shift, the giant pension fund has been investing almost exclusively through real-estate funds that manage separate accounts created for Calpers, which offers more control over how that money is invested.

Calpers' real-estate play is emblematic of a larger movement by big investors in recent years toward safer assets such as Treasury bonds.

Prices of higher-quality properties have shot up 82% over the past five years and now are above their precrisis high in 2007, according to the Green Street Advisors Commercial Property Price Index. The capitalization rate for major metropolitan office buildings has fallen to about 6% from 8% in 2010, according to real-estate researcher Real Capital Analytics. The cap rate, a valuation measure, is a property's annual income divided by the purchase price.

Some of Calpers' real-estate consultants are warning that moving too much money into pricey properties could backfire. Pension Consulting Alliance Inc. cautioned in a July report to Calpers not to expect "these increases in value to be sustained when interest rates and new construction starts return to more normalized levels."

Ted Eliopoulos, Calpers' recently appointed chief investment officer, changed the fund's real-estate approach in 2011, when he led that group. Since then, the fund has delivered average annual returns of 14% in its real-estate portfolio. But Mr. Eliopoulos acknowledges the recent high returns are unsustainable.

The fund's goals now are to diversify its portfolio risk and generate steady, modest gains, rather than striving for outsize returns with more speculative bets, he said. Likewise, Calpers on Sept. 15 said it would shed its $4 billion investment in hedge funds as part of an effort to simplify its assets and reduce costs.

"Our strategy is to focus on high-quality real estate," Mr. Eliopoulos said. "We're still on track."

Other big investors are taking a different course, eschewing pricey blue-chip properties in favor of half-rented office buildings, shopping malls in transition and other riskier ventures with lower price tags. A new survey this month from real-estate consultant Hodes Weill & Associates and Cornell University of 231 large investors found that three-quarters said they were moving money into these kinds of properties in search of higher returns.

After the dot-com bust of 2000, Calpers turned to real estate for the double-digit gains it no longer could count on from stocks. That meant putting money into higher-risk real-estate funds that used up to 80% levels of debt while aiming for returns of 20% or more.

With prices rising, the riskier, debt-oriented strategy worked at first. For the fiscal year ended June 2006, the real-estate portfolio returned 35%. But the losses began to mount during the financial crisis.

A symbol of Calpers' crisis-era stumbles can be found in an empty tract just three blocks from its Sacramento headquarters.

Before the 2007-2008 bust, Calpers was part of a plan to build twin 53-story condominium towers on a block-long parcel that leads to the state capitol building. But financing for the condos fell through in 2007, and the land now is pockmarked with trees, brown grass and pilings driven into the ground.

Calpers, which contributed $100 million to the plan, hopes the proximity to an established business district and other new projects ultimately will attract new development.

Calpers has raised its target allocation for real estate to 11%, which would require investing another $7 billion in property, based on the fund's nearly $300 billion in total assets.

Mr. Eliopoulos said that as a long-term investor, he is less worried about possible price fluctuations. He added that while Calpers' new real-estate target calls for investing billions of additional dollars in real estate, the guidelines allow him to be a little above or below the target level for flexibility.

Positive US sentiment buoys Asia bourses

Thursday 04.00 BST. Japanese, Australian and Hong Kong stocks all rebounded from sharp losses the previous day, the US central bank injected some positive sentiment into global markets.

Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 led the rebound, rising 1.4 per cent in spite of a muddled picture of the labour market resulting from significant revisions.

Australia's September employment report said 29,700 jobs were lost in the month, compared with predictions that 16,000 jobs would be created. The jobless rate rose from 6 per cent to 6.1 per cent.

However, confusion reigned in the aftermath of the report, causing the Australian dollar to fall 0.4 per cent before reclaiming a two-week high of $0.885.

The Australia Bureau of Statistics had flagged that the report would include months of revisions to strip out seasonal adjustment estimates that had proved to be unhelpful.

The 121,000 jobs supposedly created in August - a number considered not credible by many observers - was revised down to a gain of 32,100.

But a number of analysts said the report and its revisions failed to clarify the direction of the nation's jobs market.

"We are left in the dark as to the state of the labour market," said Annette Beacher, strategist at TD Securities. "This is not ideal given the RBA, Treasury and policy makers rely on such information about that health of the labour market to shape appropriate fiscal, monetary and social policy."

Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 1.2 per cent, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.5 per cent and the Shanghai Composite added 0.3 per cent.

South Korean markets were closed to observe Alphabet Day.

Japanese stocks were bolstered by better than anticipated machinery orders data, which serve as a proxy for private capital expenditures. September orders were up 4.7 per cent month-on-month - a third straight monthly gain - versus predictions of a 0.5 per cent gain.

However, three months of increases pale in comparison to orders falling by a fifth in May - a reaction to Japan raising its national sales tax in April.

"Although machinery orders continued to recover in August, their current level still points to falling business investment in the third quarter, as does the decline in capital goods shipments," wrote Marcel Thieliant, economist at Capital Economics. "But the recovery in capital expenditure should resume soon."

The broad upward moves in Asian equity markets follow a bullish session in New York, where the S&P 500 finished 1.8 per cent higher - its biggest one-day rise since October 2013.

Sentiment was lifted thanks to the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve's past monetary policy meeting, which appeared particularly dovish to many analysts.

Fed board members expressed concerns that the US economy could be negatively impacted "if foreign economic growth came in weaker than anticipated".

"Right now, there is no incentive for the Fed to signal tighter policy," said Mazen Issa, strategist at TD Securities.

"Inflation is curling lower and a strong dollar coupled with sagging global growth implies that lower inflation remains a risk in the US economy," he added.

"Until there is evidence of a sustained improvement not only domestically but abroad, the Fed will take its time in addressing the outlook for monetary policy.

In corporate news, National Australia Bank warned that its full-year cash profits would fall 14 per cent year-on-year as it booked writedowns amounting to nearly A$1bn related to its troubled UK venture. It announced plans to raise more capital. Shares rose 1.3 per cent.

Meanwhile, shares of Tianhe Chemicals tumbled 37 per cent after a five-week trading suspension following allegations of accounting fraud.

The Chinese chemicals group released a 55-page rebuttal of fraud claims late on Wednesday night, arguing that Anonymous Analytics - a group claiming links to Anonymous, the shadowy hacker collective - "used fabricated financial statements to mislead investors".

Asian Shares Gain After Fed Minutes; Sydney, Hong Kong Markets Lead Gains Following Rally on Wall Street

Stocks in Hong Kong and Australia led gains in Asian markets Thursday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it would move cautiously on rate increases.

The Hang Seng Index rose 1.2% to 23534.53, led by gains from communications stocks. Among the strongest gainers were retailer Belle International Holdings Ltd. up 4.3%, China Mobile Ltd., up 3.2%, and China Unicom Ltd., up 2.6%.

The S&P/ASX 200 was up 1.1% at 5296.7, bouncing from an eight-month low, as all sectors rallied. Within the banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 1.6%, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. added 1.7% and Westpac Banking Corp. improved 1.8%.

Fed minutes from overnight showed that officials discussed possible deflationary pressures from a stronger dollar, signaling that a U.S. interest-rate increase may come later than expected. The news helped U.S. stocks record their largest one-day gains of the year, which set a positive tone for Asia on Thursday. A later rate increase would benefit Asian markets, as investors would be less inclined to flock to the U.S. for returns.

In Hong Kong, pro-democracy demonstrators continue to occupy a few streets ahead of formal talks between student protesters and government officials Friday. Selling on the Hang Seng in reaction to the movement has eased, although investors expect negotiations to drag out because the two sides are far apart.

Shares of Hong Kong-listed Tianhe Chemicals Group, which resumed trading Thursday, were down 39.8%. The stock had been suspended for more than a month after  hacktivist  group Anonymous Analytics accused it of falsifying some financial reporting. Tianhe denied the allegations and on Wednesday, it said third-quarter gross profit rose 44% from a year earlier.

The Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.8% to 15478.93, making it the only major Asian index to finish in the red. A weaker dollar, on the back of lowered expectations for rising rates in the U.S., pushed shares of Japanese exporters down. The dollar traded at 107.85, down from 108.09 late Wednesday in New York.

Among auto makers, Mazda Motor Corp. lost 1.9%, Toyota Motor Corp. was down 0.2% and Nissan Motor Co. fell 0.1%. In the technology sector, electronics firm Hitachi Ltd. lost 1.3%, and semiconductor maker Toshiba Corp. fell 1.9%.

Bucking the trend were retail stocks. Fast Retailing Co. Ltd., the heaviest-weighted Nikkei component, was up 1.5% ahead of the company s full-year business results. Last week, the firm s Uniqlo unit reported a sharp rise in September same-store sales.

ABC-Mart surged 6.5% after the shoe retailer booked first-half results that exceeded guidance. Sales rose 15% from a year earlier, while operating profits increased 24%; management also increased its full-year operating profit forecast.

Law firms find ways to speed up normally lengthy legal processes

For the past year a dark cloud of litigation risk has hung over the European and US banking sector, dragging down share prices.

Analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove recently estimated legal costs would set back UK banks a further 15bn over the next three years, on top of the 30bn they have set aside since 2011.

Dozens of banking institutions in Europe and the US, including Bank of America, HSBC, Lloyds, UBS and Deutsche Bank, have been facing an array of civil litigation and regulatory issues relating to their past, ranging from mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities and alleged sanctions-busting to conduct related to Libor and interest rate swaps.

The legal strategies that some banks are deploying to deal with their litigation and handle their regulatory risks are, therefore, being closely watched by others in the industry.

One example is how some of the Swiss banks handled the US Department of Justice's clampdown on offshore bank accounts as it sought to pursue institutions for allegedly helping US account holders commit tax evasion. Following an agreement with the Swiss government, the DoJ announced a programme in August 2013 through which it encouraged Swiss banks to co-operate with its investigations rather than face criminal proceedings. The programme, which meant institutions could reach a non-prosecution agreement with the DoJ if they met stringent requirements, was unique.

Since then, more than 100 institutions have been assessing whether to sign up to the programme. It has tough requirements, including paying penalties for all non-disclosed US accounts held by a bank since March 2009 and giving information on accounts held directly or indirectly by US taxpayers since August 2008.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

About a third of the Swiss institutions affected turned to law firm Baker & McKenzie, which has offices in the US and Switzerland, for guidance. The firm's global approach and its Swiss partners helped bridge the cultural divide between the US and Switzerland - a crucial issue as the US pressed for total disclosure from a notoriously secretive industry. This included dealing with the thorny issue of data privacy - under Swiss law, employee data cannot be disclosed without the employee's consent. < >

Marnin Michaels, a tax partner with Baker & McKenzie in Zurich, says the programme was challenging for a number of reasons. "Typically, DoJ investigations take years, yet this was done within six months," he says. "At one time or another we worked with 40 or more institutions. We had to balance the local data protection laws with the US's need to have as much information as possible and we had to train our people to do this as quickly as possible to encourage clients into self-disclosure."

Other law firms have had to adopt an innovative approach to handling civil litigation brought by consumers who claimed they had been mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).

<>

In recent years, thousands of consumers in the UK have brought court proceedings, that have clogged up county courts in lengthy litigation. Where banks chose to settle, they faced paying the high legal costs of "no-win, no-fee" solicitors. An additional issue was that the PPI claims were all specific, so the banking industry could not bring a legal test case where a judgment would bind all subsequent claims - as the industry had done with consumer claims over current account charges in 2007.

However, law firm Simmons & Simmons, acting for Barclays, brought two legal cases that led to rulings clarifying the legal position. This effectively resulted in claims being directed away from the county courts into the bank's internal complaint functions.

In the first case of Andrew & Ors v Barclays, Mr Justice Waksman ruled in favour of the bank, staying PPI claims for eight weeks so that the bank could process them as complaints. He gave guidance that complaints should be brought first to the bank, rather than swamping the scarce resources of the court system.

A second ruling, Binns v Firstplus Financial, effectively meant any consumer who turned to the court after having their complaint upheld by the bank would see their claim struck out.

While the banking industry has been busy dealing with its legacy issues, the volume of litigation in the technology sector has increased significantly because laws have failed to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change.

One of the most significant rulings this year has been by the European Court of Justice, which gave European citizens the right to ask internet search engines to remove results for queries that included their name - the ruling was dubbed "the right to be forgotten".

Other cases have also trodden fresh ground in the developing area of intellectual property - law firm Garrigues won five cases for Google.

One notable case saw the Spanish court siding with Google and Garrigues on a dispute with broadcaster Telecinco, finding that Google's YouTube service did not have to check television clips for potential copyright violations before posting them online.

Other cases have involved trademark disputes between retailers, which are increasingly seeing the internet as a sales driver. Law firms have used new techniques, such as big data, to help them win these trademark cases. One example involved Marks and Spencer, which lost a long-running court battle after a judge ruled that the retailer had infringed the trademark of Interflora, the flower delivery business, by using it to promote M&S flowers on the internet.

Interflora had sued M&S in the High Court because it said the retailer had used its trademarked name as a keyword on Google, via the Google AdWords system. AdWords allows companies to buy online advertising that will appear when users type particular words into the search engine. As a result, typing in "Interflora" as a search term into Google brought up an M&S advert under the "sponsored links" heading, even though that advert bore no relationship to Interflora.

Law firm Pinsent Masons, which won the case for Interflora, broke new ground by using GoogleAnalytics and online metrics, rather than traditional survey evidence, to demonstrate to the court the confusion caused among consumers when they used Google.

This was the first time the courts had accepted this type of anonymised big data as evidence of consumer confusion - and demonstrates the value of using the latest tools.

Real Estate
Calpers Reboots Its Real-Estate Ambitions; Pension Fund to Boost Investments by $7 Billion

SACRAMENTO As it pulls the plug on hedge funds, the country s biggest public pension is giving its property portfolio a $7 billion jolt.

The California Public Employees  Retirement System plans to increase its $26 billion of commercial real-estate investments by 27%, according to its latest asset-allocation report. The boost would leave Calpers with its largest property holdings since before the financial crisis.

More than a decade ago, Calpers started loading up on funds investing in more speculative properties like shopping malls and office developments in a bid to boost returns. Those bets proved ill-timed, as the recession and commercial-property bust led to losses of around $10 billion, or about half the value of its portfolio during the downturn.

The latest move is different, Calpers says. This time it is focusing on investments such as fully leased office towers and apartments in big cities, which it argues are safer because there is established demand for these properties. In another shift, the giant pension fund has been investing almost exclusively through real-estate funds that manage separate accounts created for Calpers, which offers more control over how that money is invested.

Calpers  real-estate play is emblematic of a larger movement by big investors in recent years toward safer assets such as Treasury bonds.

Prices of higher-quality properties have shot up 82% over the past five years and now are above their precrisis high in 2007, according to the Green Street Advisors Commercial Property Price Index. The capitalization rate for major metropolitan office buildings has fallen to about 6% from 8% in 2010, according to real-estate researcher Real Capital Analytics. The cap rate, a valuation measure, is a property s annual income divided by the purchase price.

Some of Calpers  real-estate consultants are warning that moving too much money into pricey properties could backfire. Pension Consulting Alliance Inc. cautioned in a July report to Calpers not to expect  these increases in value to be sustained when interest rates and new construction starts return to more normalized levels. 

Ted Eliopoulos, Calpers  recently appointed chief investment officer, changed the fund s real-estate approach in 2011, when he led that group. Since then, the fund has delivered average annual returns of 14% in its real-estate portfolio. But Mr. Eliopoulos acknowledges the recent high returns are unsustainable.

The fund s goals now are to diversify its portfolio risk and generate steady, modest gains, rather than striving for outsize returns with more speculative bets, he said. Likewise, Calpers on Sept. 15 said it would shed its $4 billion investment in hedge funds as part of an effort to simplify its assets and reduce costs.

 Our strategy is to focus on high-quality real estate,  Mr. Eliopoulos said.  We re still on track. 

Other big investors are taking a different course, eschewing pricey blue-chip properties in favor of half-rented office buildings, shopping malls in transition and other riskier ventures that carry lower price tags. A new survey this month from real-estate consultant Hodes Weill & Associates and Cornell University of 231 large investors found that three-quarters said they were moving money into these kinds of properties in search of higher-returns.

 What s largely driving that is fear that valuations may have peaked  for trophy investments, said Douglas Weill, a managing partner at Hodes Weill & Associates.

After the dot-com bust of 2000, Calpers turned to real estate for the double-digit gains it no longer could count on from stocks. That meant putting money into higher-risk real-estate funds that used up to 80% levels of debt while aiming for returns of 20% or more.

With prices rising, the riskier, debt-oriented strategy worked at first. For the fiscal year ending June 2006, the real-estate portfolio returned 35%. But the losses began to mount during the financial crisis.

A symbol of Calpers  crisis-era stumbles can be found in an empty tract just three blocks from its headquarters here in California s capital city.

Before the 2007-2008 bust, Calpers was part of a plan to build twin 53-story condominium towers on a prominent block-long parcel that overlooks the entrance to Sacramento and leads to the state capitol building. But financing for the condos fell through in 2007, and the land is now surrounded by a green fence and pockmarked with trees, brown grass and pilings driven into the ground.

Calpers, which contributed $100 million to the twin-tower plan, hopes the proximity to an established business district and other new projects, including a new basketball arena for the Sacramento Kings, ultimately will attract new development. An external real estate manager, CIM Group, currently is considering various proposals.

 Calpers is committed to realizing the highest and best use of the land,  a spokesman said.

Calpers has raised its target allocation for real estate to 11%, which would require investing another $7 billion in property, based on the fund s nearly $300 billion in total assets.

Mr. Eliopoulos said that as a long-term investor, he is less worried about possible price fluctuations. He added that while Calpers  new real-estate target calls for investing billions of additional dollars in real estate, the guidelines allow him to be a little above or below the target level for flexibility.

So far this year, Calpers has been moving in the opposite direction. The pension fund has been a net seller of $688 million in real estate for 2014, according to Real Capital.

Mr. Eliopoulos said it would be challenging to reach the new target.  We still have a ways to go,  he said.

Blockchain Lands Biggest Ever Venture Funding Round in Bitcoin Industry; $30 Million Investment Sign Silicon Valley Remains Excited About Bitcoin s Prospects

Bitcoin wallet and data analytics provider Blockchain raised a little over $30 million from venture capital investors, the biggest single funding round yet for a digital-currency firm and a sign that Silicon Valley remains excited about bitcoin s prospects even as its price has fallen far from its highs of last year.

The investment was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Wicklow Capital, with contributions from others, including Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson and Mosaic Ventures.

Blockchain President Peter Smith said the company intends in part to use the funds to ramp up its marketing effort to a broader community of customers beyond the bitcoin enthusiasts who have so far signed up in for its digital wallet. With 2.3 million unique wallet owners, Blockchain s service for sending and receiving bitcoin is now the most widely used in the world.

 We have captured a lot of the low-hanging fruit in terms of users and it is time to start going after people who are going to use bitcoin not because it s interesting to them but because it s useful,  Mr. Smith said.

He said there is special interest in expanding outside the U.S., including in developing markets, where the company has seen steady growth this year. Emerging markets are seen as one of the key growth areas for bitcoin because the digital currency, which is managed by a software algorithm over a decentralized network of computers and isn't controlled by any government or centralized authority, could allow billions of people currently excluded from banking systems to directly send and receive money electronically. That could lower the cost of commerce for such people, which have had to rely on expensive remittance services, wire transfers and other money transmitters to shift funds remotely.

London-based Blockchain s wallet service differs from others in the bitcoin industry, including from its primary competitor Coinbase and newcomers Circle and Xapo, in that it doesn t allow people to purchase or sell bitcoin for fiat currency.

Mr. Smith argued that his firm has broken away from Coinbase in terms of wallet expansion over the past year because it isn t as negatively affected by the declining price, which is down almost 75% from its peak in late November last year.

 When people open a Blockchain wallet, they do so because they want to do something with bitcoin, not because they want to speculate on the price,  Mr. Smith said.

San Francisco-based Coinbase wasn't immediately available for comment.

Also unlike its competitors, Blockchain has stuck to the principle that control of bitcoins which are managed by passwords known as the private key must be held personally by the wallet owner rather than in the custody of the firm.

Blockchain s funding announcement coincides with a $3 million fundraise announcement Tuesday for New York-based SolidX, which provides bitcoin derivatives trading facilities to professional investors such as hedge funds, and generally caps a strong year for venture capital in the digital currency.

Whereas there is significant skepticism as to whether bitcoin can live up to its promise to revolutionize payments, Silicon Valley investors have poured money into the sector. As of mid-2014, there had been $200 million raised in the preceding 12 months, according to a survey by bitcoin news service Coindesk.

Some of the bigger amounts have gone to wallet providers, with Coinbase raising a total of $25 million over the past year, Xapo $40 million and Circle $26 million. Blockchain, which earns much of its revenue from advertising, has been an outlier, opting instead to grow organically. The company pays its employees in bitcoin and manages much of its expenses in the digital currency.

Chinese Insurer to Buy Hilton's Toniest Hotel

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. agreed to sell its most prestigious hotel, Manhattan's Waldorf Astoria, for $1.95 billion to a Chinese insurance company, the hotel operator said Monday.

The sale price is among the highest ever for any hotel and represents the latest sign of intense international demand for luxury hotels and other trophy properties in major global cities. The Waldorf Astoria's price of $1.3 million a room is also among the highest ever paid in the U.S. on a per-room basis.

The acquisition is the first major deal in the U.S. for Anbang Insurance Group Co., which beat out at least two other bidders for the property, according to a person familiar with the matter.

For months, Hilton has been considering its options for the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue, including converting hundreds of its nearly 1,500 rooms to condos and reinvesting the proceeds into the hotel. In recent weeks, Hilton was leaning toward an outright sale of the property. But before the hotel company could begin the formal marketing process, Anbang and at least two other groups offered pre-emptive bids around the $2 billion mark, this person said.

Hilton will continue to operate the hotel under a 100-year management contract. The company plans to use the proceeds of the sale to acquire other properties, in part to avoid a hefty tax charge on the transaction. It is unclear if Anbang plans to convert any of the rooms to private residences, but the insurer is expected to invest in upgrading the 1931 property.

The New York location is the flagship of Hilton's Waldorf Astoria luxury chain, which has grown fivefold since 2007 to include locations in cities such as Beijing, Dubai, Chicago and Amsterdam.

The deal comes as Hilton is enjoying strong growth as business picks up. In August, the company raised its forecast for the year after results for the second quarter topped expectations.

Hilton's shares have fared well since the stock made its debut in December with a $21.30 opening price. The stock has risen 9.3% so far this year through Friday's close, and was hovering around the flat line in midday trading Monday.

International buyers purchased more than $46 billion of U.S. commercial property in 2013, an increase from $35 billion in 2012 and the most since 2007, according to data from Real Capital Analytics Inc.

Bitcoin Volatility Highlights Need for Advanced Investing Facilities; Advocates for Virtual Currency Say Facilities Needed for Thinly Traded Market

Some unusually large sell orders put bitcoin through a wild ride Sunday and Monday, highlighting what bitcoin advocates say is a need for advanced investing facilities to boost volumes and tame the extreme volatility in the digital currency s thinly traded market.

Late afternoon in New York Monday, bitcoin was trading up 3.69% on the day at $331.45, according to Coindesk s Bitcoin Price Index. In the early hours of Asian trading it had dropped to $301.29, in a brief revival of some of the furious selling seen on online markets Sunday, when the price fell as low as $286.56. That low point represents a 75% decline from the peak Of $1,165.89 that bitcoin hit on Nov. 30 last year but is still almost three times the $99 price at which it traded this time last year.

The catalyst for the latest bout of selling appears to have been a 30,000-bitcoin sell order priced at $300, which surfaced Sunday morning on Slovenia-based exchange BitStamp. That one order represented twice the normal volume on BitStamp, one of the more liquid of various online exchanges for the virtual currency. The order was later withdrawn but reappeared temporarily at different levels.

The supposed attempt to sell $9 million worth of the digital currency spooked investors into a flight from bitcoin. According Bitcoinwisdom.com, total volume on the 12 exchanges it tracks ran to around 640,000 bitcoins over the 24 hours to 1 p.m. EDT Monday, more than 3 times the daily average of the past 30 days.

Matt Odell, co-founder and executive editor of market analytics firm Coinprices.io, said the seller s placement on an open exchange suggested a large player was attempting to manipulate the price. A smart investor who wanted to legitimately unload holdings would have done so in an over-the-counter market where their actions are not displayed to the broader marketplace to avoid making the price move against them, he said.

 Just selling half of that order would have totally crashed the price of bitcoin,  Mr. Odell said, adding that he suspected the quickly withdrawn offer was placed by a large player such as an exchange, which may have needed to meet a large order from a customer. By temporarily driving down the price, this large player would be able to buy bitcoins at the lower level and so fill the order cheaply.

There were other sources of ongoing selling pressure. Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket Inc. and a prominent bitcoin advocate, said some U.S. investors are selling bitcoin to finance tax bills due Oct. 15 the expiration date for the six-month extensions filed after the Internal Revenue Service announced in the spring that bitcoin sales would be subject to capital gains tax.  There are people with sizable tax bills,  Mr. Silbert said, the profit accumulation  goes all the way back to 2009. 

Bitcoin investors are also generally concerned that regulators are taking a tougher stance globally. Russia s government announced a bill over the weekend that, if passed, would declare any  money substitutes  illegal.

But if these factors invite sellers into bitcoin and keep buyers at bay, it is the lack of volume that exacerbates the market reaction. The combined average daily turnover on the biggest bitcoin exchanges runs to $60 million at current prices. By comparison, more than $5 trillion changes hands daily in the world s traditional currency markets. The thin bitcoin volume fosters volatility, which in turn decreases the digital currency s appeal as a payments vehicle, even though merchants are increasingly making it available as an option for shoppers.

One way to resolve that would be to draw bigger investors into the market. And by many accounts, there continues to be interest from institutional and wealthy investors who have been otherwise locked out of the market because the infrastructure isn t developed enough.

New York-based bitcoin derivatives provider SolidX Partners Inc., which will announce $3 million in seed-round venture-capital funding Tuesday, is among various startups seeking to address that. The firm says that in response to demand from its hedge fund clients it is developing dollar-denominated total return swaps based off bitcoin s price. By giving these investors a familiar instrument to trade without having to own bitcoin outright, SolidX will bring in  a whole other pool of capital that can, depending on what s going on, provide support or provide price pressure,  said Chief Executive Daniel H. Gallancy.

Investing in Funds & ETFS: A Quarterly Analysis --- Money Managers: ETF Giant Stomps Over to The 'Active' Side --- BlackRock, world's largest manager, makes a push in small-investor funds

Many investors are shunning actively managed mutual funds for low-cost exchange-traded funds. So why is BlackRock Inc., which owns the successful iShares ETF franchise, trying to build up its active-fund business?

The answer: Active funds for individual investors are still an enticing source of revenue for the world's largest money manager.

So New York-based BlackRock has been recruiting new fund managers for its active funds, rolling out new offerings and changing the way it markets them. The goal is to persuade advisers and individuals to use more of its active funds in tandem with its ETFs.

Although some of the new fund managers have struggled, BlackRock says it is encouraged by the early results of its push to capture more of the "retail," or individual-investor, market.

"Retail is a great growth opportunity for BlackRock world-wide," says the firm's chief executive, Laurence Fink.

With $4.6 trillion under management, BlackRock holds dominant positions in institutional money management and ETFs. But its institutional side is expected to grow at only a low single-digit pace. The firm hopes a high single-digit rate of growth in its retail business will help produce overall growth of around 5% a year.

Retail growth will come in both ETFs and active funds, the firm believes. But its more than 100 open-end active funds -- with only about $220 billion of a $15 trillion U.S. fund market -- may have more room to expand than its large ETF business, which already holds a 40% market share.

The retail push is already paying off. Although they represent about a third of the firm's assets under management, BlackRock's $1.5 trillion in global retail fund and ETF assets contribute around two-thirds of total revenue.

But the strategy relies on continuing to persuade investors that it is worth it to pay the higher management fees that actively managed funds charge (often around 1% a year of assets, compared with as little as 0.07% for some ETFs). Many people grew disillusioned with active funds after their managers did about as poorly as the market generally in 2008 and 2009.

BlackRock uses a U.S. sales force of about 130 to market its active funds and ETFs to advisers. It also guides advisers on how to best blend its active and passive products, using analytics developed for its institutional business.

Advisers no longer are interested in just hearing about the latest product, says Frank Porcelli, who oversees BlackRock's U.S. retail business. "It's all about what the [client] really wants and how the adviser can better provide it," he says.

This all started when BlackRock realized it had a problem. Many investors were either gravitating to top-performing and innovative active funds or abandoning active strategies altogether for ETFs. And many of the active funds BlackRock had acquired from other firms as it entered the retail business in the 2000s were underperformers. To shake up its active-management ranks, the firm began looking for fresh talent.

Among the key hires was Rick Rieder, a former hedge-fund manager who was tapped to help manage BlackRock's active fixed-income products.

Mr. Rieder oversees the flagship BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities fund, which has swelled to around $20 billion since it opened in 2008.

The fund has generated a five-year average annual return of 6.5% -- putting it in the top fifth of its peer group of nontraditional bond funds, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. -- by trading in many niches around the world. There isn't likely to be any broad trend to drive bond gains in the years ahead, Mr. Rieder says, so "you need to be flexible about where you go and generate a little bit of return a lot of times."

BlackRock also has seen strong inflows in other, newer offerings, including its BlackRock Global Long/Short Credit, a nearly $7 billion fund that aims to generate gains with minimal interest-rate risk.

BlackRock named Quintin Price, who had overseen its international equity investments, to overhaul a mediocre U.S.-stock fund lineup. Mr. Price has replaced the lead managers of five of the nine equities teams.

He says he has sought managers who can adapt well to changing market conditions.

Bartlett Geer took over in 2012 at BlackRock Basic Value, which seeks appreciation in large-cap stocks. It posted a 27% annualized gain in the first 18 months after his arrival, putting it in the top third of its peer group, and won a ratings upgrade to bronze at Morningstar.

Some others haven't fared as well.

After arriving in mid-2012, Timothy Keefe broadened the scope of BlackRock Flexible Equity from midcap to all cap sizes, derivatives and metals, and some bonds. But total return since has been about minus 6.6%, putting it near the bottom of its peer rankings.

BlackRock Capital Appreciation, which focuses on large-cap companies with strong growth prospects, has posted a return of about minus 3% since manager Lawrence Kemp joined at the beginning of 2013, putting it in the bottom 10% of its peer group.

Still, it is too soon to judge how the firm will fare in bolstering its stock-fund lineup, says Dan Culloton, associate director of fund analysis at Morningstar. "It's one thing to attract good managers, but can they successfully import those strategies and achieve the same level of success?" Mr. Culloton asks.

BlackRock's Mr. Fink says the firm has a "very good track record" of building and broadening its fixed-income menu, adding: "It's my expectation and hope that we do the same thing in equities. [But] the jury is still out."

An ETF Giant Stomps Over to  Active  Side; BlackRock Bets That Obituaries for Active Funds Are Premature

BlackRock uses a U.S. sales force of about 130 to market its active funds and ETFs to advisers. It also guides advisers on how to best blend its active and passive products, using analytics developed for its institutional business.

Advisers no longer are interested in just hearing about the latest product, says Frank Porcelli, who oversees BlackRock s U.S. retail business.  It s all about what the [client] really wants and how the adviser can better provide it,  he says.

This all started when BlackRock realized it had a problem. Many investors were either gravitating to top-performing and innovative active funds or abandoning active strategies altogether for ETFs. And many of the active funds BlackRock had acquired from other firms as it entered the retail business in the 2000s were underperformers. To shake up its active-management ranks, the firm began looking for fresh talent.

Among the key hires was Rick Rieder, a former hedge-fund manager who was tapped to help manage BlackRock s active fixed-income products.

Mr. Rieder oversees the flagship BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities fund, which has swelled to around $20 billion since it opened in 2008.

The fund has generated a five-year average annual return of more than 6% putting it in the top fifth of its peer group of nontraditional bond funds, according to Morningstar Inc. by trading in many niches around the world. There isn t likely to be any broad trend to drive bond gains in the years ahead, Mr. Rieder says, so  you need to be flexible about where you go and generate a little bit of return a lot of times. 

BlackRock also has seen strong inflows in other, newer offerings, including its BlackRock Global Long/Short Credit and BlackRock Multi-Asset Income funds.

Replacing Managers

BlackRock named Quintin Price, who had overseen its international equity investments, to overhaul a mediocre U.S.-stock fund lineup. Mr. Price has replaced the lead managers of five of the nine equities teams. He says he has sought managers who can adapt well to changing market conditions.

Bartlett Geer took over in 2012 at BlackRock Basic Value, which seeks appreciation in large-cap stocks. It posted a 27% annualized gain in the first 18 months after his arrival and won a ratings upgrade to bronze at Morningstar.

Some others haven t fared as well.

After arriving in mid-2012, Timothy Keefe broadened the scope of BlackRock Flexible Equity from midcap to all cap sizes, derivatives and metals, and some bonds. But total return since has been about minus 6%, putting it near the bottom of its peer rankings.

BlackRock Capital Appreciation, which focuses on large-cap companies with strong growth prospects, has ranked in the bottom half of its peer group since manager Lawrence Kemp joined at the beginning of 2013.

Still, it is too soon to judge how the firm will fare in bolstering its stock-fund lineup, says Dan Culloton, associate director of fund analysis at Morningstar.

 It s one thing to attract good managers, but can they successfully import those strategies and achieve the same level of success?  he asks.

BlackRock s Mr. Fink says the firm has a  very good track record  of building and broadening its fixed-income menu, adding:  It s my expectation and hope that we do the same thing in equities. [But] the jury is still out.

THE LONG VIEW
Banking dinosaurs will adapt to fend off technology threats

When Bill Gates speaks, bankers listen. And when he delivered a keynote speech this week at Sibos, the vast annual banking conference held this year in Boston, the symbolism was rich.

For it is now 20 years since Mr Gates dismissed banks as "dinosaurs that can be bypassed". Banking was essential, he opined, but banks were not.

In response, banks desperately clubbed together to build an internet banking platform before Microsoft did it for them.

Twenty years on, the dinosaurs have cheated extinction. Other industries have been shaken to their core, but there is no banking equivalent to the demise of Tower Records, or Borders bookshops. Even after an intervening banking crisis, the industry is dominated by the same few big names, issuing credit cards bearing the same brands, as it was when Mr Gates first dismissed them.

This does not necessarily reflect much credit on the banks. Banking is heavily regulated. That makes it prohibitively difficult to enter. Bookshops and record stores enjoy no similar privilege.

Banks also benefit from inertia. Once you have opened an account, moving banks is a pain. Starting with an unproved non-bank seems even more of a pain. Security is a further concern. People are risk-averse with their money. There is a continuing desire for a custodian - and this also reinforces incumbent banks.

The news that 76m JPMorgan customers had their personal details hacked , following big data breaches at retailers, will not inspire confidence that banks are the best available custodians - although alternative web-based financiers might find it hard to make the case that they would be much better.

But the issue here is the payment system. Because they control it, banks enjoy their greatest hold over consumers, and also their privileged position with politicians and regulators. Those who control payments cannot be allowed to fail. But increasingly, payments can be made via mobile phones, with no apparent intervention by banks.

Apple has just announced Apple Pay mobile payments - and the effect it has had on other industries is well known. If anyone can counteract the inertia surrounding bank accounts, it would be Apple. PayPal, the best-known non-bank payment provider, which has already made many fortunes, will soon be spun off from eBay. Bitcoin, the hype somewhat reduced now that its price is coming back to earth, is spawning a clutch of start-ups with clever ways to use bitcoin technology to remove the friction from making payments and transfers of money.

Most radically, banking in east Africa has been transformed by the arrival of M-Pesa, a service that allows people to pay each other using only a (non-smart) mobile phone, and without the need of a back-up bank account.

M-Pesa , which "pushes" a payment to another client, rather than providing a credit or debit card number and relying on the recipient to "pull" it, is a radically new technology. It opens the idea of splitting the payment system from the banks - a move that would make it easier to threaten banks with failure when next a financial crisis hits.

But the bankers at Sibos seem excited, not alarmed, by these new technologies. Services like PayPal sit on top of the rails of the banks' own systems, relying on credit card numbers and so on.

Even Apple Pay is not the threat it might appear. By introducing millions of iPhone users to mobile phone payments, it encourages merchants to accept them - and boost the acceptance of payments on rival Android phones. M-Pesa is remarkable, but its success has come with the unbanked, not with those who already have accounts.

None of this means that banks can avoid disruption. They must brace themselves to lose the reliable and easy revenues they generate through payments - although their core business, lending, should remain intact. The catastrophic corporate collapses driven by new internet competitors in other industries are not going to happen.

Banks also need to take care that they maintain themselves at the centre of the relationship with customers. Even if they still provide the payments infrastructure, if PayPal and others come to dominate the relationship with customers, they could reduce underlying banks to low-profit utilities - something that would be good news for everyone apart from incumbent large banks.

So banks, even in their protected position, must adapt. Technology is revolutionising them, and will keep doing so. But unless they misplay their hand, they should remain the prime financial intermediaries, and avert their extinction.

Beijing Loosens Mortgage Rules --- Central Bank Takes Direct Action in Attempt to Halt Slump in Country's Housing Market

SHANGHAI -- China loosened mortgage restrictions in one of its most high-profile efforts yet to prop up the country's housing market, which is becoming a bigger drag on the economy.

The People's Bank of China said purchasers of second homes could now be considered first-time buyers, easing down-payment requirements and giving people access to lower mortgage rates. To qualify, the home buyers have to pay off any existing mortgage debt from their first purchases.

The latest move marks the first direct action by the central government this year. So far, Beijing has largely let local governments loosen curbs against big price jumps and property speculation and urged banks to make more mortgage loans. Property developers and analysts have long called for a move like Tuesday's as a way to lift property sales.

But economists said the latest policy easing falls short of more aggressive stimulus efforts and is unlikely to reverse the slide in the country's housing market, which is plagued by the more fundamental problems of oversupply and overinvestment.

"This is part of China's piecemeal targeted easing," said Changchun Hua, an economist at Nomura. "It would ease some pent-up demand from upgraders, but it would not end the property-market correction."

China's property slump is likely to last longer than previous downturns and poses the biggest threat to the economy, many economists say. According to Moody'sAnalytics, the property sector accounts for one-fourth of the Chinese economy, affecting building materials, home appliances and transport.

The latest sign of weakness came Tuesday, when a gauge of prices for new homes in 100 Chinese posted its largest month-to-month drop in its four-year history. Average new-home prices fell 0.9% in September from August, accelerating from a 0.6% decline in August from July, according to China Real Estate Index System, a data provider. On a year-over-year basis, home prices rose 1.1%.

The housing slump comes amid signs of other economic weakness. Also Tuesday, a survey of purchasing managers in manufacturing, conducted by HSBC Holdings PLC and the data firm Markit, showed a second consecutive month of sluggish growth in factory activity in September.

The People's Bank of China said home buyers who have paid off their prior mortgages can now be considered first-home buyers and can make down payments of 30%. Previously, such home buyers would either not qualify for a housing loan or have to pay a minimum 60% down payment. Banks could also offer as much as a 30% discount on benchmark rates for mortgages, the statement said.

China saw large-scale inflows of investment in the property market after the government implemented a major package of stimulus measures in 2009. The frenetic building that followed left the country littered with empty buildings.

More aggressive policy easing, such as cutting interest rates or the proportion of deposits banks must hold as reserves at the central bank, could reinvigorate the housing market. But over the long term, such moves would worsen China's debt levels and could contribute to rising inventories of housing, Nomura analysts said in a note to clients Monday. They added that the current correction could last from two to four years.

Since the start of the year, property developers have been cutting property prices to entice home buyers and to reduce their inventories. Many home buyers have faced difficulties and delays securing housing loans as banks tightened their purse strings.

Alibaba affiliate wins approval for bank licence; Banks

China's bank regulator has approved the launch of two privately owned commercial banks, part of a broader effort to offer better financing options for small companies and increase competition in the state-dominated banking sector.

An affiliate of Alibaba yesterday received a licence to open a bank in the prosperous east coast city of Hangzhou, where the e-commerce group has its headquarters. Alibaba will partner with Fosun International, one of China's largest private conglomerates, to form Zhejiang Internet Commerce Bank, whose Chinese name plays on the similar pronunciations of the two characters for "online" and "commerce".

The bank "will mainly satisfy the investment and financing needs of micro-companies and individual consumers, which refer to deposit products under Rmb200,000 ($32,500) and loan products under Rmb5mn," Fosun said in a statement.

China's banking system is dominated by large state-owned institutions that have traditionally favoured lending to big, state-owned corporate borrowers. Small, privately owned companies often struggle to obtain capital.

Policy makers hope that private banks will meet the needs of such borrowers, which economists say provide about 60 per cent of gross domestic product and about 75 per cent of new jobs.

"Alibaba's small bank won't influence the incumbent banks' existing clients, but it will compete for new clients," said Zou Hengchao, bank analyst at Minsheng Securities. "Alibaba can exploit its Big Data advantage by looking at its internal transaction data to assess risk. That will give them an advantage in finding micro-sized clients. When (traditional) banks talk about small and micro-enterprise clients, it's usually (loans worth) less than Rmb5m. Ali's clients will be even smaller, perhaps less than 1m."

Alibaba and Tencent have already begun competing with banks for funds by selling online money-market funds that offer cash on demand, such as deposits, but at higher interest rates than deposits from bricks-and-mortar banks.

The China Banking Regulatory Commission in March announced its intention to grant banking licences to 10 separate private companies.

Moody's Raises Guidance, Will Acquire Remaining Shares of Copal Amba; Company Also Expands Range of Possible Stock Buybacks

Moody's Corp. raised its annual earnings target and the potential level of share buybacks at its investor day on Tuesday, as it benefits from strong demand for its credit ratings and market analytics.

Executives for New York-based Moody's also said rising interest rates wouldn't necessarily translate into a slowdown in the bond market and demand for its credit ratings.

"Issuers adjust to these higher rates because they have to refinance their debt books," said Linda Huber, Moody's chief financial officer. "If we see higher rates because of stronger [economic] growth, that is not a bad scenario for us. That is a fine scenario."

Moody's foresees a stronger finish to the year. It now expects full-year per-share earnings between $3.95 and $4.05, up from its previous forecast of $3.90 to $4 a share. The updated guidance includes costs related to recent acquisitions, including Tuesday's move to acquire full ownership of Copal Amba, a research service used by financial institutions. Moody's currently owns two-thirds of Copal Amba, which has large operations in India and Costa Rica.

It also boosted its outlook for U.S. revenue in its ratings division to growth in the high-single digits, from its prior forecast of growth in the mid-single digit range.

The world's No. 2 credit-rating firm also increased its full-year share repurchases to up to $1.25 billion, from $1 billion. Moody's has already repurchased just under $800 million in shares this year.

Moody's stock is up 20.6% in 2014 versus an 8.3% rise at rival McGraw Hill Financial Inc., the parent company of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.

After a slow start to the year, global bond issuance volume has remained relatively strong. Moody's and rivals S&P and Fitch Ratings get paid to issue credit ratings on bond deals, and they benefit when debt markets are active.

On July 25, Moody's puzzled some analysts when it reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its second quarter but didn't raise its full-year earnings outlook. Executives said then they would again address the full-year outlook on investor day.

Moody's generates about 70% of its $3 billion in yearly revenue from issuing credit ratings, but a growing part of its overall business comes from its Moody's Analytics division.

Compared to nine rivals in the information-service industry, Moody's has been less active in mergers and acquisitions, completing seven mid- to small-sized deals in the past five years. That compares to an average of 20 at competing firms. While the firm would still take a cautious, methodical approach, "We would like to find slightly larger deals," said David Platt, Moody's head of corporate development.

Of the "nearly five dozen cases" filed in the U.S. related to crisis-era behavior, less than one quarter of them remain, said John Goggins, Moody's general counsel. Outside the U.S., 18 cases have been dismissed or withdrawn. Only six cases are open abroad, Mr. Goggins.

Moody's also said it would purchase the remaining outstanding shares of Copal Amba. In a release, the company didn't disclose the cost of the deal, but Ms. Huber said during her presentation that the price would likely be "slightly below $200 million" and should close in December.

The deal will be funded with international cash on hand and won't have an impact on 2014 per-share earnings, Moody's said.

"We now believe we have a complete research and product offering for financial institutions globally," said Moody's Chief Executive Ray McDaniel.

Erin McCarthy contributed to this article.

Banks' Tax Trade Questioned by Feds

By Jenny Strasburg

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -- Large banks generate more than $1 billion a year in revenue by helping hedge funds and other clients reduce taxes through a complicated trading strategy that has drawn criticism from U.S. authorities.

Known as "dividend arbitrage," the strategy is run largely from London, where the banks temporarily transfer ownership of a client's shares to a lower-tax jurisdiction around the time when the client expects to collect a dividend on those shares, according to people familiar with the matter.

The maneuver typically enables bank clients to reduce taxes from as much as 30% of the dividend payment to 10% or so -- and sometimes to zero. The savings are divided between the client, bank and entities that take ownership of the shares. The business largely involves stocks listed in Europe and Asia.

Banks and hedge funds say dividend arbitrage is an attractive, legal way to shrink tax bills through the differences in withholding rates around the world. But Bank of America Corp. recently was questioned by U.S. regulators about potential legal and reputational risks from the maneuver, according to a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

The Richmond Fed oversees Bank of America because it is based in Charlotte, N.C. Examiners asked earlier this year about the bank's dividend-arbitrage clients and trades, people familiar with the discussions said.

Bank of America is "responding to the risks that were raised," the Fed spokesman said.

The regulator's concerns with Bank of America haven't been disclosed publicly. Richmond Fed officials passed along their concerns to the broader Federal Reserve system. It isn't clear if other banks have been questioned about the strategy.

Other banks that arrange similar transfers of corporate stock include Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, according to clients and people involved in the business. Banks collect fees on the transactions.

Citadel, Lansdowne Partners Ltd. and Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC are among the firms that have benefited from dividend-arbitrage trades, as well as banks that work as custodians of pension-fund assets. The hedge-fund firms declined to comment.

Some clients benefit in the form of lower trading costs and financing rates on their overall business with major banks without explicitly telling the banks to shift a stock's ownership to a lower-tax jurisdiction.

Banks' tax-cutting moves are facing broad criticism. The Obama administration is cracking down on inversions, a type of corporate merger that can cut tax bills. Swiss banks have reined in offshore accounts.

Dividend arbitrage used to be an even bigger business than it is now, but criticism by Senate investigators in 2008 and the closing of loopholes by U.S. tax authorities made it much harder to shrink dividend taxes on U.S.-listed stocks. Other countries also have made it harder to use the strategy with shares of companies listed or based there.

Still, the strategy remains popular as part of a wider offering of services aimed at helping clients reduce their tax exposure. Dividend arbitrage remains attractive because of wide variations in tax rules throughout the world. Banks generally have shifted the focus of their dividend-arbitrage work to London.

"Banks see reputational issues in dividend arbitrage," said Nigel Feetham, a Gibraltar-based lawyer specializing in financial services and taxes. "Tax authorities themselves are increasingly challenging tax arbitragers."

Concerns about possible risks from the strategy spurred a meeting at Bank of America last year that was attended by investment-banking chief Thomas Montag, according to people familiar with the situation.

At the time, Mr. Montag also was co-chief operating officer at Bank of America. He now is the company's sole operating chief. He couldn't be reached.

Last year, Bank of America estimated that trades aimed at helping clients reduce withholding taxes on stock dividends generated more than $1.2 billion for the bank from 2006 to 2012, according to people familiar with the internal estimates. The bank projected it would get $100 million in revenue from the trades in 2013, mostly from Europe, these people added.

"It's still a very profitable trade for hedge funds and broker-dealers," said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at trade-analytics company S3 Partners. The New York firm's Blacklight software program helps hedge funds assess dividend returns.

In one of the most common types of dividend arbitrage, a bank and client enter into a stock swap, a derivative transaction in which the bank takes possession of the client's shares of another company. The bank then transfers the shares to a subsidiary or third party in a country where the dividend would incur a lower tax compared with where the client is based -- or no taxes at all.

When the dividend is paid on the shares, the dividend is subject to lower taxes and the holder of the shares pockets a much higher percentage of the dividend payment. The tax savings is divided among the bank, its client and the holder of the stock. Some clients then opt to take back the shares.

"From a financial point of view, it is a beautiful strategy," said Stephen Diggle, head of Vulpes Investment Management in Singapore. "From a public point of view, no one wants to draw down the ire of a government."

Mr. Diggle is battling Bank of America over returns he claims he is owed by the bank on dividend-arbitrage trades involving European stocks several years ago, according to people familiar with the matter. The dispute involves claims of about $10 million, these people said.

Because of the dispute, he has stopped pursuing the strategy. "We haven't stopped for moral reasons," Mr. Diggle said.

The continuing fight with Mr. Diggle was one reason for the meeting that Mr. Montag attended last year. Bank of America investment-banking executives met at the bank's midtown Manhattan offices to debate the pros and cons of dividend arbitrage, people familiar with the meeting said.

Mr. Montag wanted to understand more about which clients were doing the trades and how much revenue they produced for Bank of America.

Bank of America's stock-financing desk was told to be careful about how it works with clients, these people said. Executives decided the business was too lucrative to walk away from, and Bank of America has continued to arrange the transactions.

FT REPORT - RISK MANAGEMENT
Tide of cheap capital lowers cost of terrorism insurance; Reinsurance

The industry could find itself exposed to huge claims, as it was after September 11, reports Brian Bollen

It might seem counterintuitive to the lay person, absurd even, but terrorism insurance rates are languishing at low levels and look set to stay there, despite recent events in the Middle East and elsewhere.

The principal reason given by insurers is simple: while there is an apparent dearth of capital in the retail insurance market, the reinsurance world is awash with capital. The low interest rate environment is pushing institutional investors into unfamiliar areas in the search for yield, creating fresh sources of capital for reinsurers to access, and increasing competition for new business.

Julian Enoizi, chief executive of Pool Re, whose sole business is reinsurance says: "Terrorism reinsurance rates have steadily declined from their height 10 years ago, because there have been relatively few serious events since September 11, 2001. That lower incidence of events has made terrorism insurance and reinsurance appear more profitable and means that rates are competitive," he adds.

The cost of reinsurance claims has also dropped: although localised violence is killing people in a number of countries, it is property claims and disruption to commerce that are traditionally much more expensive.

This does not mean, however, that the industry can afford to take undue risk, warns Justin Balcombe, UK head of general insurance consulting at KPMG. In 1993, he dealt with claims arising from the Bishopsgate bombing in London. More recently he has worked on claims arising from political issues in the Middle East and Africa.

All have underlined the commercial danger of not having the correct insurance values, including adequate business interruption coverage.

"The reinsurance industry is well capitalised and capable of responding to major claims events. However, that doesn't mean that cover should be reduced or diluted just because there hasn't been a trigger event. Fortunately, we have seen nothing of the magnitude of 9/11 in recent years, [but] we should not become complacent. Risks have become far more technical, complex and in many areas, highly unpredictable. This, in turn, presents a plethora of challenges for the entire insurance market and value chain," Mr Balcombe says.

James Hannan, an underwriter of terrorism and political insurance and reinsurance at Antares, a Lloyd's of London syndicate, notes that terrorism cover is increasingly included in property catastrophe insurance policies as a standard peril - as it was in the days before September 11 2001. (Afterwards, the industry, reeling from more than $40bn of losses, realised the risk was not being properly valued, and began to charge separately.)

"The growth in competition brings not only pricing pressure but greater breadth and depth of coverage in contracts," he says. "When something is offered that wasn't before, that is further indication of a softening market."

Partly echoing these concerns, AM Best, a global credit rating agency that focuses on the insurance industry, released its annual review of the reinsurance sector in September. This includes a ranking of reinsurers and geographic breakouts of reinsurance segments. In the report, How Relevant is the Underwriting Cycle? , the company states that capital continues to be drawn to the reinsurance industry, even though income is falling while costs are rising.

The report explains how downward pressure on investment yields and underwriting margins will ultimately place a drag on financial strength.

AM Best recently revised its ratings outlook on the reinsurance industry to negative from stable. "This reflects the longer-term competitive outlook," explains Catherine Thomas, London-based director, analytics. "It may be well capitalised now, but market dynamics are going against it," she concludes.

While the firm does not foresee a significant number of negative outlooks or downgrades in the very near term, "the market headwinds at this point present the industry with significant longer-term challenges".

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Rathbones stands behind big bet on US stocks; FUND FOCUS; Long-term prospects outweigh disappointing two years

James Thomson, Rathbones ' global equity fund manager, has pledged not to raise his hefty bet on the US further, after it reached almost 70 per cent of his portfolio.

The manager said clients had started raising the matter of his extremely high weighting in the world's biggest stock market, but he believes the US currently offers the best potential for "risk-adjusted returns".

In spite of its focus being on US stocks, the fund cannot be written off by investors as simply a "North American fund" because its regional weightings will continue to evolve over time, he said.

The manager's 69.1 per cent position in the US is significantly higher than the "neutral" weighting on the fund's benchmark, the FTSE World index, which was 51.2 per cent at the end of August.

"That's something that some clients have mentioned," Mr Thompson said. "People want a global fund, so I do not think I should go beyond that. People want multiple country exposure which is why they buy global."

The big US bet has been adopted on Mr Thomson's 450.4m Global Opportunities fund, which just two years ago had a weighting in the US of 35 per cent.

During that time the US has outperformed other developed markets , with the S&P 500 index gaining 39 per cent compared to 22.5 per cent on the UK's FTSE 100, according to FE Analytics.

In spite of ramping up his US weighting, Mr Thomson has lagged behind his benchmark in the past two years, gaining 28.4 per cent versus 32 per cent on the FTSE World.

The short-term woes come as he has been focusing on smaller-sized companies, particularly in the 'mid-cap' section of the US stock market.

These areas have lagged behind larger companies amid recent rallies, with the Russell 2000 index of small companies in the US falling by 2 per cent in 2014 so far compared to an S&P 500 index gain of 9.7 per cent.

The manager said his favoured investment sectors had also fallen out of favour lately. "Performance has been disappointing, but I do not feel too paranoid," he said. "I feel the fund is a coiled spring. The long-term prospects are as good as I have ever seen them."

Mr Thomson said he had raised his US exposure this year as he invested in a "broad swath" of sectors including consumer related stocks, technology companies and aerospace businesses.

In spite of the short-term hit, in the past five years the fund has gained 74.1 per cent versus a 68.4 per cent benchmark rise. Over 10 years the fund has gained 192.5 per cent, far higher than the FTSE World's 140.4 per cent rise.

Google has commissioned research on how it could enter the asset management industry, adding weight to widespread fears in the fund sector that the world's biggest internet companies could destroy the livelihoods of established fund houses.

Google asked a financial services research firm, which has a record of helping large companies tackle new markets, to assess how to enter asset management two years ago. The research firm cannot be named for confidentiality reasons.

Although Google has not made a concrete move towards asset management since the study, its interest in the sector is likely to alarm large fund groups that are already struggling to keep up with new technology.

A senior executive at a large US fund company told FTfm in April that its "biggest fear" was Google deciding to enter the fund management sector.

At an FT conference in London earlier this month, Graham Kellen, head of technology at Schroders, one of Europe's largest listed fund houses, said: "Obviously this is something we as an institution are concerned about [and] continue to monitor."

The likelihood of Google or Facebook entering the market was frequently discussed as a "real threat" at a senior level within Barclays Wealth & Investment Management, according to a former executive at the bank.

Google has already displayed a keen interest in becoming more than just a search engine. Its venture capital arm has invested in more than 189 companies including Uber, a taxi app, and Kensho, a financial analytics firm.

Google also invests in more conventional financial assets such as government bonds. In 2010 the internet group launched a California-headquartered trading operation, which also has a bank-style trading floor, to manage its cash pile better.

But Campbell Fleming, chief executive of UK fund house Threadneedle, asked how easily large internet groups would be able to penetrate the market. "Google would find the fund management market more difficult than it thinks. There are significant barriers to entry and it's not something you could get into overnight," he said.

Catherine Tillotson, managing partner at Scorpio Partnership, a wealth management consultancy, agreed that regulatory oversight, as well as investor demands, would present a significant hurdle. She said: "Entering a highly regulated industry is not something you do lightly. There probably is a subsection of investors who would have confidence in Google, but I think the vast majority of investors want a relationship with an entity which can supply them with high quality information, market knowledge and a view on that market. I think it is unlikely they would turn to Google for those qualities."

Mr Fleming conceded that Google might have more luck in persuading retail investors to buy funds where established groups have failed. "A lot of these companies have better brand loyalty and are trusted more than many financial services companies. I can see [Google] going ahead given their customer reach."

A PwC report in January concluded that fund managers' failure to keep up with technological change will create opportunities for groups like Apple, Twitter and Amazon to break into the market.

Big internet groups branching into fund management could also present opportunities for the incumbents, according to David Stevenson, head of business development at Baring Asset Management.

"Google or Facebook could make a lot of money by distributing other peoples' funds. Would I buy a Google fund? No. But would I buy a fund distributed by Google? Absolutely."

Google declined to comment.

Good morning,

The bond king has been deposed. But what of his former kingdom? Following the unexpected departure Friday of Pacific Investment Management Co. co-founder Bill Gross, we find that Pimco suffered roughly $10 billion of withdrawals a sign of how quickly Mr. Gross's move is reshaping the bond-investing landscape. Meanwhile, a complicated trading strategy known as "dividend arbitrage" generated more than $1 billion a year in revenue for large banks by helping hedge funds and other clients reduce taxes. The banks and funds say it's legal, but the maneuver has drawn criticism from U.S. authorities. Speaking of taxes, we note that European Union regulators are to say Tuesday why they believe that tax deals granted to Apple and Fiat violated EU law. And with regard to the market, E.S. Browning says that we can expect more volatility because stocks are in Wall Street lingo "priced for perfection," which means the prices are so high that gains depend on a very favorable investing environment, with strong corporate profits, low interest rates, low inflation and continued global growth.

Pro-democracy crowds continued to grow even after police used repeated rounds of tear gas to disperse them in several areas of Hong Kong the harshest response against protesters in the city's most serious confrontation with Beijing in more than a decade. We report that the Chinese leadership has taken a hard line in the brewing dispute over democracy in Hong Kong, issuing warnings to protest organizers and pushing business leaders to support its stance, allowing universal suffrage but only letting people vote for previously approved candidates. As students have led the push for democracy in Hong Kong all summer, we note that the fight over democracy has exposed a deep generational and economic divide. The protests, meanwhile, threaten to weaken Hong Kong's economy, which has suffered as Chinese growth has slowed. Banks in the area shut branches and activated contingency plans today. And stocks in Hong Kong fell as investors monitored a continuing crackdown on the city's pro-democracy protests.

Antwerp's trial of 46 alleged homegrown militants shows a dangerous new reality: Europe is a recruiting ground for jihad fighters heading to Syria and Iraq. Our story analyzes how Belgium became a hub for recruiting jihadists, noting that, according to Belgian authorities, dozens of members from an extremist Islamic group named Sharia4Belgium allegedly joined the fight in the Middle East. We note that many European countries are now rolling out tougher legislation, believing that broader surveillance powers and more prosecutions can reverse these flows. Meanwhile, we consider whether "deradicalization" programs can stem the flow of extremists. In these programs, police, social workers and Muslim-community groups identify residents at risk of becoming radicalized and try to counter the allure of militant ideologies.

Have you ever spoken to a machine? Our story looks at what it is like to converse with Amelia, the nearest thing yet to a real-life version of Samantha, the artificial-intelligence operating system in the movie "Her." Incubated for the past decade at an IT services firm called IPSoft, Amelia can solve problems if the answer appears in the data she gets. Our technology columnist Christopher Mims looks at where Amelia fits in the history of artificial intelligence, which includes IBM's "Jeopardy"-winning Watson. He also considers applications for artificial intelligence, such as call centers. " &[T]he reason Amelia knows the correct answer is that she is ingesting every single support request the company receives and learning from the answers humans dispense to customers," he writes. Despite her abilities, we note that the one thing Amelia isn't is alive; she is still just a clever way to automate tasks.

Activist Presses Yahoo, AOL Deal

The pressure on Yahoo Inc. chief Marissa Mayer to make a bold move intensified Friday with a new challenge from an activist investor experienced in fighting tech companies.

In a letter sent to the CEO, Starboard Value LP revealed it has taken a stake in Yahoo and pushed the company to reduce costs, explore a combination with AOL Inc. and spell out plans for its Asian assets. Starboard didn't say how much it had invested in Yahoo.

Starboard is voicing the loudest objection to Ms. Mayer in the more than two years since she took the reins at Yahoo, a period in which the Internet portal has failed to expand its core advertising business and struggled to reinvent itself in an age of social networks and mobile computing.

In a statement Friday, Ms. Mayer said Yahoo would review Starboard's letter and is committed to delivering value to shareholders.

Starboard's letter also put into focus the question of how Yahoo should deploy the more than $5 billion it will receive from selling a portion of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Yahoo's finance chief, Ken Goldman, has committed to returning at least half of that amount to shareholders through a buyback or dividend. Along with $1.55 billion in net cash, that would leave Yahoo with some $4 billion to spend on one or more acquisitions with the goal of accelerating growth.

An acquisition of AOL, with a current market value of $3.5 billion, could fall just within Yahoo's budget. That tie-up could help Yahoo bolster its advertising technology and create a stronger third competitor in the online ad market dominated by Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. But it also would combine two aging Web businesses that are struggling to adapt to new consumer behaviors.

"It's buying more of what they already have," said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research.

AOL declined to comment. Yahoo shares rose 4% Friday, while AOL gained 3.7% following the news.

Jacqueline Reses, Yahoo's merger chief, ruled out the possibility of an AOL acquisition in comments she made at a technology conference in July. When asked if she thought AOL would be acquired in the next two years, she said, "Not by us."

In Friday's statement, Ms. Mayer said she would update investors on how Yahoo plans to spend money when it reports quarterly earnings, likely in October.

Ms. Mayer is likely to draw on the support of a board composed mostly of directors added during her tenure. Not counting Ms. Mayer, five of the eight other board members were brought on while she was CEO, including Yahoo co-founder David Filo, who she has worked closely with on company culture and technology; Lee Scott, with whom she served on the board of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; and Max Levchin, a fellow Silicon Valley technologist.

Starboard first gained wide public recognition for its bruising 2012 fight with AOL. After months of bitter public letters, the activist investor lost a campaign to gain board seats but exited its position with a profit.

Starboard, which manages more than $3 billion in assets, according to a person familiar with the matter, has in recent years filed more activist positions than any other firm, but typically it targets smaller companies than Yahoo.

The investor is also in the middle of a proxy fight with Darden Restaurants Inc. and on Thursday won the support of two influential proxy-advisory firms in its bid to unseat the restaurant operator's 12-person board. It owns an 8.8% position in Darden worth $400 million, its largest position to date.

Starboard didn't reveal its position in Yahoo, but the lack of a regulatory disclosure means it is likely to be less than 5%. Activists have shown the ability to target larger companies like Yahoo, which has a $40 billion market capitalization, with smaller stakes. It would only take about a 1% stake at Yahoo to be a top 10 shareholder.

Starboard believes a combination with AOL would realize $1 billion in savings and, among other things, could help Yahoo cope with the weakness in the market for online display ads -- the banners that run on websites. These ads have long constituted Yahoo's core business, but are now less desired by advertisers who can choose from an array of digital, mobile and social media inventory. As a result, display ads have been falling, leading to Yahoo's revenue slide 3% in the second quarter, its fourth decline in the past five periods.

AOL has demonstrated in its last few quarters an ability to get advertisers to pay higher rates for "premium" or high-end display ads. The company has also made a push into "programmatic" advertising, offering online marketers and publishers automated tools and software aimed at making their advertising more efficient and precise. Yahoo has lagged behind in this area -- some marketers view its ad technology as outdated and subpar.

A tie-up, however, would present integration challenges and wouldn't solve one of the major dilemmas facing both companies: users and advertisers are shifting to mobile devices, where the advantages of AOL's and Yahoo's large Web audiences no longer apply. Both companies have started selling mobile ads but neither is making a significant enough portion of revenue from them to break it out in earnings results.

Should Ms. Mayer reject Starboard's proposal to merge with AOL and cut costs, she will have to pitch investors on an alternative plan soon, said Eric Jackson, founder and managing director of Ironfire Capital, which owns shares in Yahoo.

"Marissa knows that within four months from now, if she does nothing, Starboard will probably seek a short slate of directors to be elected to the Yahoo board for the next June meeting," Mr. Jackson said. "And they'll have a good chance of being successful."

Part of Ms. Mayer's plan may lie in acquiring a large tech startup. In recent weeks, the company has reached out to venture capitalists to learn about which companies might be interested in a sale, according to people who were contacted by Yahoo. "They are asking 'what big companies should we buy?'," one of the people said.

Starboard criticized Yahoo's acquisition strategy, saying Ms. Mayer has spent at least $1.3 billion on highly valued startups. The deals during her tenure include three dozen small acquisitions, ranging from an e-commerce analytics tool to a Web browser toan image-recognition company.

"We do not believe the company should be pursuing acquisitions of companies at high multiples of revenue as it has done repeatedly in the past," Starboard said in its letter.

Ms. Mayer has said the company relies on acquisitions to add small teams of engineers who can build new products that will attract users and, eventually, advertisers.

Yahoo is also researching ways to avoid paying taxes when it sells its remaining stake in Alibaba. That stake is currently valued at $21.5 billion, if Yahoo paid taxes at the current 38% capital-gains rate.

A tax-avoiding maneuver could involve acquiring a foreign asset or doing a complicated arrangement called a cash-rich split, where one of its Asian partners acquires a U.S. firm and then transfers the asset to Yahoo in exchange for its remaining shares in Alibaba or Yahoo Japan.

Yahoo is no stranger to activism. Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC owned more than 5% in 2012 when it ousted CEO Scott Thompson, gained board seats and supported the appointment of Ms. Mayer. Third Point eventually stepped down from the board and exited its position.

In 2008, Carl Icahn also took a more than 5% stake in Yahoo, gained board seats and pushed it to sell itself to Microsoft Corp. in a deal that ultimately fell apart.

WSJ.D Technology: Chinese Firms Swoop Into Israel Seeking Tech Investments

TEL AVIV -- Chinese investors are pouring millions into Israel-focused, technology-investment funds -- as well as launching their own funds and investing directly in Israeli startups -- amid a frenzy of tech investment and deal making here.

Yongjin Group Inc., a Chinese equity-investment management and financial- services company, has put between $15 million and $20 million into Israeli venture fund Pitango Venture Capital during the past year, according to people familiar with the matter.

Lenovo Group Ltd., the big Chinese computer maker, meanwhile, invested around $10 million in Canaan Partners Israel, a venture fund affiliated with American-based Canaan Partners, in late August.

And Ping An Venture, the venture investment arm of Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., one of China's biggest financial conglomerates, in November created a $100 million fund dedicated to U.S. and Israel tech ventures. It has made a total of six investments in Israeli startups so far, according to Jiang Zhang, an associate director at Ping An Ventures.

The moves come amid a frenzy of fundraising among Israeli entrepreneurs. Israeli and foreign investors, lured by a drumbeat of stock-market listings and acquisitions among Israeli tech startups, have rushed in.

In the first half of 2014, 335 Israeli high-tech companies raised a record $1.6 billion in capital, according to estimates by consultancy IVC Industry Analytics and KMPG. That was 81% higher than in the year-earlier period.

While Israeli, European and American investors have long trawled Israel for tech opportunities, Chinese investors are relatively new here. Industry insiders say that so far, they have preferred longer-term bets and looked for technology that is already being used back home, or sought investment possibilities there.

"Most of the investments we're seeing are strategic investments and not purely financial ones," said Yoav Sade, a partner in law firm Meitar Liquornik Geva Leshem Tal and vice chairman of the Israel-China Chamber of Commerce.

"Chinese investors would look for tech companies that already have a product and sales with an added value that has to do with China," said Mr. Sade. "Many times, the investment contracts include commercialization licenses for operations in China."

In July, Chinese venture fund SAIF Partners participated in a $15 million funding round in app-monetization company SupersonicAds Ltd. It was SAIF's first investment in an Israeli company, according to Ben Ng, a partner at SAIF Partners, who joined Supersonic's board following the investment.

At the same time, Supersonic announced plans to expand its business in China, Japan and India, saying it intended to open offices in Beijing, Tokyo and Bangalore.

"For the last two years, SAIF has been looking to expand its portfolio with a cross-border view. We're looking at companies in Israel" and Silicon Valley, said Mr. Ng.

Ping An and Chinese venture investor China Broadband Capital Partners LP took part in a $85-million, pre-initial public offering funding round in adware company IronSource Ltd. IronSource launched its Chinese branch with offices in Beijing this week.

Despite these direct investments, much of the early money is being funneled through Israeli funds. Chinese Internet-security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. and Web search giant Baidu Inc. have both invested in Carmel Ventures, an Israel venture fund, according to people familiar with the matter, with Qihoo putting in about $10 million in early 2014.

Qihoo has also invested money with Jerusalem Venture Partners, according to people familiar with the matter.

Firms Near a Deal To Create Chat Rival

By Justin Baer

Wall Street firms led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are close to a deal to create an instant-messaging service to rival that of Bloomberg LP.

A buyout of messaging startup Perzo Inc. could be announced as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter. While it could be months before the firms have a product ready for trading desks, the project is gaining momentum, the people say.

The number of banks and money managers working with Goldman on the purchase has swelled to 14 in recent weeks, as Wall Street's search for an alternative to the data and media giant's chat services turns rivals into allies.

Banks and money managers have long relied on Bloomberg terminals to keep their employees up to speed on market moves and to help them communicate with one another electronically. But increasingly they have griped about the $20,000-a-year price tag that Bloomberg charges for each terminal, and the data company's refusal to sell many services on an a la carte basis.

Those frustrations have only deepened since the financial crisis, as many of the world's biggest banks -- and many of Bloomberg's biggest customers -- move to pare expenses and shrink trading businesses reined in by new regulations.

By backing what they hope will become a viable alternative to Bloomberg's messaging service -- a function widely used by traders -- some bank executives believe they may ultimately weaken Bloomberg's resolve and negotiate a better price for their terminals.

The firms that recently joined the discussions are Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Jefferies LLC, Nomura Holdings Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., according to people familiar with the investment.

The banks and money managers also are in talks with Thomson Reuters to explore ways to integrate the new messaging service into its Eikon platform, a Bloomberg competitor, some of the people said.

A Bloomberg spokesman declined to comment. A Thomson Reuters spokesman didn't respond to requests for comment.

Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman was leading a consortium that at the time included Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and HSBC Holdings PLC as well as money managers BlackRock Inc., Maverick Capital Ltd. and Citadel LLC.

The firms are in talks to create a holding company called Symphony Communication Services LLC, which in turn would buy Perzo and fold in Goldman's internal messaging project, some of the people said.

The group has considered paying $40 million to $50 million for the business, some of the people familiar with the matter said, though it isn't clear if the additional firms' interest has changed the financial terms. Perzo was founded in 2012 by David Gurle, a former executive at Microsoft Corp. and Skype. Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Perzo is backed by Merus Capital, a venture-capital firm founded by former Google Inc. executive Sean Dempsey.

Some of the participating firms are expected to have a larger stake in the new company than others, people familiar with the matter said.

The consortium's initial members had pushed to recruit more of their peers to join them, reasoning that the new service stands a better chance at widespread acceptance that way, the people said. Mr. Gurle is expected to remain with the company following the deal, they said.

Of course, Bloomberg's terminals offer many other functions that the addition of an alternative messaging service won't replace. But members of the consortium believe if they can loosen Bloomberg's grip on one of the most popular features, they might be able to gain pricing leverage on the data giant.

"One of the sticky pieces for Bloomberg is messaging," said David Rho, associate partner with MMG Partners, which analyzes how firms use their Bloomberg terminals and advises on ways to lower costs. "If the messaging component was neutralized, that would severely hamper Bloomberg's ability to maintain that stickiness."

Mr. Rho said clients often tell him Bloomberg's communications functions, including email and messaging, make it difficult for trading-desk managers to shed terminals. For some employees including salespeople, messaging functions may account for more than half of their terminal usage, he said. "To say this is going to get rid of Bloomberg -- that's an impossibility," he said. "But it will require Bloomberg to possibly be more competitive from a pricing perspective."

The talks on a rival service come as banks face greater scrutiny from regulators on their traders' communications. A flurry of international investigations has moved many firms to monitor more closely how their employees interact with one another and the outside world. In January, the Journal reported that Goldman had moved to ban its traders from using certain chat services.

Some backers of the new platform say it will allow them to better customize and police traders' messages.

Bloomberg executives have said the company already provides clients with tools to monitor and control employee messages sent through its system. And they argue that a stand-alone chat platform couldn't integrate as seamlessly other functions that the Bloomberg terminal offers, from data and news to analytics.

Bloomberg's news service competes with Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Journal.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Female founders step forward; Entrepreneurship: Women in tech

More women are winning backing for start-ups by focusing on tricky areas such as fashion and beauty, writes Sarah Mishkin

Michelle Lam is a former venture capitalist and once served as chief financial officer for a data company bought by the US's Securities and Exchange Commission. Now she is a start-up founder, working out of an office in a trendy San Francisco neighbourhood lined with racks of the stylish yet sensible-looking lingerie, mostly bras, that her company True & Co designs and sells online .

She launched True & Co in 2012 after a frustrating shopping trip. She realised she could use her experience in data analysis and management, and her insights into the problems women encounter while shopping, to launch her own start-up. By crunching data on return rates and customer feedback and using that to redesign and launch products quickly, she says True & Co can make better fitting clothes.

Female start-up founders remain a minority but Ms Lam, who was the first female principal at Bain Capital Ventures, is one of a growing number in Silicon Valley specialising in ecommerce .

"We're at the point in history when we have more experienced women who have exactly the background that VCs trust - and the observations as to how to tackle a space - that are the hallmarks of a good entrepreneur," says Anna Zornosa, founder of ecommerce clothing company Ruby Ribbon.

Fourteen per cent of venture capital investments this year in the US have gone to companies founded or co-founded by a woman but the figure for ecommerce start-ups is higher and rising quickly, according to PitchBook, a VC and private equity research firm.

Among ecommerce companies, nearly 40 per cent of the start-ups winning venture capital backing were founded or co-founded by women, according to PitchBook. That is up from below 20 per cent in 2009.

Many investors find ecommerce difficult to get right. Ecommerce start-ups must master not only technology but also logistics, including multinational supply chains, inventory and consumer marketing.

But ecommerce is attractive to some entrepreneurs and investors precisely because the difficulties mean it has fewer competitors as well as room to expand. Despite the efforts of Amazon, eBay and others, less than 10 per cent of retail shopping overall in the US happens online. That has entrepreneurs racing to figure out how to sell online the types of goods that people buy primarily offline.

Among the more stubborn categories are women's beauty and fashion, areas where many new female founders have chosen to focus.

Checking fit, quality and colour is hugely important but hard to do virtually. Many of the new companies are trying to develop business models that can get those shoppers to feel more comfortable making such purchases online, an area in which these female founders, many of whom are not engineers, are trying to find ways to innovate.

"Not to be flippant but most VCs want to back the founder who knows something about the product," says Amy Errett, a VC-turned-hair-dyeentrepreneur.

Ms Errett says she got inspiration for her company, Madison Reed, in the hair colouring aisle at a pharmacy and noting how poorly designed the kits were.

Her company is experimenting with how it uses technology to sell hair dye to women for use at home. The start-up, which raised $12m in venture backing this year, sells mostly to women who want to mask greying hair. In her mid-50s, she matches her short dyed blonde hair with chunky, colourful glasses.

As colour often shows up inaccurately onscreen and women are sometimes unsure about how to use the dye, the company has staffed a call-centre with professional stylists to give advice on colour and application, and is experimenting with app features that would let users take video clips of their hair to get feedback on which colour to use.

Although investment in companies set up by women has increased, raising funds from mostly male investors, particularly for brands aimed mainly at female consumers, has its frustrations. At worst, they may even face harassment or inappropriate propositions.

More commonly, however, the issue is that male investors "often feel they can't add value to the business because they don't have expertise in the space as a consumer", says Doreen Bloch, founder of Poshly, a consumer data analytics company specialising in cosmetics.

Ms Errett says some of the investors she pitched to confessed both that they dyed their hair, and were unsure how widely hair dye is used by middle-aged women.

A former senior manager at online brokerage E*Trade and general partner at venture firm Maveron, she has had to explain to sceptical colleagues and friends that she had chosen to tackle what they saw as a humble niche with far less growth prospects than other sectors also taking off in Silicon Valley. "Everyone was like, 'hair colouring' ?" says Ms Errett, recalling their disdain.

Jane Park, founder of Julep, which makes and sells nail polish, says some investors were missing the point when they wanted to know how quickly women use up polish and therefore need to replace it.

"It's not like toothpaste," Ms Park, a former executive at Starbucks and Boston Consulting Group, told them. "It's a fashion item."

She had to do a bit more explaining about why the beauty industry could be a good fit for venture capital investment in ecommerce.

"It's something I felt they were unnecessarily fearful of," she says. "I was like, 'Hey it's big, and it's high margin and there's a huge opportunity to go online - you should be able to get your mind around it with an hour or less of research'."

In April, Julep announced a $30m round of funding from investors including the Silicon Valley firm Andreessen Horowitz. Part of the reason for the increase in the number of female founders, suggests Ms Zornosa, is that there are more women with experience of the technology industry - even if the numbers are relatively small, particularly in technical and engineering roles.

Her online clothing company equips saleswomen with apps and trains them in social networking so they can reach out to potential customers. In this case, she is melding her experience in digital marketing and at Yahoo with techniques developed over decades by direct selling companies such as Avon.

At True & Co, Ms Lam says it was having experience in technology that made it possible for her to win over investors who were sceptical or unfamiliar with the product.

Since launching in 2012, she has raised more than $6m in venture funding. Her years in tech and finance mean, she says, that "I can walk into a room with 10 different male partners and field 20 questions on why bras are a great business".

Investor etiquette

'A company policy of zero tolerance'

As women with ambitions in technology knock on the doors of investors, they are finding a few acting less than professionally.

As Y Combinator, one of Silicon Valley's most prestigious start-up incubators, prepared for a big event last month, one of the incubator's partners penned a blog post about investor etiquette. "I'd like to make the following point explicit: Y Combinator has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate sexual or romantic behaviour from investors toward founders," wrote Jessica Livingston.

Such a statement might seem extraordinary - but not to a number of women in the sector, some of whom have begun to speak out about harassment.

The topic of unwanted advances from investors has been fiercely debated in Silicon Valley. Anonymous female founders published detailed testimonials in Forbes and Wired, recounting how they were hit on.

One female start-up employee exposed by name an investor and frequent mentor at a start-up accelerator who sent her email asking to sleep with her after they met at a networking event. The investor first claimed his email was hacked, then apologised. Many of the tech incubators he had worked with have publicly cut their ties with him.

McGraw Hill Financial Selling Construction Data Unit; Symphony Technology Group Buying Unit for $320 Million in Cash

Private-equity firm Symphony Technology Group is buying the construction data unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc. for $320 million in cash, McGraw Hill said on Monday evening.

The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2014 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, McGraw Hill said.

McGraw Hill, which is focused on becoming a global financial data firm, said it was open to exploring a sale of its construction data unit in March, because the unit predominantly serves the domestic market.

That stands in contrast with McGraw Hill's other units, including Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or J.D. Power, which either have sizable overseas operations or have the potential to grow internationally. Some 41% of McGraw Hill's $4.9 billion in 2013 revenue came from international operations.

"This transaction completes our portfolio rationalization to create McGraw Hill Financial," said Douglas L. Peterson, McGraw Hill's chief executive, in a statement, adding the sale "brings more focus" to delivering global growth to the company.

"We look forward to helping the business achieve the next level of success," said William Chisholm, a managing director at Symphony Technology, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif.

McGraw Hill's construction division generates around $170 million in annual revenue and employs about 650 people.

The construction-unit decision follows McGraw Hill's exits from other traditional lines of business, as the company repositions itself as a global analytics firm. Since 2011, McGraw Hill has sold Aviation Week, a trade publication; its education division; and a broadcasting unit.

Evercore Partners acted as a financial adviser to McGraw Hill Financial for the transaction.

The City watchdog is eyeing fund rankings after receiving complaints that index trackers are being excluded from performance tables.

Some have expressed concern that popular data sites, such as Trustnet or Morningstar, do not always show the performance of index trackers alongside actively managed funds in the same sector.

As a result, investors could find it hard to discern which funds in a given category are among the best or worst-performing. In some cases, index trackers are not even included.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it expected "any regulated firm to present information to consumers in a way that is clear, fair and not misleading" and that it will "always consider the information we receive" in response to investor complaints.

Rob Davies, a fund manager at Maven Capital Partners, said Trustnet measured active funds against their peers net of costs, ranking them into quartiles according to performance.

However, passive funds are not part of these rankings and are only compared to their benchmark index. As a result, the after-fees performance of trackers is not compared to that of other funds in their sector.

Other websites only rank the performance of actively run funds and ignore trackers altogether. Lipper, a fund research company owned by Reuters, said it provided performance and quartile rankings for active and passive funds within sectors.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

< > "Individual investors would struggle to see where trackers sit," said Mr Davies. "While it makes sense to compare index funds to their relevant benchmark, it is also helpful to see how they perform against their active competitors."

"Comparison websites should facilitate this task, not make it difficult," he added.

FE Trustnet said the company was in the process of developing a methodology "which will help customers identify the best passive funds".

The tool will compare the ability of trackers to follow their index consistently, taking into account cost and tracking error among other factors.

"Importantly, because the measurement is not focused on performance, we expect that output could be used to provide an indication of how consistently a fund will be able to track its benchmark moving forward," FE Trustnet said. "This should provide investors with a very meaningful point of reference when comparing vehicles on a like-for-like basis."

Morningstar confirmed that investors using its website can see how trackers rank against other funds, including those which are actively managed, within a certain category.

Tracker funds generally have much lower fees than actively run funds, and in certain regions and sectors they regularly outperform many managers. However, investors relying on incomplete comparisons may not realise this.

Earlier this year, investors moved out of small and medium-sized companies into larger companies, crimping the returns of many actively run funds and moving passives up the rankings - seven of the 20 best performing funds in the UK All Companies sector in the six months to August were index trackers, according to FE Analytics, the firm whose data powers Trustnet.

< > Adam Laird, passive investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Investment Management Association, the fund industry's body, includes both active and passive funds when calculating the average returns of a particular sector.

"There will be times when passive does better than active and vice versa," said Mr Laird. "But in the long run, actively managed funds tend to underperform index funds and people need to be aware of this."

Although passive funds are not typically at the top of the pile, they will be consistent, said Mr Laird. "For most people, it's consistency that matters - no one wants to be top one quartile and then bottom the next," he added.

However, Ben Seager-Scott, director of investment strategy at Tilney Bestinvest, said it does not make sense to have the same framework for active and passive funds.

"Looking at performance doesn't do [passives] justice - it's not about a manager, it's about how well it tracks an index," he said. "They are not looking to beat the peer group in the same way an active manager is. They're looking at how closely they follow an index. It is therefore important to look at costs, rather than sector rankings."

Caroline Shaw, of wealth manager Courtiers, said it was "dangerous" to lump them together, as investors might believe trackers are also designed like active funds to potentially beat the index.

"Your decision to buy or sell a passive fund should be based on how efficiently it follows the index," she added.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Liontrust strategic bond fund suffers dismal year; FUND FOCUS; Poor performance and mass outflows see 85% fall in assets under management

Liontrust's Michael Mabbutt has had a torrid start running his Global Strategic Bond fund after poor performance and mass outflows.

It was the first foray back into fixed income funds by the UK fund management company following the sale of its credit team to Avoca Capital in 2011, and it marked Mr Mabbutt's return to fund management after a five-year break.

Liontrust, which bought Walker Crips Asset Manage-ment in 2012, launched the Dublin-domiciled Global Strategic Bond fund in February last year after hiring Mr Mabbutt and co-manager Felix Martin. The fund initially saw strong growth as investors bought into Mr Mabbutt's record earned at Thames River, LGT Asset Management and Baring Asset Management.

Major institutional buyer John Chatfeild-Roberts was one of the early backers of the fund, building up positions in his Jupiter Merlin Income and Jupiter Merlin Conservative funds.

But the fund struggled in 2013 and investors in its sterling-hedged share class lost 8.2 per cent by the end of the year, FE Analytics data show. The average fund in the IMA Sterling Strategic Bond sector rose 2.9 per cent over the same period.

The poor performance led many investors, including Mr Chatfeild-Roberts, to depart.

Between the end of September 2013 and the end of February 2014, the size of the fund collapsed by more than 85 per cent, with assets falling from $640m to $91.3m.

The size of the fund has since declined further to $73.4m at the end of August, despite performance turning positive.

Mr Martin said: "Obviously we were not happy with the performance in 2013. When we launched the product it was almost the complete opposite in terms of perfect timing to launch a bond fund."

The fund was launched just before the mass sell-off triggered by then US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's comments about ending quantitative easing.

Mr Martin said the fund's positioning meant it was particularly badly hit, given that it had significant exposure to emerging market debt, which bore the brunt of the sell-off.

The fund also had a large short position on corporate high yield bonds because the company thought the sector was expensive. The high-yield sector, however, held up better than other forms of bonds during the sell-off, continuing to rally afterwards.

But Mr Martin stands by the decision. He said: I do not regret [the position] in strategic terms, though I do regret the poor performance." - Matthew Jeynes

Porsche Family Fund Buys Stake in Traffic Mapping Startup Inrix; Move is Fund's First Investment After Sports Car Maker was Acquired by Volkswagen

BERLIN The Porsche family that is the anchor shareholder in automotive group Volkswagen AG made the first acquisition from its investment fund, taking a 10% stake in Inrix Inc., a U.S.-based traffic mapping startup.

Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the holding company that manages the assets held by heirs to the Porsche family's automotive holdings, will pay about $55 million in cash for a stake in the Kirkland, Washington-based company.

"We're pleased to have an investor like Porsche SE who shares our vision for transforming Inrix from a traffic data company to a connected car and smart cities leader world-wide," said Bryan Mistele, Inrix's president and chief executive officer.

"The deal shows that car companies are now thinking about how to market mobility services and not just market metal," said a person familiar with the deal.

Inrix was launched about nine years ago and has since become a global mapper of traffic and provider of data services. The company receives real-time traffic data from its users as they drive, which it then analyses and makes available to users. Rather than placing sensors along the highways to monitor traffic, the users themselves transmit the data and are connected via Inrix's network.

In addition to providing services to auto makers and individuals, the company sells information services and analytics tools to some 60 transportation agencies to help streamline operations, pinpoint investments in roads and transit and deliver traveler information.

The deal is small financially, but marks a big step for Porsche Holding. It is the first investment that Porsche Holding has made with its  2.6 billion ($3.4 billion) cash stockpile it amassed as sports car maker Porsche AG, a separate company, was acquired by Volkswagen after a bitter takeover several years ago.

Porsche Automobil Holding was created in 2007 when Porsche AG bought VW shares in a bid to take over the larger car maker. A bitter battle ensued between cousins Wolfgang Porsche and VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche who invented the original Volkswagen, for control. In the end, VW acquired Porsche and by 2012 the Porsche Holding became VW's anchor shareholder.

In the wake of the takeover battle, the Porsche family traded their shares in the sports car maker for a 31.5% stake in Volkswagen, representing 50.7% of VW's voting rights. The Porsche family created Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which manages the VW stake and the holding's cash stockpile.

Philipp von Hagen, the Porsche Holding board member in charge of investment, surveyed more than 1,000 potential investments before creating a short list of about a dozen companies. Inrix is the first investment, but others are likely to follow. The fund plans to create a pool of about eight to 12 investments, people familiar with the matter said.

"Connectivity between cars and infrastructure is one of the mega trends in the automotive industry. The need for traffic-related information and data-driven solutions is therefore growing fast. We see tremendous potential in this segment of the automotive value chain," Mr. von Hagen said in a statement.

Morgan Stanley s private equity arm is standing  resolutely  by its $300m investment in Tianhe Chemicals, as the embattled Chinese company fights back against claims it inflated profits and presented related parties as customers.

The US investment bank is doubly exposed to Tianhe   attacked last week by Anonymous Analytics, a group claiming links to its namesake hacker collective   because in addition to its investment, it sponsored the group s initial public offering three months ago.

A change in the Hong Kong listings process last year means that IPO sponsors are legally liable for claims made in prospectuses.

Homer Sun, chief investment officer and head of China for Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia, as well as a non-executive director of Tianhe, said:  We stand behind Tianhe s world class management team that has steadily and consistently invested in R&D over the past two decades to build global market leading positions in its two principal business segments. 

The China-based, Hong Kong-listed company last week became the mainland s biggest entity yet to be targeted by a short seller-style report.

Late on Wednesday, Tianhe said it  unequivocally denies and vigorously refutes  the allegations made last week by AA.

The company rushed out an incomplete rebuttal statement after discovering earlier in the day that its email system had been hacked.

Tianhe, which had its shares suspended since the report s publication, accused AA of publishing falsified documents in its document.

Tianhe said:  The [AA] report includes a combination of falsified information, forged signature of the company s chairman and blatantly untrue statements. 

The company also said its controlling shareholders would consider buying back shares in the open market  in the event of disorderly market trading  when trading resumed.

AA on Thursday said:  [Tianhe] management s half-response comes off as weak and ineffectual. We will respond to Tianhe s ramblings shortly. 

AA alleged last week that local Chinese filings and tax statistics showed that Tianhe had dramatically overstated its profits, and dubbed the company a  massive fraud .

Tianhe s rebuttal included a signed statement from its local auditors that pages of data presented by AA were not in fact from the accounts it signed off on.

Tianhe said its shares would remain suspended while it dealt with remaining questions posed by the Hong Kong stock exchange.

AA said last week it held no position in Tianhe s shares, but that readers could assume affiliates stood to gain from any fall in the company s stock.

Short sellers aim to profit by borrowing shares to sell, and gaining from the gap between the price at which they sold the stock and the cost of buying them back to return them.

*This article has been amended since first publication to reflect the fact that Morgan Stanley s private equity unit has a $300m investment in Tianhe Chemicals, and not $700m.

World
India's July Industrial Growth Likely Slowed to 4-Month Low; Poll Indicates Industrial Production Likely Rose 2.0% on Year

NEW DELHI Indian July industrial production growth likely slowed to the weakest in four months. However, the subdued growth is unlikely to damp optimism that quicker policy changes by the country's new government would give a boost to business in the next few months.

Industrial production, which includes output of factories, mines and utilities, likely rose 2.0% from a year earlier, according to the median estimate in a poll of 14 economists by The Wall Street Journal. That would be slower than June's 3.4% increase and the 19-month high of 5.0% in May. The government will release the data on Friday.

"The growth picture presented by various leading indicators remained mixed in July," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda. While output of eight key infrastructure industries -- which account for 38% of industrial production -- slowed significantly, exports grew at a healthy pace, she said. Findings of a survey of business managers by HSBC and Markit showed manufacturing activity improved, but the pace of recovery may exacerbate India's inflation troubles, Ms. Nitsure added.

Some economists pointed to a strong increase in automobile sales, which would support industrial activity. Rising consumer demand ahead of India's main festival season starting October may have also prompted industries to ramp up production.

"Industrial output might get a boost from consumer durables and FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) due to pre-festival inventory buildup," said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank.

India's economy has struggled in recent years as poor infrastructure, bureaucratic hurdles to businesses wanting to expand and slow government decision-making have hurt confidence of investors. Spiraling inflation has further eroded consumer confidence, forcing industries to scale down production.

But sentiment has improved ever since India elected a new pro-business Bharatiya Janata Party government with a landslide mandate this spring. Businesses are hoping Prime Minister Narendra Modi will use his party's majority in parliament to ensure important policy changes don't get scuttled due to political opposition.

That confidence already appears to have rubbed off on businesses which are beginning to revive expansion plans.

Data late August showed India's gross domestic product rose 5.7% in the three months to June, the strongest in more than two years.

"India's manufacturing industry improved substantially through the second quarter and was both a cause and consequence of the strong GDP figure," said Glenn Levine, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

The electricity and mining sectors have improved while "production of capital goods continues to grow, reflecting the recent increase in business sentiment and investment," he added.

Stiffer Surcharge in Store for U.S. Banks

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve plans to hit the biggest U.S. banks with a costly new requirement aimed at reducing the risk that some financial firms remain "too big to fail" nearly six years after the financial crisis erupted.

In testimony prepared for a Senate Banking Committee hearing Tuesday, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said the regulator intends to impose a capital surcharge that will require the biggest U.S. banks to maintain fatter cushions to protect against potential losses. The Fed's version of the capital surcharge will be tougher than one agreed to by international regulators.

The Fed also will penalize U.S. banks that rely heavily on volatile forms of short-term funding, such as overnight loans, in determining the size of a new capital surcharge.

The move would mean at least some big U.S. banks would be forced to increase their capital cushions beyond their global rivals, deepening a debate about whether Washington is better-protecting its banks or putting them at a competitive disadvantage. How much additional capital the big banks will need to add has yet to be determined.

Since the financial crisis, banks have added substantial capital -- and are subject to a number of new rules. A July analysis of six U.S. banks by policy Federal Financial Analytics calculated that those firms increased their capital by $29.07 billion between 2007 and 2013.

Fed officials haven't yet settled on an exact range for their capital surcharge but are considering a range that stretches as much as a couple of percentage points higher than the top range of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets agreed to by international regulators, a senior Fed official said. That could mean some U.S. banks might face a surcharge as high as 4.5%, the official said.

Mr. Tarullo said surcharge levels for a small group of "systemically important financial institutions," or SIFIs, would increase "noticeably" for some U.S. banks. Surcharge levels wouldn't necessarily increase for every bank. "By further increasing the amount of the most loss-absorbing form of capital that is required to be held by firms that potentially pose the greatest risk to financial stability, we intend to improve the resiliency of these firms," he said.

At issue is a requirement for the world's largest banks to hold an extra layer of financial padding in case of another crisis. The move was agreed to in 2011 by international regulators in Basel, Switzerland. This so-called capital surcharge would require giant, complex banks to increase their high-quality capital by between one and 2.5 percentage points, calibrated to the relative riskiness of the bank as measured by a series of factors. A total of 29 global banks, including the eight U.S. firms, are required to pay the surcharge.

While the impact of the Fed's stricter proposal on specific banks isn't clear, firms with large broker-dealer operations such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have the potential to face higher capital charges under the Fed's plan since they often rely on large short-term loans to help finance activities on behalf of clients.

Goldman and Morgan Stanley both count such short-term liabilities as more than one-third of their total liabilities, the highest levels among the eight U.S. banks likely to be affected by the rule, according to data from SNL Financial. Both firms have said in regulatory filings that they are maintaining enough capital to meet the Basel surcharge level. They declined to comment Monday.

The U.S. plan to impose a higher surcharge marks the latest move by Washington to bolster the banking system by requiring large Wall Street firms to better protect themselves against losses. Last week, the Fed and other regulators adopted another set of rules that require banks to hold very safe assets they can sell for cash in a pinch. That rule, too, was stricter for U.S. banks than the requirement agreed to internationally.

It isn't clear how many firms would need to raise capital to meet the tougher U.S. surcharge. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Co. declined to comment. State Street didn't respond to a request for comment.

Banks around the world fought the original surcharge proposal, arguing it was unnecessary and could restrict their ability to lend. U.S. banks now are likely to argue the Fed is putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Fed officials always thought the surcharge range should be higher than the level Basel negotiators ultimately settled on, a point Mr. Tarullo and other Fed officials have voiced for years.

Janet Yellen, now the Fed's chairwoman, signaled last year that she was eyeing a tougher surcharge. Ms. Yellen said in a June 2013 speech that "it may be appropriate to go beyond" the Basel surcharge levels.

One new wrinkle in the Fed's plan is to tie the size of the surcharge to a bank's reliance on short-term financing, essentially penalizing banks that readily turn to the wholesale funding markets. The Fed has been eager to reduce reliance on short-term financing, such as overnight loans, which were a source of instability during the 2008 financial crisis when such financing dried up. Heavy dependence on short-term funding helped sink Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

Fed officials thought the original Basel methodology didn't give enough weight to a firm's reliance on such short-term loans in determining how much extra capital a specific firm must maintain. The new approach could either force banks to further boost their capital cushions if they rely heavily on short-term loans or make less frequent use of short-term financing.

As part of that effort, Mr. Tarullo said Fed officials are working on a separate rule that would require all financial firms -- not just banks -- to hold a minimum amount of securities or other collateral in short-term financing transactions, such as repurchase agreements.

The Fed is planning to use its authority under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act to adopt the margin rule but is first trying to negotiate an agreement ensuring other countries will take similar steps, the senior Fed official said. The Fed's authority extends to many transactions, except those where U.S. Treasurys are used as collateral, the official said.

An agreement with international regulators is crucial, since firms could simply move trading activity to another country to avoid the U.S. margin rule if a deal isn't reached.

The capital surcharge for banks could change each year, depending on a calculation that takes into account its size, exposures, international activity, and other data.

Excluding the changes in the works at the Fed, the Basel capital accords could require banks to have a capital ratio of as much as 12.5% of risk-weighted assets by 2019.

U.S. News: Harvard Receives Largest Donation

By Douglas Belkin

The family of Gerald Chan, a Harvard-educated investor, is donating $350 million to the university's School of Public Health, the largest gift in the 378-year history of the U.S.'s richest university.

The gift is part of a wave of enormous donations to schools with large endowments in recent years that highlights the diverging fortunes of the nation's colleges.

China, the world's biggest exporter of foreign students to the U.S., has become a large source of donations for the Ivy League. In July, SOHO China Chief Executive Zhang Xin and her husband, Pan Shiyi, signed a $15 million gift agreement with Harvard University as part of their $100 million endowment to send underprivileged Chinese children to elite universities around the world.

In 2010, Lei Zhang, the founder and managing partner of Hillhouse Capital Management, said he would give $8,888,888 to Yale University, which marked the largest gift to the Yale School of Management by a graduate of the school.

A review of 208 private universities rated by Moody's Investors Service over 10 years shows a distinct tilt toward the haves. Schools with more than $1 billion in total cash and investments received 67% of total gift dollars in 2013, up from 62% in 2003. Meanwhile, universities with less than $100 million in cash and investments received a declining share -- less than 3% of gift dollars.

"Over the past decade, there has been increasing concentration of giving to already wealthy institutions," said Susan Fitzgerald, a senior vice president at Moody's.

A survey of more than 800 public and private schools by the National Association of College and University Business Officers between 2010 and 2013 shows a similar trend. Schools with endowments of more than $1 billion saw their average gifts rise 41%, while those to schools with endowments of under $25 million rose 33%.

Colleges with smaller endowments are more reliant on tuition revenue and more vulnerable to increased competition or short-term slumps. A school with a small endowment has a harder time weathering a few bad years and is more apt to start cutting programs or raising tuition. Universities with larger endowments can spend more on students, get through bad years and still hold down tuition.

Dominating the list of recipients of single donations of nine figures in the last three years are familiar names: $350 million to Cornell; $350 million to Johns Hopkins; $250 million to Yale; $225 million to the University of Pennsylvania; $150 million to Harvard and $100 million each to Dartmouth and Georgetown.

The rising fortunes of the wealthy universities are due to several factors, including the growing use of large-scale data analytics, which give college fundraisers a clearer picture of not only who has the capacity to give but who has the desire. That information makes large capital campaigns increasingly efficient and boosts the advantages of wealthier schools that produce wealthier alumni.

Caroline Hoxby, a professor at Stanford who studies the economics of higher education, likens universities to venture-capital firms: They seek out the best students, invest heavily and frequently at a loss -- often well beyond the cost of tuition -- and hope to produce a handful of great successes who will give back enormous gifts or influence others to do so.

Beyond that, the richest schools can hire the sharpest researchers and fundraisers, she said. And as research in some areas becomes increasingly complex, only the richest schools can afford it.

Mr. Chan is a director of Hong Kong property developer Hang Lung Group Ltd., where his brother Ronnie Chan serves as chairman. Together, they are ranked as the 17th richest in Hong Kong by Forbes in January with a net worth estimated at $3 billion.

At Harvard, he pursued graduate work in radiological physics and radiobiology in the 1970s. He said he is giving the money to the School of Public Health because a teacher there brought the life sciences alive. In 1984, he pivoted to investing and two years later founded Morningside Group, a private-equity and venture investment group focused on biotech, cancer research and technology in North America, Asia and Europe. It has successful investments in such companies as cancer-therapy firm Biovex and New York-listed Chinese online entertainment portal YY.com.

The 63-year-old said he hopes the gift will help professors conduct cutting-edge research to fight such global risks as Ebola and obesity. The school has a humble physical plant and a small endowment by Harvard's august standards. As part of his gift, the school will be named the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, after his father.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- Portfolio Strategy: More Investors Reach for a New 'Barbell' --- Safety on one end, counterbalanced with risk-taking on the other, is the goal of the approach

"Barbelling" isn't what it used to be.

The traditional financial definition of a barbell investing strategy calls for investors to hold supersafe debt investments in one-half of a portfolio and high-risk ones in the other, while staying away from those in the mushy middle.

But these days, the so-called barbells that investors hold over their financial shoulders can be a mix of different assets entirely: index funds and active funds, liquid and illiquid investments, or low-cost mutual funds and high-cost hedge funds. In other words, any combination of assets that can be counterbalanced on the investing bar.

Today's barbell strategies don't necessarily call for a portfolio be divided equally between safe and aggressive positions. More than ever, "barbelling" is a way of thinking about risk management -- with the goal being to construct a portfolio that both controls for losses and provides some level of exposure to the potential for outperformance or uncorrelated returns.

Barbell strategies have bled into stocks in several ways.

One way is through so-called core/satellite portfolios, where the bulk of an investor's holdings is in passive, low-cost index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (the core), with the rest in actively managed investments such as high-conviction mutual funds that zero in on a particular sector or assets of a certain size or valuation (the satellites).

Some active stock-fund managers have noticed the barbell trend and taken steps to make their funds more attractive to these investors, according to David Levine, global head of investor relations and analytics products for Nasdaq OMX Group.

Nasdaq, he says, evaluated all active U.S. mutual-fund portfolios above $1 billion, back to August 2010, and found that portfolio churn (turnover) is down significantly and the number of holdings is also decreasing (at a slower pace). This means the funds are more closely adhering to their investment mandates, instead of hugging benchmarks. More-concentrated positions and less trading gives active managers a better chance to outperform, making their funds a better choice for the active part of a barbell strategy, he says.

Jim Tierney, head of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein, is among the active managers who have chosen this path. Analyzing Morningstar data, he found that active stock managers with fewer than 50 individual holdings were the only ones to have positive net buying, or inflows, through the five years ended March 31, 2014.

The data also showed that in concentrated portfolios, funds with the most "active share" (a measure of differentiation from an index) outperformed their benchmarks over five- and 10-year periods, he says.

There are times when certain market sectors are significantly overvalued and constitute an outsize part of a broad market index, he says. A steep drop in those sectors can bring down a whole index. That's when a barbell strategy can pay off, he says.

"In a lot of strategies -- and asset classes, particularly small caps and emerging markets -- there is more capacity for active [investing] than you might think," Mr. Tierney says.

Not everyone is sold on "barbelling." Mark Balasa, financial adviser with Balasa Dinverno Foltz LLC in Itaska, Ill., says he uses only stock-index funds and ETFs for his clients.

"Investors don't want to give up on outperformance," Mr. Balasa says. But when 61% of actively managed U.S.-stock mutual funds can't beat their benchmarks over a five-year period, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, it is a "tough environment to have a barbell strategy," he says.

Richard DiMarzo, a portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley's Pelican Bay Group in Pittsford, N.Y., concedes that a barbell strategy may only be about mind-set and not a true balancing of high-risk and low-risk investments in a portfolio.

"The sides of the barbell are never going to be perfectly parallel," says Mr. DiMarco. "There is usually a tilt."

Tianhe Chemicals Squares Off Against Anonymous Analytics ; Activist Stands by Financial Allegations That the Chemicals Company Disputes

HONG KONG A week after "hacktivist" group Anonymous Analytics questioned the earnings and revenue of Chinese lubricants maker Tianhe Chemicals Group, both sides are digging in for what could be a protracted dispute.

Last Tuesday in Hong Kong, Anonymous Analytics released a report alleging that the recently listed Chinese company falsified its accounting, revenue and margins, and overstated sales of a lucrative chemical agent called anti-mar. The group broadcast the claims on its website and the social-media site Twitter, and in a matter of hours the stock, one of the Hong Kong's most successful listings in years, fell almost 5% before the company requested a trading halt. The stock remains suspended.

Anonymous said in its report that its allegations were a product of "months of due diligence, field research and analysis."

Tianhe denied the allegations, calling them "false, misleading and malicious" and has promised to publish a detailed rebuttal, which a person close to the company said could be as soon as Wednesday. The rebuttal was submitted to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday, another person close to the company said. The exchange declined to comment.

In response to questions from The Wall Street Journal, Anonymous said in an email Monday it stands by its report and will respond to Tianhe's rebuttal when it is published. It also said it has submitted documents from its report to Hong Kong's securities watchdog, the Securities & Futures Commission. People close to Tianhe said they haven't been contacted by the SFC about the report, while the SFC itself declined to comment.

"We are absolutely confident in our report," Anonymous said in the emailed response to questions. "We will be responding to Tianhe's rebuttal once it's been filed. We are not going anywhere."

On its website, Anonymous Analytics describes itself as an advocate for corporate transparency but doesn't detail who its members are. In its report, the activist group said it won't profit from the report, although a disclaimer on its report on Tianhe notes that, while it holds "no direct or indirect interest" in the Chinese company, "you may assume that certain of Anonymous Analytics' research and due diligence contacts, consultants, affiliates and/or clients may have a short position in the stock." In short selling, an investor sells borrowed shares with the aim of buying them back at a cheaper price. If the price goes up, the investor incurs a loss.

Among the allegations at issue: Anonymous said that reported revenue for two of Tianhe's units, Jinzhou DPF-TH and Fuxin Hengtong, was much lower than claimed, citing accounts that Tianhe submitted to the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, or SAIC. China's public, closely held and state-controlled companies are required to file financial reports to the SAIC. People close to Tianhe say the company will dispute this claim and that its accounts had been approved by auditors. The chemicals firm will also dispute claims that it exaggerated its margins and overstated the sales of anti-mar, these people said.

Tianhe CEO Wei Xuan acted fast in the hours after the report was published last week. In Boston at the time, Mr. Wei asked the Hong Kong stock exchange to suspend trading in the company's shares, cut short planned meetings with U.S.-based investors and boarded a flight to Hong Kong for an emergency board meeting, according to people familiar with the matter. In the meantime, the company's bankers and advisers convened a conference call to map out a defense to the activist's report, people close to Tianhe said.

A short statement was hastily drafted by the company and its advisers and released right away to the Hong Kong stock exchange saying the allegations were inaccurate, followed by the one on Friday calling Anonymous' charges "false, misleading and malicious."

Until the Anonymous report, Tianhe, which raised US$748 million in an IPO in June, was a stock-market darling. Its shares were up 28% between June 20, when it made its debut, and last Tuesday. In the hours after the Anonymous report was published, the stock dropped 4.9%.

UBS AG, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit were Tianhe's IPO sponsors.

Morgan Stanley, an early investor in Tianhe through its private-equity unit, owns 10% in Tianhe and is its second-largest shareholder after the Wei family, which has 72%, according to filings to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Other banks invested in the stock include Investec, which is listed in the U.K. and South Africa. The lender invested a total of $67 million in Tianhe in the form of loans in 2010 that were converted to a 6.5% stake in the company before the IPO.

Investors Reach for a New Kind of 'Barbell'; The Safety-and-Risk Balancing Strategy Now Is Tried With a Variety of Assets

Apple's Next Big Focus: Your Health

By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Daisuke Wakabayashi

Apple Inc. has jolted many industries over the years, from recorded music to mobile phones. Now, it is charging into health and fitness, hoping to bring order to a fragmented mess of wearable devices and scattered data.

Its entry is stirring enthusiasm among entrepreneurs and health providers. But Apple will have to overcome regulatory and privacy challenges and consumer indifference.

Apple on Tuesday is expected to unveil a smartwatch embedded with more than 10 sensors to monitor health and fitness signs, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple declined to comment.

"When Apple does it, consumers perceive it as more mainstream," said Ari Caroline, chief analytics officer for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, one of several health-care institutions building apps to work with Apple's offerings. Others include the big health insurer Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic. With Apple's device, Mr. Caroline said, "people will have all the hardware they need to make the monitoring possible."

Apple already declared its intentions with some big-name hires and its HealthKit, a data repository created by Apple to work with iOS apps, storing information collected by various devices. HealthKit can channel the information to doctors, app developers and others, with a user's permission.

HealthKit will work with apps in Apple's next mobile operating system, iOS 8, due out later this month. The new operating system will also include an app called Health -- a dashboard for health and fitness information such as heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar and cholesterol, as well as lab results and medications.

So far, interest in digital health has been confined mainly to athletic people who are motivated to upload personal fitness information into apps and track their daily activity through devices.

People "just don't want to engage with a health app the way they'd engage with an Instagram or a Facebook," said Dr. Joseph Kvedar, director of the Center for Connected Health, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. "There's a lot of foaming at the mouth and market estimates . . . the part that is missing in mobile health is the part that convinces people they have to use it."

The lack of enthusiasm has felled prior efforts by tech companies. In 2008, Google Inc. launched Google Health, a portal where consumers could upload health records and share them with insurers and providers. The search giant closed the portal three years later. Microsoft Corp.'s Health Vault, another attempt to house and share medical data, hasn't gained much traction.

Apple may benefit from better timing. When Google launched its portal, smartphones weren't as prevalent as they are now and health apps were still new. Consumers also have more incentive to monitor their health because they are shouldering more of the burden of health-care costs. What's more, a growing number of companies are offering financial rewards for people to adopt healthy behaviors or track things like weight or activity.

Many hospitals and insurers are intrigued by the possibilities of Apple's smartwatch and HealthKit. John Halamka, chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said doctors could remotely monitor patients after a procedure for signs of complications. He said hospitals can also save money by detecting problems early because the Affordable Care Act penalizes hospitals that have too many readmissions.

To gain widespread adoption, Apple will need to convince users that their health information is safe, a task that became more difficult after hackers posted nude pictures of celebrities that had been stored in Apple's iCloud service.

Even before the hacks, Apple was taking measures to protect privacy. The company said it wouldn't allow app developers to store health data in iCloud -- and wouldn't allow companies that share information with HealthKit to use it for advertising. To steer clear of regulators, Apple also said apps using data from HealthKit can't provide diagnoses or treatment advice.

Apple wants to support and bring order to what is now a small and unruly market, but questions loom over whether the company will have the capability to police a growing number of apps.

Market research firm NPD estimated that the U.S. digital-fitness market, including sales of wearable devices such as the Fitbit and Jawbone UP, totaled more than $330 million last year.

By comparison, Apple's shrinking iPod business generated $442 million in the April-June quarter -- the equivalent of less than two days of world-wide iPhone sales. As of December 2013, there were roughly 40,000 health apps being marketed, according to Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, a nonprofit for the health industry.

"Up to now, the information gathered by those applications lives in silos," said Apple Senior Vice President Craig Federighi at a company conference in June, where he introduced HealthKit.

To support its initiative, Apple has hired engineers and scientists from medical-device and bio-sensing companies.

The company has been working on ways to use advanced sensors to track a person's blood pressure, body temperature, glucose and hydration levels, these people said.

ICE in $350m bid to crack data market; EXCHANGES

IntercontinentalExchange, the transatlantic exchange and clearing house operator, has agreed to acquire SuperDerivatives, an Israeli financial technology group, in an effort to penetrate the lucrative financial information market.

ICE is expected to pay $350m in cash for the Tel-Aviv based business and a deal could be announced as early as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.

SuperDerivatives provides data and analytics on over-the-counter derivatives but also has a chat platform similar to the one used on Bloomberg terminals.

The exchange has long wanted to crack the market for providing high-tech information terminals and has been under growing pressure to do so as Bloomberg and other financial information providers push into its core markets.

With the acquisition of SuperDerivatives, the Atlanta-based company will gain access to the Israeli group's DGX product, which allows traders to access live pricing and news in addition to analysing theoretical trades before they execute them.

Other potential buyers who showed interest in SuperDerivatives included CME, Nasdaq and Markit , according to people familiar with the matter. It is unclear if any of those parties reached advanced discussions with SuperDerivatives and its advisers.

ICE's move to gain a toehold in messaging comes as Wall Street firms push back against Bloomberg's dominance. CME, the futures exchange operator, has invested in Wickr, a start-up that is in talks with banks to create an alternative to Bloomberg instant messaging, and Goldman Sachs has spearheaded efforts to create a rival Wall Street chat service.

Other rival technology and data companies have attempted to break Bloomberg's dominance in messaging with little success and it is unclear whether new chat tools backed by financial services companies will flourish where others have failed.

A competing chat service would face an uphill battle given the degree to which Bloomberg terminals remain entrenched on Wall Street - the private company says 20m chat exchanges take place over its terminals each day.

"Displacing Bloomberg is undoubtedly the holy grail of the information services industry," Jefferies analysts Dan Dolev and Trevor Young said.

David Gershon, Super-Derivatives chief executive, in 2008 estimated that the company would one day go public with a $1bn market value. The IPO did not happen, however, and the company has been working with banks on a sale process since early this year.

ICE demerged Euronext, the European exchanges operator, for  1.4bn ($1.9bn) in cash this year. The demerger, via a listing, was planned when ICE bought NYSE Euronext for $11bn in 2013.

Neither ICE nor Super Derivatives were available for comment.

Intercontinental Exchange said Friday that it would acquire SuperDerivatives for about $350 million in cash to expand its financial market clearing and data services.

SuperDerivatives provides risk management analytics systems across all asset classes, including foreign exchange, interest rates, equities and commodities. ICE said the acquisition will help it expand its multi-asset-class clearing strategy. SuperDerivatives, which was founded in 2000, is based in New York and has more than 300 employees. The company also provides valuation services and market data.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, and ICE will provide relevant guidance when it reports quarterly earnings in November, the Atlanta-based commodities and derivatives trading company said.

"SuperDerivatives is an innovative developer of valuable derivatives data and technology, and will play a key role in extending our financial market clearing and data capabilities," said Jeffrey C. Sprecher, ICE chairman and chief executive.

Reaction from economists to ECB rate cut

The European Central Bank has gone further than was expected in its attempt to counter the threat of stagnation across the eurozone. Here are the initial reactions from five economists:

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit:

"There are big questions over the effectiveness of the further reduction in interest rates and, while the asset purchases may have a more significant impact, little is known about just how much many assets the ECB will be able to buy and what impact this will have on the economy.

Perhaps the main immediate benefit of the additional policy action is a weakening of the exchange rate (the euro dropped around 1 per cent on the news and is down 5 per cent since the start of July). The lower exchange rate will undoubtedly provide a boost to exporters' competitiveness.

The action should also help improve business and consumer confidence. The more determined and aggressive approach from the ECB should hopefully encourage more investment and spending.

There are suspicions that the increasingly aggressive stance from the ECB could reduce the likelihood of the central bank buying sovereign debt, a policy which is politically controversial but widely considered as becoming increasingly essential in reviving the economy."

Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes,:

Today's ECB moves are a step in the right direction, but too little, too late to snuff out deflation-risk and kick-start growth. The further 10bp shavings off the refinancing and deposit rates are puny, and look more cosmetic than real. Any drop in the euro on the back of them would be welcome, but possibly short lived.

The ECB hopes the negative deposit rate (-0.2 per cent) will deter banks from parking cash at the ECB, instead passing it on to consumers and firms. But, this may be a red herring, given still tame credit demand, pressure for the banks to pass stress tests and the fact that the bulk of reserves still gets the (0.05 per cent) refinancing rate.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist, at IHS Global Insight:

"The ECB's hand has clearly been forced by a further fall in Eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.3 per cent in August, weakening inflation expectations and evidence that already weak Eurozone economic acidity was faltering. Eurozone GDP was only stagnant in the second quarter, consumer and business confidence relapsed to an 8-month low in August and the purchasing managers reported reduced manufacturing and services growth overall in August

It is also likely that the ECB's moves are a reflection of further downward revisions to Eurozone GDP growth and inflation forecasts in the September projections by ECB staff.

Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody'sAnalytics:

The interest rate will remain at a record low for an extended period because of the stuttering recovery, high unemployment and weak inflation, which reached a five-year low of 0.3 per cent in August.

With actual output below potential, low capacity utilisation in many eurozone countries, and low energy and food prices, the risk of deflation is intensifying. The output gap should close, at which point inflation should stabilise in late 2015 or early 2016. Until then, domestic inflation pressures will be soft.

The risk of deflation and an anaemic euro zone recovery may prompt the ECB to introduce an additional monetary stimulus, such as full-scale quantitative easing, in coming months.

Yet we do not expect the ECB to begin purchasing private and public debt until the bank evaluates its latest long-term lending programme targeted at boosting business credit.

Meanwhile, bank lending has started to stabilise, easing pressure on the ECB to introduce further measures.

Nick Beecroft, a senior market analyst at Saxo Capital Markets:

"ECB goes for ABS purchase of simple and transparent loans to non-financial corporations and also of covered bonds. QE-lite!

BofA and UBS pull Tianhe coverage; CHEMICALS

Banks had sponsor roles in share debut

Chemicals group denies fraud claims

Two of the banks that sponsored the Hong Kong flotation of Tianhe Chemicals have suspended analyst coverage of the company after it was accused of fraud by a group claiming links to cyber-hacking collective Anonymous.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS halted their coverage of Tianhe, according to people familiar with the matter, having both taken sponsor roles on its initial public offering. Both banks declined to comment.

Bank research teams often suspend coverage of stocks when large uncertainties arise but the two banks, along with Morgan Stanley, have been in the spotlight for their roles as sponsors in bringing Tianhe to market in June.

New listing rules introduced last year in Hong Kong made banks acting as IPO sponsors legally responsible for any misinformation contained in listing documents.

Morgan Stanley - also an investor in Tianhe - did not immediately return requests for comment.

Tianhe went public on the Hong Kong stock exchange in June after raising $650m from investors in one of the city's biggest listings of the year so far.

The company's 30 per cent rally since its float gave it a market capitalisation of $8bn - making Tianhe one of the biggest targets of a group linked with short sellers.

Anonymous Analytics said while it holds no position itself in Tianhe, readers of an AA report about the company could assume affiliates stood to gain from any fall in the share price.

Trading in Tianhe was halted on Tuesday following the release of the AA report, which described the company as a "massive fraud and one of the biggest stocks scams ever conceived", and claimed that its true sales and profits were well below figures stated in its prospectus.

Late on Tuesday Tianhe said the AA report contained "errors of fact, misleading statements and malicious accusations", and that the company reserved the right to "take legal action for damages and other relief".

Tianhe said yesterday that the company was still working on a clarification announcement, which it would file to the stock exchange "as soon as practicable".

Shares will remain suspended until the formal clarification is published.

Tianhe management and bankers were on the US east coast on Tuesday, preparing for meetings with investors when the AA report was published.

A number of listed Chinese companies have been accused of fraud in recent years. The most high-profile case - Toronto-listed Sino-Forest - resulted in the company's bankruptcy, and helped make short seller Muddy Waters a well-known name among investors in Asian stocks.

However, a number of other similar attacks have failed. Shares in New York-listed Qihoo 360 have risen fivefold since the release of a critical report by AA in 2012.

Samsung Unveils Curved Phone, Virtual Reality Headset; Company Also Launches the Latest Version of its Smartphone-Tablet Hybrid

Samsung Electronics Co. released a smartphone with a display that curves around one side of the phone, along with a virtual reality headset, as it looks beyond the traditional handset to fend off competition.

The South Korean technology giant launched the devices alongside the latest iteration of its popular smartphone-tablet hybrid, the Galaxy Note 4, on Wednesday at the IFA trade show in Berlin.

The headset, called the Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition, is a nylon head strap that allows users to mount the new Galaxy Note in front of their eyes, allowing consumers to use the device for gaming and watching movies.

With the new products, which will go on sale through major U.S. carriers this fall, the message is clear: The world's biggest smartphone maker is thinking beyond the rectangular smartphone slab in its attempt to maintain a shrinking lead in its mobile business, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of its operating profit in the second quarter.

Last week, the company said it would begin selling a stand-alone wristwatch, the Samsung Gear S, that will be able to make and receive calls without having to be tethered to a smartphone.

In the second quarter, Samsung accounted for about one in four smartphones sold around the world, down from about one-third a year earlier, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, as it lost ground to local competitors in markets like China. As a result, the company reported a 20% decline in net profit for the quarter from a year earlier.

On Wednesday in Seoul, Samsung's shares dropped to a two-year low, after Goldman Sachs cut its earnings expectations and target price, citing risks to the company's smartphone sales as aggressive Chinese competitors narrow the gap with Samsung's handsets.

(Read more from The Wall Street Journal: 5 Things to Read Today.)

The update to Samsung's Note series gives the company a potential source of differentiation in the market for oversize smartphones a product category that Samsung created with the introduction of the first Galaxy Note in 2011.

Since then, a number of Chinese handset makers have released similarly-sized devices. Samsung's new announcement on the Galaxy Note comes just days before an event next week where Apple Inc. is expected to introduce a larger iPhone of its own.

"Competitors are catching on," said Shoneel Kolhatkar, senior director of product planning for Samsung's U.S. mobile business, referring to the increasingly crowded market for larger smartphones. "How can we show our differentiators to consumers?"

Underscoring the importance of the product segment, Mr. Kolhatkar said Samsung's internal research showed that users of its smartphone-tablet hybrids spent 390 minutes a day on such devices far more than 244 minutes a day for its tablet users and 229 minutes a day for its smartphone users.

Samsung added a metallic frame to the Note devices, in an echo of a new line of smartphones that Samsung introduced just weeks ago. That new series of smartphones, called the Galaxy Alpha, came after years of complaints that the company's plastic-bodied high-end smartphones appeared cheap.

The new Note also features improved screen resolution and pixel density, as well as an optical image stabilizer for the built-in camera which Samsung called a first for a phone camera.

However, the Note won't be water-resistant, like the Galaxy S5 smartphone that Samsung released earlier in the year.

The premium version of the Note with the curved screen dubbed the Galaxy Note Edge will sell at a higher price, though the company didn't release specifics. A company spokeswoman said that both the Note 4 would go on sale in October, with the Note Edge and the Gear VR following later in the fall.

The software for the virtual reality headset will be powered by Oculus VR, the Irvine, Calif.-based virtual reality company that Facebook Inc. acquired earlier this year for $2 billion.

Subzero Eurozone Yields

Show ECB Power, Problems

Lending money when it is a losing proposition from the start sounds like an odd thing to do. That isn't stopping bond buyers in the eurozone government-bond market.

Two-year yields on bonds from five countries -- Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Belgium -- are in negative territory, according to data from Tradeweb. France briefly joined the negative-yield gang Monday, before rebounding into marginally positive territory Tuesday. Germany is leading the way: Not only does its current benchmark two-year bond pay a zero coupon and a yield of minus 0.04%, yields on its bonds are below zero all the way out to January 2018.

This isn't the first time yields have gone negative in the eurozone. In the depths of the sovereign-debt crisis, yields fell below zero in Germany as investors feared that the euro might collapse and countries might revert to national currencies. A subzero yield then was effectively an insurance fee: Investors wanted to be in safer German paper no matter the cost to returns.

Now, however, the rationale is different. The European Central Bank's decision to introduce a negative rate of minus 0.1% on cash deposited at the central bank has rippled outward. Relative to that, negative yields on highly liquid two-year securities don't look so bad to banks that need to find a home for their cash. Banks aren't locked into losses: If yields decline further, they could sell the bonds at a profit. But that banks are doing this trade also signals continued risk aversion and means they aren't finding more attractive opportunities for lending.

Some think the ECB could cut rates again this Thursday. That would be likely to entrench more firmly the trend for negative yields. Ireland, where two-year yields are just 0.04%, could yet join the club.

In theory, negative bond yields don't present particular issues. Bond math works just as well with negative numbers as it does with positive ones -- even if it does throw up some oddities, such as Italy's two-year yield spread over Germany being higher than Italy's yield. But in practice, they are a sign of big problems. Indeed, that buying bonds with a negative yield can be a rational and accepted activity is a reminder of just how distorted the financial markets are, and how precarious the eurozone outlook remains.

Novo's Regulatory Dependence

This is where the fat starts hitting the fire for Novo Nordisk.

The pharmaceuticals company had a troubled 2013 after U.S. regulators demanded more trials examining cardiovascular risk for its latest insulin, Tresiba. This year, though, Novo's stock is up more than 30%. That prices in a return to form for the diabetes specialist.

Novo's appeal lies in its organic growth, underpinned by the rising incidence and diagnosis of diabetes around the world. The Danish company expects revenue growth of between 7% and 10% this year. The hope is that its well-stocked pipeline should then enable a return to double-digit sales growth. That would be higher than peers and help justify Novo's hefty 40% premium to the global pharma sector on forward price/earnings multiples.

To do that, Novo must deliver on a number of coming data and regulatory milestones. The big one concerns Tresiba. Its potential is proven: In Japan, the next-generation insulin was priced roughly in line with market leader Sanofi's Lantus and has taken a fifth of the market by value in just over a year. Novo should have initial trial data sooner than anticipated, though regulatory clarity could take at least another year.

Getting Tresiba into the U.S. is crucial. Sanofi has been pushing up the price of Lantus, which enabled Novo to raise prices on its Levemir insulin while also taking share. But price pressure is intensifying, with U.S. pharmacy-benefits managers pushing drug companies harder. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly could bring its biosimilar version of Lantus to market in 2016. Tresiba, which acts for over 42 hours, compared with about 24 hours for current insulins, is critical to fighting mounting competition.

Nearer term, a U.S. regulatory committee next week will meet to consider Novo's obesity treatment, a higher dosage of diabetes drug Victoza. Safety will be the focus, especially given the checkered history of obesity treatments. But approval isn't the only question here. Obesity hasn't been big business for the pharma industry: The U.S. market is worth a mere $100 million, notes Citigroup, despite some 30 million people who are extremely obese. Doctors and insurers have been skeptical of paying for medicines to treat something often considered a lifestyle issue. Novo may face resistance over the cost of its treatment, anticipated to be about $25 a day.

Given the market's muted expectations, a regulatory snafu in obesity at least presents limited downside risk. And Novo does offer other interesting things in its pipeline. Trial data for an oral version of one diabetes drug could generate particular excitement next year. Novo also has a combination therapy of two diabetes drugs with regulators.

But the heat around Novo relies on the company's ability to produce high-single-digit sales growth, at least, translating that into higher earnings growth as research-and-development spending falls. Novo said on Tuesday it would discontinue its research and development in inflammation. The company's sales growth could translate into higher earnings growth as R&D spending falls.

In the next year, Novo needs a fair regulatory wind to fan those flames further.

Putting a Name on the Claims

Made by Tianhe Chemicals

Four years after short sellers and corporate activists began wreaking havoc at Chinese-listed companies, they are at it again.

Tianhe Chemicals was tossed into the fray when the secretive activist group Anonymous Analytics issued a report alleging the specialty-chemicals maker had fabricated numbers and cooked up customers. Tianhe says the report is wrong, though it has yet to issue a full-throated defense. Its shares were suspended after tumbling 4.9%.

Northern China-based Tianhe listed in Hong Kong in June, and Anonymous's contention is that the firm's initial-public-offering prospectus doesn't gel with separate filings it makes to a local-government agency. The 2012 net profits its subsidiaries filed with local officials was a thousandth of what Hong Kong investors read in the prospectus, according to Anonymous.

Investors will need to dig into these local details at Tianhe. What seems inexplicable at first sometimes can be explained. That said, the profits Tianhe plainly reported in its prospectus do raise questions. Tianhe clocked 60%-plus margins on its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization the past two years. Yet global chemicals makers tend to average Ebitda margins in the midteens.

One explanation for Tianhe's high profit is selling anti-mar, a specialized chemical used in smartphone touch screens to repel water and oil. But Anonymous says Tianhe's anti-mar sales are twice the world demand for the product.

Tianhe had generated controversy before it went public. J.P. Morgan Chase, which earlier hired the daughter of Tianhe's chief executive, pulled out of a role in the chemical maker's IPO while it was being investigated for recruiting the sons and daughters of Chinese government officials.

Whatever the strength of Anonymous's claims, investors would be wise to consider the mixed history of following on such campaigns. Muddy Waters in 2011 famously helped hasten the fall of Toronto-listed Sino-Forest. Yet Qihoo 360's shares are up 408% since Anonymous said its website traffic was a fraud in 2012.

It will take time to unravel the claims and counterclaims in Tianhe's case. The broader impact could end up being on China Inc. generally. Despite four years of scrutiny, investors aren't comfortable enough to give Chinese companies the benefit of the doubt.

Tianhe Shares Suspended in Hong Kong; Shares Suspended Following Anonymous Report Questioning Accuracy of its Earnings.

Shares in Tianhe Chemicals Group, the recently-listed Chinese maker of specialty chemicals, were suspended from trading Tuesday after an activist group's report questioned the accuracy of its earnings, traders said.

The Liaoning province-based Tianhe, which raised US$748 million in a Hong Kong float in June , saw its shares fall 4.9% in the morning, underperforming the broader market, before the company requested a suspension of the stock. Tianhe, which has a market capitalization of US$7.6 billion, said the report is inaccurate and that it will issue an official statement later Tuesday. Both Hong Kong's stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission declined to comment.

A report posted on the group's website by an offshoot of "hacktivist" group Anonymous alleged that Tianhe had falsified its accounting and that several of its customers for a lucrative chemical agent called anti-mar were related companies.

The authors of the report didn't reveal their identity and the accuracy of the report couldn't be determined.

Anti-mar is coated on products including lenses and touch screens to repel contaminants such as oil, water and dirt, according to Tianhe's IPO prospectus. The offshoot, Anonymous Analytics, which scrutinizes corporate activity, put a "strong sell" rating on the stock.

Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal and others reported that Joyce Wei, daughter of Tianhe chief executive Wei Xuan, worked at UBS AG, which was hired as a sponsoring bank on the chemical firm's IPO. UBS hired Ms. Wei in October 2013 and in February suspended two executives amid an investigation into Ms. Wei's recruitment. Tianhe has previously said that the sponsor banks were selected fairly and transparently, and that its IPO business was never linked to Ms. Wei's employment.

UBS AG, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch were Tianhe's IPO sponsors, the banks in charge of due diligence for the IPO. UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment on the report.

Morgan Stanley which owns around 10% in Tianhe also declined to comment.

Asia
Veterans of Thai Military Government Take Key Posts in New Cabinet; Former Central Banker Appointed to Key Role Overseeing Economic Strategy

BANGKOK Thailand's military leaders presented a new cabinet Sunday, placing much of the responsibility for reviving the country's troubled economy in the hands of an aristocratic former central banker.

The lineup includes Pridiyathorn Devakula as a deputy prime minister with special responsibility for overseeing economic strategy, formalizing an advisory role he has held since army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power in a coup d'tat in May.

The 67-year-old Mr. Pridiyathorn served as finance minister after the previous military coup in 2006, notably introducing a series of short-lived capital controls that rattled financial markets. One of his assistant ministers then, Sommai Pasi, returns as finance minister, underscoring the extent to which the army is entrusting a handful of veterans from previous juntas to run the government under the direction of Gen. Prayuth, who became prime minister last week.

Indeed, more than a third of the 32 cabinet members are active or retired military officers. The head of the air force, Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong, who has been serving as the junta's economics czar, will become transport minister, while former Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwon and Gen. Tanasak Patimapragorn will be deputy prime ministers.

The strong military influence in the new government appears to suggest that the armed forces are likely to continue their tight political control of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy as they step up efforts to reinvigorate the economy and win over the millions of Thais who voted for populist leaders Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

Gen. Prayuth and Marshal Prajin have adopted many of the populist-leaning policies initially championed by Mr. Thaksin, who was ousted in 2006, and Ms. Yingluck, who was elected in a landslide in 2011.

The measures include a plan to spend $75 billion over the rest of the decade to revamp the country's infrastructure and make Thailand more competitive with neighbors such as Malaysia and China.

The economy contracted in the first half of year, although it showed some signs of picking up in the second quarter after the May 22 putsch. Still, the country's manufacturing production index fell 5.2% on the year in July, the 16th consecutive monthly decline. Some economists, including those at Moody'sAnalytics, said political uncertainty in the country is continuing to hamper investment and spending.

Export growth, meanwhile, remains sluggish, indicating the generals' efforts to accelerate growth partly depend on demand elsewhere in the world. Exports declined 0.85% while imports contracted 2.86% in July from a year earlier.

AIG Takes New Tack: Data Into Dollars

For clues about what direction Peter Hancock is taking American International Group Inc., check out his tennis racket.

"It's the coolest thing," said Mr. Hancock, the insurer's incoming CEO, of the $350 racket. "It tells you exactly how many forehands, backhands you hit, where on the strings you hit the ball, how many were top spins. . ." He called it "just one tiny example of the kinds of things [technology] can measure now."

Mr. Hancock, an active sportsman whose first day at the helm is Sept. 1, is betting that data crunching can improve more than just his serve: The 56-year-old is pushing AIG to wring greater efficiency -- and profits -- out of the vast reams of information it keeps about its customers, among other sources.

If the strategy works as he expects, the results will include new products, better identification of fraud and potentially lower premiums for certain customers.

"If we can do that, we become not the biggest insurance company, but the most valued in the eyes of those customers," he said.

The emphasis on analytics is one of the clearest signs of how Mr. Hancock hopes to address the main challenge now facing AIG: boosting profits.

Mr. Hancock is taking over from Robert Benmosche, the chief executive since 2009, who initially focused on morale and keeping AIG afloat after its financial-crisis bailout. Through a series of divestitures, Mr. Benmosche slimmed down AIG considerably; in 2012, the company repaid the last of the bailout money. AIG announced Mr. Hancock's promotion in June. Mr. Benmosche, 70, had indicated he would stay into early next year, but he advanced his retirement to allow the new CEO to move ahead with decisions and as he continues to be treated for a 2010 cancer diagnosis.

AIG is now built primarily around two large, valuable franchises: a world-wide property-casualty insurance business, which Mr. Hancock has run since 2011, and a U.S. life-insurance and retirement-services unit. Analysts say a key challenge for Mr. Hancock is to catch up to many of AIG's peers in profitability metrics such as return on equity.

Mr. Hancock wants AIG to use its expertise "to manage down the cost of risk" by investing heavily in computers and people to dive deeper into data, he said in an interview in his 30th-floor downtown Manhattan office, which features an ergonomic stand-up workstation.

Mr. Hancock said he was recruiting a chief information officer, who will report directly to him "to raise the profile of technology" at the company. Already, Mr. Hancock has a "chief science officer," a position he added in 2012 to the property-casualty unit as part of his effort to focus on science-driven decisions about strategy. The science team numbers about 130, many of them Ph.D.s.

As an example of how the concepts he champions can work in practice, Mr. Hancock points to recent analysis by AIG, in conjunction with Johns Hopkins University, of about 23 million of its workers' compensation claims. The effort identified addiction and other problems stemming from overuse of opiates.

"It is a terrible cost to the industry, a terrible cost to employers, and it's a terrible cost to society," Mr. Hancock said. AIG now has teams of doctors and nurses who reach out to injured workers and their primary-care physicians early in treatment to suggest nonaddictive pain solutions, he said.

Mr. Hancock also has been tweaking the business mix, including reducing sales of certain types of workers' compensation accounts, such as those the company doesn't see as profitable enough. AIG is also boosting sales of property insurance and aiming to expand in many emerging markets.

But significant improvement in AIG's return on equity -- a measure of profit relative to shareholders' investment in a company -- may be a ways off. That figure stands in the single digits, in part because AIG sends a larger percentage than do many rivals of each dollar earned in premiums back out the door to pay claims and other expenses.

Some analysts have raised concerns about a deceleration of price increases for property-casualty insurers industrywide and whether a tougher pricing environment is slowing AIG's turnaround. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Mr. Hancock said the company was "clearly experiencing some headwinds in the pricing" of certain business lines.

Mr. Hancock's data push also adds to costs at a time when the company is shaving expenses.

"His approach to the business is still a work in progress," said Janney Capital Markets analyst Larry Greenberg. For now, Mr. Greenberg believes shareholders care more about share buybacks -- which AIG has under way as well -- as a way to boost the stock price than they do about data analysis.

"Our businesses continue to demonstrate our discipline and resilience, underscoring our focus on improving the results of our core insurance businesses," an AIG spokesman said.

Other analysts are more bullish. Josh Stirling of Bernstein Research applauds the decision "to aggressively embrace data and analytics," and especially likes what he calls AIG's "hiring binge" of scientists and other talent.

Mr. Hancock arrived at AIG in 2010 with extensive risk-management experience. In the 1990s, he worked at J.P. Morgan, now part of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., where he helped develop the market for products such as credit-default swaps. In those early years, banks and their corporate clients typically used the swaps to mitigate risk on debt exposure.

AIG went to the brink of collapse in 2008 after a now-defunct financial-products unit used credit-default swaps to essentially bet on the subprime-mortgage market. Mr. Hancock chafes at the suggestion he indirectly contributed to AIG's difficulties.

"That was certainly not something I anticipated the tool to be used for," said Mr. Hancock, who was hired to beef up the insurer's risk management and to help unwind the bad bets.

Mr. Hancock said he looked forward to the challenge of running AIG. A novice in the extreme sport of kitesurfing, he grew up in Hong Kong, where his father worked at a Canadian insurer and was involved in competitive sailing.

The family had sessions in which they ran through scenarios for what could go wrong in a race, and who would do what if it did.

"My dad taught me an important lesson," Mr. Hancock said. "If you rehearse every maneuver ahead of time, people don't panic when things get really intense."

U.S. News: Construction Loans Are Gaining Strength

By Kris Hudson

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Construction lending posted the largest gain of its yearlong recovery in the second quarter, signaling that the real-estate industry's rebound is gaining steam, albeit slowly.

Outstanding construction loans for both residential and commercial projects increased to $223.2 billion in the second quarter, up 4% from the first, figures released Thursday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. show. The gain is the sector's largest since it began rising from its nadir of $201.5 billion in the first quarter of 2013.

The trajectory has been similar for lending to build one- to four-family homes. Loans for home construction increased to $48.2 billion in the second quarter, up 5.4% from the first quarter, according to the FDIC.

That, too, is the largest gain for home construction since the sector started rebounding from its low point of $40.7 billion of outstanding loans in last year's first quarter.

"Lenders are growing more comfortable extending credit, and demand for credit is improving," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sAnalytics. "Both residential and commercial construction should steadily improve going forward because the level of construction remains very low by historical standards, and vacancy rates are falling."

Vacancies at office buildings in the top 79 U.S. metropolitan areas have declined slowly from their recent high of 17.6% in 2010 to 16.8% in the second quarter, according to real estate data firm Reis Inc. For strip shopping centers in the top 77 markets, vacancies have dipped from a high of 11.1% in 2011 to 10.3% in the second quarter, Reis said.

In a broader context, though, construction lending has far to go to approach even half of its boom-time highs. Overall construction lending exceeded $600 billion of outstanding loans in much of 2007 and 2008, FDIC data show. Home-construction loans climbed past $180 billion during that time. The FDIC tracks only outstanding balances, not originations.

Home builders and lenders say they've seen a slight boost in loans to the sector. Many add, however, that lending remains particularly scarce in certain segments, including for small, closely held builders and for riskier projects.

"We've seen more small, medium and large banks entering the space in the past 12 months," said R. Bird Anderson Jr., an executive vice president at Wells Fargo & Co., speaking of lending to home builders. "It is nowhere near the number of lenders that were in the space in 2005. But there seems to be a reasonable amount of debt capital seeking opportunities."

An increase in lending to builders is one factor needed to revive the stalled home-construction business, which regularly accounts for 5% of U.S. gross domestic product but remained at 3.1% for the third consecutive quarter in this year's second quarter. Several factors have hampered the new-home market, including shortages of lots and labor, tepid wage growth for would-be buyers and steep new-home prices that have steered some buyers toward the cheaper resale market.

Construction starts for single-family homes are up a modest 3.2% so far this year in comparison to the same period last year, while new-home sales are down 1.9%, Census Bureau data show.

Builders consider increased availability of lending a positive, but only to the extent that there also are buyers for new homes.

"The banks are a little more aggressive and will chase the right deals, which has helped to loosen up overall [loan] terms," said Scott Laurie, chief executive of California builder the Olson Co. "It's a good world today, the best it has been to be borrowing and building since the recovery started."

Robert Myers, an Ohio builder who typically constructs five custom homes a year, said banks shy away from the regulatory scrutiny that comes with lending to smaller builders.

At Wells Fargo's digital innovation lab, developers and engineers are trying to make sure the bank, founded during the 19th century California gold rush, keeps up with the latest technology, write Sarah Mishkin and Camilla Hall.

The projects are varied. Some explore whether Google Glasses could be used to help identify potential bank robbers, or the use of smartwatches to authorise payments.

The bank is also launching a start-up accelerator, a "boot camp" for entrepreneurs working on financial services projects. Wells Fargo will take an equity stake in the companies in exchange for giving them advice, coaching and contacts.

Among the companies already in that programme are one from Kansas that uses eye recognition as security. Another, from New York, is working on artificial intelligence technology that can be used in customer support. Outside the bank, financial services start-ups are trying to innovate not just by looking at integrating new hardware and software, but by navigating complex regulations to build new companies in overlooked areas.

Quippi is trying to change the multibillion-dollar cross-border remittance industry, but anti-money laundering laws make such transfers complex. So instead, founder Michael Aleles is building a system that lets immigrants in the US send home gift cards preloaded with cash and usable at major retailers.

"It's hard to completely change how money moves," says Mr Aleles.

Virtual-Reality Start-Ups Capture More Funding

Facebook Inc . and Sony Computer Entertainment Inc . have placed billion-dollar bets on virtual-reality technology. Now, private investors have backed a string of virtual-reality startups, with Jaunt Inc. becoming the latest to get funding.

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company has raised $27.8 million to accelerate adoption of its virtual-reality technology in the film, real estate, travel and education industries.

Venture capital investors recently have backed Lytro Inc . and 360fly Inc., which have raised $90 million and $21 million, respectively.

But unlike Lytro and 360fly, Jaunt isn't making 3-D cameras for consumers.

The year-old startup has created a sphere dotted with camera lenses and microphones for professionals to create immersive content. That content can then be played on virtual reality headsets like Oculus Rift from Oculus VR Inc ., which Facebook purchased this spring for $2 billion, or Sony 's Project Morpheus headset currently in development.

While much excitement around virtual reality involves its use in immersive games, Jaunt Chief Executive Jens Christensen said that isn't his company's focus. Rather, Jaunt will team up with professionals in the film, live event, real estate, travel, education and other industries to use the gear.

Jaunt is still in the early stages but it has already been used for a few film projects. New Deal used the gear to film World War II narrative "The Mission," and "Paranormal Activity 5" director Gregory Plotkin used it to film a horror short "Black Mass."

Along with providing the hardware to capture content, Jaunt has also created algorithms to process and edit the visual and audio recordings. Jaunt is also working on apps so the content can be played on any virtual reality goggles.

Jaunt's Series B funding came from Highland Capital, Google Ventures, Redpoint Ventures , British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC and individual investors. The company has raised more than $34 million in outside funding.

Farmlink

FarmLink LLC raised $40 million in Series B venture funding to help farmers use big data to maximize farm productivity and to avoid spending unnecessary efforts on soil that is spent.

FarmLink extracts data from about 800 farm combines that were leased out through MachineryLink Inc ., where FarmLink began as a subsidiary.

The data feeds the company's benchmarking tool and lets it offer a service called TrueHarvest to help farmers figure out how their yields stack up to previous harvests and other local farms' yields, for example. Farmers can take the own farm's data to a consultant or agronomist offline and decide how to improve their output. OpenAir Equity Partners led the investment, joined by family office Thorndale Farm, Early Investments and individual investors.

Zumigo

Zumigo Inc. has secured $6 million in funding for a technology that can help determine where a device is and if it belongs to the proper person before online purchases are completed. The San Jose, Calif., company developed a global network that detects the location of a device that can be used for purchasing, such as cellphones and laptops.

The network is combined with technology that verifies if devices belong to the user. Zumigo's technology also makes it easier to buy things using known mobile devices by automatically filling out purchasing information.

Merchants can also target mobile customers with deals. Zumigo's technology is in use at several financial institutions. Intel Capital and Aligned Partners participated in the funding round.

No Credit: Small-Business Lending Stuck in the Slow Lane

CARROLLTON, Ga. -- Brandi Shirey wants to borrow at least $20,000 to expand the birthday- and wedding-cake business she started four years ago after leaving her job as a bookkeeper.

Demand for the cakes, which sell for $150 to $500, overwhelms her home kitchen. She plans to use about $2,000 from her savings to move into a nearby storefront next month. But the 28-year-old Ms. Shirey believes her credit record and financial paperwork have to be bulletproof before she dares approach a bank for a loan. "It's time to grow," she says, but things "aren't what they used to be."

Across the U.S., small-business lending has been stuck in a slow, grinding recovery behind most other types of business and consumer loans. At the end of the first quarter, banks held $585 billion in loans to small businesses, up 1% from last September but still 18% less than the peak of $711 billion in 2008, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

The number of loans for $1 million or less held by banks is down about 14% to 23.5 million since 2008. In nearly one-third of all U.S. counties, small-business lending remains below 2005 levels, estimates PayNet Inc., a Skokie, Ill., tracker of loans by banks, corporations and alternative lenders such as finance companies.

In contrast, loans to businesses of all sizes totaled $2.48 trillion as of March 31, up 9% since 2008. Federal Reserve data show that overall loans and leases grew in the second quarter at the highest quarterly rate since the end of the financial crisis, a sign of improvement in the economy. The latest official survey of senior loan officers showed that banks have loosened standards more quickly for medium and large companies than for small ones.

Some analysts are encouraged by recent signs of a lending uptick by small banks, which often focus on small businesses. In July, the total amount of commercial and industrial loans held by small U.S. banks rose 11% from a year earlier, according to Moody'sAnalytics. July was the fourth straight month with a double-digit percentage increase, Moody's says.

In Carrollton, which has a population of 24,958, and surrounding Carroll County, though, entrepreneurs like Ms. Shirey still are wrestling with the impact of six bank failures since 2007. Those banks held more than half of deposits in the county.

Loan originations in a six-county area that includes Carroll County are 40% below prerecession levels, according to PayNet. Just 13 local businesses got loans backed by the Small Business Administration in the fiscal year that ended last September, down from 25 in fiscal 2007.

"The ripple effects" of the local housing bust and bank failures have "lasted longer than most anybody expected," says William Smith, chairman of the economics department at the University of West Georgia, based in Carrollton. Kathy Yates, area manager of Southern Co.'s Georgia Power unit, says weeks can go by "without a single installation" of a new electric meter at a home or business.

Carroll County Chamber of Commerce President Daniel Jackson says the local economy has improved and lending policies are "loosening a bit, but we still have to look at alternative funding for our businesses." The biggest employers in the roughly 500-square-mile county include the University of West Georgia, Tanner Medical Center and Southwire Co., a closely held maker of wire and cable with annual sales of about $5 billion.

Efforts by Carroll County leaders to spur job growth have helped generate an estimated $655 million in capital investments since 2010.

For decades, local business owners chewed over business plans with bank executives at ballgames and local restaurants, building relationships that help win loan approvals.

Following the bank failures and a push by many surviving banks to rein in and simplify their loan underwriting, "relationship lending is gone," says Todd Anduze, director of the government-funded Small Business Development Center in Carrollton, which advises small firms on financing and business planning. "Now, if you don't fit into their box, you're not getting that loan."

A study of lending cutbacks during the financial crisis concluded that employment and business formation were depressed in counties with more exposure to banks that cut their small-business lending, according to University of Chicago economist Michael Greenstone, a co-author of the study.

Bank failures hurt local economic activity for years, according to a study by Federal Reserve Bank of New York economist Adam Ashcraft, who examined the impact of some bank closings during the savings-and-loan crisis.

Tano Phommasith, owner of a popular Carrollton restaurant called Little Hawaiian, borrowed $650,000 from First National Bank of Georgia in 2008 to move to a bigger location closer to the main, cobblestone-lined square.

Getting the loan wasn't easy, even though his banker was a regular customer. The loan was secured by Mr. Phommasith's home and his parents' home, then worth about 30% more than the loan amount.

After First National Bank of Georgia failed in 2010, the buyer boosted the interest rate to 8.25% from 7.7%, making the loan unaffordable, Mr. Phommasith says. He now pays 5.5% on a loan from a unit of United Community Banks Inc., of Blairsville, Ga., but keeps looking for a better deal. Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and other large banks have turned him down.

"You would think any banker who came in for lunch and saw how busy we are would want to work with us," he says. United Community, Bank of America and Wells Fargo say they don't comment on individual customers.

Some business owners have dug into their savings or retirement plans, turned to family and friends for funding or sought out costlier forms of financing. Biz2Credit Inc. says nearly three-quarters of Georgia business owners who approach the online small-business lending marketplace wind up getting loans from high-cost, short-term lenders. That is the highest percentage of any U.S. state.

Many of those borrowers have good credit and more than two years of business history, traditionally good enough to qualify them for bank financing, says Biz2Credit co-founder Rohit Arora. "The failure of so many small banks there has created a credit desert," he says.

Some entrepreneurs are reluctant to take on debt even though their business is strong. They still feel rattled by the recession, unsure about the economic recovery's strength and chastened by the trouble other small-business owners have keeping up with loan payments. About 3.3% of small-business loans in Carroll and surrounding counties are 31 to 180 days past due, based on dollars outstanding, PayNet estimates. The U.S. average is 1.5%.

"You become aware of every single penny," says Alicia Michael, owner of Carrollton Collision Center, an auto-body shop along the main highway here. She has six full-time employees but mows her own lawn on weekends to keep expenses down. "I don't have a line of credit, and I don't want one," she says. "We run everything pay-as-you-go. I guess we're all a bit gun-shy these days."

April Harris, the owner of a men's clothing store, says she divided her business accounts -- including payroll, loans and other services -- among five banks after Bank of America withdrew her credit line in 2008. Since the crisis, Ms. Harris has required wholesale customers to pay upfront. "I'm sure we would grow faster by extending credit, but that is the reality," she says.

U.S. News: Americans Borrow for Cars, Less So for Homes

By Alan Zibel

Americans displayed a selective willingness to borrow money during the spring, taking out new auto loans at the fastest pace in nearly eight years while fresh home loans tumbled to the lowest level since 2000.

Total outstanding household debt -- including mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, student loans and home-equity lines -- sank $18 billion between April and June to $11.63 trillion, according to a report released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It marked the first decline after three quarters of increases.

According to the report, student-loan balances increased $7 billion, bringing the nation's student-loan tab to $1.12 trillion. Credit-card debt outstanding rose by $10 billion to $669 billion, slightly below year-ago levels.

The trends suggest Americans continue to recover from the recession by paring existing debt and taking on new loans judiciously. Defaults are generally at low levels, with the share of Americans' debt that was seriously overdue falling to 4.5%, the lowest level since the start of 2008.

Amid this healthier lending climate, "borrowers and lenders are increasingly more willing to lend and take on more credit," said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody'sAnalytics.

Auto lenders made $101 billion in new loans in the second quarter, the highest since the third quarter of 2006. Total auto-loan balances grew by $30 billion to $905 billion.

Auto lending didn't experience the high levels of defaults that led to the foreclosure crisis. With auto lending rising for 13 straight quarters, analysts and consumer groups have been growing increasingly worried that loose lending guidelines could lead to a surge of defaults.

Growth in auto loans has been most pronounced among riskier borrowers in recent years, with new loans to borrowers with low credit scores doubling since 2009, New York Fed officials found in an analysis of lending data.

The resurgence in subprime auto lending after a sharp crisis-era decline is most prominent among auto-finance companies, typically owned by car makers, rather than banks or credit unions, New York Fed officials said.

Auto lenders, however, say that concerns are overblown and that defaults in the auto-loan business remain low.

"The proof is in the pudding," said Bill Himpler, executive vice president of the American Financial Services Association, which represents the industry. "The loans are performing and the securities are performing."

By contrast, the amount of new mortgage loans extended in the quarter fell to $286 billion, the lowest level since 2000, and half the $589 billion in the second quarter of 2013.

Total mortgage debt outstanding fell by $69 billion from the prior quarter to $8.09 trillion. Home-equity lines of credit fell by $5 billion on a quarterly basis to $521 billion.

Those who have been able to obtain home loans are enjoying historically low rates, and some are able to tap home equity to stabilize their finances.

Donald Beckwith, 58 years old, and his wife Laurene, 59, are now borrowing $150,000 against the Seattle condominium they purchased in 2011 for $220,000 in cash.

The home is now valued at more than $300,000, and they are using their built-up equity to pay off nearly $80,000 in debt, including credit cards, medical bills and unpaid tax bills "We'll have a little bit more control of both our present and our future," Mr. Beckwith said.

Still, many Americans are still playing it relatively safe when it comes to using credit, a force that could keep a damper on consumer spending.

Tanya LaPrad, a 43-year-old cardiovascular technician and yoga instructor from Monroe, Mich., worked with nonprofit credit counseling firm GreenPath Debt Solutions to pay back $21,000 in credit-card debt over four years. During that time, she also secured a modification on her mortgage to avoid foreclosure.

Ms. LaPrad said she is now far more careful about her finances. "I still have credit cards," she said. "But I'm very, very cautious about how I use them."

Lookout raises funds to expand base; SOFTWARE; Start-up taps into cyber crime fears

Lookout has raised $150m from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, in the largest fundraising by a cyber security company this year.

The San Francisco-based group is one of a growing number of companies raising large amounts of money as they tap into investor excitement about the potential to sell to corporations worried about the rising threat of cyber crime.

Investment in cyber security start-ups this year has already overtaken last year's total of $1.1bn, according to PrivCo, a financial data provider on privately held companies.

Lookout, which has developed an app to improve the security of smartphones , plans to use the money to target large enterprises, expanding beyond its base of 50m subscribers who are mainly consumers and small businesses. The product protects smartphones against attacks from hackers who are targeting mobile devices to gain access to users' personal data. It now plans to develop products specifically for large companies, increase its sales force and open offices in Europe, Asia and South America.

Jim Dolce, a former vicepresident of Akamai Technologies and Juniper Networks, joined in March, the first chief executive recruited from outside the company. He said the group's focus on big themes such as security, mobile, big data and cloud gave it the potential to be "one of the most important security companies in the world".

As Lookout prepares to take on what he calls "legacy companies" with "legacy solutions", as well as a range of early stage start-ups in mobile security, Mr Dolce said that it could set itself apart from rivals.

The financing was led by fund manager T Rowe Price Associates and included participation from Wellington Management Company, as well as existing investors.

The valuation of the company was not disclosed but it is likely to be more than $1bn, based on other fundraisings at this scale. The start-up's last fundraising was in October 2013, when Deutsche Telekom led a $55m round that also included money from chipmaker Qualcomm.

John Hering, co-founder and former chief executive, said Lookout had partnered investors who were focused on the long term and that companies such as Amazon and Goldman Sachs could also be potential customers for the new enterprise products. The company already partners big telecoms operators across the US and Europe including investor Deutsche Telekom, AT&T in the US and EE in the UK.

Lookout's fundraising follows another large round raised by Tanium, which focuses on helping IT managers manage security across large networks. Tanium raised $90m in a series A round from Andreessen Horowitz in June, the second-largest investment the venture capital firm has made. Tanium is already used by half of the Fortune 50.

Deal of the Week: 'Master' Class on Leasing

PEARLAND, Texas -- The medical-office sector is undergoing a broad transformation with the rise of master leases.

In those deals, a large company or organization leases several floors or an entire building, then typically sublets the space to smaller users. Until recently, the sector had relied on myriad small leases backed only by the guarantees of individual physicians and small practices.

Just this summer, construction kicked off on a proposed medical-office building south of Houston after hospital operator Memorial Hermann Health System agreed to lease more than one-third of the building. HCP Inc., a developer, is building the project on Memorial Hermann's campus here, where the hospital system already has a master lease for an existing 80,000-square-foot office building.

Marshall Heins, Memorial Hermann's head of facilities, declined to disclose the terms of the lease or the rent it will pay for the new space. In general, he says, rents are climbing rapidly and property values are eclipsing those of conventional office spaces.

"Medical-office lease rates continue to rise across the country," he said. "This is probably the hottest sector right now."

The deal is an example of a side effect of health-care overhaul some might not have expected. Across the nation, the value of medical-office space is skyrocketing as the size and credit quality of tenants increase.

In the past, many medical offices were leased by individual doctors and small practices rather than by large, well-funded institutions. In an exodus that began in 2009 and accelerated under the Affordable Care Act, many physicians are abandoning the independent-practice model to join large systems that are better able to create efficiencies and control costs.

For example, the Affordable Care Act requires health-care providers to maintain digital medical records by 2015 or lose progressively larger percentages of Medicare reimbursements each year. At Memorial Hermann, doctors to whom the company leases space will have access to Memorial Hermann's digital-medical-records infrastructure, as well as optional services in areas such as reception, billing and office management. Those doctors, in turn, are expected to steer patients to the system's hospitals.

Master leases such as the one signed by Memorial Hermann are becoming the norm at medical-office buildings, boosting property values and investor demand for the asset type, according to Eric Johnson. Mr. Johnson runs a group that advises health-care companies at Transwestern. The Houston-based commercial-real-estate firm markets HCP's building for lease and brokered the recent deal with Memorial Hermann.

"The beauty of these master leases is that now we're not doing 2,000-square-foot deals. We're doing 30,000- to 50,000-square-foot deals," Mr. Johnson said. "For a developer, with one lease, you can hit your minimum preleasing requirements required by the lender for construction."

Memorial Hermann previously owned its office buildings and leased directly to tenants. About five years ago, it sold those properties and leased them back in order to free up cash for other purposes. "With health-care reform, we spend our dollars where we get a better bang for the buck," Mr. Heins said.

The new economics of the industry also have led to strong demand from investors who want to own medical-office buildings. Some 822 properties with a collective sales volume exceeding $8.2 billion changed hands during the 12 months that ended June 30, a six-year high, according to New York researcher Real Capital Analytics. Median prices on a 12-month rolling average reached $229.67 per square foot in the past 12 months, the highest since early 2008, Real Capital found.

Asking rents for medical offices average $23.36 per square foot currently in Houston, according to CoStar Group, a researcher. That is up 4.9% from the $22.27 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 and exceeds the previous high of $23.08 set in the first quarter of 2009. Yet rent growth alone may not account for the steeper uptick in acquisition prices.

Yet rent growth alone may not account for the steeper uptick in acquisition prices.

Some observers attribute the increase to the relatively low risk associated with health-care systems as tenants. "The institutional capital has seen this transfer of credit from individual practitioners to, now, bonded hospitals that have institutional credit," Mr. Johnson said.

Properties leased to pharmaceutical companies, which also are generally seen as having a relatively low risk of defaulting on a lease, increased values for landlords during the 1990s, points out David Rodgers, a research analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. "You went from these lower-value buildings to an asset class that became somewhat sought-after, and credit has a lot to do with that," Mr. Rodgers said. "We are seeing that very same trend, the move to credit, occur within the medical-office field."

Wunderlich Securities Inc. research analyst Craig Kucera argues that, more than credit, rising values reflect low interest rates and potential rent growth as large health systems take up more of the market's rentable space. "These large physician groups are thriving," Mr. Kucera said.

You'll never guess how much BuzzFeed raised from Andreessen Horowitz

1. OK, maybe you will

If you guess $50m. BuzzFeed's new investor is one of Silicon Valley's best-known venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz. This is literally what happens when you create an INSANELY DISRUPTIVE news service.

2. There's more

The investment values BuzzFeed at $850m, the New York Times reported.

Or $850,000,000.00.

Or more than three times what Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post or nearly half the New York Times Company's own enterprise value.

Let's all salute a start-up founded in 2006, which was reportedly worth less than $200m in January 2012.

3. Orphaned pygmy hippos that are looking directly at you

Yes, every article about BuzzFeed must mention that their LISTS ARE CHAMPAGNE FOR THE EYES.

But honestly, that's cool because the site has also been hiring political reporters and is beefing up its foreign coverage.

With Andreessen Horowitz's money, BuzzFeed wants to add more AMAZING sections that your GRANDMOTHER should have told you about, invest in UNBELIEVABLE videos that will MAKE YOU SPILL (ADVERTISER-NAME) COFFEE ON YOUR SHORTS RIGHT NOW and possibly buy some weird-ass tech companies where GEEK'S ARE COOKING THE FUTURE.

4. Which Buzzfeed executive are you?

If you're lucky, you're upbeat founder and chief executive Jonah Peretti. He just rocked the internet so hard, we can all go home now.

But there are stumbling blocks. BuzzFeed has been accused of copying other's work: last month it fired one of its political editors for plagiarism. And its ad-funded model may not be fail-safe: MailOnline, which reaches 180m unique users compared to BuzzFeed's 150m, has had to hire more and more journalists to generate growth. BuzzFeed currently has 550 employees.

5. How did this MASSIVE SITE become MASSIVE anyway?

BuzzFeed's secret sauce is its grasp of how content spreads online and on mobiles, paying intense attention to subject-matter, headlines and so on.

As Andreessen Horowitz's Chris Dixon put it: "Many of today's great media companies were built on top of emerging technologies. Examples include Time Inc. which was built on color printing, CBS which was built on radio, and Viacom which was built on cable TV... BuzzFeed takes the internet and computer science seriously."

BuzzFeed resembles Andreessen Horowitz's investments in big data start-ups, Facebook and accommodation site AirBnB, than the venture firm's moves into, say, robotics.

So, when Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist who co-founded PayPal, wakes up this morning, we know he'll mutter to himself again: "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."

6. Secrets that no one tells you about Buzzfeed

BuzzFeed is famous for lists or 5 or 10 things, but now tend to have more random numbers, in order to appear more credible to readers. That is one of the cutest things they have ever done, ever.

LOVED IT!

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
'Brutal' rotation squeezes mutual funds

Poor results match worst days of crisis

Managers may be forced into high risk

Actively managed US mutual funds suffered one of their worst periods of performance in the past 10 years in March and April despite market volatility remaining low.

The fear is that disappointing returns could force many active managers to adopt more risky strategies in the second half of 2014 in order to make up for the poor performance.

Managers of large-cap US mutual funds fell below their benchmarks by an average of 175 basis points between the start of March and the end of April, according to MSCI, the index provider.

This poor result was only matched during four other periods of exceptionally weak performance over the past decade, including the worst days of the global financial crisis in 2008 and Europe's sovereign debt crisis in 2012.

Mehmet Bayraktar, head of equity analytics research at MSCI, said: "[The returns] stand out as one of the worst over the past 10 years."

Growth-orientated fund managers endured a particularly tough time. Those benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Growth index underperformed by 290 basis points on average in March and April.

Mr Bayraktar said the worst-performing funds tended to have more exposure to more-volatile high-beta stocks, momentum stocks that had done well over the previous 12 months, and growth-orientated equities.

"Brutal" sector rotation presented huge difficulties for both long-only and hedge fund managers in March and April even though the S&P 500 traded within a narrow 75 point range and equity volatility also remained subdued, according to Nick Nelson, global equity strategist at UBS.

Tech stocks , a momentum trade over the previous six months, registered a sharp correction in March.

"Winners suddenly turned into losers. Any stockpicker, regardless of their exposure by region or asset class, found it extremely difficult to outperform," said Mr Nelson, who added that this would leave many managers "playing catch-up".

The MSCI figures come after research from S&P Dow Jones Indices for the UK found that almost 90 per cent of UK active equity fund managers beat the UK stock market last year.

The performance of UK managers was in marked contrast to their European rivals, where more than 60 per cent underperformed their benchmarks in 2013.

Records over three and five years were also significantly better for UK active managers than for their European counterparts.

Aye Soe, director of global research and design for S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the results for UK fund managers stood out. Almost 68 per cent of French fund managers and 63 per cent of German managers underperformed their benchmarks in 2013.

"However, it would be wrong to assume that UK active managers are the shining stars of the fund management industry," said Ms Soe.

As the five largest companies in the FTSE 100 account for more than a quarter (27.5 per cent) of the market capitalisation of the blue-chip index, it was relatively easy for UK managers to beat the benchmark by tilting their portfolio away from these stocks, she said.

WANdisco shares rose after the fast-growing software group secured a $10m credit line from HSBC to fund the rapid expansion of its big-data business.

The company had long been expected to raise capital but, unlike many other young technology groups, has tried to avoid tapping investors - preventing the need to give up more equity.

Yesterday it said it had instead secured a $10m facility with HSBC at a rate of 1.2 percentage points above Libor until 2017. This would help its expansion plans and fulfil contracts "in the pipeline".

After initially jumping 10 per cent, the shares pared their gains to close up 2.5 per cent at 442.8p on Aim.

WANdisco has attracted investor interest for its push into "big data", with software than can process huge quantities of information. Since listing on Aim in 2012, it has been rewarded by investors for reporting strong growth in subscriptions. By the start of this year, its market capitalisation had grown sevenfold.

But some analysts have raised doubts about the as-yet-unprofitable company because its move into big data brings higher operating expenses. The shares have fallen 70 per cent from a December peak of about 15.

Its results for 2013 showed bookings rose 86 per cent to $14.8m. But operating losses more than doubled to $7.8m with its employee base growing from 90 to 147. The company said it was committed to a hiring spree.

Asked whether the new credit facility would help to settle investors' nerves, Paul Harrison, chief financial officer, said: "This is significant because it diversifies our finances. There had been a presumption WANdisco was wholly dependent on equity. But this proves that a top-tier bank like HSBC is willing and able to take a look at the company, see the quality of the business with its recurring revenues and lend at investment-grade prices against that."

Dan Howlett, HSBC's UK head of corporate banking, said: "We were sufficiently impressed with the company's growth prospects to make a commitment at investment-grade interest rates."

Roger Phillips, an analyst at Investec, said the deal showed that "a near-term equity capital raise would be a matter of choice, as opposed to necessity. Additionally, both the identity of the lender and terms are impressive."

AIG Posts 13% Profit Gain, Settles Suit

Outgoing American International Group Inc. Chief Executive Robert Benmosche left parting gifts for his successor, delivering strong earnings and settling a large piece of crisis-era litigation.

In the last earnings report overseen by Mr. Benmosche, the New York-based insurer on Monday posted a 13% jump in second-quarter profit, aided by solid results in its core operations and a gain from the last of a series of divestitures prompted by its 2008 government bailout.

Separately, AIG agreed to pay $960 million to settle claims that it misled investors about its financial health from 2006 to 2008, in one of the largest settlements of investor litigation stemming from the financial crisis.

AIG shares retreated 1.4% in midday trade on Tuesday after climbing 2.1% late Monday.

Mr. Benmosche, who took over AIG five years ago this month and restructured the company as it repaid its rescue package, plans to retire Sept. 1. He will be succeeded by Peter Hancock, who runs the company's world-wide property-casualty unit.

The proposed class-action settlement, with plaintiffs including the state of Michigan's pension plan, was disclosed in the insurance conglomerate's second-quarter earnings filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The settlement, subject to federal-court approval, aims to close out more than a half-dozen separate class-action complaints filed in the wake of AIG's near collapse in September 2008.

The plaintiffs allege that AIG made statements in news releases, financial filings and elsewhere that hid from investors the extent of the company's subprime-mortgage exposure.

The proposed pact "is one of the largest ever achieved in the absence of a criminal indictment or an SEC enforcement action," said Robert Hoffman, a partner with Philadelphia-based Barrack, Rodos & Bacine, a lead counsel in the case representing the Michigan pension plan.

An AIG spokesman said: "The resolution of this and other legacy financial-crisis-related matters better enables us to focus on AIG's future."

AIG was previously the plaintiff in several other lawsuits in which the insurer claimed Wall Street firms misled it about the risks of subprime mortgages they sold to AIG. The company has recovered more than $2 billion in settlements from those cases.

The insurer reported net income of $3.07 billion, or $2.10 a share, up from $2.73 billion, or $1.84 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. The latest results included a $1.4 billion gain on the sale of its aircraft-leasing unit to AerCap Holdings NV. Revenue fell 13%, to $16.1 billion.

AIG's operating earnings, which exclude realized capital gains and losses from its investment portfolio and other items considered nonrecurring on a quarterly basis, rose 11%, to $1.83 billion.

The results showed improvement in the property-casualty insurance unit, after a sluggish first quarter that had prompted concern among some analysts and investors that the company's turnaround was stalling. Mr. Hancock has stressed higher pricing and an exit from unprofitable lines of business that in previous years were valued for their top-line growth, while also modernizing the company's computer infrastructure to make better use of data analytics.

While net premiums written, an indicator of future revenue that reflects the value of coverage sold in the quarter, declined 1%, to $9.21 billion, in the quarter, the unit posted pretax operating income of $1.36 billion, up 25% from the year-earlier period. The company cited improvement in underwriting results, which it said was partially offset by a decline in net investment income, including lower returns on alternative investments.

AIG's more globally focused property-casualty business saw a dip in catastrophe losses, as disaster costs world-wide came in lower than the year before. AIG's quarterly catastrophe losses were $139 million versus $316 million a year ago.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Wreck of Cards

622 words

English
(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

A law of political physics is that a regulator will always find something new to justify its existence, whether or not it's needed. Witness the plan by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra) to gather account information each month from America's roughly 4,000 brokerage firms.

Known as the Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System (Cards), this experiment in big data is intended to allow "birds-eye view surveillance," said Finra chief Richard Ketchum in May. "CARDS will allow us to collect and manage data from firms in such a way that we can quickly identify trends and product concentrations that are harmful to investors and take swift, responsive action."

Finra is the "self-regulatory organization" that polices the securities industry. Overseen by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it is considered a state actor by some judges but operates as a private, nonprofit organization of member firms. And those firms, especially small ones, are fretting about new compliance costs and privacy risks.

Finra says it won't require that firms include personally identifiable information such as names and Social Security numbers. But critics worry that details on accounts, assets and trading history -- when combined with other databases -- could reveal identities and might lead to abuse if data end up in the wrong hands.

As for the price tag, Finra plans to produce a cost-benefit analysis with its formal proposal expected in a month or so. If Finra enacts a final rule after a comment period, it will then need the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must also consider costs and benefits.

Additional compliance expenses are daunting for smaller firms already drowning in the Dodd-Frank regulatory tidal wave that is only now cresting. A little more than half of roughly 400 required rule-makings have been completed. And small brokerages are disappearing. Finra says that from 2004 to 2013 its member firms shrank to 4,146 from 5,191. Another wave on the horizon is the SEC's Consolidated Audit Trail. Approved in 2012 as a response to the 2010 flash crash, it will scoop up much of the trading data that Cards aims to collect, but without as much information on particular accounts.

Finra says the ocean of data will help it spot a problem almost in real time, far earlier than if it showed up during a regular examination. For example, officials believe they will be able to more quickly identify classic "pump-and-dump" schemes in which unscrupulous brokers persuade clients to pile into a thinly-traded stock, driving up the price before selling into this artificial demand. Mr. Ketchum says Cards will "revolutionize" regulation as market cops see activity across all firms in the market.

But the financial crisis showed that more data doesn't guarantee that regulators will know what to do with the information, and it's as likely the data flood will overwhelm Finra. Brokers are already obliged to report complaints to Finra, which says it isn't seeing a spike in fraud cases.

Finra's weakness isn't the lack of data but a failure to analyze or act on it. Bernie Madoff falsified his records and likely would have done the same with Cards reports. Finra examiners saw red flags at Allen Stanford's $7 billion Ponzi scheme but failed to act.

A fair suspicion is that Finra wants this data mainly to have it and decide later how to exploit it. This isn't the proper job of a regulator, and Finra's board ought to intervene to shut down this needless foraging of information on 110 million investor accounts.

How Tax Inversions Became the Hottest Trend in M&A; Tax Inversions a Major Driver in Cross-Border Deals

In 2010, a group of lawyers from New York and London took a bike trip through the rolling countryside of southern France, and helped set the wheels in motion on the hottest new trend in mergers and acquisitions.

Part holiday, part corporate off-site meeting, the peloton brought together top tax and merger lawyers from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. Deal making was in the doldrums, but, in tandem, some of the lawyers figured out a plan that could persuade clients to take the brakes off mergers and acquisitions.

Four years later, so-called tax inversions have been a major driver in cross-border deal making, accounting for 66% of proposed U.S. outbound deals this year, according to Thomson Reuters. That is up from just 1% in 2011. Skadden is at the front of the pack, involved in 78% of inversions by deal value since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The premise behind inversions is that companies based in one country can benefit significantly by buying firms in another country where taxes are lower, reducing their overall tax rate. There have been 22 such deals since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters. Most have been in the pharmaceutical industry, where overseas sales generate significant income that can't be brought back to the U.S. without suffering a major tax hit. But there also have been inversion deals in the media, consumer and manufacturing sectors. Some of those deals have collapsed, amid disputes over price and political scrutiny.

After their bike-trip revelation, Skadden started presenting the inversion idea to banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Perella Weinberg Partners, according to people familiar with the matter. Some of Skadden's U.S. partners, including top Washington tax lawyer Paul Oosterhuis, flew to London to attend meetings organized by leading London deal maker Scott Simpson, co-head of the firm's global M&A practice, said people familiar with the matter.

The firm is very familiar with cross-border tax issues. Mr. Oosterhuis has previously testified in front of the Congress about techniques multinational corporations employ to shift taxes overseas, while some of the other lawyers who flew to London had formerly worked for the U.S. government's Internal Revenue Service, said people familiar with the meetings. Mr. Oosterhuis didn't respond to requests for comment.

Banks started pitching to their European clients, positioning inversions as a way to make European companies seem more attractive to U.S. buyers. It took time to catch on.

"I would say that initially the reaction was 'Wow, that's a very cute esoteric point, thanks for showing us but we have a real business to run,'" said one banker.

Now, though, inversions are "on the mind of every executive" said Edward Lemanowicz, a tax partner at law firm Dechert LLP.

Skadden isn't the only advisory firm to benefit from the flurry of inversion deals. Bankers and lawyers across the U.S. and Europe have long known that tax benefits could be achieved through cross-border M&A. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, Latham & Watkins LLP and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP also are significant players when it comes to legal advice. The leading banks for inversions are Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which has an 88% market share by deal size, followed by Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Bank of America Corp.

Skadden has advised on many of the biggest deals so far this year, including U.S. drug firm AbbVie Inc.'s $54 billion acquisition of Ireland's Shire PLC and Pfizer Inc.'s $120 billion failed attempt to buy U.K. rival AstraZeneca PLC.

Skadden, founded in New York in 1948, has its roots in M&A and remains a global deal powerhouse. With over 1,600 attorneys, Skadden is one of the biggest U.S. firms, with more than $2 billion in annual revenue, according to American Lawyer, an industry publication.

Collectively, banks will have made close to $1 billion from fees on inversion deals since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters doesn't track legal fees.

While the inversion trend has gathered pace in recent months, the idea isn't entirely new. In 1993, U.S. cosmetics company Helen of Troy became a subsidiary of a Bermuda-based shell corporation, thereby avoiding U.S. taxes.

In 1996, the U.S. government started to try to restrict the benefits to shareholders of U.S. companies moving abroad in an effort to curtail deals done solely for the purposes of evading U.S. taxes. However, inversions continued, so in 2004 the U.S. introduced more rules to try to ensure that acquisitions that resulted in a U.S. company leaving its tax jurisdiction were for real business purposes and not only to escape the reach of the IRS.

The 2004 rule said that if 80% of a company's shareholders are in the U.S., it would be considered a U.S. corporation for tax purposes. U.S. taxes kick in with just 60% of shareholders in the U.S. if the company doesn't have substantial foreign operations.

However, the impact of these rules was limited. From 2004 to 2007 a strong M&A market gave companies plenty of options to pursue deals. Then the financial crisis hit, and deal making slowed sharply.

Over the past 18 months, though, the deal making tide has turned thanks in part to signs of life in the U.S. economy. Another leading driver of cross-border deals, many of which are inversions, is the large cash stockpiles U.S. companies are hoarding overseas.

Bringing the money home would trigger hefty tax bills. U.S. nonfinancial companies held nearly $950 billion of cash overseas at the end of 2013, according to Moody'sAnalytics.

"This is a huge driver for the surge in M&A this year, particularly cross-border M&A that has been dominating the headlines," said Sriram Prakash, global head of M&A insight at Deloitte LLP.

In total, the value of all U.S. outbound deals last year, including withdrawn deals, hit $152.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. So far in 2014, $349.37 billion worth of U.S. outbound M&A deals have been announced, including withdrawn deals.

Recently, the political cycle has started to turn against inversions. President Barack Obama's administration has grown more vocal about closing the tax loophole that allows companies to do inversions. For some corporate executives, the changing political climate may mean it is now or never for inversions.

"Whenever there's a chance that something could eliminate the transaction there's a bit of rush to do these transactions," said Jason Kaplan, a tax partner at law firm Hogan Lovells. Mr. Kaplan said inversion deals are also creating a "domino effect."

"It's more competitive than ever," he said.

But some advisers say the inversion trend didn't play out in Europe the way they had anticipated. When Skadden first began pitching, the idea was that European companies could gain some power over their U.S. counterparts by offering something they couldn't get elsewhere: lower taxes. Rather than mergers of equals, however, the trend has leaned toward U.S. firms buying out European targets, leading to a sense of attack by some European corporations.

One banker who helped pitch the idea to clients said he originally thought of it as "a whole new angle for European acquirers in the U.S. In fact, it's been a whole new angle for U.S. companies."

Corrections & Amplifications

So-called tax inversions have been a major driver in cross-border deal making, accounting for 66% of proposed U.S. outbound deals this year, according to Thomson Reuters. An earlier version of this article said tax inversions accounted for 66% of announced deals this year. (Aug. 5, 2014)

Goldman Has a Hedge-Fund Rethink --- Bank Dumps Some Less-Profitable Clients as New Capital Rules Take Their Toll

By Justin Baer and Juliet Chung

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is upending the way it does business with hedge funds, jettisoning less-profitable clients and increasing some fees on others as it adapts to new banking rules, people familiar with the matter said.

The bank has told hedge-fund clients that the regulations have forced it to set aside more capital, crimping profits at its prime-brokerage business, which executes and finances the funds' trades.

The changes, which are playing out at many of the world's largest banks, highlight yet another way Wall Street has tried to adapt to the shifting landscape. Banks already have cut proprietary-trading units, sold commodities businesses, shrunk stockpiles of securities used to make markets and scaled back investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds.

Goldman also is pulling the firm's own cash out of its largest internal hedge fund, according to people familiar with the matter, to comply with other new rules limiting how banks invest their money.

Goldman and rivals such as Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG are seeking to offset the impact of stiffer capital requirements while delivering the higher returns their shareholders expect. Prime-brokerage units brought in an estimated $13 billion in revenue for the biggest banks last year.

Many banks are trying to squeeze more out of client relationships and pulling back from business that ties up more capital, including financing trades. Some, in addition to Goldman, have even cut off funds that don't bring in enough profits.

"It's the most dramatic thing to ever happen in the business," said Robert Sloan of S3 Partners, a financial-analytics firm for hedge funds. "It's a total redefinition of what's a good customer."

Goldman is urging funds to take back the cash they hold in their accounts, charging clients more to finance trades and imposing monthly fees more often on fund managers for maintaining untapped credit lines with the bank, the people familiar with the matter said. In some cases, Goldman has stopped serving clients that produce little or no returns for the firm, they said.

In recent months, Goldman's prime-brokerage unit has been contacting hedge-fund clients to inform them that it now evaluates their business based on the return on assets it produces for Goldman, according to people familiar with the matter. Historically, banks had valued their clients primarily on the revenue they brought in.

Similar discussions have been taking place in meetings and phone calls across Wall Street, as big banks come to grips with the new international capital requirements. Hedge-fund executives say each of the banks is adapting to the new rules at its own pace.

Banks such as UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have spoken to clients about the effect of capital rules on their prime-brokerage businesses, according to people familiar with the plans. Some firms, including Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, are charging clients more to finance their trades, other people familiar with the matter said.

"Everything is being rendered explicit," said Charles Winkler, chief operating officer of Hudson Bay Capital Management, a roughly $3 billion hedge-fund firm, referring to banks' expectations of the profitability of client relationships. "In the old days, it was much more squishy."

The steps Goldman and other banks have taken have led some funds to reconsider their relationships on Wall Street, opening the door for smaller prime brokers that are more willing to work with smaller funds.

"There is less room at the inn" at the major banks, said Noel Kimmel, global head of prime services at securities firm Cantor Fitzgerald LP. As a result, Mr. Kimmel said, Cantor has seen an increase in existing client activity, as well as discussions with new hedge-fund clients seeking to start relationships. Yet many clients are willing to keep their accounts with the big banks if it means they still will enjoy other benefits, including opportunities to buy shares in initial public offerings, the people said.

"It's a balancing act," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with ISI Group. "You have a conversation, and maybe there's a way of sharing the higher costs."

Cutting ties with certain hedge funds can help Goldman improve the financial health measures that regulators watch closely. Goldman finance chief Harvey Schwartz last month told analysts the firm undertook a "comprehensive analysis" of its books and "identified opportunities to reduce the balance sheet." The effort helped Goldman increase its ratio of capital to total assets, known as the leverage ratio, to 4.5% from 4.3%, closer to the 5% minimum U.S. regulators have mandated as the minimum by 2018.

In all, Goldman sliced $56 billion of assets during the second quarter, or roughly 6% of its total, Mr. Schwartz said. He said the cuts had only a "de minimis impact on our client franchise and earnings potential" and that the firm's prime-brokerage franchise "feels quite strong."

Banks have allowed hedge funds to keep cash in their prime-brokerage accounts as a convenience for clients. But the cash also adds to banks' total assets, weighing down their leverage ratios.

Goldman and other big banks are pushing to streamline their balance sheets before the end of the third quarter. That is the period the Federal Reserve uses when it runs banks' books through a battery of stress tests that gauge how the banks would perform in a deep recession.

A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.

Simon Segars joined Arm Holdings as its 16th employee at the age of 23. Born in Essex, with degrees in electronic engineering and computer science, he arrived at the UK microchip designer just after it had been spun off from Acorn Computers in 1991. On his first day at work, he was greeted by the sight of his boss soldering a computer together for his use. Since March, he has been chief executive of the technology group that is Britain's largest by market capitalisation. Edited highlights of a video interview with FT.com appear below.

You've talked about how Arm's microprocessors can enable the rise of the Internet of Things. What does that mean to you?

The Internet of Things is really the internet of lots of different things. We're going to be embedding intelligence into everything that moves and a lot of things that don't. Being able to gather and process data from all around us is going to enable us to deal with congested cities, to feed a growing middle class and a growing population. Many of our licensees have already built microcontrollers [which] they're able to sell . . . for tens of cents. You can write an application to control it from your smartphone for basically nothing, and you can get access to as much cloud-based computing as you like for next to nothing - [this] is driving innovation everywhere.

Do you think the advance of computing power will lead to artificial intelligence that will see robots becoming as smart as humans, and, if so, when?

Certainly we're going to see more intelligence in more autonomous equipment. There's a lot of talk about how robots are getting more sophisticated, but the human brain is a really complex thing - I think it will be a very long time before computing power can really replicate what humans can do. That said, computing power has been growing at an exponential rate for a long time, and the thing about exponentials is they look flat for a long time and then suddenly go really steeply up.

Some observers think that Moore's law, being the increase or doubling in computing power approximately every 18 months, is coming to an end. Do you agree?

Transistor scaling is getting harder and harder. We're starting to see the approach of the point where you can't scale silicon any more. So people are looking at different materials and three-dimensional structures - how you integrate not just in two dimensions but in three, to get more and more functionality into a chip and provide more and more performance.

The British computer scientist, Tim Berners-Lee, invented the worldwide web - but the world's biggest internet companies are American. Do you think the British tech sector suffers from a lack of ambition?

I don't think so. I think there are a lot of very smart people in the UK, and we have a long history of engineering and innovation. Now, how they end up being deployed on a global basis remains to be seen, but I think we'll still see a lot of innovation coming out of the UK.

[Is there] growing interest from the business community for industrial applications for wearable tech?

Some. I think that exactly how wearables are going to be useful is a bit unclear. I think there will be a lot of healthcare applications. I think medical devices that can track your vital body measures and provide a much clearer view of your state of health to a medical professional are going to become transformational in dealing with long-term chronic healthcare issues.

City hiring slowdown offset by small business

City hiring remained flat last month but strong recruitment by small and midsized companies helped offset a slowdown at investment banks, a recruiter has reported.

Astbury Marsden said 2,000 job vacancies were created in the City in July, down 8 per cent on June and down 7 per cent on the same period last year.

"It is smaller City firms rather than the big investment banks that are driving hiring activity at the moment," said Adam Jackson, associate director.

"While the cost of meeting regulatory capital requirements has cut sales and trading jobs at the investment banks, it is still the compliance and regulatory roles in which hiring has been most active."

Other than compliance, risk and technology staff, hiring at the investment banks was modest, Mr Jackson said. "High frequency and algorithmic trading firms are especially active, taking on technology and infrastructure staff from the investment banks as the banks wind down their proprietary trading activities."

Astbury Marsden said Bank of England proposals to extend the deferral period for the full payment of bonuses , as well as regulatory and public pressure to reduce their overall size, was likely to make smaller and mid-tier firms more attractive to investment bankers.

Mr Jackson said: "Smaller City firms don't have the same restrictions on remuneration that the large investment banks do. For the bigger firms there is intense scrutiny of the rewards for top staff."

A more buoyant picture emerges from a survey by recruiter Robert Half. It found that 48 per cent of financial services companies planned to hire during the second half of the year, up from 37 per cent over the same period in 2013.

But, 97 per cent of executives said it was difficult to find skilled professionals, with compliance the hardest role to fill, followed by finance, data analytics and risk. In accountancy, 45 per cent of finance directors expected to expand their teams, up from 28 per cent a year ago. Phil Sheridan, senior managing director at Robert Half UK, said: "Skills shortages across the UK economy are becoming a major issue, with this deficit putting businesses at increasing risk. Our figures show that financial services and finance and accounting, in particular, are current and future growth areas, with professionals being highly sought after and commanding premium pay."

Employees at FTSE 100 oil and gas companies cost their employer on average more than twice as much as the big UK-listed banks, ac-cording to Banc De Binary, a binary options trading firm. It said oil and gas companies paid 106,660 a year in salary, pensions and bonuses per employee whereas top banks paid 54,608.

"Banking has the glamorous image of being the best- paid industry but in reality UK-listed banks are doing less and less investment banking and are placing more emphasis on lower retail bankers," said Oren Laurent, the company's founder.

Confidence falls as growth expected to weaken

Business confidence has dipped for the first time in two years, reinforcing expectations of a modest slowdown in growth later this year, a survey has found, writes Brian Groom .

Skills shortages are also becoming a bigger problem as employment continues to grow rapidly, according to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and Grant Thornton.

Their business confidence index, based on interviews with 1,000 chartered accountants across the economy, fell to +32.3 compared with +37.3 in the second quarter - still close to an all-time high.

A separate survey by the CBI employers' group reported strong orders and output growth for small and medium-sized manufacturers in the three months to July.

It found that companies were hiring at their fastest rate since at least 1988, but export orders had underperformed, possibly in part because of the strength of sterling.

The findings follow weaker data over the past week for manufacturing growth, consumer confidence and house prices. Most forecasters, including the Bank of England, expect a slower pace of growth in the second half.

The ICAEW and Grant Thornton said they expected the economy to expand by 0.9 per cent in the third quarter but growth could slow in the final three months. Business investment was also expected to slow.

The survey found that employment was likely to increase by 2.5 per cent over the next year.

LONDON -- The annual rate of inflation in the euro zone fell further below the European Central Bank's target in July, and to its lowest level since October 2009.

The decline is a setback to the ECB which, in June, launched a series of measures designed to boost growth and start to move the inflation rate back toward its goal of just below 2.0%. It is too soon for those measures to have had an impact, but the further drop in the rate at which consumer prices are increasing underlines the severity of the threat confronting policy makers.

Eurostat said consumer prices were just 0.4% higher than in July 2013, as the inflation slowed from 0.5% in June. The inflation rate has now been below 1.0% for 10 straight months.

Figures released by the European Union's statistics agency also showed that the jobless rate fell to 11.5% in June from 11.6% in May, reaching its lowest level since September 2012. The number of people without work fell by 152,000 during June, leaving 18.4 million unemployed.

That was the largest month-to-month decline in the number of jobless since December 2013, and the second-largest since February 2007.

Economists said the decline in the inflation rate is unlikely to prompt an immediate response from the ECB, which has said it may take as much as a year for the measures announced on June 5 to take full effect. The central bank had expected the inflation rate to remain around its June level of 0.5% for some months to come.

"We have to wait and see what will be the use of these measures," said ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio on Saturday. "We won't introduce new measures until we assess [whether] these measures will be as effective as we expected."

Those measures included a cut in the central bank's main interest rates, as well as a new program of cheap, medium-term loans to banks that are intended to boost their funding of businesses.

"The ECB will likely hold interest rates steady and continue to prepare its new long-term loans targeted at boosting banks' business lending," said Tomas Holinka, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

The ECB may take some comfort from the fact that falling energy and food prices were the main reason for the lower inflation rate, while prices for services rose at an unchanged pace, leaving the core inflation rate unchanged at 0.8%.

Low inflation is a particular problem for the euro zone because it makes it more difficult for companies, households and governments in southern Europe to cut their high debts and recover from the currency area's twin banking and fiscal crises.

Figures released on Thursday by Italy's statistics agency showed prices were unchanged from July 2013. Previously released figures showed Spanish consumer prices fell by 0.3% in the 12 months to July, while Germany's rose by 0.8%.

Economists warned that the annual rate of inflation could fall further in August and September as food and energy prices continue to ease, but they expect a gradual pickup thereafter.

There are some signs that after a disappointing second quarter, the euro zone's economy has regained some momentum. A monthly survey by the European Commission published on Wednesday found euro-zone businesses were mostly undaunted by growing tensions between the European Union and Russia over Ukraine's future.

The accelerating decline in unemployment will likely encourage ECB policy makers, since it should boost consumer spending over the coming months, and in turn make it easier for businesses to raise their prices.

Compared with June 2013, the number of people without work is down 783,000. Much of that reduction is due to an improvement in Spain's jobs market, but unemployment has also been falling steadily in Ireland and Portugal, while it has remained low in Germany.

Samsung Mutes Payout Calls

It's easy to see why investors in Samsung Electronics are feeling let down.

The Korean electronics giant left its interim dividend unchanged Thursday, despite earlier promises to boost cash returns. Its shares fell 3.7%

Investors have been calling on the company to return more cash, through buybacks or by raising its paltry 1% dividend yield. Samsung has said repeatedly it would increase shareholder returns as a proportion of free cash flow this year, and promised last quarter to give investors "a bit more information" after second-quarter results.

But Robert Yi, head of investor relations, said Thursday that Samsung hasn't settled yet on a shareholder-return plan. "We need a bit more time to reach a decision," he said on a conference call with analysts.

Technically, the company hasn't violated its pledge to raise returns as a percentage of free cash flow. This metric, which measures the operating cash flow left after capital expenditures, fell 16% in the first half from a year earlier. Executives cited the need to make long-term investments in areas like flexible displays and new memory-chip technologies for their caution on payouts.

The company didn't say so, but its weak earnings could be making it even more cautious about promising too much. Net profit fell 19.6% from a year earlier in the second quarter, due to a glut of unsold phones and intense competition from low-end Chinese manufacturers.

Also left unsaid was what role the company's cash pile may play in plans behind the scenes to restructure the broader Samsung conglomerate. Since Samsung patriarch Lee Kun-hee suffered a heart attack in May, his family members appear to have set in motion an elaborate succession involving a reshuffling of the dozens of companies under the Samsung umbrella. Mr. Lee's heirs also need to raise funds to pay an inheritance-tax bill that could reach billions of dollars.

For Samsung Electronics, this makes share buybacks more likely than dividends. Buybacks in Korea don't extinguish shares, so they would help the family consolidate control of the company by adding to its stock of treasury shares in itself. Dividends would benefit family members little because their direct stake in Samsung Electronics is small.

Investors may have to wait awhile for clarity on restructuring plans. More clues will emerge when Cheil Industries, a key family holding vehicle known until recently as Samsung Everland, lists shares early next year.

Meanwhile, no matter how loudly they ask for payouts, ordinary shareholders in Samsung Electronics are far down on the company's list of priorities.

Risk for Bonds as the Fed's

Reserve Starts Cracking

The Federal Reserve's tone has gotten a bit more hawkish. Judging from what the economy is doing, there may be more to come.

In the statement released Wednesday following its two-day meeting, the Fed offered a less qualified assessment of the improvement in the job market than it did when it met last month. That was before the strong June jobs report came out. And whereas last month the Fed said that inflation was running below its 2% target, it acknowledged this time that inflation has "moved somewhat closer" to it.

Indeed, Wednesday's unexpectedly strong report on second-quarter gross domestic product from the Commerce Department showed that the Fed's preferred inflation measure -- the price index for personal-consumption expenditures -- was up 1.6% from a year ago. The first quarter's gain was just 1.1%. The core measure, which excludes food and energy, was only slightly more muted, gaining 1.5% compared with the first quarter's 1.2%. Moreover, inflation's pace picked up, with prices increasing at a 2% annual rate in the second quarter.

As long as wage growth remains low, though, most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee will likely view a move above 2% inflation as transitory. In their view, as the statement put it, "there remains significant underutilization of labor resources." In plain terms, there is still a lot of slack in the job market.

But the GDP report suggested the economy has strengthened to the point that it should be able to sustain the recent pickup in hiring. And with that, growth in wages may finally get a lift.

GDP expanded at a 4% rate in the second quarter, better than the 3% economists foresaw. Some of that strength came from companies building up inventories, for which there likely will be a payback as these get run down.

But the strong GDP number also owed something to a better tone in consumer spending, which should carry over into the third quarter.

Moreover, revised data showed that over the past three years the personal saving rate, measured as a share of after-tax income, has consistently been higher than what the Commerce Department had previously reported. This implies that household balance sheets are in better shape than was thought.

To that, add Fed figures showing banks stepping up lending, and it looks as if spending will be more strongly supported in the quarters to come. And with companies running lean, any uptick in spending should translate into more jobs.

The upshot is that while economists and interest-rate futures markets see the Fed raising its overnight interest-rate target around the middle of next year, the odds of an earlier move are increasing. For the stock market that may, on balance, be a good thing, with the challenge of higher rates offset by the better growth that brought them on. But the bond market may have trying times ahead.

Overheard

It has gotten a lot more expensive to be too big to fail. A study from Federal Financial Analytics says the quantifiable regulatory costs borne by the six largest U.S. banks have more than doubled since before the financial crisis. The price tag in 2013 was about $70.2 billion, up from $34.7 billion in 2007.

That is counting tightened capital rules, higher deposit-insurance premiums and supervisory assessments as well as interchange-fee restrictions. FFA says other new rules can't be quantified yet.

The bank with the biggest tab: Bank of America, which FFA figures was hit with an extra $8.6 billion in costs and lost profits. The next-largest bill lands at Goldman Sachs, due to its conversion into a bank amid the financial crisis. Surprisingly, J.P. Morgan Chase fares best in FFA's study, saddled with just $4.3 billion in new costs.

FFA doesn't try to quantify the benefits of new regulations. But there is one thing that is certain: They are still far cheaper than the bailout of many of those same big banks during the crisis.

Insurance price falls pose threat to underwriters; INSURANCE

Competitive pressures in large parts of the global insurance industry have become so intense that some underwriters risk failing if prices fall further, the head of the sector's largest broker in Europe has warned.

Steep declines in premium levels are no longer merely the downward part of a "normal cycle", said Dominic Burke, chief executive of London-listed Jardine Lloyd Thompson. "If this continues then we may well have failures."

Mr Burke's warning is among the most outspoken yet about the impact of low prices for some lines of "big ticket" specialist corporate insurance, which have dropped to their lowest levels in more than a decade.

His comments come a day after the insurer Hiscox said it would shrink its reinsurance business as it forecast further downward pressure on premiums, while rival Lloyd's insurer, Beazley, said last week that the market was "one of the most difficult in our history".

Competition levels are especially intense in natural disaster reinsurance, for which the levels of capital that back the cover have risen almost two-thirds since the financial crisis to $555bn, according to Aon Benfield Analytics.

Low interest rates have driven yield-hungry capital market investors to " catastrophe bonds " and a relative absence of natural disasters has also pushed prices down.

Insurers have continued to post bumper profits because of the lack of claims , but Mr Burke cautioned that some underwriters could encounter difficulties when a big disaster does strike.

Historically, the industry would expect to generate returns of between 12 and 15 per cent. But the rate at which policies were now being priced implied some insurers were targeting long-term returns on capital of as low as 4 per cent, he added.

Mike Reynolds, JLT's finance director, raised particular concerns about reinsurers covering the risk of big hurricanes in Florida, where prices have fallen especially steeply.

Shares in JLT closed down 1.8 per cent yesterday at 10.37 after the company said it was "cautious over the outlook for the remainder of the year", citing the strong pound as well as pressure on prices.

The wary outlook came even though JLT, the world's fifth-largest insurance broker by sales, boosted first-half pre-tax profits from 85m a year ago to 98m and increased its dividend by 5 per cent to 10.6p.

Joanna Parsons, analyst at Westhouse, said the intermediary had so far been shielded from the worst of the pressures because it garnered about half its sales from fees, less exposed to the falling insurance prices than commissions. JLT has also been taking market share and was growing in areas including employee benefits business, she added. However, the analyst cut her forecast for the insurance broker's annual pre-tax profits by 6 per cent.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Fidelity warns on China's bad debt; Fund focus

Fund manager says government must act over non-performing loans, writes Bradley Gerrard

Fidelity's top man in Hong Kong, Dale Nicholls, has become the latest fund manager in China to warn about bad debts in the nation's ballooning economy.

Mr Nicholls, who succeeded Anthony Bolton as manager of Fidelity's China Special Situations investment trust in April, says the Chinese government needs to take action on "non-performing" loans.

He says the number of non-performing loans - where loans are either in default or close to default - is rising and the real level of bad debt is likely to be higher than official figures. This fear is holding markets back, he believes.

"The next 12 months will be pretty interesting. The total social-financing figure tries to factor in all lending and, with some of these [non-performing loans] maturing, what we are hoping to see is some of them getting written off.

"What the market needs is progress."

Most global stock markets have produced gains in the past five years, but the Shanghai Composite index has lost 31 per cent in sterling terms over that time, according to data from FE Analytics.

Mr Nicholls says non-performing loans are estimated to account for 1 per cent of assets for most Chinese banks, but he suspects the "true number is north of that".

Since taking the helm, the manager has further reduced its weighting to Chinese financials - largely because of a successful takeover bid for Wing Hang Bank by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation. The deal meant Wing Hang hit Mr Nicholls' valuation target and he divested entirely.

Mr Nicholls has used the proceeds of that sale to add to consumer discretionary plays as well as internet-related stocks, such as Tencent. He is also invested up to the fund's maximum limit for Chinese A-shares, companies listed in mainland stock markets and not Hong Kong.

Elsewhere, Mr Nicholls says he has "ramped up" the use of external companies to verify the corporate governance of businesses the trust is considering investing in.

"We are using third-party resources more," he says. "We have people doing background checks and in many cases asking around and looking for red flags in terms of reputation. We have tried to learn from things that have been issues in the past."

In 2011 Mr Bolton was hit by fraud claims surrounding Sino-Forest , the Chinese timber company, and China Integrated Energy, the energy firm. The Toronto-listed Sino-Forest lost 75 per cent of its share price following the allegations.

Mr Bolton admitted he had underestimated the corporate governance challenge in China but added that he had taken steps to improve his research methods for smaller companies.

At the time, he said: "I knew corporate governance was going to be a challenge but I didn't realise it was that bad. We now do a lot more cross-checking and due diligence."

Mr Bolton was one of the most renowned stockpickers of the 1980s and 1990s while running UK and European equities, and in 2010 he returned from a short retirement to launch the China trust. Following lacklustre returns , he retired again earlier this year, handing over to Mr Nicholls.

Moody's Profit Rises, but Cautious Tone Prevails

Moody's Corp.'s second-quarter earnings climbed 42% and the firm raised its revenue outlook for its analytics and ratings businesses, but executives issued a cautious outlook.

The New York-based firm left its annual earnings targets unchanged at $3.90 to $4 a share. Moody's executives had previously said they expected the second half of 2014 to be stronger than the first six months of the year.

Linda Huber, Moody's chief financial officer, said on the company's earnings call on Friday that second-quarter revenue growth was fueled by structured-finance deals and speculative-grade corporate bonds that have boomed while interest rates are low. But she said it is tough to project that same pace continuing for the rest of the year.

"We had a white-hot second quarter, and we are cautious as we are usually cautious about whether that pace can continue," Ms. Huber said.

Moody's, owner of the second-largest credit rater by revenue, posted earnings of $319.2 million, or $1.48 a share, up from $225.5 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. Revenue improved 16%, to $873.5 million. The consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters predicted earnings of $1.01 a share and revenue of $803 million. Moody's shares hit an all-time high of $95 in intraday trading, before pulling back to close down 86 cents, or 0.9%, to $91.62.

After a slow start to the year, bond issuance has bounced back in recent months. Credit-ratings firms saw their businesses fall off after the financial crisis, but the downtrend has reversed with the return of strong demand for corporate debt and increased bond issuance in emerging markets.

Moody's said it expects full-year revenue to increase in the low double-digit percentages versus a prior forecast in the high single digits. Much of that view is shaped by stronger activity for its ratings business.

Some analysts pointed to several factors explaining why the company's bullish tone on revenue might not boost profits.

In June, Moody's announced two deals: the acquisition of WebEquity Solutions LLC, an analytics firm, and an increase of its equity stake in India-based rater ICRA Ltd. This month, Moody's raised $750 million in debt. The firm is also adding employees in several divisions, increasing 10% to about 9,500 workers, excluding the new acquisitions, Ms. Huber said.

William Bird, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets & Co., pointed to the deal costs, higher employee compensation and the July debt issuance, which subtract about four cents from per-share earnings.

"It appears that revenue upside will be eaten up by higher costs," Mr. Bird said in a Friday note to investors. Moody's executives said they would revisit their full-year outlook at its investor day on Sept. 30. The debt markets, which have gotten off to a slower July after a strong June, have some uncertainties, said Moody's Chief Executive Officer Raymond McDaniel. "What we're seeing from a geopolitical standpoint breeds caution," Mr. McDaniel said.

The company's Moody's Investors Service debt-rating operation, its biggest revenue contributor, posted a 16% increase in revenue, to $621.7 million. The biggest debt-rating segment was global corporate finance, in which revenue rose 22%, to $320.9 million.

Moody's and other credit-ratings firms have also seen an increase in European bond markets, where bank lending has tightened. They are also expanding into emerging markets.

Operating expenses rose 14%, to $461.8 million, compared with the prior-year period. Moody's attributed that increase to higher compensation, deal costs and real-estate expenses tied to more employees.

For the year, Moody's raised its projections on operating expenses to the high-single-digit percentages, up from midsingle digits.

In recent years, the company has seen a higher percentage of its revenue come from its Moody'sAnalytics division, which helps financial institutions manage risk and sells additional research from its ratings analysts.

Much of that unit generates revenue on a recurring or subscription basis, meaning it is less vulnerable to a slowdown in bond issuance. Revenue for the analytics business climbed 15%, to $251.8 million, in the quarter.

The Property Report
New Lenders Enter Market and Think Small --- Loans for Properties Valued at Under $10 Million Are Seen as Less Risky as Economy Improves; 'Starting to Percolate'

A new group of lenders has begun to target properties valued at $10 million and less, and that is good news for mom-and-pop landlords and small-business owners.

Lenders, including ones controlled by asset managers Waterfall Asset Management, Guggenheim Partners LLC and Sabal Financial Group LLC, have launched new programs this year focusing on loans to smaller properties. Many banks and other lenders have been avoiding smaller deals since the financial crisis because they can be riskier than larger properties, and the underwriting costs are high relative to their size.

But now lenders are paying them more attention as the economy improves and loans are seen as less risky. Also, with less competition among lenders for these deals, interest rates and potential profit can be higher.

After sputtering for years, the commercial-property market for small properties is "starting to percolate," said Randy Fuchs, principal of Boxwood Means Inc., a commercial-property analytics firm.

One beneficiary of this trend is BKM Capital Partners, an Irvine, Calif.-based investment company that turned to ReadyCap Commercial LLC for a $4.6 million loan this year to buy Hayden Island Business Park, a Portland, Ore., industrial property. ReadyCap is a unit of Sutherland Asset Management Corp., a real-estate investment trust managed by Waterfall.

Brett Turner, director of acquisitions for BKM, said ReadyCap was able to offer terms that banks wouldn't, such as limiting lender recourse in case of default.

ReadyCap expects to quintuple volume to $1.25 billion by 2016 by making real-estate loans to investors and small businesses under a U.S. Small Business Administration program, said Tom Capasse, chief executive of Sutherland. The loans are "for the small manufacturer in the Midwest or an eight-unit, multifamily owner in Encino who has been left behind," he said.

Lenders made $176 billion in loans of $5 million or less last year, a 75% rise from 2010, Boxwood said. The pace has slowed to $36 billion in the first three months of this year, but some of the newer entrants expect volume will increase as they address pockets that haven't been able to meet still-tight bank-lending guidelines.

While large deals involving trophy properties get most of the headlines, many real-estate markets depend just as much on debt financing being available for the buying, selling and refinancing of stand-alone doctor offices and restaurants, and cheaper apartment complexes. Loans on small or less-expensive properties represent about 15% of the $3.2 trillion in commercial-real-estate debt outstanding, according to Mr. Capasse's estimates.

Partly because debt financing has been tight, prices of small commercial properties as of April have climbed 7% from their low in January 2012, according to a Boxwood Means index. In comparison, prices for larger properties have gained more than 27% in the same period and 54% from their bottom two years earlier, according to the Moody's/RCA Core Commercial Property Price Index, which covers transactions averaging $22 million.

Before the financial crisis, most loans to smaller properties were made by commercial banks that held the loans or lenders that packaged the loans into securities that were sold to investors. Commercial banks have been ramping up lending since 2010 but have been mindful of stiffer regulations.

Lenders not overseen by bank regulators, such as ReadyCap and Guggenheim, also are returning to smaller loans.

Before 2008, at least a dozen nonbank lenders funded some $26 billion of commercial real-estate debt to small properties by selling asset-backed securities. The asset-backed market for newly originated, smaller commercial real-estate loans has been frozen since the crisis, but will likely be revived with a bond backed by ReadyCap loans in coming months, Mr. Capasse said.

Meanwhile, lenders such as Guggenheim and Wells Fargo & Co., which have focused on larger and more standardized loans for commercial mortgage-backed securities, have made a push into smaller properties. Wells Fargo, which started a program for $1 million to $10 million loans in 2011, said its volume has increased, while Guggenheim launched a similar effort this month.

In the market for larger loans, lenders are taking profits of less than 1% to win deals, down from 2% or 3% two years ago, said Chris Haynes, president of Broadacre Financial, a commercial real-estate finance adviser. Smaller loans can still produce more than 2% profit, though lenders must close more in a short period to make them worthwhile, Mr. Haynes said.

A company that refers to its collection of assets as a "Federation" is not keen on breaking up. So a showdown between computer storage stalwart EMC and Elliott Management looms. Elliott has amassed a $1bn stake in EMC (2 per cent of the shares). It hopes to convince EMC to separate its fast growing subsidiary, VMware. EMC has a market value of $57bn; $32bn of that stems from its 80 per cent ownership of VMware, the biggest player in "server virtualisation," which allows many programs to run on a single computer.

VMware was listed in 2007 to unlock value. But EMC maintains that, despite the separate listing, EMC and VMware (and a new Big Data subsidiary, Pivotal) are an integrated product set. While VMware's explosive growth has led its shares up 75 per cent since its IPO, they are up only 5 per cent in the past two years. That gives EMC the window to buy out the portion of VMware the public owns.

EMC, like big entrenched technology vendors such as IBM and Cisco, has two problems. First, with their already large client bases, these companies grow at roughly the rate of total corporate IT spending - less than 5 per cent. Since the financial crisis, those budgets have not fully recovered. The second challenge is that new software is coming to market that decreases the need for hardware. EMC's core storage unit is expected to grow just 2 per cent in 2014, according to Credit Suisse.

It would cost $8bn for EMC to buy out the public stub of VMware (not including any premium). It could do so using its cash position of $8bn, along with its shares. The risk with Elliott's spin-off idea is that EMC and VMware would lose the benefit of shared arrangements in sales, marketing and other areas. A buyout of VMware would prove how valuable EMC's board thinks those arrangements are.

The pace has slowed to $36 billion in the first three months of this year, but some of the newer entrants expect volume will increase as they address pockets that haven't been able to meet still-tight bank-lending guidelines.

While large deals involving trophy properties get most of the headlines, many real-estate markets depend just as much on debt financing being available for the buying, selling and refinancing of stand-alone doctor offices and restaurants, and cheaper apartment complexes. Loans on small or less expensive properties represent about 15% of the $3.2 trillion in commercial real-estate debt outstanding, according to Mr. Capasse's estimates.

Partly because debt financing has been tight, prices of small commercial properties as of April have climbed 7% from their low in January 2012, according to a Boxwood Means index. In comparison, prices for larger properties have gained more than 27% in the same period and 54% from their bottom two years earlier, according to the Moody's/RCA Core Commercial Property Price Index, which covers transactions averaging $22 million.

Before the financial crisis, most loans to smaller properties were made by commercial banks that held the loans or lenders that packaged the loans into securities that were sold to investors. Commercial banks have been ramping up lending since 2010 but have been mindful of stiffer regulations.

Lenders not overseen by bank regulators, such as ReadyCap and Guggenheim, also are returning to smaller loans. Before 2008, at least a dozen nonbank lenders funded some $26 billion of commercial real-estate debt to small properties by selling asset-backed securities, which typically contained riskier and more customized loans than traditional commercial mortgage bonds. The asset-backed market for newly originated, smaller commercial real-estate loans has been frozen since the crisis, but will likely be revived with a bond backed by ReadyCap loans in coming months, said Mr. Capasse.

Meanwhile, lenders such as Guggenheim and Wells Fargo & Co., which have focused on larger and more standardized loans for commercial mortgage-backed securities, have made a push into smaller properties. Wells Fargo, which started a program for $1 million to $10 million loans in 2011, said its volume has increased, while Guggenheim launched a similar effort this month.

Freedom Mortgage Corp., a residential lender in Mount Laurel, N.J., last year launched a lending division for commercial mortgage-bond loans up to $10 million.

In the market for larger loans, lenders are taking profits of less than 1% to win deals, down from 2% or 3% two years ago, said Chris Haynes, president of Broadacre Financial, a commercial real-estate finance adviser. Smaller loans can still produce more than 2% profit, though lenders must close more in a short period to make them worthwhile, Mr. Haynes said.

News analysis

New chief faces fresh challenges at helm of the world's biggest insurer, says Tracy Alloway

On the surface, Peter Hancock, the incoming chief executive of the bailed-out mega-insurer AIG, could not be more different from his predecessor, Bob Benmosche.

Where Mr Benmosche is known for his blunt opinions on everything from financial regulation to bathroom fixtures , Mr Hancock has built a reputation as a cerebral thinker with a tendency to choose his words far more carefully.

"We're different people with different ways of thinking . . . but we're much more aligned than perhaps our language would suggest," Mr Hancock, 56, says in his first interview since being named CEO. "We use different words to describe the same thing."

Exceedingly polite, perhaps the worst that could be said about the British-born Mr Hancock is that he has a tendency for "out-there" ideas that sometimes grow to take on a life of their own.

Before joining AIG he was best known for leading the JPMorgan team that invented credit default swaps , the same financial product that caused AIG's near-collapse in 2008.

AIG ended up with a book of derivatives valued at $2.5tn at its height, including $50bn of insurance-like swaps that promised huge payouts to banks and investors should bonds backed by mortgages default.

What followed was chaos: an infusion of $182bn in taxpayer funds in one of the most reviled government rescues of the crisis and a quick succession of CEOs until Mr Benmosche was recruited from MetLife in 2009. The following year Mr Benmosche chose Mr Hancock to help him wind down AIG's remaining portfolio of swaps, and then promoted him to run the company's property-casualty unit soon after.

"In the 95-year history of the company I will be, I think, the seventh CEO, and the first one with a peaceful transition," Mr Hancock says. "This is a continuity decision by the board, which means that there won't be a radical change of direction as a result of the shift."

While Mr Hancock rejects the notion of a complete corporate overhaul, he is tinkering at the edges of AIG's business in typically inventive style.

Much of the post-crisis work has been done by Mr Benmosche, who led the company to its unlikely recovery to repay the bailout - with $25bn of profit for taxpayers.

Yet Mr Hancock faces fresh challenges at the helm of the world's biggest insurer - beyond the obvious but daunting task of managing a company with more than 60,000 employees and boosting the amount of money AIG can make from pricing complex risks in everything from earthquakes to cyber attacks .

For a start, AIG must contend with new oversight from the Federal Reserve after being designated a "systemically important financial institution". The rules mean the insurer is subject to heightened scrutiny of its operations and corporate governance.

Or, as Mr Hancock puts it: "It's meant that the -Federal Reserve, whom we've known well in the past as a creditor, we now have come to know well as a regulator."

When it comes to creative ideas for the company Mr Hancock talks fervently of the opportunities provided by "big data" - the reams of information being produced by an increasingly digitised world.

He will soon hire a new chief technology officer to join a science officer already in place. AIG has a team of more than 130 scientists and technicians who are studying everything from work flow processes in hospitals to road safety in China.

Mr Hancock says the results of this scientific foray come "in the form of advice to our customers, or in the form of giving them price discounts on less risky behaviour".

Famous for breaking down business silo while at JPMorgan, Mr Hancock has already sought to replicate this approach at AIG - combining geographicallydiverse business units in the property-casualty business into single profitreporting entities in an effort to encourage collaboration and the more efficient sharing of risk.

He also plans a company-wide rollout of the concept of risk-adjusted profitability - an accounting approach he introduced in the property-casualty unit to try to better reflect the company's financial health than -conventional "GAAP" -standards. Mr Hancock, a former pilot in the RAF University Air Squadron, appears determined to make the most of what he sees as a lingering post-crisis tailwind.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Legg Mason sees value in Europe; Fund focus

Paul Ehrlichman looks past all the negativity to find opportunities, writes Philip Scott

Legg Mason's Paul Ehrlichman is targeting the sectors and regions that are causing the greatest investor unrest, with Europe presently top of his hit list.

Mr Ehrlichman is a Legg Mason stalwart who spent 18 years at the company's Brandywine business, latterly as chief investment officer, before launching the Global Currents Investment Management unit in 2008.

In 2010 Global Currents was moved within Legg Mason's heavyweight ClearBridge business, which runs $94.8bn largely in equity funds, and Mr Ehrlichman isnowheadof ClearBridge's global value equity team.

The team runs $2.5bn, mostly in US-based assets, and offers the Dublin-domiciled Legg Mason ClearBridge Global Equity fund across Europe.

The team also runs the 29m UK-based Legg Mason Global Equity Income fund, which is significantly overweight in continental European shares. Some 40 per cent of the portfolio - compared to a benchmark weighting of 18 per cent - is invested in the region.

The UK represents Mr Ehrlichman's second-biggest regional allocation in the fund but accounts for just 14 per cent in comparison, while a mere 10 per cent is invested in the US.

"Where there is the greatest uncertainty is where we tend to be moving towards. We buy cyclically stressed assets but we buy the highest quality," he says.

While Europe's economy only managed to muster feeble economic growth of 0.2 per cent in the first quarter, he argues the subsequent negativity has been overdone. "We believe a strong possibility exists for earnings to improve given the stability that has developed as the region climbed out of recession in 2013.

"The last quarter was about consolidation and correction, and we believe there is way too much pessimism in terms of growth in the coming years."

Mr Ehrlichman cites automobiles and construction as two such embattled sectors, with German auto firm Daimler, "the poor sister to BMW", an example of the former. "BMW and Audi are still far more expensive and Daimler has been the laggard, but it has a strong domestic demand and it has improved its market share."

Elsewhere, he is finding opportunities in real estate and construction in southern Europe. "We hold some Spanish real estate investment trust including Hispania Activos Inmobiliarios , which invests in cash flow generating assets primarily in residential properties, offices and hotels."

When it comes to companies with the potential to increase their dividend payouts, Mr Ehrlichman highlights the energy sector, where, for example, he counts France's GDF Suez among his top holdings.

Beyond Europe, he believes Japan represents a big opportunity in terms of dividends. "Japan has the best dividend growth in the world right now," he says. "We had been underweight until very recently, but are now neutral."

Legg Mason Global Equity Income has delivered a 16 per cent return versus an IMA Global Equity Income sector average of 8 per cent in the past 12 months. In the past three years it has returned 37 per cent, outperforming the peer group mean by 8 percentage points, according to data from FE Analytics.

Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Shares Edge Lower

MARKETS AT A GLANCE

(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)

SNAPSHOT

U.S. stocks declined, but finished well off session lows, in a data-light session as investors displayed caution after Friday's rally. Treasurys finished mixed, with longer-dated bonds getting a boost from geopolitical tensions. The British pound slipped on downbeat U.K. data, while the dollar held steady against the yen and euro. U.S. oil prices ended near a three-week high on supply woes. Gold prices rose on tensions surrounding the downed Malaysian plane in Ukraine.

OPENING CALL

As Japanese investors return to markets Tuesday following a holiday, they'll face a raft of data starting with the All Industry Activity Index for May, which is seen rising modestly after a 4.3% decline in April. Meanwhile, the New Zealand and Australian foreign-exchange markets "will follow central bankers' leads" Tuesday, says ANZ Bank. An annual address by RBA Governor Stevens and a speech on prudential policy by RBNZ Deputy Governor Spencer "both have potential to upset the equilibrium," the firm says.

EQUITIES

U.S. stocks declined as investors hit the pause button after Friday's sharp gains.

Traders said that investors were taking stock after the previous sessions rally, rather than selling on fundamental worries about military action in Ukraine or the Middle East. Both the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 rose last week, underscoring the stock market's resilience in the face of rising geopolitical tensions.

"The buying was very ferocious on Friday," said Jeff Yu, head of single-stock derivatives trading at UBS. "A lot of this is giveback."

A handful of negative headlines weighed on consumer stocks. McDonald's fell 1.5% and Yum Brands 4.3% after the fast-food chains suspended purchases in China, on allegations a meat supplier sold expired chicken and beef to restaurants. McDonald's reports earnings on Tuesday before the market's open.

Toy maker Hasbro and theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment declined 2.7% and 4.1%, respectively, after missing analyst forecasts for second-quarter sales.

Small shares were hit as well, with the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks down 0.4%.

Broadly, though, U.S. stocks have been notably stable in recent sessions. Shares have been boosted by improving economic data, an accommodative Federal Reserve and persistently low interest rates.

"Investors want stocks, and they're using any kind of slight selloff as a reason to increase their exposure," said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist with S&P Capital IQ. His clients are saying, "Where else do I go?" he said.

Much of the week's attention among investors is expected to turn to second-quarter earnings. Many investors say the current earnings season will be a key factor that determines whether recent stock-market gains can continue. Twelve Dow industrials components and 146 S&P 500 companies are set to post earnings this week, including Apple, Microsoft and Ford Motor.

"This is peak earnings season week," said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management. "I'm expecting continued good news. My expectation is that we're going to handily beat consensus earnings."

Among other stock movers, shares of EMC rose 5%. The hedge fund Elliott Capital Management has taken a more than $1 billion stake in the data-storage company and is planning to push for a breakup of the company, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Allergan outlined plans to cut 13% of its workforce, part of a restructuring plan intended to save $475 million next year as the Botox maker continues to try to stave off Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Allergan shares gained 2.2%.

In Asian trading Monday, Australian stocks closed at a six-year high and Indonesian stocks made gains ahead of the results of the Indonesia election. In China, stocks edged lower. Japan's Nikkei was closed for a public holiday.

FOREX

The British pound edged lower against the dollar on negative economic data in the U.K., slowly pulling back from almost six-year-highs versus the U.S. currency, on a day where investors mostly remained on the sidelines warily regarding geopolitical tensions in eastern Ukraine and Gaza.

The pound slid against the dollar after the U.K. recorded its first drop in consumer confidence in 2014 and, in a separate report, British home prices fell.

"The U.K. saw its first decline in consumer morale this year; that's dragging down sterling a tad," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union. "The U.K. has seen more mixed data, of late. It hasn't added materially for the case for an earlier rate hike by [Bank of England]."

Investors made few large bets during the Americas session as an absence of economic indicators on the day shifted their attention to the investigation of the downed Malaysia Airlines passenger jet in eastern Ukraine, as well as to developments in Israel's ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.

Investors searched for any signals that geopolitical risks were spreading and would eventually lead to a slowing of global growth. They mostly avoided equities and other risky assets, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.

The greenback was flat versus the yen, while the euro traded steady against the dollar.

BONDS

U.S. Treasury prices ended mixed, as shorter-dated notes slipped and longer-dated bonds got a boost from investors cautious about geopolitical risks.

The bond market rallied last week as a Malaysia Airlines jetliner was shot down in Ukraine and Israel launched an offensive at Gaza. Investors and analysts said the geopolitical flare-ups for the moment won't post a big threat to the world's economic growth, but they are keeping an eye on the developments for possible contagions.

"Geopolitical tensions are still driving the Treasury market higher in price...as bombs drop and clashes continue in Gaza," said Tom di Galoma, head of fixed income rates in New York at ED & F Man Capital Markets.

COMMODITIES

U.S. oil futures rose to their highest level in nearly three weeks on expectations that domestic refineries would continue to run at high rates, reducing U.S. oil supplies. Brent, the global oil benchmark, also ended higher.

The price gap between the two benchmark contracts narrowed to its lowest level in months.

U.S. oil supplies have fallen for three straight weeks. Stockpiles typically shrink at this time of year as refineries process more oil into gasoline and other fuels to meet summer-driving demand.

"I think we're reacting to a couple weeks of draws on crude in the U.S., which has been supportive to (the U.S. benchmark contract) in comparison to Brent," said Richard Soultanian, co-president of NUS Consulting Group.

Gold prices rose, as the U.S. intensified its allegations about Russia's possible involvement in the downing of a Malaysian jetliner over Ukraine while European leaders threatened broad new sanctions against Moscow.

Prices for gold have also been lifted by the ongoing conflict in Gaza, as Israel's ground forces waded into the region for the first time in nearly two weeks of fighting, sending casualties higher.

S&P Reshuffles CMBS Ratings Group; Group Has Struggled to Restore Investor Trust Since 2011

The head of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' commercial mortgage-backed securities rating group, which has struggled to restore investor trust after a mishandled 2011 rating, is moving to a senior position in Australia while about one-third of the group was dismissed, according to people familiar with the matter.

Peter Eastham, an Australian national who moved from an S&P position in Melbourne to lead the New York-based CMBS team in February 2012, will return home with the move, these people said. Mr. Eastham took over from Barbara Duka, who oversaw S&P's CMBS ratings group in July 2011 when it took the unprecedented step of pulling a preliminary rating on a $1.5 billion issue at the 11th hour.

Other officials overseeing ratings of commercial real estate deals who were let go include Kurt Pollem, Barbara Hoeltz and analyst Brian Snow, according to people familiar with the matter. In total, 16 people were dismissed Friday, about one-third of the CMBS team, these people said.

In a statement, S&P spokesman Ed Sweeney said the company "is realigning its U.S. CMBS team to increase its resources around the country and better leverage its staff on the ground" in Boston, Dallas, Denver and San Francisco. That move includes a reduction in New York-based analysts, Mr. Sweeney said.

The reorganization includes merging S&P's CMBS ratings team with its analytics division, which monitors the performance of a bond over time. The move will "better position us to analyze the financial life cycle of the assets as debt matures and are replaced by new loans," Mr. Sweeney said.

The combined group will be led by Jim Digney and Deegant Pandya, who will serve as S&P's CMBS analytic managers, Mr. Sweeney said.

S&P, which is owned by McGraw Hill Financial Inc., long held a dominant position in grading commercial mortgage-backed securities along with rival, Moody's Investors Service. That started to change after the July 2011 mishap, a move that angered investors and the deal's issuers, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. After that ordeal, S&P shook up senior management and changed their ratings methodology.

The leadership changes come on the day trade publication Commercial Mortgage Alert released U.S. market-share data for the first half of 2014, showing that S&P had slipped one notch to fifth place in the CMBS ratings market, losing the No. 4 ranking to DBRS Inc., a smaller competitor.

The top three firms were Moody's, Fitch Ratings and Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc., according to CMA. Commercial real estate deals are often rated by multiple firms, and market share is measured by the total dollar value of the deals that one company is involved in.

S&P's market share fell to 33.9%, rating 21 of 56 total U.S. deals in the first half of 2014, valued at around $13.7 billion, according to CMA. That's a decline from the 52.4% share rating 31 of 61 deals, valued at around $23 billion it held in the first six months of 2013, according to CMA.

The total U.S. issuance for CMBS deals was $40.6 billion for the first six months of 2014 versus $43.9 billion for the same time period in the prior year, CMA said.

S&P has seen some shifts among the top ranks of its ratings units in recent months. Sharif Mahdavian, who had led the U.S. residential mortgage-bond ratings, was moved into a housing research role, industry newsletter Asset-Backed Alert reported last month.

That was followed by the departure earlier this month by Steve Murphy, S&P's national head of public finance, who retired.

MANSION --- Jumbo Jungle: Borrowers in No Rush to Change --- Demand for refinancing may be beginning to dry up among high-end homeowners, thanks to low incentives and shifting rates

By Daniel J. Goldstein

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

The refinancing boom in the jumbo market appears to be winding down. The share of jumbo-loan refinances during the first part of 2014 plunged to its lowest level in almost a year, according to mortgage data and analytics company Black Knight Financial Services.

In April, about 5.8% of refinances were jumbos, Black Knight says, down from a two-year peak of close to 9% in December.

The steep drop in jumbo refinancing comes as the overall demand for refinanced mortgages has fallen amid higher interest rates. (Jumbo mortgages exceed $417,000 in most markets, and are more than $625,500 in some expensive markets such as New York.)

From January 2012 to January of this year, jumbo refinancing was a hot market, going from just under 4% of refinance originations to 8.86%, according to Black Knight data, thanks to low rates, improved jumbo-mortgage credit and a surge in home prices, says Kostya Gradushy, Black Knight's manager of research and analytics.

Home prices nationally rose 25% between January 2012 and April of this year, according to the 20-city S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. "The rebound in home prices facilitated long-delayed move-up purchases and cash-out refinancing," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.

In addition, during those two years, many of the best-qualified jumbo borrowers who had interest-only mortgages opted to refinance at low rates to avoid having the loan reset to a higher payment.

Traditionally, jumbo mortgages had higher rates than conforming loans. This led some refinance borrowers to pay down their loan balance so they could qualify for a conforming mortgage with a lower interest rate.

But since this past fall, the difference between jumbo and conforming mortgage rates has either narrowed or disappeared, removing the "incentive to refinance as soon as the borrower's balance gets below the conforming threshold," says Bankrate's Mr. McBride. For example, the rate in April for a jumbo refinance on average was 4%, compared with a conforming refinance at 4.4%, according to Black Knight.

Qualifying for a jumbo refinance may still be difficult for less-qualified borrowers. Some borrowers who might have easily obtained loans in years past find themselves out of step with today's stricter underwriting standards, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a Riverdale, N.J.-based company that tracks mortgage rates.

For Darren Ferlisi, a loan officer with Integrity Home Mortgage Corp. in Frederick, Md., the phone calls from all borrowers seeking refinancing has slowed to a trickle. "Last year I had a few, but many borrowers are content with having rates and payments low due to the adjusted rates being so low," he said.

Black Knight's data also bears this out. Prepayment rates, which generally indicate the strength of the refinancing market, fell to less than 1% of outstanding loans in February, the lowest since 2008 and down from close to 2.5% a month during the height of the 2005 boom. "It definitely seems like borrowers were aware of their loans readjusting and refinanced to take advantage of the lower rates," said Mr. Gradushy. "The pool of borrowers who are looking to refinance is not as big as it was before."

Here are some factors to consider for borrowers looking at refinancing jumbo mortgages.

-- Houses as ATMs again? The slowdown in refinancing could pick back up if housing prices increase their rate of acceleration, says Bankrate's Mr. McBride. "We've only seen the end of people using the home as an ATM because they didn't have the equity to do so," he said.

-- ARMs leading refis? Mortgages that originated in 2008 and 2009 show the highest rates of prepayment, Mr. Gradushy said, indicating that borrowers of 5-year and 7-year adjustable rate mortgages are refinancing just as the mortgage resets.

Mining industry digs the 'internet of things'

Cutting edge technology is helping to rein in costs and improve productivity, writes James Wilson

Just 0.5km below ground at Chelopech in Bulgaria, a hard-hatted miner jabs his finger at one of the most useful tools aboard his vehicle: a tablet computer.

Nikolay Hristov, general manager of Chelopech, says producing gold and copper here has become more efficient since Dundee Precious Metals, the owner of the mine, installed 45km of fibreoptic cable to build an underground WiFi network.

"It is the next generation of underground mining. It lets us go to the next level of planning and scheduling and drilling activities that need to happen - and the next level of progress and monitoring those tasks," Mr Hristov says, showing how miners using tablets can feed data between the face and a control room on the surface. "It is like taking the lid off the mine and having a complete look at what is going on."

Chelopech's network is one example of how the mining industry is starting to appreciate the benefits that the " internet of things " can bring to the age-old business of scratching minerals out of the ground.

"The internet of things is now in mining too," says Mike Elliott, of EY in Australia. "These were dumb bits of equipment 10 years ago. If the computer in the office fell over, who cared? Now underground mines are full of optical fibre and bits of equipment that talk to each other."

Miners' interest in joining the data dots and connecting their operations comes as the expansionary ambitions of the commodities supercycle have given way to a focus on reining in costs and improving productivity. Easy steps in terms of cost-cutting - laying off staff and contractors and cutting budgets for exploration - have been taken. Now miners are having to work harder to find additional gains.

Grant McCabe, team leader for "next generation mining" at BCG, says: "There is enormous slack in many mining systems. The industry has not been run with manufacturing discipline. Companies know they have to run a lot more productively."

They must also overcome an industry trend of falling ore grades, forcing them to extract and process more waste to recover the metals and minerals they seek. They are having to do all this in more complex locations.

Rachael Bartels, head of the global mining practice at Accenture, says: "They really need to work out how to get more from less."

In some mines, achieving more from less via technology means using unmanned vehicles to run efficiently at low cost. Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton use autonomous trucks in Australian iron ore mines and Rio is investing in driverless trains. Drones - unmanned aerial vehicles - are also starting to be used.

But smarter mining also means using technology to produce data that help miners measure their performance and adjust where they fall short.

"It is not just having automated trucks - it is the degree to which you are creating a connected worker and a connected asset," says Ms Bartels.

Mr Elliott says: "The most substantial contribution to mine productivity may be the ability to deal with big data around the operation - analyse it, process it and react quickly enough to make a difference."

At Chelopech, the reading of data from operations means problems that used to take one or two shifts to solve can be addressed in a fraction of the time.

Or consider the million or so holes that Rio drills each year for blasting in its iron ore mines in Australia. John McGagh, the company's head of innovation, says sensors in drill holes provide "insanely valuable data" that can help Rio understand its ore much more quickly and precisely.

Drilling for samples has always been the way miners have understood the rock they work with - but now "technology allows them to understand the resource in a much more sophisticated way", says Mr McCabe.

At BHP BillitonMike Henry, president for health, safety, marketing and technology, says "downhole" assay (analysis of a metal or ore) techniques being developed are improving the understanding of a mine's geology. "In the old days you'd drill the core, send it away and results would take months to come back," he says. "This allows us to optimise mine planning and increase efficiency."

Ms Bartels says better data on what material is emerging from a mine can also make miners' marketing more effective - an often under-appreciated part of their business. "You can optimise your output from pit to port and beyond," she says.

The technology and data drive is being supported by the industry's new generation of chief executives.

Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American, who has accused miners of lagging decades behind other heavy industries in its processes, says the mining industry is "on the brink of enabling a step change".

Ms Bartels says there are still questions about the degree to which miners can industrialise and integrate. "Most have good pilot projects but moving it beyond pilot stage and rolling it out across the entire organisation is difficult."

Peace under fire from Experian investors; SUPPORT SERVICES

Chairman lands in another shareholder tussle, write Andy Sharman and David Oakley

Sir John Peace is doing a good job of defying his surname.

The serial chairman - a graduate of Sandhurst military academy and a former High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire - is fast making a habit of facing down shareholder rebellions after enduring a bloody annual general meeting season.

First, in May, more than 40 per cent of shareholders in Standard Chartered - which he chairs - voted against the bank's new pay structure . Then, last week, investors in Burberry - also chaired by the City grandee - voted against share awards worth about 20m granted to Christopher Bailey before he took over from Angela Ahrendts as chief executive.

The hostilities look set to resume today as Sir John hosts shareholders of Experian, the FTSE 100 data analytics group, at an annual meeting in the Georgian surrounds of the Merrion Hotel in Dublin.

The Institute of Directors yesterday added its voice to those criticising the appointment of Don Robert, current chief executive, as a replacement for Sir John as chairman. The promotion runs counter to corporate governance guidelines.

"A desire to maintain continuity should not come at the expense of the board's ability to exercise independent oversight," says Oliver Parry, the IoD's corporate governance adviser.

Previously, the Investment Management Association, whose members oversee 4.5tn of assets, and investor advisory group Pirc had expressed concerns over the succession, as well as the level of pay.

Some investors share these fears. One Top 20 shareholder in Experian says: "A chairman who has moved from chief executive will obviously have preconceived ideas that may not benefit investors, whether that is on pay or wider strategy."

Experian, Burberry and StanChart are not the only companies to have faced shareholder discontent. Barclays, AstraZeneca, Pearson (which owns the Financial Times), WPP and HSBC have suffered revolts amid renewed investor agitation .

But concern over Experian's board reshuffle, which is nonetheless expected to be ratified at the annual meeting, has sharpened focus on Sir John and renewed a familiar accusation: that he holds too many jobs.

Despite stepping down at Experian, he remains chairman at Burberry and StanChart - both FTSE 100 companies. He also has a community role as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire.

While the 2003 Combined Code on corporate governance advised against individuals holding more than one chairmanship, the Financial Reporting Council's current guidelines do not proscribe multiple chairmanships.

The code does, however, say that company boards should not agree to executives taking on more than one non-executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company, "nor the chairmanship of such a company", hinting at the time commitment required.

David Styles, the FRC's director of corporate governance, says that the chairmanship of a FTSE 100 bank is a "demanding post" that could "extend to a full-time position".

Sir John, 65, describes himself as a "workaholic" at the helm of three "successful businesses". He admits the trio of chairmanships is rare, but says it was prompted by a "very unusual set of circumstances". He was founder of the GUS division that went on to become Experian - which he also ran as chief executive - and joined Burberry to lead its flotation in 2002.

"In terms of my time commitment, I would be surprised if you found any one of them say I don't give the right amount," he says.

But some shareholders disagree. One Top 25 investor at Burberry says: "As an investor, it is better to have a chairman who is solely concentrating on one company. Sir John arguably has too many fingers in too many pies."

A Top 10 investor at StanChart adds: "There have been issues over pay and performance at the bank and Sir John seems to have taken his eye off the ball. Is that because he has taken on too much? That is a possibility." Sir John divides opinion at StanChart. While he has the support of some big British institutional investors, who turn to him as an establishment figure, critics have privately expressed frustration at his low-key approach.

Other modern bank chairmen, including Sir Philip Hampton at Royal Bank of Scotland and Douglas Flint of HSBC, treat their roles as full-time jobs.

The fear is that Sir John's hands-off approach has led to corporate governance and policies that run counter to the trends in modern British banking. The StanChart pay report, for instance, proposed single-year targets for a larger proportion of executives' variable pay, when other UK banks are taking a longer-term view of performance.

StanChart says Sir John does not have a fixed time commitment as chairman, although it is "comfortable that he spends as much time as the role needs".

He attended 50 board and committee meetings last year and sits on the governance, nomination and regulatory compliance committees - although, notably, not the remuneration committee.

"If you measure the contribution I make as chairman by the number of board and committee meetings I attend . . . I would be surprised if that was the only measure," he says.

"We must be very careful as a country not to take on a box-ticking mentality."

Tech
Financing Would Give Game Startup $3 Billion Valuation; Machine Zone Gets Pricey Looks for Multiplayer Game With Translator

A little-known game developer called Machine Zone Inc. is on the verge of raising a round of financing that would catapult it into the ranks of the most valuable start-ups in the world.

The developer of "Game of War: Fire Age," a popular mobile game with a built-in language translator, is in advanced talks with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. about raising funding at a valuation of more than $3 billion, according to people familiar with the negotiations. It was unclear how much money the company is trying to raise.

It got its start in 2008 as a developer of a dating app, but co-founders, led by Chief Executive Gabriel Leydon, shifted their focus to making strategy games for smartphones and changed the company's name to Machine Zone in 2012.

Launched a year ago, "Game of War" is a new twist on the genre of massively-multiplayer online games, such as Activision Blizzard Inc.'s "World of Warcraft," that bring together millions of players to go on collaborative quests or battle each other in a shared virtual world.

One of the unique attributes of "Game of War" is its built-in language translator that lets gamers of different nationalities interact in the same online universe. Whereas most online multiplayer games group together gamers in the same region, "Game of War" lets playerswhether in Brazil, Singapore or New Zealand share in the same quests and battles.

"This is what my goal is, to network the entire world together into one real-time environment," Mr. Leydon said in an interview with tech blog Inside Mobile Apps last August.

Mr. Leydon declined to comment on Wednesday.

The game relies on translation services powered by Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., and uses a technology called machine learning to build its own dictionary of terms that are more specific to videogames.

Sales of virtual currency within the app have added up.The company predicts revenue this year of around $600 million, according to a person familiar with its business. Apple ranks the game at No. 3 on its list of "top grossing" game apps.

The Palo Alto, Calif., company is following a similar trajectory as Finnish developer Supercell, which was a virtual unknown a few years ago before its combat game "Clash of Clans" took off. In April 2013, Supercell raised $130 million in funding from investors including Institutional Venture Partners at a $770 million valuation. Six months later, the value rose to $3 billion the largest valuation for a mobile app company at the time, according to investment bank Rutberg & Co. when it sold a 51% stake to SoftBank Corp. last year.Machine Zone previously raised only about $13 million from investors including Menlo Ventures, Anthos Capital and Baseline Ventures, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. The company has more than 150 employees, including alumni of top game makers like Electronic Arts Inc. and Activision Blizzard.

By valuing a young startup so highly, investors are betting Machine Zone can produce many more lucrative apps. Game makers such as Zynga Inc., Rovio and King Digital have struggled to follow up their biggest hits with repeat successes.

Investors "like broad diverse portfolios and they don't tend to reward guys that are one-hit wonders," Michael Pachter, a gaming analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.

Zynga is valued at $2.7 billion and King is valued at about $6.4 billion.

GM, VocalIQ Work On Voice Command

General Motors Co. is working with U.K.-based software maker VocalIQ Ltd. to develop an advanced voice-control system for vehicles that would allow spoken commands to access navigation and entertainment systems and accessories.

The work is being overseen by GM's Advanced Technical Center in Israel, which focuses on research and development of autonomous vehicles, robotics, and human-machine interface.

The two companies are negotiating a contract, according to two people familiar with the process, although they have been cooperating for several months.

Spun-out in 2011 from the University of Cambridge's Dialogue Systems Group, VocalIQ recently raised GBP 750,000 ($1.3 million) in funding from investors led by Amadeus Capital Partners. VocalIQ, which is still based in Cambridge, develops machine learning software to enable voice control of devices.

GM and VocalIQ have been working on a prototype for a dialogue management system that could be integrated into dashboard navigation systems, the people said. The development would allow drivers to turn on wipers, adjust the volume of its entertainment system, or request directions by spoken commands.

GM now offers several 2014 models with Apple Inc.'s Siri Eyes Free voice system tied to its Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system.

Richard Anton of Amadeus Capital Partners said VocalIQ's technology was a step beyond the currently available voice-recognition products.

"The technology enables the machine to learn how people say different things. In situations like driving a vehicle, you can't afford to spend any time distracting yourself on the road. You need to be able to get the machine to understand what you're trying to say the first time," he said.

VocalIQ Chief Executive Blaise Thomson said: "Our plan is to build a demonstrator application that could be used in automotive and show that the performance really is better using our approach."

He added "We are in negotiations with a large automotive [company]" on the development, but said no contract has been signed.

Gil Golan, director of the GM technical center in Israel, said the company has been working with VocalIQ's chairman, an expert in spoken language processing, for almost three years and with VocalIQ itself over the past year. He said the system being developed has the potential to be used broadly and the auto maker is considering an investment in the firm.

"The dialogue system developed by VocalIQ can be applied to many different industries and we've been tailoring the technology to the car industry and registering many patents along the way," Mr. Golan said.

The dialogue-management system that VocalIQ develops is a software component that sits on top of speech-recognition systems, like those developed by Nuance Communications Inc. and Google Inc.

"The recent launch of OnStar 4G/LTE systems in GM models in North America means that we now have the bandwidth necessary to put the dialogue manager either in the cloud or in the car itself and we are considering both options.

Implementation via the cloud can mean a shorter time to market. Basically, any input that is currently being done via a button can be done through voice potentially," Mr. Golan said.

Lou Eccleston, who led the fast-growing S&P Capital IQ division at McGraw Hill Financial Inc., departed Monday to pursue other opportunities, according to an internal company memo.

Imogen Dillon Hatcher, S&P Capital IQ's chief commercial officer, will take over as acting president, as the company conducts "an internal and external search for a successor," McGraw Hill Chief Executive Douglas Peterson said in a Monday-afternoon memo distributed to employees and obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Eccleston became president of S&P Capital IQ in 2010, the second-biggest unit of McGraw Hill by revenue, after its ratings division. S&P Capital IQ, with $1.2 billion in 2013 revenue, specializes in providing investors with real-time data and analytics.

The unit was a standout performer in McGraw Hill's first quarter, with revenue growing 4% to $301 million compared with the prior-year quarter. S&P Capital IQ is divided into three components: desktop and enterprise solutions, credit solutions and markets intelligence.

S&P Capital IQ has unrolled new products over the past year and is competing for business with Thomson Reuters Corp., Bloomberg LP and others.

Credit raters, such as Standard & Poor's and rivals Moody's Corp. and Fitch Ratings, have beefed up their real-time analytics divisions, as investors desire more information following the financial crisis. Those units are among the fastest-growing at all of the rating firms.

Ms. Dillon Hatcher is a newcomer to S&P Capital IQ. She started in her current role in February, after leaving the London Stock Exchange, where she served as executive director of global sales.

Mr. Eccleston joined McGraw Hill in 2009, according to the company memo.

Insurers trawl big data  to find those careful with cash are unlikely to crash

It is the unlikely question that could save your life. Next time a colleague offers you a lift home, ask him if he paid his electricity bill on time.

His insurer will already know the answer. The industry has started quietly trawling customers' finances and other sources of "big data" after proving that those who are careful with their cash have fewer car crashes.

The correlation is so strong that Lloyds Banking Group has begun offering prudent account holders savings of as much as 20 per cent on their car insurance premiums.

Scottish Widows, Lloyds' insurance arm, has not established why consumers who stay within overdraft limits or avoid bounced debit card payments have fewer accidents, but insiders suggest that the thrifty tend to be more responsible in other areas of their life.

The development shows how access to big data is revolutionising the insurance sector. Groups are accessing a wide range of data on everything from financial probity to shopping habits to determine the risk premium for customers.

Tesco, which tracks consumer behaviour through its Clubcard loyalty scheme, offers those it deems less risky based on their shopping habits discounts of as much as 40 per cent on home and car insurance.

Aviva has calculated the optimal distance from the street at which a property is least likely to be burgled: not too secluded nor too exposed. Executives at Aviva's Canadian business have established that houses within a radius of a few hundred metres from cinemas are more likely to be vandalised.

"This is not just a backroom theoretical exercise," said -Maurice Tulloch, who runs Aviva UK's general insurance business.

"If our analyst finds something new on a Monday, that can be live and impacting our prices on the Tuesday," he said.

Simon Douglas, director of AA Insurance, said: "The winners in the insurance market will be the ones that have got the data insights that others don't have. It could be supermarkets, banks or social media companies."

Insurers, including Scottish Widows and Tesco, say that they use such personal data to offer some consumers cheaper policies, not to penalise those they deem riskier.

Yet the big data trend ultimately means some policyholders will pay more than others. Brokers say the main reason flood insurance is increasingly unaffordable for some is not climate change but because insurers know more about the risks posed by particular properties.

Emma Carr, acting director of Big Brother Watch, said of the use of sensitive data by insurers: "Despite this being within the law, the way many companies go about doing this is underhand and goes far beyond what customers would expect them to do with their data."

She called on companies to give consumers the option to opt in to such analysis, rather than merely allowing them to opt out.

Infosys quarterly results beat forecasts

Infosys posted first-quarter profit that beat expectations and maintained its sales growth forecast for the year, signalling further improvement at the Indian IT group in spite of a period of unsettling churn in senior management.

Since returning as executive chairman last year, co-founder Narayana Murthy has focused on cutting costs and shifting the focus of India's second-largest IT services exporter by revenue back to its core services, following a mistimed attempt to move up the value chain.

Infosys earned net profit of Rs28.86bn ($480m) in the three months to June, up 21.6 per cent from the previous year, on revenue of Rs127.70bn, which was up 13.3 per cent per cent year-on-year. Analysts at brokerage Kotak Securities had forecast post-tax profit of Rs27.16bn on revenue of Rs128.36bn.

"They've delivered well on the margins front given that they had headwinds of wage hikes, increasing visa costs and the appreciation of the rupee," said Ankita Somani, an analyst at Mumbai-based MSFL Research.

The Indian rupee has gained some 8 per cent against the US dollar since a September collapse in emerging market currencies.

Employee costs have also been an issue, with a high attrition rate of 19.5 per cent in the quarter and an increase in the cost of US visas that analysts say will hit India's IT outsourcing industry more broadly given the large number of projects involving US-based clients.

Infosys also maintained its outlook for sales growth of 7-9 per cent in dollar terms this financial year, suggesting the Bangalore-based group is on the path to recovery as Mr Murthy hands over to new leadership.

Mr Murthy stepped down as executive chairman last month and the company said Vishal Sikka, a former senior executive at SAP, will take over as chief executive in August. Mr Sikka is the first leader not from among the group of seven executives who founded Infosys in 1981.

More than 10 senior executives have left the company since Mr Murthy's return to the helm, creating volatility that - along with a slowdown for some clients in the retail and tech industries - led Infosys to issue a profit warning earlier this year.

Shares in Infosys were up 1.1 per cent on Friday morning in Mumbai at Rp3,330. They have dropped nearly 5 per cent over the past six months, in contrast to a gain of almost 23 per cent for the benchmark Nifty equities index amid political optimism surrounding the election of new prime minister Narendra Modi.

Mr Sikka has built a reputation for innovation in up and coming areas such as data analytics and cloud computing, and observers suggest his appointment signals Infosys' intention to focus itself as a global technology group, moving away from being simply an outsourcing vendor.

Analysts at Mumbai-based brokerage Motilal Oswal foresee a period of change for Infosys, which has so far shunned large acquisitions in spite of a growing cash pile. The company had Rs259.5bn in cash and equivalents at the end of the most recent financial year.

"With Mr Sikka's prowess in technology innovation . . . transformative solutions will not be lacking," Motilal Oswal said in a note to clients. As a results, investments will likely pick up, "increasing the possibility of cash seeing swifter allocation".

U.S. News: Red Flags in Medicare Billing --- Report on Questionable Lab Payments Shows Program's Vulnerability to Abuse

Corrections & Amplifications

Medicare allowed $1.5 billion in 2010 payments to clinical laboratories for claims associated with questionable billing. Because of a calculation error by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, a U.S. News article on July 9 about red flags in Medicare billing incorrectly said that the total was $1.7 billion. Also, the value of duplicate lab tests during that time period was $38.5 million, and claims with problematic physician, lab provider or beneficiary identification numbers totaled $209.6 million, representing at least 20.6% of laboratories analyzed. A chart accompanying the article incorrectly listed those values as $234.6 million, $210.2 million and at least 20.7%, respectively, due to the office's calculation error. A corrected chart is available at WSJ.com/Corrections.

(WSJ August 21, 2014)

(END)

Medicare allowed $1.7 billion in 2010 payments to clinical laboratories for claims that raised red flags, according to a report to be released Wednesday, the latest example of how the federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled is susceptible to misspending and abuse.

The report, by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, found that more than 1,000 laboratories showed five or more measures of questionable billing during that year, the latest available when the office began compiling the data. That includes metrics signifying higher-than-average billing, using ineligible physician identification numbers and administering duplicate tests, among other things.

The findings show how Medicare remains vulnerable to inappropriate spending. In fiscal 2013, the rate of improper payments in Medicare was 10.1%, representing $36 billion in improper payments, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That is up from 8.5%, or $29.6 billion, the previous year.

Clinical laboratory services, which include blood counts, cholesterol screenings and urinalyses, lend themselves to suspect billing in part because physicians order the services instead of providing them directly, according to Medicare fraud specialists.

"Wherever you've got a set of multiple parties involved in the care of a given patient, you've got an opportunity for the dishonest to make something of it," said Bill Mahon, president of Mahon Consulting Group in Great Falls, Va., which helps health-care payers reduce their exposure to fraud.

Medicare is the nation's largest payer of clinical laboratory services, paying $8.2 billion in 2010 for lab services in Part B of the program, which covers doctor visits and other clinician services. From 2005 to 2010, Medicare enrollment in Part B rose by 10%, while spending for lab services in that part of the program increased by 29%.

The inspector general's office detailed several examples of questionable billing but didn't release labs' names. It singled out an independent lab in Texas that was allowed to bill an average of $61,434 per ordering physician, or 15 times the average for independent clinical laboratories. All of the lab's claims were for beneficiaries that Medicare flagged as having compromised identification numbers, which are tied to questionable billing activity.

Of the claims billed, 89% were for beneficiaries who lived more than 150 miles from the physician who ordered the test, an indicator of questionable billing. Medicare allowed $2 million in billing for the lab in 2010.

Forty-three percent of the labs that exceeded the threshold for having five or more measures of questionable billing were in California and Florida. Just 13% of all labs were in those states.

At one California lab, all 1,224 beneficiaries for whom the lab submitted claims had compromised beneficiary identification numbers. Additionally, 45% had ineligible ordering-physician identification numbers. The lab was allowed an average of $61,041 in billing per ordering physician, again 15 times the average among independent labs.

The report didn't measure how the 2010 questionable-billing findings compared with previous years, but the inspector general has highlighted fraudulent billing among clinical laboratories. A 2000 inspector-general report found fraud schemes that included billing for services not performed or needed, and a nationwide law-enforcement project on laboratory scams resulted in settlements against several large lab companies.

In a letter to Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson, CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said the agency agreed with his recommendation that the agency direct Medicare contractors to investigate the labs identified as having questionable billing.

The agency said advanced analytics have identified or prevented more than $210 million in improper Medicare payments in the past two years. Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the agency, said CMS "will continue to utilize all available tools to identify and prevent improper billing practices."

The agency said advanced analytics have identified or prevented more than $210 million in improper Medicare payments in the past two years. Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the agency, said CMS "will continue to utilize all available tools to identify and prevent improper billing practices."

Corrections & Amplifications

Medicare allowed $1.5 billion in 2010 payments to clinical laboratories for claims associated with questionable billing. Due to a calculation error by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, an earlier version of this article incorrectly said the total was $1.7 billion. Also, the value of duplicate lab tests during that time period was $38.5 million, and claims with problematic physician, lab provider or beneficiary identification numbers totaled $209.6 million, representing at least 20.6% of laboratories analyzed. An earlier version of the chart accompanying the article incorrectly listed those values as $234.6 million, $210.2 million and at least 20.7%, respectively. (Aug. 20, 2014)

Mike Lynch, the founder of UK software group Autonomy, has revealed the latest investment from his $1bn technology fund as he forges ahead with deals despite investigations into the sale of his former business.

Invoke Capital is leading a $13.75m investment in Sophia Genetics, a Swiss genetics company. Other investors in the round include Swisscom, the media group, and Endeavour Vision, a Swiss venture capital firm.

The investment is Invoke's first entry into healthcare, which Mr Lynch believes is ripe for disruption by technology groups that can utilise big data.

Sophia Genetics will work with Genalys, a British big data start-up within Invoke's portfolio, to develop a mathematical approach to medicine that can predict problems with a person's health. It works with hospitals and researchers, helping to provide an early diagnosis for patients and optimised treatment of cancer and genetic diseases.

"It's a bit like playing poker when you can see the other guy's hand," said Mr Lynch. "There is no doubt this is the beginning of personalised medicine which will be a revolution in healthcare."

He said the fund is likely to pursue other similar investments. Mr Lynch said he considered 40 genetics companies before settling on Sophia Genetics, believing the group had the greatest chance of making an impact on "an industrial scale".

Invoke seeks to fund young companies involved in "deep technologies" that give them a clear advantage over rivals in their industry.

Previous investments include two Cambridge-based start-ups, Darktrace, a Cambridge-based cyber security company and Neurence, an augmented reality platform.

Mr Lynch remains in the crosshairs of Hewlett-Packard's legal team over Autonomy, which HP acquired for $11bn in 2011. The Silicon Valley company last week said it would continue to press claims against him and Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy's former chief financial officer, over alleged fraud related to acquisition.

HP last week settled shareholder lawsuits over the $8.8bn writedown it subsequently took on the value of Autonomy. It claims that some $5bn of the writedown was due to misrepresentations by former Autonomy executives about the state of the business. Autonomy's management team have always denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Lynch said the issues with HP had not affected his work with Invoke, and had not put start-ups off making deals with Invoke.

"We raised a billion dollars in four weeks, which is much faster than some of the more established funds," said Mr Lynch. "Other than hurling bricks at each other in the press, there is no litigation [with HP]. There's not actually that much of a distraction."
