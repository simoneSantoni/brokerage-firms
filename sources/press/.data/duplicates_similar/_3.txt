Fintech Crowd Dives Into Subprime Credit-Card Lending; Financial-technology startups are stepping into a void increasingly left by credit-card-issuing banks: lending to customers with poor credit histories

Financial-technology startups are stepping into a void increasingly left by credit-card-issuing banks: lending to customers with poor credit histories.

LendUp Global Inc. and Fair Square Financial LLC, which focus more heavily on riskier borrowers, mailed out roughly 35 million credit-card offers during the first half of the year, according to market-research firm Competiscan, up from 7 million during the same period last year.

CreditShop LLC, a specialist in personal loans to risky borrowers that was acquired last year by investment firm Vrde Partners, rolled out a credit card earlier this year. Elevate Credit Inc., which specializes in high-cost installment loans, launched one in July.

Subprime lending can be lucrative. Most of these cards carry interest rates north of 20%, significantly higher than the average credit card interest rate of 14.1%, according to the Federal Reserve. Rewards programs, one of the biggest costs for large card issuers chasing creditworthy customers, are rare.

But risks abound: Facing rising loan losses, especially among the riskiest borrowers, banks are reining in their growth in this sector. Subprime credit-card balances at seven large U.S. banks rose 3% in the first half of the year from a year prior, down from a 13% increase in the year-earlier period, according to Autonomous Research. Capital One Financial Corp.'s subprime balances accounted for 32% of its domestic credit-card balances in the first half of 2018 compared with 36% in the same period a year earlier

The new lenders are getting help from some industry stalwarts. The Orogen Group, an investment firm headed by former Citigroup Inc. chief Vikram Pandit, said in May it was committing $100 million in equity to Fair Square, which distributes cards to borrowers with less-than-pristine credit scores. LendUp recently announced that Capital One co-founder Nigel Morris and former Capital One chief credit officer Frank Rotman were joining its board of directors.

The population of subprime borrowers "is nigh on half of America, and there's enormous opportunity for others to be able to offer a great product with great sophistication to compete in this space," Mr. Morris said in an interview.

Fintech startups still account for a relatively small slice of the subprime-card market. At the end of 2017, Fair Square had 124,000 open accounts, more than half of which went to customers which prime credit scores at the time they were opened, and just shy of $95 million in balances for its Ollo card holders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Capital One has around $32 billion in subprime credit-card balances on its books.

The new entrants say their use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for underwriting helps them manage the risk. They also mostly extend small credit lines, often ranging between $500 and $2,000, limiting the scale of potential losses.

Around 60 million U.S. adults have credit scores lower than 650, according to Fair Isaac Corp., roughly the threshold where banks focused on prime borrowers stop lending. Some 53 million U.S. adults don't have credit scores at all because they have little or no borrowing history.

Fintech lenders have been targeting both groups, often using data not included in applicants' credit reports, such as how often they change addresses and whether they pay their utility bills on time, to determine whether to approve them.

Fintech startups looking to enter the credit-card business have a few challenges that banks don't. They typically must partner with banks to issue the cards on their behalf to comply with rules set by card networks Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., and they need a source of funding to lend against. LendUp, for example, uses Transportation Alliance Bank to issue its Arrow Card and has a $100 million line of credit from Victory Park Capital Advisors LLC, a Chicago-based investment firm.

Vista Could Raise Nearly $14 Billion for Latest Fund

Technology-focused private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners could raise nearly $14 billion for its seventh flagship fund, pension fund documents show.

This would put Vista in line to become one of the latest private-equity shops to raise its largest-ever fund.

A document published on Aug. 8 by Oregon State Treasury, which invests money on behalf of employees of Oregon State, said the fund is expected to be 20% to 25% larger than its predecessor, which raised more than $11 billion in 2016.

WSJ Pro reported in May that Vista was seeking to raise $12 billion or more for its latest fund.

The Oregon Investment Council said in the document that it recommended an investment of up to $500 million in the fund. Vista's latest buyout fund will seek to take majority stakes in 15 software and data companies worth between $750 million and $10 billion, the document shows.

The fund has yet to set a hard cap despite returning to market earlier this year, the document shows, the latest sign of the increasing clout top-performing private-equity shops have in today's buoyant fundraising market.

Soaring investor demand means buyout funds can increasingly dictate terms during fundraising, in some instances not letting investors know how much they will seek to raise until the firm has held an initial or final close. Investors typically like to know how much a firm plans to raise at the outset so they don't find themselves backing a fund that is a lot bigger than expected.

Vista only set a hard cap on its previous fund after holding a first close in March 2016, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.

Other large-cap firms including Advent International Corp., Cinven and Apax Partners also began marketing their most recent funds without establishing an upper limit, WSJ Pro said in the same report.

Raising larger funds has become increasingly common in recent years as yield-starved investors turn to well-established private-equity brands in a bid to boost returns.

Carlyle Group LP recently raised $18.5 billion for its latest flagship buyout fund, it said in a statement in July. Last year, Apollo Global Management LLC raised $24.7 billion the largest pool of capital ever raised by a private-equity firm.

The Oregon State document lists Vista's increasing fund size as one of several concerns.

One of the challenges it says it expects Vista will face is increasing competition for deals.

Rival private-equity firms and sovereign-wealth funds are attracted by the strong recurring revenue software businesses generate. Last year, deals for technology companies accounted for about one-fifth of all acquisitions globally, Dealogic Ltd. data shows.

"Vista was a first mover in a nascent market for software buyouts but & as new competition has arisen, there has been a step change in purchase prices for mature and profitable software companies," the document says.

Vista was founded in 2000 by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives Robert Smith and Brian Sheth.

The firm manages over $31 billion and has backed companies, including educational-software provider PowerSchool Group LLC and data-analytics provider TIBCO Software Inc.

Since inception, the firm has invested approximately $19 billion in more than 70 deals, generating a net internal rate of return of more than 20%, the document says.

Footwear Designer Vionic Explores a Sale

A private equity-backed footwear designer is marching toward a potential deal.

Vionic Group LLC has engaged Robert W. Baird & Co. to weigh a sale, said people familiar with the matter.

The Alpine Investors-backed company is projected to generate more than $30 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2018, the people said.

Founded in 1979 by podiatrist Phillip Vasyli, the San Rafael, Calif.-based business designs supportive shoes, sandals and heels with the aim of melding style with footwear technology. Vionic makes so-called biomechanical footbeds that are designed to provide extra sole support. The company sells its shoes online and through retailers such as DSW Inc., Zappos.com Inc. and QVC Inc.

Alpine invested in Vionic in 2012. As an Alpine portfolio company, Vionic has rolled out new product styles and boosted its direct-selling capabilities by establishing its own stores, the first of which opened last year. It also appointed the former president of Deckers Outdoor Corp. unit UGG, Connie Rishwain, as its president in 2016.

"We're always exploring strategic and financial opportunities to help fuel our growth, but there is no active deal in place. We will continue to evaluate all our options to determine what is best for Vionic's exciting future," said Chris Gallagher, Vionic's chief executive. He didn't comment further.

The apparel-and-footwear category is becoming increasingly competitive. The retail market continues to evolve, driven by changing preferences among shoppers looking for unique fashion items. Makers of functional apparel and footwear with proprietary technology have fared better than the broader sector.

The U.S. footwear segment expanded retail sales 1.6% in 2017, generating $74.15 billion, compared with $72.97 billion in 2016, according to data provider Euromonitor International Ltd.

Recent private transactions in the space include Charlesbank Capital Partners' purchase of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlesbank-to-buy-bankrupt-rockport-for-150-million-1530729995?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3" out of bankruptcy protection and Optimal Investment Group's acquisition of USA Dawgs Inc.

Alpine invests in companies in the software, consumer-services and business-services industries. The San Francisco firm backs North American businesses with $2 million to $25 million of Ebitda, at times dipping down to consider companies in the software sector that generate at least $1 million of Ebitda.

Alpine in April "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alpine-investors-backs-comlinkdata-1523548850?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" in Comniscient Technologies LLC, a provider of data analytics software that does business as Comlinkdata.

Why One of the Biggest Mall Owners Is Doubling Down on Malls; William Taubman of Taubman Centers says the mall isn't dead. It's just changing.

While mall owners have faced record store closures and bankruptcy filings as more Americans shop online, Taubman Centers Inc. has doubled down.

It is reinvesting in design, technology, big-data tools and new store mixes for its 24 malls. One of the biggest overhauls is a $500 million revamp of the Beverly Center in central Los Angeles.

The Bloomfield Hills, Mich., company is adding natural light, a chef-curated food hall and new luxury tenants. Taubman is also bringing in services for high-end clients through an armada of personal shoppers and the London-based concierge service Quintessentially, as well as analyzing consumer data with OneMarket, a retail-technology network.

Big-ticket moves such as these have been controversial. Some shareholders pressed for less-expensive strategies, and the dissatisfaction contributed to the election of activist investor Jonathan Litt to the company's board in May, replacing William S. Taubman, son of the company's founder. Mr. Taubman, known as "Billy," continues in his role as the company's chief operations officer.

Mr. Taubman argues that some of his competitors have spent much more Westfield Corp. recently spent $1 billion revamping the Century City Mall in Los Angeles while others are failing to invest enough in the future of shopping.

Mr. Taubman sat down with The Wall Street Journal to discuss his strategy. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation.

A mall overhaul

WSJ: Let's begin with a bird's-eye view of what you're trying to accomplish with the redo of the Beverly Center. You're in a competitive shopping market, with the Century City mall having just finished its own very extensive makeover. And Rodeo Drive is 10 minutes away.

MR. TAUBMAN: Let's go to 30,000 feet. I think what's most interesting about Beverly, and is representative of the future, is that Century City really focused their entire development around the department stores. The basis of our plan was everything but the department stores. We basically did nothing with the department stores. We just did something with everything else [such as mixing brands, and adding new food choices, signage and client services].

WSJ: Your reinvestment strategy has been controversial with some of your shareholders, and may have contributed to your replacement on the board in May. To what do you ascribe those investors' concerns?

MR. TAUBMAN: Reinvesting in Beverly Center was a generational decision necessary for it to keep its competitive position in one of the most important and growing markets. The property needed to be rethought and reimagined in order to remain relevant to the L.A. consumer and our significant Asian tourist business. The friction comes from the fact that investors are focused on short-term returns, but this transformational reinvestment will maximize the long-term value of the asset.

WSJ: Why do you think this reinvestment strategy will be successful at a time when retail is generally experiencing something of a recession?

MR. TAUBMAN: Destination retail centers continue to improve and gain market share. They are not in a recession. Our efforts to reinvigorate the center are already paying off. As we mentioned on our recent earnings call, we're seeing materially improved traffic and sales productivity. Even with the project not yet completed, its sales per square foot has grown by double digits. If this trend continues, sales will reach historic levels this year.

WSJ: You're focused on a lot of brand stores smaller and more mixed. Is there still a need for anchor stores at malls?

MR. TAUBMAN: I use this analogy about the anchors. In the '60s and '70s, the three television networks ABC, NBC and CBS had like a 90% market share. Today, they probably have a 20% market share or a 15% market share, but they represent the cultural consensus of America. As opposed to cable, which is narrowcast.

Retailing has shifted like cable. There is still a function for the [traditional networks] it's just not the function it was. When my father was building shopping centers, anchors were guaranteed a certain sales performance and draw of customers because everybody did shop at the anchors consistently. That's now less true.

WSJ: How do you figure out what those narrowcast needs are in your shoppers?

MR. TAUBMAN: We did a year of market research. We embedded a videographer and an anthropologist into 40 different homes for five days. We videoed the customer as she made every decision. We lived with them to really understand why and what they were doing, and why did they come to Beverly or Century City? We saw that the decision making was complex. Food was incredibly important in her decision making. That's why we were so focused on the food at Beverly.

A full experience

WSJ: Everyone's talking these days about experiential retail. What does that mean for your malls?

MR. TAUBMAN: We're putting [clothing retailer] Canada Goose in [the mall in Short Hills, N.J.] They'll put a cold room in, it'll be 12, 13 degrees. You'll be able to put coats on and walk into the rooms to test out what they feel like. Indigo, we're bringing it in from Canada it's a 30,000-square-foot bookstore. The cooking department has a chef every evening and on the weekends, cooking, demonstrating. And we're bringing in [fashion retailer] Brunello Cucinelli. We haven't announced everybody we're bringing in, but there's just a whole bunch of new luxury retailers.

WSJ: Luxury brands often want to be segregated from everyone else.

MR. TAUBMAN: The luxury tends to want to be in its own [area in the mall, but they do] want to be near Apple. With the Beverly Center, we moved Apple up to the seventh floor; it's right next to the luxury zone.

WSJ: Would you like to mix it up more?

MR. TAUBMAN: I would and I wouldn't: I do think that the Gucci shopper goes into Zara. Now, they buy different things in Zara than they buy in Gucci. On the other hand I have to be careful what I say here there are many midprice women's apparel stores that I actually don't think the Gucci shopper is shopping at. So, do I think she goes into Footlocker to buy a pair of shoes? Absolutely. She's not trying to replace her Christian Louboutins with Nikes, but she wants Nike as well, for another part of her life. So, I think that if the association makes sense for the customer, then it'll make sense for the retailer.

WSJ: You also get a lot of tourists at the Beverly Center. How do they even find it?

MR. TAUBMAN: We've been adopted by Chinese tourists, and we had a whole strategy for them. About nine years ago, we hired the marketing consultant that had helped Louboutin in China. We employ Chinese speakers in the information booth and take Union Pay [the Chinese international credit card]. Every Chinese student who arrives in L.A. for university gets a welcome package from Beverly with special benefits and an invitation to come see us and have a concierge to help them. Chinese students, we find, get a lot of family as well as friends, so there's a real spending opportunity with everybody who comes over to see them.

WSJ: Are you adding new services for shoppers?

MR. TAUBMAN: Of course, we have Wi-Fi everywhere. That's sort of the price of admission today. In the Beverly Center, Quintessentially is our concierge service.

What happens is, you're a Chinese billionaire and you decide that you want to come to L.A., you want courtside seats for the Lakers, you want Michael Mina to cook you a meal, and you want a stylist. Your concierge will be able to plan that.

WSJ: Is there any other infrastructure technology that you're looking at for the near future?

MR. TAUBMAN: We've signed up with Westfield for OneMarket. If OneMarket is successful and we're betting on it we believe it will create a marriage of the virtual and real world that will allow us to address customers one on one and make their shopping experience far more efficient. Ultimately, the major retailers will all have their inventory on the system, using big data.

So, when you get in your car and you say to Waze or you go into an Uber and you say you want to go to the Beverly Center, we're going to know that you've pinned a black dress on your picture app. And we'll be able to tell you, "By the way, that black dress is on the second floor at Bloomingdale's and we'll have Louise pull it out right now and put it in a fitting room, and we will take you directly to it."

WSJ: How soon do you think that's going to be real?

MR. TAUBMAN: I think two to three years. We're testing now.

Silicon Valley's fatal attraction to Saudi Arabia

S ilicon Valley royalty received a visit from the real thing. Google co-founder Sergey Brin and venture capitalist Peter Thiel were among those meeting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his US tour in April. The budding relationship was on display again this week. The FT revealed that Saudi Arabia's wealth fund had spent $2bn to acquire almost 5 per cent of Tesla's stock. The mutual attraction is obvious. The crown prince has an agenda to transform his oil economy into an investing and tech powerhouse. For their part, tech groups, especially those burning cash, appreciate patient investors.

Yet the Saudi tech splurge is far more than meets the eye, while the glaring contradictions and obvious potential for disaster are swept under the carpet.

First, the sprawl. Japan's SoftBank has drawn a lot of attention for the size and volume of investments in tech, but remember that almost half of its $100bn Vision Fund is Saudi money. That means companies as diverse as Slack, the messaging app, and SoFi, the online lender, have Riyadh to thank, in part, for their surging valuations. WeWork, the shared office provider, received another $1bn this week; so widely is the fund sprayed around that the news barely registered.

For some companies, it goes further. Magic Leap, the consumer virtual reality company, has a direct investment from the Saudi Public Investment Fund. At Uber, the PIF acquired a 5 per cent stake in 2016 before SoftBank bought a 17 per cent stake for $9bn last year. That adds up to enough financial clout for real influence. Indeed, the PIF's Yasir al-Rumayyan sits on the ride-hailing company's board. Those are just the ones we know about. The Tesla revelation shows that Saudi Arabia is prepared to invest quietly in sizeable amounts which stay just below the disclosure threshold of 5 per cent. No other foreign government is close to building such a position in US tech.

US companies should not need reminding that the behaviour of this government is as distant from Californian values as it is possible to imagine. When Uber gobbled up the first investment from the PIF, women were still barred from driving in the kingdom. Only months ago, Saudi businessmen were locked up in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton.

For all the crown prince's liberalising agenda, he leads a repressive regime waging a war abroad and beheading people at home. Given this, the embrace of investment by Silicon Valley's liberal elite might be their biggest act of hypocrisy yet.

No such qualms are expected from the Trump administration. But these are sensitive industries. SoftBank has stakes in companies such as Nvidia, the chip company for artificial intelligence and virtual reality.

Stability is not guaranteed on either side. The Trump administration likes to blow hot and cold, even with allies; it has used its powers to block foreign investments, especially from China.

From the Saudi side, it was striking that officials   annoyed by the Canadian foreign minister voicing support for jailed rights activists   ordered their overseas asset managers to sell Canadian holdings. How soon could they tire of a tech sector which is slow to reciprocate with the hoped-for inward investment in Saudi Arabia? Whether this spending spree ends in boom, bust or fire sale, it will be something to behold.

Markets
Public or Private, Tesla Fans Are Along for the Ride; Many retail investors say they plan to stick with the electric-car maker for the long haul; one is 'betting on the jockey, not the horse'

Plenty of Tesla Inc.'s die-hard holders are prepared to stick with Elon Musk, no matter if the electric-car maker is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-big-question-better-or-worse-off-as-private-company-1533751228?tesla=y&mod=article_inline".

"As long as it's an option for me to invest my money alongside Elon, I'm going to," said James Stephenson, who says he has been a Tesla investor since 2014.

Whether individuals and some institutional investors will be able to stay in Tesla will depend on how a deal is structured, though. Some holders of Tesla stock could face hurdles to participating.

Mr. Musk has said he wants "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-twitter-account-am-considering-taking-tesla-private-at-420-1533661152?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline", giving investors a choice: stay with the company or sell their shares and receive $420 cash for each. The more shareholders who opt to stay, the less cash the company or any new investor would have to pony up.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/experts-cast-doubt-on-musks-envisioned-buyout-of-tesla-1533680027"for a deal"https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-go-private-dream-doesnt-add-up-1533677506?mod=article_inline". Tesla, which has dwindling cash reserves and continues to generate negative free-cash flow, hasn't given any detail on how it would fund a buyout.

Mr. Musk tweeted "funding secured," but a later statement "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-board-has-met-several-times-to-discuss-going-private-proposal-1533736367?mod=article_inline" was less definitive. It said a meeting with Mr. Musk a week earlier had "also addressed the funding for this to occur."

Individual shareholders like Mr. Stephenson hold about 12% of Tesla's stock, according to FactSet, and many say they won't go. The 40-year-old financial analyst who lives in Florida said he wants to hold on to his Tesla shares, which he says number 169 and were worth around $60,000 based on Thursday's close.

"I'm not going to sell at $420, and most other Tesla shareholders I've spoken with aren't going to sell either," said Mr. Stephenson, adding he expects Tesla to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization over the next decade, versus around $60 billion today.

Mr. Musk said in "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026890900885184514"that he would create "a special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla," but the car maker and Mr. Musk haven't elaborated on how such a vehicle would work. Usually, individual investors who don't meet certain income and asset criteria face steep regulatory barriers to participating in a buyout.

What's more, almost 8% of Tesla shareholders are index funds that follow benchmarks that exclude unlisted companies, according to Morningstar. Most of those would likely have to cash out since they can't generally hold stock not included in public markets or an index.

An additional 24% of shareholders are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that face limits on holdings of securities that don't trade easily. In most cases, they can't have more than 15% of their portfolio in illiquid securities.

These funds, which are among Tesla's biggest shareholders, have yet to say how they would react to a go-private transaction. T. Rowe Price Associates, Tesla's second-largest holder after Mr. Musk, with a 9.2% stake, declined to comment. So, too, did No. 3 holder Fidelity Management & Research Co., with an 8.16% stake.

Baillie Gifford, the next largest holder, said in a statement: "As long-term shareholders, we will take time to reflect upon this development."

Vanguard Group, which is Tesla's sixth-largest holder, owns shares mostly through index funds, which would likely have to sell. "Our active funds are technically able to invest in private companies, but it is rare for them to do so," a spokesman said.

Some smaller fund managers say they are on board. Craig Blanchfield, a portfolio manager at Mosaic Advisors, a money manager that oversees more than $241 million, said he wants to continue to hold Tesla shares. He said Tesla has already been a lucrative investment for him, as well as clients for whom he manages money.

Mr. Blanchfield added that Mr. Musk's penchant for success from revolutionizing payments with PayPal Holdings Inc. to building rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is a key reason behind his plan to hold Tesla shares indefinitely. "This is an example of betting on the jockey, not the horse," said Mr. Blanchfield.

The $174.7 million Ark Industrial Innovation ETF, an actively managed fund from Ark Investment Management, is another committed bull. Tesla is its largest holding, accounting for 11.7% of the fund's portfolio, according to FactSet. Two other Ark ETFs own smaller stakes in Tesla.

"We think that $420 is a very low price to pay for Tesla today," said Tasha Keeney, an analyst with Ark Investment Management. The fund would prefer Tesla stay public because liquidity limits might push it to sell, but she argued that the market is underestimating the growth of battery-powered cars.

Factoring that in, Ms. Keeney estimated Tesla's shares could reach $4,000 in five years.

The scant detail provided by Mr. Musk has given pause to some steadfast supporters. Galileo Russell, a 25-year-old founder of a financial media startup, HyperChange, geared at millennials, views a take-private move as a "step backwards in terms of liquidity and transparency."

Mr. Russell conceded heavy short selling in Tesla stock, which entails investors betting a share price will decline, has been a distraction for the company, as Mr. Musk has said.

Investors who have placed wagers on Tesla shares falling have accumulated about $12.5 billion in short interest, making the electric-car maker one of the most shorted stocks in the U.S., according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

"I'm not super convinced going private is the right move," said Mr. Russell. Still, he says he doesn't plan to sell any of his 60 shares, valued at about $21,000. "The financial upside could be huge. I'm holding this for 10, 20, 30 years at least."

For Prem Kalevar, a 29-year-old Canadian entrepreneur, Tesla's long-term potential isn't enough to mask liquidity concerns. Mr. Kalevar said he would sell a meaningful portion of what he says is his low six-figure holding that he has accumulated since 2013 if Mr. Musk takes the company private.

"Given the complexity and uncertainty of holding private company stock, my willingness to hold as large as a position as I do now would go down," Mr. Kalevar said.

Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin answered questions from the audience during an appearance in Roanoke, Va., on Wednesday, Aug. 8, 2018. He discussed cryptocurrencies, cyberrisks, the opioid crisis and U.S. tensions with trading partners, among other issues. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for clarity and length.

THOMAS BARKIN: (In progress) ... I focus on three big things. I spend a lot of time digging into the economy. As a guy who had a business background, I'm deeply respectful of economic thinking, but maybe not as fluent as folks who do it every day. I thought the only thing I was going to bring to the FOMC was to make sure that I had learned and be able to talk about economics in a way that was credible around the Federal Open Market Committee table. (Inaudible)   in and of itself. I have been digging hard into economics and the economy.

The second thing I've been doing is digging into the district. And as I said, I've been everywhere now. (Inaudible.) But West Virginia's the place where we're going next month. But just trying to understand what's happening in cities and towns that   and some of the stuff I talked about today, the urban/rural split, that's not something I spent time thinking about six months ago, but it's something I spend a lot of time thinking about today. So trying to understand what's happening in our district.

And then the third part, I'd say, is just developing my own voice. As a competitive guy, if you show up around the FOMC table with the group of talented colleagues that I described, you want to be able to add value. And, you know, I'm hopeful that two things   that being able to talk about economic issues in the way that firms think is a distinctive value-add   (inaudible). So I've been pushing more on trying to do that.

Q: OK. How does the information that you learn through events and outreach opportunities like this help inform your view on monetary policy?

MR. BARKIN: Oh, gosh, it helps a ton. So one of the challenges we have is we're trying to make really important decisions off of data that is by and large three months old and always revised. So, for example, we found out that the savings rate   three weeks ago we found the savings rate actually hadn't been 3.6 percent for the last year; it was 7 percent. So actually 3 percent to 6.8 percent, you know, shocking changes in the data. And so you don't want to go into the room, look at the data, and make a decision without trying to understand what's happening on the ground.

So one of the kind of things that my colleagues and I spend a ton of time doing is trying to test what we think we're seeing in the data with what's happening on the ground. If wage increases look modest in the data but you tell me they're massive on the ground, then I start asking some questions. If price increases look significant in the data but you say not that meaningful on the ground, fantastic. So I like to think that what we're doing is constant testing of what we see with what we hear. And I think the two of those put together give us the best chance to get an accurate view of what's happening in the economy.

MODERATOR: Along those lines, I imagine the questions that you have or look at maybe   (inaudible)   get questions when you come to Fed meetings, conferences   (inaudible)   several questions. The last time it was the way that you look at wages, but   (inaudible)   seeing turnover, wage inflation. So that gives us an opportunity to hear more about what specifically is going on at that time, so.

MR. BARKIN: And I'm going to add, we meet every six weeks. You might not think that the economy changes that much every six weeks, but I'd say every time we meet there's new stuff on the table. In January, it was the tax cut. In March, it was the tariffs. And I might be wrong, but I think in April it was the Italian fiscal situation and what that meant for others, wages. I mean, so there's always something. So it's incredibly helpful to stay abreast of what's happening in the market, and why I appreciate   (inaudible)   today.

MODERATOR: So, Tom, with regard to the economy, what keeps you up at night? (Laughter.)

MR. BARKIN: So, you know, we are many, many years into an economic expansion that, you know, started slowly but I think has started to gain some traction in the last couple years. I've been told by many people that economic expansions don't die of old age, they die of cardiac arrest. And so I'm trying to figure out what's the shock to the system that could, you know, put a stop or   (inaudible). You know, is it what's happening internationally? Is it a cyberrisk of some sort? Is it, you know, financial conditions? There are certain markets that are   that are leveraged or overleveraged.

But I think it's a hard job trying to forecast the future. And you know, if you decide that there's going to be a shock you're only right roughly one out of five times. But I do try to spend time thinking about what's around the corner, you know, that could put the brakes on what's been, I think, a very   (inaudible)   virtuous circle.

MODERATOR: And if it's not a   not a cyberattack or something spectacular, where do you think the   where do you see the next recession could possibly come from?

MR. BARKIN: Again, I think that confidence matters a lot in our economy. I think   if you go back to '09 to '12, I think there were businesses that, you know, for whatever set of reasons, weren't that confident in investing in   (inaudible). And I think we're just now seeing businesses start to make those investments. We're seeing investment come back. And I think that this   (inaudible)   on business confidence would be   (inaudible)   in consumer confidence. You know, do you feel like you've got a job, you've got enough money that you could spend a little money on your family or on yourself? Or do you feel like you're   (inaudible)   paychecks   (inaudible)? So, again, things that have to do with consumer confidence would be the same.

So, you know, I'm very focused on confidence and things that drive our confidence because if you take consumer spending, you could easily   and we've seen it happen   make a change in spending to saving like that if you start to feel nervous about the future. Businesses could   (inaudible)   shareholders   (inaudible)   the future like that. And so it is a wide range of things that could affect it, but I focus a lot on the confidence.

... And consumer savings rate   you know, in addition to everything going down, businesses hunkered down, consumers hunkered down, people lost their jobs. There's a vicious cycle and a virtuous cycle. In '08, you saw the vicious cycle of people getting cautious all at the same time, which then, you know, made the economy contract even more.

MODERATOR: One more question. You touched on tariffs. Any idea where this might   the outcome might be on tariffs?

MR. BARKIN: No. No. So I think the most important thing to say right now is, you know, we're in the middle of a negotiation with a bunch of countries that could land on the spectrum all the way from fairer trade deals with a lot of, you know, countries that is a boost and a stimulus to the economy; to modest tariffs in many places that don't really hit the bottom line of the economy quite significantly; to a significant trade war that most economists say would be detrimental to the economy. I don't think anybody has any idea where it's going now ...

We're not seeing massive issues with economic performance today across the entire economy driven by, you know, the various trade   (inaudible). For sure, you know, we've had tariffs on steel that are driving prices up. For sure, these threatened tariffs on soybeans are driving soybean prices down. ... But it's a pretty big economy here, and across the whole economy I don't think we see a massive impact. So we're in that middle state, but it could go left or it could go right. We certainly don't know, or I certainly don't know, so.

Q: My question is regarding tariffs   (inaudible). How much of an impact does unfair trade practices impact the future of   (inaudible)?

MR. BARKIN: So, again, economic theory would suggest   (inaudible)   theory about free trade that presumes fair trade, all right, as opposed to unfair trade. Some of our predecessors made calls a number of years ago in the context of various trade agreements or in the execution of those trade agreements to allow things that might not have been as fair to continue. I presume that they did it because they thought net-net it was still better than not having the trade at all. And, in fact, I have looked at it in depth; my instinct is many, many, many of these trade deals that are currently situated have benefitted us, right, net, even though they may not be as fair as they could be.

That said, we have a totally legitimate interest to making them as fair as they could be. And I think if they were fairer, they'd be better. So I wouldn't go back and say we'd be better off if we hadn't traded with China or Mexico. I don't intuitively believe that's correct. But do I believe we'd have better trade if it was fairer? I do.

Q: Hi. Good morning. So the question   a lot of technologists and futurists are predicting that robotics and artificial intelligence, automation   (inaudible). Are you guys having a conversation around this topic? And, if so, what are your thoughts on how it may affect the economy?

MR. BARKIN: I've seen a lot of the same studies you are and, you know, I'll say that there's a lot of studies. I'm reminded of the   Time magazine had a study in the early '60s where they looked at the effect of automation and they decided if we could just get all the automation implemented, we would all just work a three-hour day. (Laughter.) And that's actually what they thought, and then the picture was the robot butler that would scoot over and give you your drink at the end your three-hour day. (Laughter.) And so technology is going to come. Technology will replace some jobs. It will   you know, industries are constantly being disrupted by technology.

A little bit the question is, will that happen   (inaudible)? And there's a piece to it which is positive for the economy, that I think a lot of businesses   (inaudible)   more effective. It will create new jobs. Like AI   artificial intelligence translators is a job that's going to be quite a big job in the future that actually doesn't exist today. But the key to making it really work in the long term is for our workforce to be capable enough that they can redeploy in the way that economic theory suggests they do.

And that's why I think workforce development is such a big thing. And if you read books, James Hills's great book I would recommend, and it talks about some of the challenges that workforces have in redeployment. You definitely get the feeling that technology will come in and displace workers, but if we don't have any thought to how those workers redeploy to other tasks, that that's our real issue as an economy.

And as I said before, probably right now we have jobs for everyone who's looking for jobs. We need to get some of the folks who aren't looking for jobs to be, you know, back in the workforce looking for employment   (inaudible). And so I think we do have an opportunity to be investing in the development of that workforce to be able to do that.

Q: To follow on just a little bit on that, lately world-wide, particularly in emerging economies, there's an increasing awareness of the value added for investing in (research and development), including fundamental or what's called basic research, whether it be in biomedical, engineering, communications, whatever it might be. It seems like in the last decade we've lost a bit of will, and perhaps policy can help guide us back to that.

I suppose there are two choices, and I wonder what your opinion is. One choice is we become a country that takes advantage of fundamental discoveries made elsewhere in the world and translate and apply. The other is that we double down on the history of the United States to be a world leader in fundamental discovery. Can policy from where you sit affect that decision? And what is your opinion about which way we should go?

MR. BARKIN: The way you described the second one sounded a lot better than when you described the first one. (Laughter.)

I'll probably give a non-answer to the question, but, you know, policy-wise   (inaudible)   how just, you know, or where the government spends money on whatever. I do have a feeling that the right spending on infrastructure for this country is an important thing. And infrastructure has many different components to it.

You, obviously, think about roads and rail lines and those things as physical infrastructure, but I think that basic research is part of the fundamental infrastructure base of this country. And I do think that investment in basic research by this country has paid off in the past and would continue to do that going forward.

I'm also more than comfortable with us taking advantage of other people's innovations and innovating on top of those ourselves. So I don't   I don't see it as much as a choice between the two; I see it as a both/and.

Q: (In progress following break) ... The Fed is a regulator, and in the recent past it seems that one size fits all has been more prominent. What can the Fed do to encourage the growth and the success of local small banks?

MR. BARKIN: Well, there are a couple of things in there. But I think   I think the core of what you're asking is, do we think that one size fits all makes sense for our oversight and support of banks? And I think you'll see in some of the regulatory stuff that has passed recently and in the support that we've given to that regulatory stuff that I, and I think others, are supportive of tailoring.

The way I think about it is I was an ex-consultant, so they should be getting the same protection of the economy with less administration, less ask. That's a very attractive thought to me. And so I think it's a very attractive thought to say, horses for horses, we should be tailoring recommendation to what the actual risk is and what the actual need is. And I think you see that coming out of the most recent Senate bill. We're in the process of, you know, tailoring our reviews by size of institution and by risk of institution to make sure we give the most in-depth reviews to the ones that have the most risk.

I'd just say as an aside that, to me, there's actually a lot of interesting stuff in entrepreneurial finance. A lot of it's online and, you know, what's happening in some of those fintech firms, they're getting to that as well. And I do think for the smaller banks, you know, how they compete with the online thing is another   a big issue. And I've noticed the (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) has just reached out to start regulating some of the online banks. I think that will be a good thing as well.

MODERATOR: I think that's   from a banker's standpoint, that feels like they have a playing field, that they come in without regulation and yet we're regulated.

MR. BARKIN: Well, again, we're always trying   you asked about what keeps me up at night. We're always trying to think about what the next problem is, not the last problem. I actually do have a philosophical   or view that we never make the same mistake twice. But what is the next problem? And so parts of the system that are underregulated or unregulated, I think that those are places to look at.

Q: Talk to us a little bit about cryptocurrencies, and how you see it impacting our economy and on the future.

MR. BARKIN: We'll see. (Laughter.) I have to report my investments every year, so I want to make clear that I am not invested in any cryptocurrencies. (Laughter.)

So the whole   the blockchain methodology, which is behind cryptocurrency, is a really interesting methodology providing verification and security. And most of the folks that I have talked to believe that's a real innovation and has real value.

The question of whether that is best used as a currency is an interesting one, and I think what I would think about it is this. Obviously, if you got some currency and someone else will pay you for it, then it's currency. But if you value currency as   if you value the stability features of currency   you know, money has a stable source of value   then it's hard for me to imagine how you would be using as currency something that isn't backed by the government, but is instead backed by a bunch of people who, by definition, you don't know. It just doesn't make that much sense to me. And so I think it's a fun investment, but I don't know that it's yet got the level of protection that you would hope for in currency.

Q: You've done some talking about sort of the next problem and other economic disruptions. Can you talk a little bit about environmental factors? For example, sea-level rise. Many of the primary economic cities that you represent   Richmond, Baltimore, Norfolk, Hampton Roads   they're all affected by sea-level rise. And I just wondered what part, if any, that it played in environmental resiliency.

MR. BARKIN: I am a homeowner on the beach in South Carolina, so I'm aligned with your concerns. Also, offshore drilling.

Actually, the Richmond Fed just published a paper   I think I saw it; it was yesterday or the day before   on climate change and some of the impact on the economy. And I think I'm being direct, though; our sense of the economy is more a two- or three- or four-year kind of look, and I think a lot of these climate-change issues are much longer-term kind of issues. And so it's not obvious to me that the rising of the   potential rising of the seas is something we can take into account in next month's interest-rate decision. And so I just think that is what it is.

There are some interesting analyses that have been done and are being done. And I would point to this thing Richmond   and talk about, you know, what the economic impact could be of higher temperatures, higher   (inaudible)   you know, those sort of things.

And, of course, there are puts and takes. You create a   it's hotter for you, but it's, you know, nicer for somebody in Canada is sort of puts and takes. But I wouldn't say we do a ton on that.

It is one of the interesting things about being in the Federal Reserve is, you know, our lane is pretty focused. The Congress has given us the task of setting interest rates, maximum employment, stable prices, and that's where we focus. There's actually a huge economy out there that we don't control. Things like fiscal policy, policy makers have a lot more influence over that than we do. We have the chance to comment on it, but we really don't control it.

Q: Health care is a significant, growing part of the (gross domestic product) in this country. And I've heard some economists say it's unsustainable more than worrisome, crowding out other economies. Other economists are saying thank goodness for health care and we obviously   (inaudible)   more and more. Where do you come down on that?

MR. BARKIN: I don't think I have an opinion on whether health care should be a bigger sector of the economy or a smaller sector of the economy. I have heard lots of stuff; I've talked to lots of people ... And the economists I speak to, you know, do find the funding system of the health-care model to be sort of counter   (inaudible)   economic theory with cross-subsidies, as you know, from government-funded to, you know, charity cases, people who   (inaudible)   insurance. So there's a lot of belief in the   in the profession that if we could, you know, find a way to clean up the payment models and make it a more efficient payment model, that might have benefits for everyone ...

But I don't think we have an intuitive   I don't believe this is a managed economy. I don't believe we'll ever wake up and say health care ought to be bigger and something else ought to be smaller. I'd like to see the markets work.

Q: What is the   your influence and difference in influence between a credit union and a bank?

MR. BARKIN: Well, I mean, credit unions are regulated by different operating machinery than banks are. You probably know that. They have a different tax regime. And so, you know, our   we are regulating banks that we regulate; we're not talking about their oversight.

I'm not sure what you're   is that what you're getting at?

Q: Well, basically, the difference in the operations of the   of the two, if you   if you influence at all credit unions.

MR. BARKIN: I don't think we do, meaningfully. I mean, I think they're   they're regulated in their lane, but we're not in their oversight.

Banking regulation is very complicated, a whole  nother conversation, but there are multiple regulators in the banking space. We regulate   (inaudible)   banks. We regulate bank holding companies. That's what we've been chartered to regulate. And there are other regulators   the OCC, the (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.), for example   that regulate other institutions. And we do our best to try to keep it all aligned. We certainly regulate the biggest banks, right? We don't regulate all the small banks. In fact, there are multiple regulators in that space.

Q: I thought it was interesting that you were responsible for overall (information technology) for the Fed. And Susan, when she asked you about what keeps you up at night, you brought up two things, and Susan also brought up catastrophic cyber problems. I was wondering, then: Do you feel that business owners big and small should be devoting more resources towards cyberrisk prevention? And, if so, where would you start, based on your knowledge of that?

MR. BARKIN: So, sadly, I do think we should be spending more resources on cyber loss prevention. And I say that knowing that those resources don't increase productivity, and I said productivity is important to growth. But sustainability is also important to growth, and I think this is one of those things that's about sustainability.

By the way, we looked at this much in my prior world as a consultant, too, and so it's something I'm relatively familiar with. And the most important thing and I think the place to start as a business is, what information do you have that, if released to other people, would be damaging to your business or more broadly? And so the answer will differ by businesses. There are businesses that really don't have very much that matters. Obviously, a lot of retailers have credit-card numbers. You may have sensitive personal information for some of your employees or maybe even some of your customers. But understanding really clearly what's the stuff that really matters and doesn't matter.

Then the challenge is that most people think of cyber prevention as the technology. And there's something to be said about the technology, making sure that your firewalls are secure and your patches are clear. There are firms out there   (inaudible)   firms out there will do independent assessments and try to penetrate your firewalls and give you a good sense of how vulnerable you are.

The real issue you've got is human error, and human error is a massive issue. Almost all of major recent cyber things that have been in the public   think the stuff that happened in the last election   were phishing attempts that some human, who's really busy and has a hundred emails and just trying to get through the day, clicked on a link and in many cases put their password into the link, which enabled bad guys to get access to the internal systems.

And so, you know, one of great challenges   now, the good thing is this doesn't have to cost a lot of money. The bad thing is it requires a very fundamentally different   (inaudible)   culture within an organization. So it's a cultural thing that says, actually, this is a huge competitive issue to us.

You know, I used to say in my old firm that people hired us in part because we were so trustworthy personally. They were going to trust us with their secrets and their strategies, and we had to be as trustworthy technologically as we were personally   which is a really hard thing for people to get their heads around because they have great ethics and great reputations, but they don't necessarily understand what it means to be trustworthy technologically. It is different than it means to be trustworthy personally. So I really do think it's an imperative for everybody.

You may have noticed   (inaudible)   company last week talked about risks in the energy sector. And I think there's a lot of folks   a lot of bad guys out there who are targeting it, and I think it's probably the most contemporary way to steal from you. And so, you know, just like banks, you know, the armed guards, you know, you need to think about the same approach with your business.

Q: Can you speak to what the Fed is seeing in the   (inaudible)? Certainly, it's starting to occur on the West Coast   (inaudible)   years. I'm not in   (inaudible)   but it appears there are some real problems with housing or a crisis. New construction prices are going up rapidly because of   partly because of tariffs and other issues. Can you speak to how the Fed's going to   (inaudible)?

MR. BARKIN: Now, I'm   (inaudible)   in Richmond today, I'm reading prices are ridiculous.

Here's how   here's what I think is happening in the numbers. It may be different by market. Coming out of the last downturn, new home construction, you know, went through the floor and it's been very slow to come back. Part of that was we were overbuilt beforehand. Part of it was confidence. Part of it was access to funds, right? But it's been slow to come back. And I think today a large part of it is access to trade, laborers. You know, what I'm told is it's really hard to get construction workers these days to build new homes. And if you do, it costs a lot of money to do it.

At the same time, new home demand has started to rise, and part of that is you have more confidence in the economy. I think a large part of it is there's a whole millennial generation that, you know, the story was five years ago they were going to live in the cities and bike to work. And a lot of them are   they're getting older, having kids, and buying houses. And so I think home demand has gone up at the same time that home construction has been slow to come back. And, of course, what comes out of that is an increase in housing prices. That's, I think, a relatively simplistic answer to what's happening.

Whether that's a bubble and what the impacts of the bubble are is worth a conversation. I mean, one definition of a bubble is, are prices higher than the long-term rates would imply? And I do think it's market-dependent, of course, but there are many markets where that's true. In our role as regulators and also overseers of the economy, we try to ask the question of whether banks are overexposed. That's the kind of bubble we had in '07-'08. It wasn't just pricing; it was also financial market overexposure.

And we do not have any sense that that's the case right now. In fact, like I said, if there's anything we've worked hard to prevent, it's overexposure, you know, in bank balance sheets. So we may be wrong, but we're pretty comfortable with that right now.

MODERATOR: Any other questions?

One last question, if I may. Could you comment on the opioid crisis and also on student loans? I hear that is a   is that an issue? Is that a concern   (inaudible)?

MR. BARKIN: I think both are   both are concerns.

On the   for us, we see the opioid   our team in Richmond has done a lot of research on it. We think hard about, you know, what it takes to get folks into the labor force. I talked about our district. Labor participation in our district is in the low 60s   61, 62, 63 (percent)   in every state in our district except for West Virginia, where it's 51 percent. So there's 10 percent fewer parts of the population who are looking for work or working. And I'm told a lot of it has to do with, you know, the opioid issue. So I'm also told by a lot of folks who are trying to hire tradesmen and truck drivers that they can't pass a drug test, and so that's another inhibitor. And so doing something to get, you know, good folks clean so that they can work I think is a huge   (inaudible)   for our economy. And I'm sure it's true in multiple markets around here, too.

On student loans, student-loan debt is high, and we do watch that closely. I think the question is student-loan debt as a percentage of total consumer debt or as a percentage of the total economy is not a huge number, so we don't at this point see massive risk to the economy for student-loan debt.

I will say that we see massive risk to the individuals. You know, as I said before, 40 percent of the people who enter college aren't graduating. So there's no doubt that the outcomes if you go to college and graduate are better than the outcomes if you don't, but sadly the outcomes if you go to college and don't graduate aren't meaningfully better than the outcomes if you don't go to college at all, and   except that we now have no better outcomes and a lot of debt. And so we really worry about the debt more on an individual basis than we do even on a collective-economy basis. So, of course, we're paying attention to it on a collective-economy basis.

Nordic Capital Buys Data Platform Macrobond

Nordic Capital bought Swedish economic data platform Macrobond Financial AB as private-equity interest in financial technology continues to surge.

The deal is Nordic's fifth from its  4.3 billion ninth fund, which the firm said closed in May, 23% above its target. The size of the transaction was not disclosed.

The company's founders, including Chief Executive Tomas Liljeborg, are reinvesting alongside Nordic, the person familiar with the matter said.

Macrobond was founded in 2008 in Malm, Sweden, and has since opened offices in London and New York. It runs a platform that lets users access a database of macroeconomic and financial information, analyze data and build charts. Its clients range from banks and institutional investors to universities.

"The demand of financial big data analysis and visualization is increasing continuously and Macrobond's management team has an outstanding proven track record in financial software analytics," said Nordic Capital Partner Fredrik Nslun.

Macrobond fits with two popular themes among private-equity firms. As a software-as-a-service platform, it offers the prospect of stable revenue and loyal customers. Its core offering, financial data, is also in demand among private-equity investors.

In one of the largest-ever private-equity deals, a group led by Blackstone Group LP agreed in January to buy a majority stake in Thomson Reuters Corp.'s data and terminal business for $17 billion.

Smaller data deals this year included Citic Capital Partners' purchase of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC's market intelligence arm for $180.5 million and Phoenix Equity Partners' 95 million purchase of economic forecaster Capital Economics Ltd.

Nordic Capital has a long history of backing fintech companies. Last year it scored a notable success with the  1.5 billion sale of payments company Bambora AB to French rival Ingenico Group. The exit delivered a five-times return on Nordic's investment, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.

The value of private equity-backed European fintech deals is already close to $10 billion this year, compared with $5.2 billion in 2017, according to data provider PitchBook Data Inc. This year's total was boosted by Hellman & Friedman's $5.3 billion take-private of Danish payments firm Nets A/S, which completed in February.

At this rate, 2018 may be the biggest year for buyout firms investing in European fintech, surpassing 2014 when total deal value hit $13 billion, according to PitchBook.

Nearly a decade ago, we decided to ask professionals from across the private-equity and venture-capital industries what they were reading, and our first annual summer reading list was born. This year's contributors include limited partners and general partners, both from long-established firms and newer ones. Although their individual preferences vary, their contributions reflect a shared intellectual curiosity and love of reading.

Christopher Ailman, chief investment officer, California State Teachers' Retirement System

"The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing" by Benjamin Graham

"As a primer for the beginning investor, it's an oldie, but a goodie."

"Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics" by Richard H. Thaler

"A fun read for economics nerds like me."

Beth Ferreira, managing director, FirstMark Capital

"3 Kings: Diddy, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, and Hip-Hop's Multibillion-Dollar Rise" by Zack O'Malley Greenburg

"I'm reading this book because I am fascinated by opportunities in cultural movements. In this case, what created the opportunity to develop large lasting lifestyle brands like Beats by Dre or Diddy's Croc vodka."

Britt Harris, chief executive, University of Texas Investment Management Co.

"Predicting the Markets: A Professional Autobiography" by Edward Yardeni

"Traversing the financial markets is a dangerous and often treacherous undertaking. It can also be rewarding. We need a guide who has traveled the terrain over many years and under all kinds of unusual conditions. Ed Yardeni is that guide for America, and this book lays out a vast array of information that will be helpful for every investor who hopes to make their journey a success."

Pam Hendrickson, chief operating officer and vice chairman, Riverside Co.

"Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption" by Bryan Stevenson

"It's a memoir by a world class lawyer who defends people on death row! We are all implicated when we allow others to be mistreated. A story about the importance of mercy and compassion."

Julia Kahr, senior managing director, Blackstone Group LP

"Pachinko" by Min Jin Lee

"I read modern fiction as a way to relax and decompress.  Pachinko' captured my imagination not only because it is a lovely family saga crossing multiple generations in Japan and Korea, but also because the theme of insularity between these two countries is relevant to much of the geopolitical discourse today."

Andrew Kuper, chief executive, LeapFrog Investments

"Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World" by Jack Weatherford

"This revisionist history tackles many Western myths about the history of societies and governance in the East. Genghis and his successors, far from overseeing brutal hordes, were enlightened innovators in both economics and governance. Some of the book's arguments are overblown or inaccurate, but overall it leads us to rethink the foundations of the modern world, especially Asia and other emerging markets, in which we invest."

Kyle Lefkoff, general partner, Boulder Ventures

"How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence" by Michael Pollan

"The medical history of psychedelic drugs and their resurgence as a treatment for depression and addiction. I've loved Pollan's books about food in the past, which combine his first-person accounts with solid history and context. This one was great, too, and should spark an important public discussion around the proper use of LSD and psilocybin in the modern practice of psychiatry."

Adam Levin, partner, Bain Capital Ventures

"The Old Man and the Sea" by Ernest Hemingway

"I am heading to Cuba over Labor Day weekend so decided to start rereading  The Old Man and the Sea.' The last time I read it, I was in seventh grade. I always try to read a work of fiction set in my future travel destination before a trip. Hemingway illustrates the essence of the country through this sense of magical realism, as he details an elderly Cuban fisherman &out at sea looking for a giant marlin. The language is simple, yet the story hits on the complex themes of triumph and loss."

Roger McNamee, co-founder, Elevation Partners

"Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy" by Siva Vaidhyanathan

"The country has entrusted the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections to Facebook, along with Twitter and Google. Is that a good idea or total insanity? Professor Siva Vaidhyanathan of the University of Virginia has studied the issue and shares his perspective in a brilliant book."

Mike Miles, advisory director, Berkshire Partners

"The Bitter Woods: The Battle of the Bulge" by John S.D. Eisenhower

"Although it gets pretty deep into the detail of troop units and positions, it gives a very readable and credible (the author was Ike's son) account of one of the most important battles Americans have ever fought. It also covers how pride and what seem like petty jealousies almost sidetracked the British-American alliance. If those issues can impact great leaders like Eisenhower, Bradley and Montgomery in the midst of the most important enterprise of the 20th century, it should not surprise us that they crop up in other organizations all the time."

Tricia Patrick, managing director, Advent International

"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, "Why We Can't Wait" by Martin Luther King Jr. and "The Banker's Wife" by Cristina Alger ("Who was in my Goldman Sachs analyst class and is now a highly published author")

"Nonfiction is wonderful for keeping the mind enriched, but getting lost in great fiction is almost meditative."

Jackie Rantanen, managing director, Hamilton Lane

"The Ambition Decisions: What Women Know About Work, Family, and the Path to Building a Life" by Hana Schank and Elizabeth Wallace

"I'm intrigued by this profile of a group of female classmates 20 years after they graduated from Northwestern, and the diversity of life and career choices they've made along the way. It speaks to the evolving definitions of success for women."

Gary Sernovitz, managing director, Lime Rock Partners

"Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup" by John Carreyrou

"When reading  Bad Blood,' the story of the Theranos blood-testing startup fraud by The Wall Street Journal investigate reporter who unmasked it, I alternated between two conclusions. One was that the fraud, which resulted in a $9 billion valuation at its peak, was so wild, odd, brazen, and sociopathic that there is nothing of practical use to professional investors. The second conclusion, though, was that Theranos is a case study in why we need professional, industry-specialist investors to separate optimism from hype and to not allocate capital to bad ideas and bad people. But whether  Bad Blood' is practical or not, the book should qualify for your summer reading list for the most basic reason: It is a fun, fast, detailed, alive and surprising read that's hard to put down."

Dave Tamburri, managing partner, Health Enterprise Partners

"Hit Makers: How to Succeed in an Age of Distraction" by Derek Thompson

"The way we shape our message to the market about a product or service is based on science and art. In  Hit Makers,' Thompson uses a variety of examples to highlight the  customer paradox' consumers innately want something both partly new as well as somewhat familiar."

Brendan Wallace, managing partner, Fifth Wall Ventures

"Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence" by Max Tegmark

"A remarkably accessible book that delves into the complex social, economic and ethical implications of superhuman AI. Most of us are familiar with Hollywood-esque, dystopian depictions of AI as  Terminator' robots indiscriminately killing humans. However, to Tegmark, evil robots are a theatrical distraction from the real risk: a general intelligence that exceeds our own. Life 3.0's focus is on the nature of intelligence itself and why general intelligence, and perhaps even consciousness, need not be confined to the neurons and tissue of the human brain."

This column appeared in the August 2018 issue of Private Equity Analyst, a monthly magazine published by WSJ Pro.

Carrick Capital Partners is ramping up its investment in Discovery Health Partners, nearly three years after the firm initially backed the company.

The growth investment firm has purchased a majority stake in Discovery, betting the provider of cloud-based services to health plans and other health-care organizations will continue to expand its reach.

Based in Itasca, Ill., Discovery offers a platform that helps clients such as health insurers manage their payments and revenue-collecting processes. That includes ensuring that payment requests are legitimate and that insurers are compensated for the services they provide, particularly by government-sponsored programs such as Medicare, said Steve Unterberger, a managing director at Carrick.

Carrick "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150818eb8iqg8r7?mod=undefined" Discovery in 2015, investing $22.5 million in its parent company, LaunchPoint Ventures LLC. Discovery today has more than 70 customers in the U.S., including regional and national health-care plans, Mr. Unterberger said.

Discovery in January named Jason Brown as its new chief executive. The company is working on new business tools based on data analytics and machine learning that it expects will help add new customers, Mr. Unterberger noted.

Carrick invests in companies that use technology to make business processes more efficient, focusing on three areas: software as a service, business process outsourcing and transaction processing. The firm, which has offices in San Francisco and Newport Beach, Calif., typically targets businesses with annual revenue of $20 million to $100 million and positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to its website.

The firm recently invested $80 million to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/carrick-capital-invests-80-million-to-take-a-minority-stake-in-exiger-1531159496?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" in Exiger LLC, a provider of regulatory, financial-crime, risk and compliance consulting services and technology. The deal was one of the largest in Carrick's history, Mr. Unterberger said.

Carrick's other portfolio companies include "https://www.wsj.com/articles/carrick-backs-perfect-sense-with-22-million-investment-1484312400?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4", a software maker that helps businesses produce digital content; and Saviynt Inc., a provider of cloud-security and identity-governance services.

Hastings hints at string of shareholder payouts despite cost pressure

Hastings, the UK insurance group, has pushed up its half-year dividend by a tenth and suggested that more generous payouts could be on the way.

The company said on Thursday that it had met its leverage target, which would allow it to  move towards a policy of increasing distributions to shareholders over time. 

Hastings also joined the growing chorus of insurance companies complaining about rising costs.

 We have 	. 	. 	. 	seen adverse weather, continued fraud activity across the market, and some increase in the cost of repairs and mid-range bodily injury claims, resulting in a claims inflation outlook for the full year towards the upper end of a 3 per cent to 5 per cent range,  said chief executive Toby van der Meer.

Although Hastings managed to push up its prices by 2 per cent in the first half of the year, premiums more generally have been falling. Claims inflation could reverse that trend, however.

Overall, net profits grew 25 per cent to 72.9m, partly because of a VAT recovery.

Mr van der Meer said:   We remain excited about the future   a fast moving and increasingly digital landscape plays to our strengths. Our capabilities in agile pricing, analytics and anti-fraud combined with our disciplined underwriting and strong capital position means we are well positioned to continue to identify and grow in profitable parts of the market.

Facebook Asks Banks for Customer Data

Corrections & Amplifications

A July 26 decline in Facebook Inc. shares shaved more than $119 billion from the company's value. An Aug. 7 Page One article about Facebook's discussions with banks about possibly sharing data incorrectly said that the decline was more than $120 billion.

(WSJ August 15, 2018)

(END)

Facebook Inc. wants your financial data.

The social-media giant has asked large U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about their customers, including card transactions and checking-account balances, as part of an effort to offer new services to users.

Facebook increasingly wants to be a platform where people buy and sell goods and services, besides connecting with friends. The company over the past year asked JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc. and U.S. Bancorp to discuss potential offerings it could host for bank customers on Facebook Messenger, people familiar with the matter said.

Facebook has talked about a feature that would show its users their checking-account balances, the people said. It has also pitched fraud alerts, some of the people said.

Data privacy is a sticking point in the banks' conversations with Facebook, said people familiar with the matter. The talks are taking place as Facebook faces several investigations over its ties to political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which accessed data on as many 87 million Facebook users without their consent.

One large U.S. bank pulled away from the talks due to privacy concerns, some of the people said.

Facebook has told banks that the additional customer information could be used to offer services that might entice users to spend more time on Messenger, a person familiar with the discussions said. The company is trying to deepen user engagement: Investors shaved more than $120 billion from its market value in one day last month after it said its growth is starting to slow.

Facebook said it wouldn't use the bank data for ad-targeting purposes or share it with third parties.

"We don't use purchase data from banks or credit-card companies for ads," spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana said. "We also don't have special relationships, partnerships or contracts with banks or credit-card companies to use their customers' purchase data for ads."

Facebook shares climbed sharply Monday on the news, rising 4.45%, marking the biggest one-day gain since last month's historic drop.

Banks face pressure to build relationships with big online platforms, which reach billions of users and drive a growing share of commerce. They also are trying to reach more users digitally. Many struggle to gain traction in mobile payments.

Yet banks are hesitant to hand too much control to third-party platforms such as Facebook. They prefer to keep customers on their own websites and apps.

As part of the proposed deals, Facebook asked banks for information about where their users are shopping with their debit and credit cards outside of purchases they make using Facebook Messenger, the people said. Messenger has some 1.3 billion monthly active users, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on the company's second-quarter earnings call last month.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Amazon.com Inc. also have asked banks to share data if they join with them, in order to provide basic banking services on applications such as Google Assistant and Alexa, according to people familiar with the conversations.

"Like many online companies, we routinely talk to financial institutions about how we can improve people's commerce experiences, like enabling better customer service," Facebook's Ms. Diana said. "An essential part of these efforts is keeping people's information safe and secure."

Facebook has taken a harder public line on privacy since the Cambridge Analytica uproar. A product privacy team has announced new features such as "clear history," which would allow users to prevent the service from collecting their off-Facebook browsing details. It also is making efforts to alert users to its privacy settings.

That hasn't assuaged concerns over Facebook's privacy practices. Bank executives are worried about the breadth of information being sought, even if it means their bank might not being available on certain platforms their customers use. Bank customers would need to opt-in to the proposed Facebook services, the company said in a statement Monday.

JPMorgan isn't "sharing our customers' off-platform transaction data with these platforms, and have had to say no to some things as a result," spokeswoman Trish Wexler said.

Banks view mobile commerce as one of their biggest opportunities but are still running behind technology firms such as PayPal Holdings Inc. and Square Inc. Customers have moved slowly, too; many Americans still prefer using credit or debit cards, along with cash and checks.

In an effort to compete with PayPal's Venmo, a group of large banks last year connected their smartphone apps to money-transfer network Zelle. Results are mixed so far: While usage has risen, many banks still aren't on the platform.

In recent years, Facebook has tried to transform Messenger into a hub for customer service and commerce, in keeping with a broader trend among mobile messaging services.

A partnership with American Express Co. allows Facebook users to contact the card company's representatives. Last year, Facebook struck a deal with PayPal that allows users of that payment service to send money through Messenger. And Mastercard Inc. cardholders can place online orders with certain merchants through Messenger using the card company's Masterpass digital wallet. (A Mastercard spokesman said Facebook doesn't see the card users' information.)

Data-driven analytics are helping to transform cities.

StreetLight Data Inc., a data startup used by transportation planners and mobility companies, may be one of the prime players powering the so-called smart cities movement by crunching big data about city streets.

Clients of the company range from private-sector transportation engineers to city planners to ride-sharing startups like Uber. They use StreetLight's technology to gain detailed insights about traffic patterns to inform designs of city infrastructure projects, solve traffic problems and plan mobility services like bike sharing and even flying taxis, said Laura Schewel, StreetLight Data's founder and chief executive.

Her company just raised a $10 million Series C round in a deal funded by existing investors Osage Venture Partners, Engie New Ventures and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners. It has raised a total of $27.4 million since it was founded in 2011.

Ms. Schewel said the San Francisco-based company intends to nearly double its 42-person staff in the next 18 months with the new capital. She declined to provide financial specifics but said revenue growth has doubled annually for several years and should continue "at that pace."

Veery Maxwell, a director of Energy Innovation: Policy and Technology LLC, will join the company's board in conjunction with the funding.

High-Speed Adjusting Trips Insurers

By Leslie Scism and Nicole Friedman

Property insurers are relying on more drones, small aircraft and artificial intelligence to accelerate claims during 2018's hurricane season. There are signs this push for speed could pose new headaches for the industry.

Last year marked the first widespread use of aerial technology to pinpoint damages and evaluate losses quickly as insurers scrambled to keep up with back-to-back hurricanes and wildfires.

But some insurers have reopened claims from that period because initial repair estimates turned out to be too low, according to executives and regulators.

Everest Re Group Ltd., which offers insurance coverage to other insurers, said last week it increased its estimated 2017 net catastrophe losses by $400 million partly because many customers had to reopen claims in Florida and Puerto Rico.

"Settling claims quickly was initially a sound strategy, but what we now know is that this approach left our clients vulnerable when the actual repair bills came in higher than at what they originally closed their claim," Chief Executive Dominic Addesso said on a conference call last week.

Insurers are testing a number of new tools as they try to speed up what still can be a clunky, time-consuming claims process. That includes everything from drones and small airplanes to assess damage without the help of an on-site adjuster to smartphone apps that let consumers submit their own damage photos. Some insurers are identifying property damage before policyholders even reach out to report a claim.

It took 16.5 days on average in 2017 for policyholders to receive payments for residential property damage after notifying their insurers, according to a J.D. Power survey released this year. That was down from 17.4 days in 2016 but still longer than the average time earlier in the decade.

Several large insurers said they are using flights, drones and aerial imagery more frequently in 2018. Allstate Corp. settled 16,500 claims this way in the first half of this year, compared with 12,600 for all of 2017.

Allstate also is expanding its use of a program called "Virtual Assist" that reduces the need for an adjuster to visit a site in person. Instead a service provider broadcasts the damage to an office-based adjuster via streaming video. In the first half of 2018, Allstate resolved 47,500 claims this way, up from 6,100 in all of 2017.

Virtual Assist addresses a problem that surfaced last year: a shortage of adjusters, which contributed to claims delays. The program eliminates travel time for adjusters, according to Allstate, allowing them to be more efficient.

American International Group Inc., another property insurer, launched a system last year with data feeds, analytics and forecasting models, so loss-prevention specialists can monitor wildfires and storms and their proximity to policyholders. AIG can then dispatch teams to clear brush or transport valuables.

"The name of the game today is preparation and mitigation as much as claim response afterward," said Jerry Hourihan, president of AIG's Private Client Group.

Some customers, like Stephen Dunn in Houston, are pleased with the industry's efforts to speed things up. He said a motion sensor installed on his doorbell alerted his phone to rising water levels during the 2017 arrival of Hurricane Harvey. He was able to take pictures remotely using the doorbell and send the photos to his insurer, USAA. Within two days USAA declared the cars in Mr. Dunn's garage a total loss and deposited money in his bank account.

"I had no idea that they would resolve this so quickly," he said.

Older policyholders have more reservations about some speed-enhancing tools, according to a 2017 study by J.D. Power. Policyholders older than 53 years who filed an auto claim via a photo app on a smartphone, tablet or computer were less satisfied than peers going the traditional route, according to J.D. Power. Younger customers, on the other hand, were more satisfied.

"Now the insurer is saying, 'You need to do the work. Be sure you photograph the damage and send us a photo,'" said David Pieffer, a J.D. Power insurance practice leader.

After nearly four decades in the military, retired Adm. Michael Rogers is making his first move in the private sector.

The former National Security Agency director has joined the board of directors of cybersecurity insurance startup CyberCube Analytics Inc. He was introduced to company leaders at a party following his retirement in the spring, CyberCube Chief Executive Pascal Millaire said.

CyberCube, which spun out of Symantec in March, is one of several companies seeking to model cyberrisk for the insurance industry. The company also has received venture backing from ForgePoint Capital.

Mr. Rogers, who was traveling and wasn't available for an interview, is just the latest national security veteran to take on roles at startups. Former National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander serves as chief executive of IronNet. Retired Gen. Peter Pace has board seats with AlienVault Inc. and Qualys Inc. Former NSA Director Mike McConnell serves on the board of IronNet.

Mr. Millaire said the insurance industry and national security agencies are trying to determine how to measure cyberrisk. He said Mr. Rogers can use his military experience to help the company predict catastrophic cybersecurity attacks.

"In essence, the insurance industry is faced with very similar problems to the NSA and [the Pentagon's] Cyber Command arm," Mr. Millaire said.

P2P lenders fear new FCA proposals would deter retail investors

Britain s peer-to-peer lending industry fears being stripped of one of its key advantages, after the UK regulator proposed to block the access of many retail investors, alarming some senior executives in the nascent sector.

 This is a moment,  said Rhydian Lewis, chief executive of RateSetter   one of the UK s biggest peer-to-peer lending platforms.  They are looking to restrict this new industry and it is wrong. This is how things get stymied. 

Mr Lewis, who co-founded RateSetter in 2010 and has since overseen more than 2.6bn of consumer loans on the platform, said he would fight back by providing data to disprove the regulator s claim that peer-to-peer lenders are a high-risk investment.

His frustration stems fromthe consultation paperpublished just over a week ago by the Financial Conduct Authority, which proposed placing the same restrictions on peer-to-peer lenders that already apply to high-risk platforms, such as equity crowdfunding sites.

This would mean that to invest in peer-to-peer loans, investors would in future have to be certified as sophisticated, be very wealthy, be advised by an authorised person, or certify they will not invest more than 10 per cent of their net assets.

Mr Lewis said this contradicted the support the government and regulators have provided for the peer-to-peer lending sector, once hailed as a way to  democratise  finance by giving borrowers an alternative to banks and savers a way to earn more on their money.

Online platforms that match investors with borrowers, UK peer-to-peer lenders have grown rapidly, fuelled recently by last year s launch of Innovative Finance Individual Savings Accounts   government-approved, tax-free accounts.

In 2016, they increased net lending by 40 per cent, providing 1.23bn of loans to small businesses   equal to 15 per cent of all new SME loans by UK banks   and similar amounts of consumer and property loans, according to theCambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.

 On the one hand they are talking about the promotion of competition   the UK likes to be ahead on fintech   and on the other hand they have come to a fork in the road and they have chosen to be risk-averse,  said Mr Lewis.

The FCA s own impact assessment suggested its proposals could significantly change the industry. It said a survey of 4,500 investors in peer-to-peer loans found that four out of 10 had invested more than their annual income and a fifth had invested double that amount.

 We can infer from this that a significant number of them are likely to be putting more than 10 per cent of their net investible wealth into P2P lending,  the FCA said.  The proposals should make investors less likely to be overexposed to such assets and limit their potential losses. 

 We have also seen some poor business practices, particularly among some P2P platforms,  the FCA said. It cited a number of  potential and actual harms  for investors, including unreliable performance, disorderly failure, buying unsuitable products, poor customer treatment and setting prices too high or the quality of service too low.

Some smaller peer-to-peer lenders have collapsed under a cloud in recent years. In March, 21m of investors' money was put at risk when Manchester-based Collateral entered administration. Three years ago, Stockholm-listed TrustBuddy collapsed with a similar amount of investors  money trapped on its platform after finding some of it had gone missing.

The FCA signalled its main concern was to prepare for the next downturn.  So far, losses and defaults across the P2P sector have been low,  it said.  However, it is important to recognise that the sector is still relatively new and has not been through a full economic cycle. When economic conditions tighten, losses on loans and investments may increase. 

The regulator s plan could complicate the plans for an initial public offering at Funding Circle, the UK s biggest peer-to-peer lender that has made 3.8bn of loans to small businesses. But a person close to Funding Circle said the FCA proposals would benefit the largest platforms.

Paul Smee, chair of the Peer-to-Peer Finance Association, gave amixed responseto the consultation paper, saying:  Peer-to-peer lending needs to make its full contribution to the growth of the UK economy and we will be working to ensure that new regulatory requirements do not get in the way. 

Further fintech fascination

Data gold rushChina represents a giant playground for data-loving quantitative traders, given how much is readily available from vast, digital-savvy private companies and a state that is keen to take advantage of big data s benefits and relatively nonchalant over privacy. Even China s tech giants are getting involved. In December, search company Baidu partnered with E Fund Management, an asset manager, to create E Fund Yibai Intelligent Quantitative Strategy fund, which uses searches, news articles, social media and  Baidu s data-processing ability  to trade.

Backing up bitcoinIntercontinental Exchange, the world s second-largest exchange group by market value, has deepened its involvement in digital currencies with a new company that aims to make them mainstream for institutional investors and consumers. The Atlanta-based group announced plans to launch Bakkt, a business that plans to build infrastructure allowing easier use of digital currencies for everyday transactions.It s hard to buy coffee with bitcoin, but Starbucks may be poised to make that easier,Bloomberg reports.

Fundraising Pulls Back as Investors Get Defensive; U.S. fundraising declines in the first half across a range of fund types, as investors become pickier about which groups they back.

Private-equity fundraising took a breather in the first half of the year, as flat public markets and fears of a slowdown caused investors to back off from the record-setting commitment pace of recent years.

The long private-equity fundraising boom didn't show any signs of stopping during the first six months of the year, but the level of investment tapered off from perhaps the highest ever to merely very good. Overall capital raised by private-equity and venture funds in the U.S. declined by a modest 13% to $173.05 billion from $199.92 billion during the same period a year earlier, according to LP Source, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro Private Equity publisher Dow Jones & Co. Capital raised dropped across nearly all major fund categories except for venture capital, and the overall number of fund closings dropped across the board.

The $121.25 billion raised by U.S. corporate-finance funds in the first half is a healthy sum by historical standards, but 15% lower than the 2017 pace, and the 210 funds that held closings represented a 14% drop, according to LP Source data.

Demand for private-equity funds is holding steady but isn't increasing as it did through 2016 and 2017. The stock market was flat over the first six months of 2018, which took pressure off limited partners to increase allocations to keep up with a rising market. Distributions have relaxed somewhat, reducing the urgency to keep pushing money out the door.

There also has been a subtle but clear shift by some LPs into a more risk-averse pose, industry observers said. Wary of signs of froth in the market, investors have become more selective when committing to new managers, and some have started to favor countercyclical strategies.

"We're starting to see an increased interest on the part of investors in defensive strategies," said Kevin Naughton, who co-leads the private-funds group at Credit Suisse Asset Management.

Fundraising declined across a broad swath of corporate-finance-fund types compared with the first half of 2017. Traditional buyout funds raised $53.24 billion, or 24% less capital than the same period last year. Growth and expansion funds raised 7% less than they did during the first half of 2017, while industry-focused funds rounded up 5% less. Meanwhile, capital collected for real-assets funds dropped 38%.

The only categories of U.S. corporate-finance funds that collected more money than they did a year earlier were restructuring and distressed-debt funds, which raised 3% more, and diversified private-equity funds, which raised 95% more. The latter category represents funds that invest across a broader capital structure than just buyouts, including venture and growth investments.

The popularity of distressed and diversified funds reflects concerns that high asset prices are making it harder for straight-down-the-middle buyout vehicles to earn the exceptional returns they once generated. Leverage multiples and underwriting criteria are becoming a bigger part of the due-diligence process, and LPs want to back sponsors that can unearth value in an overpriced market. As a result, so-called deep-value strategies, which target underpriced assets, and sponsors with specific operational expertise are becoming more in demand, placement agents said.

The largest distressed or restructuring fund to close in the first half was Strategic Value Partners' latest special-situations fund, which held a final closing on $2.85 billion, while the largest diversified private-equity fund to close was General Atlantic's General Atlantic Investment Partners 2017 LP, which closed with at least $3.29 billion.

There have been other surges of interest in distressed funds in recent years for instance, following the 2014 oil-price decline and after the late-2015 stock selloffs in the U.S. and China but managers often have struggled to access deals, as corporate defaults have remained low.

Nonetheless, after nearly a decade of economic expansion, many investors again feel confident that distressed funds will have their moment, if not this year then within the long-term time frame of a private-equity vehicle.

"Those that are interested in deep value and distressed are willing to sacrifice short-term performance for long-term outperformance," said Eric Zoller, founder of placement agent Sixpoint Partners.

Overall, the first half saw a lull in the fundraising cycle for the biggest managers, after Apollo Global Management LLC, KKR & Co., Silver Lake and others closed funds in the double-digit billions last year. The largest buyout fund that held a final closing in the first half of 2018 was American Securities' newest vehicle, which gathered $7 billion.

As the fundraising cycle accelerated in recent years and firms have shortened the interval between funds, re-ups with large, established firms have taken up a larger proportion of LPs' available cash. But when backing new groups, they often look for niche strategies such as ones with operational or sector specialties, or strategies that aren't correlated with broader markets, said Peter Martenson, a partner with placement agent Eaton Partners.

"If they're adding new strategies to developed programs, they're no longer going for broader generalist strategies," he said.

Along with an increase in operators raising funds, there has been a "continued resurgence" in venture and growth investing, said Mr. Martenson. For some LPs, high deal prices make quickly-expanding companies more appealing, Mr. Zoller said.

Growth-equity or expansion funds raised in the first half include Providence Equity Partners' Providence Strategic Growth III LP, which gathered $1.3 billion, and a $2.4 billion vehicle Thoma Bravo closed to back midmarket software deals.

However, there is some skepticism about tech buyouts, a sector many investors view as oversaturated. That isn't likely to stop the hottest players from raising new funds Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity Partners are both in the process of raising funds targeting more than $10 billion, for instance but many investors want to see more exits of recent big-money deals before committing more capital, placement agents said.

The private-debt market also strikes some LPs as oversaturated, with a number of firms having launched debt platforms in recent years. Private-debt fundraising fell 52% in the first half compared with the same period last year, and the number of closings declined by 26%. The bar for new investment in credit has risen simply because the field is so crowded with managers raising money, placement agents said.

Venture Capitalists Raise More Capital for Fewer Funds

Venture-capital firms continue to benefit from LP appetite for the latest hot startups this year as large offerings help drive fundraising totals.

During the first half, venture firms raised $26.66 billion, up about 19% from $22.33 billion in the first half of last year, driven partly by $6 billion raised for Sequoia Capital's global growth fund, according to LP Source. The overall number of funds raised declined by about 7%, however, to 297 funds during the first half from 321 offerings during the same period last year.

Fundraising accelerated in the second quarter with $17.74 billion raised, up 22% from $14.49 billion during the year-ago period. Even excluding Sequoia's fund, U.S. funds raised $11.74 billion in the quarter, which is the industry's largest quarterly haul since the second quarter of last year, when New Enterprise Associates closed its $3.3 billion fund.

Although industry veterans such as CRV, Meritech Capital Partners and Sequoia enjoyed fundraising success during the first half, investors also showed a willingness to bet on newer groups. At least 29 debut funds, often ones focused on very narrow strategies, have formed this year as of July 18, according to LP Source.

The increase of capital pouring into late-stage funds hasn't slowed down, thanks almost entirely to Sequoia's new fund. That fund accounted for the lion's share of the $7.46 billion raised by nine late-stage offerings during the first half.

Firms that invest across multiple venture-capital stages saw the overall number of funds that held closings increase more dramatically than capital raised. During the first half, 68 funds raised money, up 19% from 57 funds that held closings in last year's first half. Capital collected, however, only rose by 9% during those periods to $10.23 billion during the first six months of this year.

Early-stage funds collected $8.30 billion in the first half, slightly less than the $8.48 billion raised in the comparable period last year. However, the number of early-stage closings declined by 17% to 202 fund closings during the first half from 244 in the year-earlier period. Early-stage investors that raised funds this year include veteran firms 8VC, Matrix Partners, Emergence Capital, Madrona Venture Group, Redpoint Ventures and Venrock, as well as newcomer Unusual Ventures.

Despite the increasing amount of capital flowing into startups, LPs continue to seek out venture funds where they can find strong returns, said Tim Porter, a managing director at Madrona, which recently raised a $300 million early-stage fund for startups in the Pacific Northwest.

"The LP community is receptive, assuming you post strong returns," he said.

Large Secondary Firms Pause to Reload

Fundraising for secondary vehicles has cooled off after a few years of furious growth, with $9.18 billion raised by U.S. and European managers in the first half, down substantially from $17.49 billion raised during the first half of 2017. When calculating secondary fund totals, WSJ Pro Private Equity combines U.S. and European data because those managers often invest their funds globally.

The decline from last year's first half stems from the fact that few, if any, of the largest secondary firms held big closings during the first six months of this year.

The first half belonged largely to firms targeting smaller deals or specialized strategies, including HQ Capital, PineBridge Investments and RCP Advisors. Among the largest funds to raise capital during the first half were a $1.75 billion real-assets secondary fund from Blackstone Group LP's Strategic Partners unit and a new midmarket-focused vehicle being marketed by Deutsche Bank AG spinout Glendower Capital. Glendower closed on $1.3 billion for the fund, putting it about halfway to a $2.5 billion hard cap.

The secondary fundraising lull comes as secondary deal making continues to move at a record pace. During the first half, alone, secondary deal volume hit $27 billion, putting it on track to exceed the record level hit in 2017, according to intermediary Greenhill & Co.

But the fundraising lull may be short-lived. Firms that include Coller Capital, Ardian and Lexington Partners are pitching massive new funds to investors. Lexington, for one, is expected to hold a substantial closing of its next flagship fund before year-end, said people with knowledge of the firm.

Preparing for a Second-Half Bump

Although it was a relatively quiet first half for the biggest private-equity firms, and a crowded field for the smaller players, sponsors with creative fund strategies remain in demand. As the year continues to unfold, anticipated closings from larger players such as Thoma Bravo, Vista, TCV and Lexington could substantially boost totals by year-end. Early in the third quarter, for example, Insight Venture Partners closed its 10th tech-focused fund at $6.3 billion.

The largest firms still dominate the fundraising market, but as their returns fall, investors are seeking out niche strategies for the kind of home-run returns that large-cap funds no longer consistently offer, said Christopher Godfrey, president of private-equity analytics company Cepres GmbH.

"Investors tend to be more attracted to the brand names for security but are looking around the fringes for increased performance," he said.

Insurers Are Speeding Up Claims. Their Worry: More Mistakes; Aerial technology such as drones was used widely last year to evaluate damage amid back-to-back disasters

Property insurers are relying on more drones, small aircraft and artificial intelligence to accelerate claims during 2018's hurricane season. There are signs this push for speed could pose new headaches for the industry.

Last year marked the first widespread use of aerial technology to pinpoint damages and evaluate losses quickly as insurers scrambled to keep up with "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricanes-earthquakes-rack-up-huge-bill-for-insurers-1506945600" and wildfires.

But some insurers have reopened claims from that period because initial repair estimates turned out to be too low, according to executives and regulators.

Everest Re Group Ltd., which offers insurance coverage to other insurers, said last week it increased its estimated 2017 net catastrophe losses by $400 million partly because many customers had to reopen claims in Florida and Puerto Rico.

"Settling claims quickly was initially a sound strategy, but what we now know is that this approach left our clients vulnerable when the actual repair bills came in higher than at what they originally closed their claim," Chief Executive Dominic Addesso said on a conference call last week.

Insurers are testing a number of new tools as they try to speed up what still can be a clunky, time-consuming claims process. That includes everything from drones and small airplanes to assess damage without the help of an on-site adjuster to smartphone apps that let consumers submit their own damage photos. Some insurers are identifying property damage before policyholders even reach out to report a claim.

It took 16.5 days on average in 2017 for policyholders to receive payments for residential property damage after notifying their insurers, according to a J.D. Power survey released this year. That was down from 17.4 days in 2016 but still longer than the average time earlier in the decade.

Several large insurers said they are using flights, drones and aerial imagery more frequently in 2018. Allstate Corp. settled 16,500 claims this way in the first half of this year, compared with 12,600 for all of 2017.

Allstate is also expanding its use of a program called "Virtual Assist" that reduces the need for an adjuster to visit a site in person. Instead a service provider will broadcast the damage to an office-based adjuster via streaming video. In the first half of 2018 Allstate resolved 47,500 claims this way, up from 6,100 in all of 2017.

Virtual Assist addresses a problem that surfaced last year: a shortage of adjusters, which contributed to claims delays. The program eliminates travel time for adjusters, according to Allstate, allowing them to be more efficient.

American International Group Inc., another property insurer, launched a system last year with data feeds, analytics and forecasting models, so loss-prevention specialists can monitor wildfires and storms and their proximity to policyholders. AIG can then dispatch teams to clear brush or transport valuables.

"The name of the game today is preparation and mitigation as much as claim response afterward," said Jerry Hourihan, president of AIG's Private Client Group.

Some customers, like Stephen Dunn in Houston, are pleased with the industry's efforts to speed things up. He said a motion sensor installed on his doorbell alerted his phone to rising water levels during the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-months-after-harvey-houston-continues-to-count-the-cost-1509442203". He was able to take pictures remotely using the doorbell and send the photos to his insurer, USAA. Within two days USAA declared the cars in Mr. Dunn's garage a total loss and deposited money in his bank account.

"I had no idea that they would resolve this so quickly," he said.

Older policyholders have more reservations about some speed-enhancing tools, according to a 2017 study by J.D. Power. Policyholders older than 53 years who filed an auto claim via a photo app on a smartphone, tablet or computer were less satisfied than peers going the traditional route, according to J.D. Power. Younger customers, on the other hand, were more satisfied.

"Now the insurer is saying, 'You need to do the work. Be sure you photograph the damage and send us a photo,'" said David Pieffer, a J.D. Power insurance practice leader.

Some insurers are wary of using photo apps for home damage, citing the possibility of more complexities.

"We're cautious," said Ross Buchmueller, chief executive of PURE Group of Insurance Cos., which focuses on the affluent. "You don't want to find out you did an incomplete job and need to reopen the claim."

In Texas, for the vast majority of homeowners who filed claims following Hurricane Harvey's Aug. 25 landfall, it took an average of 24.5 days for resolution, according to state insurance-department data as of Oct. 31. In Florida, about half of complaints to an insurance hotline following Hurricane Irma involved claim delays.

In both states satisfaction with the handling of property claims fell last year, according to J.D. Power.

"We're seeing some improvements in the way that insurers are working with their customers to get the benefits paid with as little hassle as possible," said Amy Bach, executive director of consumer group United Policyholders. "But that is not all insurers and that is not in all regions."

China's Markets Draw In Bears

Investors are piling into bets against China's stocks and currency, reviving what has been one of Wall Street's most popular -- and painful -- trades in recent years.

Asset managers including Invesco Ltd. have amassed positions that will pay off if the Chinese yuan continues to slide, while investment firms such as Muddy Waters Research and Blue Orca Capital LLC have announced new bets against Chinese stocks.

Rising interest in shorting, or betting against, Chinese markets comes amid an intensifying trade spat with the U.S. that investors fear will exacerbate the country's economic slowdown.

"If you get the next round of tariffs, it's going to deliver a larger economic shock than what you witnessed in Asia in 2015 and 2016," said James Ong, a senior macro strategist at Invesco who is betting against the Chinese currency. "It might challenge their control of the currency to a greater degree."

On Friday, China said it would impose levies on $60 billion of U.S. goods if Washington moves forward with plans to more than double its tariffs on Chinese imports.

Trade fears already have rocked Chinese markets in recent months. The yuan has tumbled around 5% against the U.S. dollar this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index is down 17%. Investors have made roughly $7.1 billion betting against Chinese and Hong Kong companies, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

U.S. investors have long sought to profit by shorting Chinese markets. Carson Block, founder of San Francisco-based Muddy Waters, rose to fame in 2011 after he revealed fraudulent practices at Chinese forestry company Sino-Forest Corp. The company filed for bankruptcy the following year.

His latest target is TAL Education Group, an after-school tutoring firm in China he claims is "a real business with fake financials." Its U.S.-listed shares had risen over 50% this year through June 12 before he unveiled his bearish thesis on the company. Since then, the stock has dropped around 30%. A TAL spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Soren Aandahl, who runs Texas activist investment fund Blue Orca Capital LLC, last Tuesday unveiled his latest short bet: GDS Holdings Ltd., a provider of data-center infrastructure and services in China.

Mr. Aandahl criticized the company's "staggering debt burden" and raised concerns about the company's ability to repay dollar-denominated debts amid the yuan's slide. GDS's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 37% the day the report was published. The company said in a statement that Blue Orca's claims are "false" and "reflect a fundamental misunderstanding" of its business.

Other investors are betting on broader declines in China's markets. Short sellers have added roughly $300 million in bets against the iShares China Large-Cap ETF this year, according to S3 Partners.

Step change Hedge funds take on tech in search for talent

To compete for top recruits, normally secretive firms are in the unusual position of having to rebrand themselves as cool places to work

As Mario Roussanov, a recruiter for hedge funds, began making his annual visit to clients this year, the change was apparent.

Cubicles had been replaced by openplan layouts, workers were increasingly donning jeans and casual shirts at places that once favoured suits and ties, kitchens were fully stocked with food for employees, and pods, libraries and other quiet spaces to think had popped up.

Just like other industries competing for the top computer science talent, hedge funds are projecting an image that appeals to a new generation. The development is forcing a traditionally secretive industry into an unusual position: having to promote itself, and become cool.

The office revamp is all part of that plan, as hedge funds vie with technology companies for recruits who have expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data analytics, many of whom are garnering salaries of $150,000 or more straight out of university.

"A lot have gone down the Google route to offer more perks," said Mr Roussanov, who works for the recruitment firm Selby Jennings in New York.

"They're trying to rebrand themselves as tech firms."

He added: "They're telling recruits, 'we're tackling challenging problems with data'.

"They're emphasising more of the problems they are facing that need to be solved, rather than what they're trying to achieve."

Hedge funds have always been the outliers in the finance industry, more dressed-down than investment bankers, and content to have offices in Connecticut over Manhattan, but they have also rarely been in a position where they had to seek out talent. They paid the best, and traders clamoured to work for them.

But tech firms can now often offer just as much, and recent graduates who are in demand are seeking work they feel has purpose.

At the London Business School, the percentage of graduates going to work in tech has jumped from 6 per cent to 20 per cent over the past decade, and those entering finance fell from 46 per cent in 2007 to 26 per cent last year.

While quantitative investing funds, which trade using computer algorithms, have been on the forefront of hiring these types of candidates, other hedge funds that rely on humans to make trad-ing decisions are increasingly upping their quantitative capabilities in order to analyse reams of data faster.

Besides the increasing amount of perks funds try to offer, like revamping their workplace and offering services such as free dry-cleaning, they are emphasising the amount of money they are willing to spend on technology and the complexity of the problems in financial markets to entice recruits.

"The pitch is ... this is a very datarich environment, and it's a phenomenally well-resourced environment," said Matthew Granade, chief market intelligence officer at the Point72 hedge fund. For the people Mr Granade calls "data learning, quant types", the harder the problem, the better. "The benefit for us is that the markets are one of the hardest problems in the world. You think you've found a solution and then everyone else catches up. The markets are always adapting. So you are being presented with new challenges, and the problem is constantly getting harder."

Some hedge fund managers privately scoff at the idea that working at a tech firm is more worthy.

One executive who asked not to be named dismissed the notion that "there's a great holy mission in being at Google or Facebook. Going there just means doing advertising more efficiently."

A star candidate now is likely to have six or seven offers, where it used to be two or three a few years ago, said Mr Granade.

They are usually deciding between an offer from a hedge fund, a big bank, a couple of tech firms and whether to continue at university to get their PhD, he said.

Hedge funds are starting to put together better offers than tech firms, and are streamlining the interview process to a coding test, site visit and lone interview, Mr Roussanov said.

"With hedge funds, the upside comes from the bonus," he said. "The upside is much bigger than what they could potentially make at a tech firm, where it might be a small sign-on bonus and a cash bonus at the end of the year, plus an equity component."

While money may not be the chief driver for a quant with five to 10 years' experience, right out of school it can make a difference, especially if a student has loans to repay, Mr Roussanov said.

Richard Wu, a quantitative research analyst intern at Citadel, Ken Griffin's $30bn hedge fund, said he hadn't considered working in finance until he was a finalist at one of Citadel's data hackathons and the firm got in contact with him.

Citadel launched what it calls its "datathons" in 2017 to help it target top quant, tech and data science graduates. Teams compete for a $25,000 cash prize, and are often approached by Citadel for internships or jobs.

"We all had the misconception that it'd be long hours, we would all have to go in at the same time, we'd all have to wear suits and that it'd be a strict dress code," Mr Wu said of his classmates at the University of Waterloo in Canada, where he is about to go into his senior year.

His summer internship has been eyeopening. "My team is flexible on when I come in and what I wear to work, as long as it's not a T-shirt and shorts," he said.

"As long as you get your work done, the hours are probably the same as tech. And in terms of the work we're doing, it's all technical. Both industries have their different focuses. In finance it's about increasing the bottom line. It's quantitatively more difficult and rigorous, in my opinion."

The 21-year-old, who has also done internships at Google and Shopify, said that part of the challenge for him at Citadel is "the game theory aspect; you're competing against a lot of people".

He is undecided about what he would like to do once he graduates, whether to work in finance or technology, or go to grad school, but he said his priority will be to find where he can learn the most.

"After a certain point, compensation tapers off in its importance," he said. "For me, the learning aspect outweighs the money."

When hedge funds began donating heavily to universities over the past decade to finance research on data and the financial markets, they found it came with an added bonus: closer ties with the students themselves.

That gave them a boost in recruiting some of the most in-demand graduates, the ones who are conducting research at the cutting edge of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analytics.

Funds including Brevan Howard, CFM, Winton and Man Group have all donated to establish chairs and centres at universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and London Business School.

One of the largest gifts has come from Brevan, Alan Howard's hedge fund, which donated 20.1m to Imperial College Business School to open the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis in 2014. The centre aims to fund research into preventing another financial crisis, the role of finance in achieving growth, improving the environment and developing medicine, and designing new financial structures.

While Brevan Howard is a macro hedge fund, which takes bets on macroeconomic predictions, the funds that have the closest ties to universities are predominantly quantitative, which means they trade using computer algorithms and are the most reliant on developments out of academia.

One of the largest hedge funds with a significant quant component, Man Group, set up the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance in 2007, and in 2016, established a centre for machine learning there.

That included the appointment of two senior research fellows in machine learning, with a focus on quantitative finance, with support from PhD students and postdoctoral research assistants.

EXCHANGE --- Finance: Old-Money Billionaires Are Chasing New Tech Riches --- Some big names are turning to venture investing as a way to bet on the future; But they aren't rushing to hang up their shingles in Silicon Valley

Corrections & Amplifications

Walt Disney Co. hasn't closed its purchase of assets from 21st Century Fox. In Saturday's Exchange section, a Finance article about old-money billionaires turning to venture investing incorrectly said the deal has been completed.

(WSJ Aug. 8, 2018)

(END)

Some old-economy billionaires have a new calling: venture capitalist.

Having made their fortunes in industries that are increasingly being upended by technology, many of the world's wealthiest individuals and families are turning to venture investing as a way to bet on the future at a time when fewer startups are going public. Some are backing young companies in hopes of spotting the next potential threat to their core business. Others are lured by the promise of high returns and bragging rights when a startup makes it.

But these rookie venture capitalists aren't rushing to hang up their shingles in Silicon Valley, widely considered the beating heart of venture investing. Instead, they are setting up venture-capital firms in their hometowns, including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Chicago. They're enticing entrepreneurs with access to their networks. Since many billionaires have built businesses from scratch, they're hoping that their knowhow will be another selling point.

"These investors are saying, 'all great venture returns don't start in Silicon Valley or end there,'" said Michael Kurdziel, managing partner of Participant Capital, which advises families on private equity and venture investing.

Among the new venture capitalists are Wall Street financiers Steven A. Cohen and Michael Novogratz, who are seeding financial-technology and bitcoin companies from New York.

Now that Walt Disney Co. has closed its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox Assets, James Murdoch is expected to leave the media company his father founded and plans to start a venture-capital fund to invest in digital and international media businesses, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The family of French billionaire Francois Pinault set up a venture firm with an outpost in Los Angeles to invest in emerging luxury and other companies.

The ultrawealthy were among the first venture capitalists. Bessemer Venture Partners, one of the oldest U.S. venture firms, grew out of steel baron Henry Phipps' family holding company more than a century ago. Venrock, an early investor in Apple, started in 1969 to invest on behalf of the Rockefeller family.

More recently, venture investing has been driven by hundreds of professionally managed firms, most of them in Silicon Valley. These firms raise money from pension funds and other big investors. The success of top funds and rising valuations of hot startups has made venture attractive to many types of investors.

Investors used to dream of making a wildly profitable investment in a promising company when it was selling shares in an initial public offering. But increasingly, as startups delay going public, investors are vying to back companies much earlier in their development, which has the effect of delaying IPOs even more.

In 1986, Microsoft Corp. went public at $21 a share, raising about $60 million. Today, the value of a Microsoft share purchased at the IPO has risen more than 147,000%, including stock splits. By comparison, modern-day venture-backed companies including Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. have raised tens of millions of dollars and are valued at tens of billions without selling a single share in public markets.

"To get the . . . really, really explosive growth from technology, you have to participate in private markets now," said Garry Tan, cofounder of early-stage venture firm Initialized Capital, which counts wealthy families among its clients.

Family offices, private firms through which billionaires often invest, stand out partly because of the large amount of capital they have available. According to research by Campden Ltd., family offices have more than $4 trillion in investable assets globally.

There is little data on how much money family offices invest in venture capital, either directly or through outside venture funds, making it difficult to assess their success. Family investors are among the backers of at least 25 unicorns, or those startups valued at $1 billion or more, according to a Wall Street Journal tally.

The family office of hedge-fund titan William Ackman has invested in Rubicon Global, an Atlanta-based trash-collection startup last valued at $1 billion. Payments processor Adyen and grocery-delivery company Instacart were among companies that received late-stage funding from family offices, according to the National Venture Capital Association.

E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc., which in July raised $650 million from investors at a $15 billion valuation, counts a family office founded by Nicholas Pritzker and his four adult children among its early backers. Mr. Pritzker, a San Francisco investor whose family wealth includes that from the Hyatt Hotels Corp. empire, is also a director of Juul, according to a recent company filing.

Family offices are typically not lead investors in venture-backed companies, although they sometimes can get in early. Mr. Pritzker's Tao Capital Partners was among the early backers of Tesla Inc., investing in 2006. Mr. Pritzker and his sons Joby and Isaac met Tesla and PayPal Inc. cofounder Elon Musk through venture capitalist Antonio Gracias, an early PayPal backer and family friend.

The Tesla deal, Tao's first, helped draw the Pritzker brothers into venture investing full time and helped open the door to other sought-after startups. "It becomes part of how you introduce yourself to new entrepreneurs, the list of companies you've been involved with before," said Isaac Pritzker.

Still, many guardians of family capital say they won't invest in early-stage startups because so many of them fail. "You're working with young companies to shape them and their business, and it's certainly not our skill set," said Steven Rattner, chief executive of Willett Advisors LLC, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's firm. It would be a rare family office that has those skills, he said. Willett instead invests directly in late-stage startups and in select venture funds.

Since 2014, AOL Inc. cofounder Steve Case has been traversing the country on a mission called "Rise of the Rest" to spur entrepreneurship in cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Mr. Case's D.C.-based firm disclosed in 2017 it raised a $150 million seed fund from wealthy families and individuals, including Henry Kravis of private-equity firm KKR and recently departed Starbucks Corp. Chairman Howard Schultz. It has invested in more than 80 startups outside geographies traditional venture capitalists dominate.

"Successful tech companies are popping up all around [families]," making it impossible not to consider investing, said Jacob Cohen, who oversees venture investments for Dan Gilbert, the billionaire cofounder of mortgage lender Quicken Loans Inc. and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team.

While Mr. Cohen is open to investing in deals led by Valley firms, he also focuses on Michigan-area investments and holds out his serial-entrepreneur boss Mr. Gilbert as a resource to young founders.

Steve Cohen, the hedge-fund titan who was barred from managing outside money for a time after his previous company, SAC Capital Advisors LP, pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013, has made venture investments with his personal money for years, including in data-analytics firm Palantir Technologies Inc., among the world's most valuable private companies. He has stepped up his presence in venture capital more recently, creating a business separate from his $12 billion hedge-fund firm dedicated to investing in early-stage fintech and artificial intelligence startups.

"If you're only looking at the public markets, you can't understand the full economy," said Matthew Granade, who runs Mr. Cohen's Point72 Ventures, citing the work of companies including General Motors Co., Google and Uber on autonomous cars. So far, the business has invested in three dozen startups and plans to expand its areas of interest.

Mr. Cohen hasn't bypassed Silicon Valley completely. While his fintech venture team is based in New York, the artificial intelligence team is based in Palo Alto. Mr. Cohen is also a regular presence at CEO roundtables convened by Valley venture firms and Y Combinator's popular Demo Day, where entrepreneurs who are part of the tech incubator pitch to investors.

China Bears Score $7.1 Billion Victory in Long-Running 'Pain Trade'; Investors pile back into bets against China's stocks, currency as trade dispute intensifies

Investors are piling into bets against China's stocks and currency, reviving what has been one of Wall Street's most popular and painful trades in recent years.

Asset managers including Invesco Ltd. have amassed positions that will pay off if the Chinese yuan continues to slide, while investment firms like Muddy Waters Research and Blue Orca Capital LLC have announced new bets against Chinese stocks.

Rising interest in shorting, or betting against, Chinese markets comes amid an intensifying trade spat with the U.S. that investors fear will exacerbate the country's economic slowdown.

"If you get the next round of tariffs, it's going to deliver a larger economic shock than what you witnessed in Asia in 2015 and 2016," said James Ong, a senior macro strategist at Invesco who is betting against the Chinese currency. "It might challenge their control of the currency to a greater degree."

On Friday, China said it would impose levies on $60 billion of U.S. goods if Washington moves forward with plans to more than double its tariffs on Chinese imports.

Trade fears have already rocked Chinese markets in recent months. The yuan has tumbled around 5% against the U.S. dollar this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index is down 17%. Investors have made roughly $7.1 billion betting against Chinese and Hong Kong companies, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

That comes after a dismal 2017 performance for short-selling investors, many of whom were caught off guard by last year's global market rally. The Shanghai Composite and yuan jumped 7% against the dollar, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 36%. That sent short sellers to a roughly $35 billion loss in 2017, according to S3.

Kevin Smith, founder of Denver-based asset manager Crescat Capital, was one of them. His firm's global macro hedge fund declined 23% last year, the worst return in its 12-year history, thanks to bets against Chinese stocks and the yuan.

The dismal performance led to the departure of two of the firm's largest clients and brought its assets under management down to $46 million from a peak of $94 million in 2016. This year's market reversal has helped the fund recover 14% through June.

"From everything we can see, it's happening now," said Mr. Smith. "The currency is declining; the equity markets are in a bear market. I think this is going to be one of our best years ever."

U.S. investors have long sought to profit by shorting Chinese markets. Carson Block, founder of San Francisco-based Muddy Waters and a subject of the 2017 documentary The China Hustle, rose to fame in 2011 after he revealed fraudulent practices at Chinese forestry company Sino-Forest Corp. The company filed for bankruptcy the following year.

His latest target is TAL Education Group, an after-school tutoring firm in China he claims is "a real business with fake financials" and has likened to the 2001 Enron accounting scandal. The company's U.S.-listed shares had risen over 50% this year through June 12 before he unveiled his bearish thesis on the company. Since then, the stock has dropped around 30%. A TAL spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Soren Aandahl, who runs Texas activist investment fund Blue Orca Capital LLC, last Tuesday unveiled his latest short bet: GDS Holdings Ltd., a provider of data-center infrastructure and services in China. Mr. Aandahl criticized the company's "staggering debt burden" and raised concerns about the company's ability to repay dollar-denominated debts amid the yuan's slide. GDS's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 37% the day the report was published. The company said in a statement that Blue Orca's claims are "false" and "reflect a fundamental misunderstanding" of its business.

Other investors are betting on broader declines in China's markets. Short sellers have added roughly $300 million in bets against the iShares China Large-Cap ETF this year, according to S3 Partners. They've also raised short bets on Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong that would likely be harmed by a slowdown in growth, such as property developer China Evergrande Group and cement manufacturer Anhui Conch Cement Co.

Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer, had long avoided betting against the yuan due to the cost of shorting the currency. A few weeks ago, he began shorting the yuan in offshore markets for the first time "in recent memory."

"The real wild card is these trade tensions and how much further do they escalate," Mr. Upadhyaya said.

Many investors have struggled to turn a profit on bearish China bets in the past. That's in part because some underestimated China's ability to stabilize its economy and financial markets, analysts say. Beijing maintains tight control over the value of the yuan, liquidity in the financial system and the ease of taking money offshore all tools China tapped to help control the fallout of its 2015 currency devaluation.

"People have gotten China very wrong before," said Mr. Aandahl. "There's a classic quote in short selling: It's not enough to be right; you have to be right, now."

The Chinese government has also struck back at short sellers in the past, launching investigations into some investors and squeezing others out of positions by driving up the cost of borrowing in Hong Kong, where many investors short Chinese assets due to fewer restrictions.

Beijing revived efforts to deter short sellers on Friday by announcing it will impose a 20% deposit requirement for trading currency forwards, effectively making it more expensive to bet against the yuan.

China's efforts to control market reactions have driven many bearish investors out of the market and left others hesitant.

Hayman Capital's Kyle Bass scaled back his China position after the fund posted its worst-ever annual return in 2017, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. Mr. Bass didn't respond to requests for comment. Longtime China bear Jim Chanos has also scaled back his bets against China, saying in an email: "Given the eight years of underperformance of the Chinese market, we are less short China now than in the past."

Groups find they can tap graduates researching machine learning, AI and data analytics

When hedge funds began donating heavily to universities over the past decade to finance new research on data and the financial markets, they found it came with an added bonus: closer ties with the students.

That gave them a boost in recruiting for some of the most in-demand graduates, who are conducting research at the cutting edge of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analytics.

Funds including Brevan Howard, CFM, Winton and Man Group have all donated to establish chairs and centres at universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and the London Business School.

One of the largest gifts has come from Brevan, Alan Howard s hedge fund, which donated 20.1m to Imperial College Business School to open the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis in 2014. The centre aims to fund research into preventing another financial crisis, the role of finance in achieving growth, improving the environment and developing new medicine, and designing new financial structures.

While Brevan Howard is a macro hedge fund, which takes bets on macroeconomic predictions, the funds that have the closest ties to universities are predominantly quantitative, which trade using computer algorithms and are hence the most reliant on new developments out of academia.

One of the largest hedge funds with a significant quant component, Man Group, set up the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance in 2007, and in 2016, established a centre for machine learning there. That included the appointment of two senior research fellows in machine learning, with a focus on quantitative finance, with support from PhD students and postdoctoral research assistants.

The fund has its own commercial office, the Man Research Lab, located in the same building as the institute.

Similarly, CFM, a French quantitative firm, funds cross-discipline research at cole Normale Suprieure, looking at where artificial intelligence will succeed, in finance and more broadly. The Paris-based hedge fund also has a relationship with Imperial College, where it helped launch the CFM-Imperial Institute of Quantitative Finance.

The partnership has allowed them to gain greater exposure in the UK, according to the firm.

China's retail investors create giant playground for data-loving quants

Analysis. Equities Harvesting digital information is the modern gold rush, says a new wave of algo-driven funds

When China proposed to eliminate presidential term limits in February, allowing Xi Jinping to hold on to power indefinitely, a host of local stocks with "emperor" in their name suddenly went on a tear.

While the broader market only gained 1.5 per cent on February 26, Shenzhen Emperor Technology surged nearly 10 per cent when trading started.

Harbin VITI   an electronics group that has words meaning "powerful emperor" in its name   jumped over 4 per cent while Vatti Corp, which stands for "Chinese emperor" in the local language, opened up 7.3 per cent.

These spectacular jumps were unusual but not unprecedented. The Shanghai Composite index dipped 0.7 per cent following Donald Trump's presidential election victory but Wisesoft Co jumped by as much as 6 per cent as its Chinese name, "Chuan da zhi sheng" is a homophone for "Trump's big win". Yunnan Xiyi Industrial Co, whose Chinese name is a homophone for "Aunt Hillary", fell as much as 10 per cent.

These bizarre movements highlight just how retail-dominated China's vast stock market is and why quantitative investors think it could become the industry's new Klondike with market gold readily available for mining.

"This is typical," said Asha Mehta, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, a US investment group with over $100bn under management, including a fund launched in March devoted specifically to Shanghai and Shenzhen shares. "The Chinese market is rife with behavioural errors."

Quantitative investors, or "quants", typically use high-end computers and advanced algorithms to trawl through vast data sets to find signals that they can trade, such as looking at satellite images of retailer car parks for shopping activity or credit card data for real time consumption patterns.

With many of these "alternative" data sets now widely available to investors, it has become harder to make money in ferociously competitive and efficient developed markets, like the US.

But in China   where retail investors account for roughly 70 per cent of all trading   much of this information is still valuable. Indeed, China represents a giant playground for data-loving quants, given how much is readily available from vast, digital-savvy private companies and a state that is keen to take advantage of big data's benefits and relatively nonchalant over privacy.

Even China's tech giants are getting involved. In December, search company Baidu partnered with E Fund Management, an asset manager, to create E Fund Yibai Intelligent Quantitative Strategy fund, which uses searches, news articles, social media and "Baidu's data processing ability" to trade.

Over a fifth of attendees at JPMorgan's annual quant conferences in Hong Kong said that big data was already making traditional information sources like corporate earnings statements and economic statistics less relevant.

Another 32 per cent said that it was "likely" to make traditional data less important in the coming years.

Indeed, "softer" data sets, such as social media that can give clues on investor sentiment, have long proved hard to exploit in developed markets but quants say that in China they can be a gold mine.

Over half of investors surveyed by JPMorgan said sentiment and social media data looked like the most promising of all alternative data sets.

BlackRock agrees. Its quant arm, San Francisco-based Systematic Active Equities, uses its machines to read almost 1m online posts a day in China, which it says can offer valuable indicators on what the herd of retail investors are planning to do.

"Let's say a person overheard something about a company doing well, they go and search online and see whether other people are thinking about the same thing before they do the trade," said Rhui Zhao, a portfolio manager at BlackRock's SAE unit.

Aggregating all the chater is a valuable indicator of where the retail herd is heading, she added.

The local quant industry   which faces none of the access restrictions that foreign investors do   has also grown swiftly in recent years and evolved from fairly simple models to more complex, data-intensive approaches, according to Yin Luo, head of quantitative research at Wolfe Research.

Of course, these signals are still hard to find and, in the chaos of China's day trader-driven markets, they can be even harder to exploit.

Ms Mehta and Ms Zhao's new China funds are down about 9 per cent to 10 per cent this year. That is better than MSCI's China A Shares index's 17 per cent loss and comes amid a broad global quant reversal in 2018 but underscores how big data and machine learning are far from silver bullets.

"Actual application of this kind of data still carries risks and difficulties because a lot of the data isn't freely available and transparent," said Tang Tao, chief investment officer of Quant-Bridge, a Shanghai-based quant hedge fund. "It's difficult to confirm the accuracy of social media data. At the end of the day, we're risking our own treasure with these judgments, so we're pretty cautious."

HSBC touts client-checking software to rivals

Banks

HSBC, once the preferred bank of Mexican drug cartels, is now pitching its "know your customer" software to rivals.

The bank has agreed to sell its new compliance system, which combines robotic process automation and machine learning technologies to carry out automated checks on clients, through a deal with US-listed outsourcing company EXL.

The move underlines how much HSBC believes its client-checking systems have improved six years after it was fined almost $2bn and narrowly escaped criminal charges for breaching money laundering and sanctions rules in the US.

The US Justice Department said in 2012 that at least $881m in drug-trafficking proceeds from Mexican and Colombian cartels was laundered through HSBC.

EXL has agreed to take over the running of HSBC's system for checking the compliance status of its corporate and institutional clients and to offer it more widely as a service to rival banks.

"We are not really in the business of manufacturing software and selling it to other banks," said Kirsty Roth, head of operations at HSBC. "This has the arms-length benefit of not being an HSBC tool but an industry utility tool."

The new system developed by HSBC has cut the time it takes to carry out checks on customers from five hours to 1.5 hours, said Ms Roth, adding that it can learn which sources of information to prioritise if there are conflicting data on a client.

"Humans never get much above 95 per cent accuracy when they are filling out forms as it is quite tedious work, but automating it gets you much closer to 100 per cent," she said.

HSBC employs 2,000 people in its "know your customer" operations team for corporate and institutional clients, but Ms Roth said it was continuing to add more staff even since the new system launched. "People are being used for more complex checks instead," she said.

Banks have spent vast sums on tightening up their KYC systems after regulators imposed multibillion-dollar fines on lenders that failed to spot they were handling money for criminals, taxdodgers and groups subjected to sanctions. HSBC spends $200m-$300m a year on KYC checks for corporate and institutional clients.

"I see it as cause and effect," said Vivek Jetley, senior vice-president at EXL. "HSBC has probably spent more time and devoted more talent on KYC than any other bank and that reflects their determination to become best-inclass in this area."

EXL is already in talks with the Mexican subsidiary of a large global bank interested in buying the service, as well as with banks in Australia and South Africa.

Mr Jetley said banks typically paid $300 to $450 per customer for clientchecking services. Its agreement with HSBC will result in the bank being paid $25m if the service sells well.

Ms Roth said the new system had helped to reduce tension with customers, who had become frustrated at repeated demands for the same information and the often lengthy delays to transactions caused by compliance checks.

Old-Money Billionaires Are Chasing New Tech Riches; Some big names are turning to venture investing as a way to bet on the future, but not necessarily in Silicon Valley

Corrections & Amplifications

Walt DisneyCo. is closing in on its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it had closed in on the acquisition. (August 5, 2018)

Some old-economy billionaires have a new calling: venture capitalist.

Having made their fortunes in industries that are increasingly being upended by technology, many of the world's wealthiest individuals and families are turning to venture investing as a way to bet on the future at a time when fewer startups are going public. Some are backing young companies in hopes of spotting the next potential threat to their core business. Others are lured by the promise of high returns and bragging rights when a startup makes it.

But these rookie venture capitalists aren't rushing to hang up their shingles in Silicon Valley, widely considered the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-venture-funds-thrive-as-more-investors-put-money-in-tech-1511260201". Instead, they are setting up venture-capital firms in their hometowns, including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Chicago. They're enticing entrepreneurs with access to their networks. Since many billionaires have built businesses from scratch, they're hoping that their knowhow will be another selling point.

"These investors are saying, 'all great venture returns don't start in Silicon Valley or end there,'" said Michael Kurdziel, managing partner of Participant Capital, which advises families on private equity and venture investing.

Among the new venture capitalists are Wall Street financiers Steven A. Cohen and Michael Novogratz, who are seeding financial-technology and bitcoin companies from New York.

Now that Walt Disney Co. is closing in on its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets, James Murdoch is expected to leave the media company his father founded and plans to"https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-murdoch-wouldnt-move-to-disney-if-fox-deal-closes-1525824120"to invest in digital and international media businesses, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The family of French billionaire Franois Pinault set up a venture firm with an outpost in Los Angeles to invest in emerging luxury and other companies.

The ultrawealthy were among the first venture capitalists. Bessemer Venture Partners, one of the oldest U.S. venture firms, grew out of steel baron Henry Phipps' family holding company more than a century ago. Venrock, an early investor in Apple, started in 1969 to invest on behalf of the Rockefeller family.

More recently, venture investing has been driven by hundreds of professionally managed firms, most of them in Silicon Valley. These firms raise money from pension funds and other big investors. The success of top funds and rising valuations of hot startups has made venture attractive to many types of investors.

Investors used to dream of making a wildly profitable investment in a promising company when it was selling shares in an initial public offering. But increasingly, as startups delay going public, investors are vying to back companies much earlier in their development, which has the effect of delaying IPOs even more.

In 1986, Microsoft Corp. went public at $21 a share, raising about $60 million. Today, the value of a Microsoft share purchased at the IPO has risen more than 147,000%, including stock splits. By comparison, modern-day venture-backed companies including Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. have raised tens of millions of dollars and are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-succeeds-in-tender-offer-for-large-stake-in-uber-1514483283" without selling a single share in public markets.

"To get the... really, really explosive growth from technology, you have to participate in private markets now," said Garry Tan, cofounder of early-stage venture firm Initialized Capital, which counts wealthy families among its clients.

Family offices, private firms through which billionaires often invest, stand out partly because of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-force-on-wall-street-family-offices-1488991396". According to research by Campden Ltd., family offices have more than $4 trillion in investable assets globally.

There is little data on how much money family offices invest in venture capital, either directly or through outside venture funds, making it difficult to assess their success. Family investors are among the backers of at least 25 unicorns, or those startups valued at $1 billion or more, according to a Wall Street Journal tally.

Vulcan Capital, the family office of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, for instance, has invested in augmented reality company Plantation, Fla.-based Magic Leap, in which AT&T Inc. also invested recently, as well as music-streaming company Spotify Technology, which went public in April. The closing price of its shares the first day of trading ranked Spotify as the eighth-biggest technology IPO, just behind Google in 2004, according to Dealogic.

The family office of hedge-fund titan William Ackman has invested in Rubicon Global, an Atlanta-based trash-collection startup last valued at $1 billion. Payments processor Adyen and grocery-delivery company Instacart were among companies that received late-stage funding from family offices, according to the National Venture Capital Association.

E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc., which in July raised $650 million from investors at a $15 billion valuation, counts a family office founded by Nicholas Pritzker and his four adult children among its early backers. Mr. Pritzker, a San Francisco investor whose family wealth includes that from the Hyatt Hotels Corp. empire, is also a director of Juul, according to a recent company filing.

Family offices are typically not lead investors in venture-backed companies, although they sometimes can get in early. Mr. Pritzker's Tao Capital Partners was among the early backers of Tesla Inc., investing in 2006. Mr. Pritzker and his sons Joby and Isaac met Tesla and PayPal Inc. cofounder Elon Musk through venture capitalist Antonio Gracias, an early PayPal backer and family friend.

The Tesla deal, Tao's first, helped draw the Pritzker brothers into venture investing full time and helped open the door to other sought-after startups. "It becomes part of how you introduce yourself to new entrepreneurs, the list of companies you've been involved with before," said Isaac Pritzker.

Still, many guardians of family capital say they won't invest in early-stage startups because so many of them fail. "You're working with young companies to shape them and their business, and it's certainly not our skill set," said Steven Rattner, chief executive of Willett Advisors LLC, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's firm. It would be a rare family office that has those skills, he said. Willett instead invests directly in late-stage startups and in select venture funds.

Families' growing interest in geographies outside Silicon Valley mirrors the increasing presence of venture funds outside California. Although California-based firms accounted for more than half of venture funds managed at the end of 2017, states such as Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada and Washington saw double-digit increases in venture-capital assets under management compared to 2016, according to NVCA and Pitchbook data.

Since 2014, AOL Inc. cofounder Steve Case has been traversing the country on a mission called "Rise of the Rest" to spur entrepreneurship in cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Mr. Case's D.C.-based firm disclosed in 2017 it raised a $150 million seed fund from wealthy families and individuals, including Henry Kravis of private-equity firm KKR and recently departed Starbucks Corp. Chairman Howard Schultz. It has invested in more than 80 startups outside geographies traditional venture capitalists dominate.

"Successful tech companies are popping up all around [families]," making it impossible not to consider investing, said Jacob Cohen, who oversees venture investments for Dan Gilbert, the billionaire cofounder of mortgage lender Quicken Loans Inc. and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team.

While Mr. Cohen is open to investing in deals led by Valley firms, he also focuses on Michigan-area investments and holds out his serial-entrepreneur boss Mr. Gilbert as a resource to young founders.

Entrepreneur-turned-venture-investor Barak Pridor, who has $100 million from media mogul Haim Saban's investment firm Saban Capital Group to deploy on startups, too is steering clear of the Valley. He's training Saban Ventures on Israel, which he deems as friendlier than the Valley. Israel has a thriving community of entrepreneurs and has produced venture-backed companies such as Mobileye, acquired by Intel Corp. for $15 billion.

"Premium deal flow is limited to a few companies in the Valley, so once in a blue moon you might get a good investment opportunity" if you focus on Silicon Valley startups but aren't locally based, Mr. Pridor said. "That's not good investment practice."

Steve Cohen, the hedge-fund titan who was barred from managing outside money for a time after his previous company, SAC Capital Advisors LP, pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013, has made venture investments with his personal money for years, including in data-analytics firm Palantir Technologies Inc., among the world's most valuable private companies. He has stepped up his presence in venture capital more recently, creating a business separate from his $12 billion hedge-fund firm dedicated to investing in early-stage fintech and artificial intelligence startups.

"If you're only looking at the public markets, you can't understand the full economy," said Matthew Granade, who runs Mr. Cohen's Point72 Ventures, citing the work of companies including General Motors Co., Google and Uber on autonomous cars. So far, the business has invested in three dozen startups and plans to expand its areas of interest.

Mr. Cohen hasn't bypassed Silicon Valley completely. While his fintech venture team is based in New York, the artificial intelligence team is based in Palo Alto. Mr. Cohen is also a regular presence at CEO roundtables convened by Valley venture firms and Y Combinator's popular Demo Day, where entrepreneurs who are part of the tech incubator pitch to investors.

Whistleblowers allege risk and compliance failures amid  toxic  culture of bullying

Just a month ago Legal & General boss Nigel Wilson told investors that the UK insurer s $1tn asset management arm was  built for the future  with  the best team we ve ever had .

Now a series of complaints to the Financial Conduct Authority has cast a shadow over the UK s largest fund house and led to questions about LGIM s employee culture and its risk and compliance processes.

At least three LGIM employees have reported the fund house to the UK s financial watchdog, accusing the asset manager of compliance and risk failures that potentially cost its clients millions of pounds. They also allege there is a culture of bullying at the fund manager, with one complainant describing the company s culture as  toxic .

As LGIM employees arrived at work on Tuesday at their City of London headquarters, conversations turned to the news of the FCA complaints, as reported by the Financial Times. Staff were warned not to speak to the press, while the sales and distribution team had been put on alert to expect calls from clients.  Things in the office today were not good,  said one LGIM employee.

A senior figure in the investment industry, who advises pension funds and asset managers on investment strategy and regularly meets with the company, said the news caused shockwaves.  They are a hugely respected asset management company. The people at the top of both sets of organisations [LGIM and L&G] are well respected,  he said.  This is a big blow for LGIM. 

The complaints to the FCA, which were filed under whistleblowing procedures, come while the company is in a state of flux. In May, Mark Zinkula, who became chief executive of LGIM in 2011, announced plans to step down from his role in 2019.

During his time in charge, LGIM has attempted to cast aside its reputation as a British fund house that mostly manages money for its parent company and instead become an international investment group with the capabilities to compete with global asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors.

Since 2011, revenue generated by its international arm jumped by 39 per cent to 103m, the fastest growth rate of any of its divisions. In contrast, revenues from assets managed on behalf of L&G increased by just 4 per cent.

Gordon Aitken, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the company is  nicely positioned  for growth because of its large passive business. The global passive fund management industry has grown at 4.5 times the rate of active fund management in recent years. Mr Aitken also said the overarching insurance group, particularly its annuities business, benefits from LGIM s investment capabilities.

Although LGIM is still most often used by pension funds and other institutional investors, its so-called retail arm   aimed at financial advisers and wealth managers, as well as individual investors   has also been growing.

 Its institutional strength has been its historical focus and although it has a good retail presence, it has not fully exploited this at a brand level,  said Diana Mackay, a managing director at consultancy Mackay Williams, part of Broadridge Analytics Solutions.

But she added:  The group is highly regarded, particularly for its passive funds, by those fund selectors that use them. 

One former employee, who has not submitted a complaint to the FCA, said he believes the focus on growing rapidly in recent years has piled pressure on staff and led to bad practices, where staff are afraid to admit to mistakes.

He also claimed that employees are dissuaded from questioning internal processes or criticising systems, which he alleges are old-fashioned and often developed by individual teams.

In some cases, this means that staff are unwilling to question managers, he said.  When you are told to do something in an environment where you can ask why, you will ask why. But in this environment, it was more a case of  yes sir . 

The former employee added that there is a big separation between the investment team and compliance department, which are not on the same floor.  This makes a difference because you don t even know them. In my current company, [compliance] are on the same floor and I speak to them all the time,  he said.

LGIM declined to comment on these allegations. But it said in a statement it had recently commissioned an external review of LGIM s culture, which found it over all to be  positive, respectful, professional and client focused .

 We are proud of the business we have built, but are never complacent and as a result deal seriously with any employee issues raised,  it added.

According to the complaints submitted to the FCA, there was a failure by an internal team to report trading errors, flouting the company s policies. It is alleged that this involved the duration of several funds   the sensitivity of the investment portfolio to interest rate changes   being miscalculated by analysts, meaning that trades were executed incorrectly and potentially resulted in multimillion-pound losses for clients.

Provisional findings of an internal investigation earlier this year, which were seen by the FT, indicate that there were trading mistakes that were not reported up the command chain.

The company declined to comment on the allegations, but a person familiar with the matter said the company s internal investigation is close to winding up. The person said in one case no mistake was found to be made, while in another the client was made fully aware of the issue. One issue is still being investigated.

The findings relate to an internal whistleblowing complaint filed last December. In documents seen by the FT, the whistleblower who raised his concerns internally said he was subsequently bullied, including being left out of client meetings. He was put on leave in July, pending an investigation into his investment performance.

In the weeks ahead, many in the investment industry will be focused on how both LGIM and the FCA responds.

The senior figure in the investment industry said:  I will be watching to see how they respond both privately and more importantly publicly to this.

 [LGIM] have not just got to resolve it immediately internally and with clients, but they also need to address it with the rest of us   and explain what has happened and how they will make sure it never happens again.

China Invests to Make Its Warehouses Smarter

By Dominique Fong

SHANGHAI -- China's e-commerce giants are starting to build a new crop of smart warehouses that can keep up with the surging growth of the world's largest online retail sales market.

But that trend promises to add enormous costs to warehouse development. Modern robot and conveyor-belt systems require a multitude of upgrades not found in traditional warehouses like higher ceilings, more air conditioning, the amount of mezzanine space and other infrastructure.

GLP, China's largest owner of warehouse and distribution space, began offering tenants financing for smart upgrades and expansion two years ago, the company said. Other warehouse landlords may soon feel pressure to follow suit, market participants say.

In May, GLP created a private-equity fund to invest 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in robotics, automation and big-data sectors that could complement its logistics real-estate business. It is "not sufficient to focus just on the facility itself," says Victor Mok, co-president of real estate at GLP China. "Our focus is to build a logistics ecosystem which considers every aspect of the supply chain, not just warehouse space."

To be sure, smart warehouses still make up just a sliver of the Chinese market.

Both foreign and domestic investors are carefully watching the smart-warehouse trend because the logistics property market is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the Chinese commercial real-estate industry. Last year, investors acquired $4.4 billion worth of warehouses and distribution centers, up from $3.2 billion in 2016, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

China isn't as far along as U.S. and European markets in shifting to smart warehouses because labor costs are cheaper there, reducing the benefit of automation. But as leading industrial landlords begin to make the transition, the topic of who is going to pay for it is coming up more, market participants say.

Chinese e-commerce giants, such as JD.com Inc., Suning.com Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., are now making big investments into the smart-warehouse real-estate sector as they look for an edge over rivals to deliver packages faster. In October, for example, JD.com began operating its first fully automated warehouse it owns in Shanghai.

For now, China is a landlords' market, making it easier for them to fend off requests from tenants to put up money to upgrade smart warehouses. Vacancy rates are at a record low, analysts say.

Still, landlords may want to invest in smart warehouses to increase chances of approvals from local governments, as Beijing positions China as a global leader in artificial intelligence and other high-tech development.

Also, some market participants say expectations are changing rapidly. "We're definitely entering an era where it's no longer, 'Come and lease my building,' " said Stuart Ross, head of Chinese industrial property for JLL. "It also has to have high-level tech."

Private Sector Adds 219,000 New Jobs in July, Driven by Mid-Sized Firms; Monthly increase in ADP report was the largest since February

The U.S. private sector added 219,000 jobs in July, according to a report released Wednesday, the bulk of which were in medium-size businesses and in the service sector.

The monthly increase in July was the largest since February, when the private sector added 241,000 jobs, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. July's increase also beat projections from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, who expected 185,000 new private-sector jobs.

"The job market is booming, impacted by the deficit-financed tax cuts and increases in government spending," Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said in prepared remarks. "Tariffs have yet to materially impact jobs, but the multinational companies shed jobs last month, signaling the threat."

Medium-size businesses which have anywhere from 50 to 499 employees added 119,000 jobs, more than small and large businesses combined. Most of the 219,000 new private-sector jobs were in the service sector, with health care and social assistance seeing the strongest growth, the ADP National Employment Report showed.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its nonfarm job numbers on Friday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal are expecting 190,000 new nonfarm jobs and an unemployment rate of 3.9%.

Message from Wall Street seems emphatic: we ve caught up, and we re crushing it

**FT subscribers can click here to receive #fintechFT every week by email**

It was hardly the most dramatic second-quarter earnings season for the big US banks. Revenues from trading were mostly down while investment banking was mostly up. Retail banking arms kept churning out solid figures more or less unblemished by consumer or corporate delinquencies.

But one word kept popping up: digital.

At Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the theme arose a handful of times on the earnings call, in the context of automated tools for financial advisers (Morgan Stanley) and the push into consumer banking (Goldman). At the big retail banks, meanwhile, it seemed that digital was all executives wanted to talk about. The word got six mentions at JPMorgan Chase, 11 at Wells Fargo, 18 at Citi and 29 at Bank of America.

The preoccupation with digital reflects the steady rise of independent apps and platforms, many of which have spent years chiselling away at the banks  market shares in areas such as consumer loans, wealth management and checking accounts. Many of the biggest brick-and-mortar banks were slow off the mark in developing tools of their own. But now the message from Wall Street seems emphatic: we ve caught up, and we re crushing it.

BofA, for instance, talked about crossing the 25m threshold during the quarter, in terms of active users of its mobile app. Another 10m used other digital channels (see charts below). All in, that s about 80 times more than SoFi, the biggest of the independent upstarts, which says it had about 430,000  members  in January.

BofA talked aboutErica, its virtual assistant which it began to roll out across the country in March. Erica had interactions with 2m users in July, the bank said, up from 50,000 in April. The bank boasted of strong growth at Zelle,the big banks  answer to Venmo, the fast-growing money-transfer service from PayPal.

Brian Moynihan, BofA's chairman and chief executive, also talked about its new online mortgage application, which he called a  true end-to-end digital experience".It is taking aim at upstarts like Better and Lenda, boosted by a series of expensive-looking ads on youtube.

Size matters, said Mr Moynihan, on the bank s results call with analysts.  The important thing is the size of our consumer base allows those investments to be leveraged. 

The big banks aren t just building their own. Goldman talked about its acquisition in April of Clarity Money, a personal finance start-up, which gave it access to more than 1m users. At the time, Goldman executives said that they would look to use the Clarity app to offer products and services from Marcus, the bank s new retail-banking arm which has generated about $4bn of consumer loans since launch.

 It's the emphasis on making it an easy user experience, leading with the behavioural economics, a better service,  said Marty Chavez, Goldman s chief financial officer, on the Clarity purchase.  We know this is a competitive and commoditised business, and we know that we have to differentiate ourselves and are on our way into it. 

Direct contact with ordinary consumers does not come naturally to Goldman, which has focused on big companies and the ultra-wealthy for almost all of its 149-year history. After the financial crisis, in fact, the bank came to be associated with  a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,  in the lurid phrase of Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi.

That s now way out of line, said Marcus chief Harit Talwar, at a New York conference last month.  We re like a loveable teddy bear. 

Further fintech fascination

Amazing inertiaThey say that people in the UK are more likely to get divorced than split with their bank. What kind of  unreasonable behaviour  would it take for you to ditch your current account provider? An awful lot if the evidence from TSB is anything to go by. After suffering one of the most expensive systems outages in British banking history, net customer losses from TSB inthe second quarter were a puny sounding 6,000 customers. TSB reported that while about 26,000 customers switched their account away from TSB in this period, more than 20,000 customers opened a new bank account or switched to TSB.

App payThe number of mobile payments users who tap to pay using a contactless payment solution provided by their mobile device s maker will grow to 450m people worldwide by 2020, according to a new forecast from Juniper Research. By this time, Apple Pay will have amassed the largest audience,accounting for 1 in 2 of these mobile payment users globally,TechCrunch reports.

Celtic dealTransferMate, the Irish-based digital payments company, has signed a strategic partnership with Dutch bank ING, which isinvesting  21mfor a stakein the company. The Dutch lender will offer Transfermate's cross-border payment services toits small business and corporate clients.

Fintechviews in theFTbanking podcast

Bits and bobs

Boom timeFintech investment roared ahead at a record pace in the first half of the year, with $57.9bn invested across 875 deals, a significant increase from the $38.1bn invested in all of 2017, according toKPMG's Pulse of Fintech report. There were nine $1bn-plus deals by fintech companies, including the $14bn fundraising by China's Ant Financial and the $12.9bn takeover of the UK's Worldpay.At a technology level, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation continued to gain attention while interest in blockchain, insurtech and regtech also grew significantly.

Plus ca changeWe've been told for a few years now that fintech start-ups such as Monzo, Revolut and Starling Bank were coming for the high street banks' lunch. But, judging by a new set of data, they haven't even got started on their breakfast. Mobile data analytics company Ogury found the top ten most-used UK  banking  apps, which include the fintech hopefuls, were all traditional high-street lenders,reports Alphaville.

Bitcoin blowThe Winklevoss twins  dream of launching a bitcoin ETF was dealt another blow as the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that Cboe Global Markets could not list and trade shares in their cryptocurrency fund. The SEC said that Cboe had not put forward convincing arguments in favour of listing the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and dismissed its suggestion that cryptocurrency markets are inherently resistant to manipulation. Meanwhilebitcoin climbed above $8,000 for the first time since May.

Peer reviewThe UK financial regulator is planning to crack down on peer-to-peer lenders and crowdfunding platforms, following concerns that investors could be taking on more risk than they realise. In a long-awaited review, the Financial Conduct Authoritysaid it was worried that a rise in interest rates could trigger a spate of defaults on many of the high-risk loans that peer-to-peer lending websites facilitate.

Chinese Investors Bid Up Prices Locally as They Bring Capital Home; Domestic buyers purchased a record $564.9 billion worth of commercial real estate in China last year

Chinese investors have been buying commercial property domestically at the fastest rate ever as new institutions and funds join the market and traditional players focus more on their home shores in response to government-imposed capital controls on offshore investment.

Domestic buyers purchased a record $564.9 billion worth of office buildings, shopping centers, development sites and other commercial property in China last year, according to real-estate data firm Real Capital Analytics. By comparison, domestic buyers did $395.8 billion in such deals in 2016, the firm said. The lion's share of the deals each year involved development sites.

Domestic investors pulled back slightly in the early part of this year as Beijing began raising concerns about debt and financial risk. But the government has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-effort-to-control-debt-loses-steam-1531410115"and ease market worries over escalating trade tensions with the U.S.

"There is obviously more domestic capital chasing transactions in China," said Rush Desai, chief executive of the Asia and Pacific region for Allianz Real Estate, the real-estate investment unit of Allianz SE, the Munich-based financial-services firm.

The sharp increase in investment by Chinese investors is helping turn the Chinese real-estate market into one of the largest in the world. Including acquisitions by Hong Kong firms and other foreign investors, there was a total of $633.4 billion in deals last year, up from $456.2 billion in 2016, Real Capital said.

At the same time, the surge in domestic activity is driving up prices making the market trickier for foreign investors to compete. Some have moved to the sidelines. Others are still very much in the game but are fine-tuning their investment strategies.

Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management Inc., which has about $60 billion in real-estate assets under management, in April acquired Shanghai International Plaza, a mixed-use tower with 24 stories of office space on a six-story retail podium, for an undisclosed price. LaSalle is planning to make the investment work partly by converting some of the retail space into more desirable office space.

LaSalle is confident it can do this because it has more than a decade of experience investing in the country, said Claire Tang, the firm's head of acquisitions for China. "We are foreign capital, but our team has local expertise," she said.

The Chinese real-estate market is young compared with those in the U.S. and Europe. Until the development surge of the past two decades, major markets didn't have enough buildings with the design quality or leasing structures to appeal to institutional investors.

The first foreign investors in Chinese property didn't start showing up until the 1980s, after the government eased restrictions on such deals. Since then a wide range of major foreign players have done deals in the country including Morgan Stanley, New York developer Tishman Speyer and mall giant Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, one of the world's largest commercial real-estate investors.

The appeal: diversification and the high growth rate of the Chinese economy, which is expected to translate into higher rents and occupancies.

"We are trying to participate in the Chinese economy whereby it's transitioning from being a manufacturing [economy] to where it's becoming more of a service-based economy," said Mr. Desai of Allianz, which has invested about  1 billion ($1.17 billion) of equity in China since 2016.

Allianz's deals this year includes its venture with Gaw Capital Partners, a Hong Kong-based private-equity firm, to purchase two of the four offices blocks in Sky Soho complex in Shanghai. "The location is where you would expect the central business district to expand," Mr. Desai said.

Chinese domestic investors used to be mostly individuals and family offices. But in recent years more institutional players like insurance companies and homegrown private-equity firms have become more active.

"There's a local saying that the Chinese real-estate industry has come into the second round," said Megan Hu, managing director of World Union Investment, a Shanghai-based firm which currently has about six billion yuan ($880 million) under management.

Ms. Hu's firm was formed in 2014 as the investment arm of Shenzhen-based World Union, one of China's largest real-estate services firms, which specializes mostly in residential property. Most recently, it acquired Cross Tower, a 24-floor office building in Shanghai, for 2.7 billion yuan.

Domestic investors have had more firepower lately because of pressure from Beijing for them to pull back on their yearslong foreign buying spree. For example, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-real-estate-investors-retreat-from-u-s-as-political-pressure-mounts-1532437934" in the second quarter of this year, for the first time since 2008.

"With China capping the amount of money that can go out of the country, that traps capital in the country," said Michael Cole, founder of the real-estate website mingtiandi.com.

Ms. Hu said that domestic investors often have an advantage over foreign investors, who may have to face more government restrictions. Big Chinese institutions also "may have access to cheaper financing" than their foreign competitors, she said.

But other foreign investors believe they can still hold their own. "We have differentiated ourselves by being able to do all cash deals," said Mr. Desai of Allianz Real Estate. "We bring certainty of execution because we don't need leverage all the time. That helps us find transactions that are attractive to the rest of the market."

Verana Health Inc., which makes software designed to accelerate clinical trials and drug commercialization, has raised $30 million in Series C financing.

GV led the round in the San Francisco-based company, with participation from Biomatics Capital, GE Ventures, Brook Byers and Lagunita Biosciences. The latest funding brings the company's total raised to date to $45 million.

Along with the funding, the company announced it has appointed Miki Kapoor as chief executive. Previously, Mr. Kapoor was the chief executive of health-care data company Tea Leaves Health LLC, which was acquired by Welltok Inc. in 2017.

Founded in 2008 as DigiSight Technologies Inc., Verana Health has developed an analytics platform for life science companies to track performance of drugs in clinical trials. The software, which is initially targeted at eye health, combines clinical data from the American Academy of Ophthalmology with patient data from electronic health records, and also provides insights for drug development and commercialization.

Inward investment and early-stage backing are up, but local venture capital falls short

In a former Pittsburgh bowling alley, Maven Machines aims to save lives by developing a wireless headset that monitors truck drivers  fatigue and concentration.

On the same floor of the building, Noah Snyder and Kasey Catt, co-founders of Interphase Materials, are using the research on anti-microbial brain implants they developed at the University of Pittsburgh to make non-toxic coatings for infrastructure such as bridges and pipelines.

The two companies   among some 20 start-ups working from AlphaLab Gear, a Pittsburgh hardware accelerator   are part of an ecosystem of emerging tech enterprises that is winning  Steel City  a new reputation as a top technology hub.

On the floor below AlphaLab Gear is AlphaLab, a software accelerator. Entrepreneurs from such neighbouring hardware and software outfits often end up collaborating.  The internet of things means a lot of companies straddle the line between hardware and software,  says Ilana Diamond, AlphaLab Gear s managing director.  They can benefit from running into each other in the hall. 

Big tech companies are also becoming involved. In an area now known as Robotics Row, comprising the Strip District and Lawrenceville neighbourhoods, robotics and autonomous vehicles companies have set up shop, including Uber s Advanced Technologies Group, which focuses on self-driving technologies, mapping and vehicle safety. On Bakery Square, near the Shadyside neighbourhood, Google has set up offices in a former factory of Nabisco, the bakery product and snack manufacturer.

Inward investment in the technology sector from overseas and from other US states rose from $33.4m in 2009 to almost $55m in 2017, according to fDi Intelligence, a Financial Times data service tracking cross-border investment flows.

 Over the past decade or so, Pittsburgh has far outpaced the nation s average growth in tech and venture capital investing,  says Rich Lunak, chief executive of Innovation Works, the seed stage investor that supports AlphaLab and AlphaLab Gear.

In the 1980s, it was state funding that helped kick-start the tech sector. In the wake of the steel industry s collapse, Ben Franklin Technology Partners, one of the country s oldest tech-based economic development initiatives, was established to provide support for start-ups including access to capital and business expertise.

The city s latest generation of tech entrepreneurs stands on the shoulders of local giants such as Carnegie Mellon University s Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize winner considered a founding father of technologies such as artificial intelligence.

Adding to the city s academic and research clout is the University of Pittsburgh, a life sciences leader, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), which announced last year it would put $2bn into developing new digitally focused speciality hospitals.

 In the industries driving the fourth industrial revolution   AI, robotics, autonomous vehicles, nanotechnology, biology   Pittsburgh has leadership in almost every one,  says Mr Lunak.

The physical proximity of these research institutions, all in the city s Oakland district, has also helped, says Evan Facher, head of the University of Pittsburgh s Innovation Institute.  You have 1.7 square miles where the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon and the healthcare system [UPMC] sit,  he says.  So you have a huge density of ideas being created in a really small area. 

Even so, the city has gaps to fill as it builds its reputation as a tech and innovation hub, including the lack of a well-established local venture capital industry.  Historically, we ve not had a lot of indigenous venture capital resident here,  says Mr Lunak.

Rob Rutenbar, the University of Pittsburgh s senior vice-chancellor for research, agrees:  There s a bunch of venture in the neighbourhood. But it s not at the scale of either of the coasts. 

Moreover, while big companies such as Ford, Google, Facebook and Uber are setting up offices in Pittsburgh, no global tech business has made its headquarters there.

 Right now we don t have a Microsoft,  says Jim Jen, AlphaLab director.

 What we would like to have is companies growing to that scale, creating the anchor companies here. That would speed things up and bring more scale and financial returns for investors.

Race for savings will open up the indices blame game

The cynical view is that S&P Dow Jones and MSCI stand in way of lower costs

I was chatting with the boss of a large, newish player in the world of passive investing when exchange traded funds and the tricky subject of indices came up.

I say tricky because virtually everyone I talk to at a senior level in ETF-land seems to be spending a disproportionate amount of time working out how to lop costs and cut out the big index companies.

The driver is obvious: the race to ever-lower total expense ratios. Big index firms such as S&P Dow Jones and MSCI, it is alleged, stand in the way of this race because of their basis point and licensing fee structure.

On paper, I wholeheartedly agree with this cynical view, mainly because these large outfits are classic examples of what economists call rent-seeking corporates, trading off their brand (and to be fair, hard work), forcing businesses to pay an entry fee for access to legally protected brands.

I d be happy, come the revolution, if we could find a way of open-sourcing indices, perhaps through blockchain. Back in the real world the alternatives don t look quite so attractive.

Self-indexing is a popular option with some, as is the idea of using a lesser-known index company to do the boring number-crunching and calculating but keeping the issuer s brand name for marketing purposes. This makes sense but for one fly in the ointment   having someone to blame.

There have been attempts to build the index version of generic drugs (S&P 500 indices in all but actual name) but most end-investors tend to like a familiar name on the box.

So, for the really deep, liquid pools of equities and to a lesser degree bonds, the big brand names built around an exchange heritage are probably safe for now.

This means that most of the innovation has erupted in what I call outcome-based indices, ie, where an issuer working with an index company is trying to filter the market to get the right outcome for investors.

Two examples jump to mind, one mild, the other potentially lethal. Many multi-factor strategies, combining different factor tilts look eminently sensible on paper but could end up producing what I call  mushy  results.

By this I mean that the investor says:  This looks almost exactly like the returns from a broad market cap index but with higher fees. 

As the investor begins to dig, they discover that what s inside the black box of the multi-factor is in effect a pale shadow of the well-known broad market index. They will need someone to blame.

My guess is at that point the issuer will say:  Ah, well, we did get an index firm in and they said this was the best strategy. 

Such buck-passing may not rescue the situation but it will deflect some blame. At which point you need some well-funded, cash-rich indexing company to step in and defend the daft strategy behind the multi-index idea.

A variation of the theme centres on low or minimum-volatility strategies   what happens in the next downturn when a badly designed index blows up and investors discover they have a mixture of overpriced, quality stocks that are now egregiously overpriced in a market sell-off?

A deadlier variant could occur in thematic index investing where some crazy idea for a sexy fund   a mutant combination, say, of blockchain, genetics and artificial intelligence in the title   ends up with a portfolio of mid and small-cap basket cases.

In sum, lots of listed businesses worth zilch. As the index and its ETF plunge in value, I can imagine the reasoning in class-action lawyers  fee-obsessed minds:  How on earth did Business X make it past the screen? 

In these circumstances, one needs the index equivalent of high street banks and payment protection insurance   that is, well-funded businesses with layers of management on hand to explain what went wrong.

This also means that in the good times these index firms will also need to step up their education efforts and explain precisely how they build factor/ESG/thematic indices.

Crucially these highly profitable monsters will need to get out more often and talk to retail investors   it is no good simply relying on relationships with a few choice institutional clients.

The index firms need to earn their rent and engage more openly. If they don t, the regulators should force them to do so.

Don t be too keen to see them go the way of the dinosaurs. When the next meltdown occurs, there will be plenty of ETF issuers in need of someone to blame for their ill-conceived products.

A world where scale counts

FT BIG READ. ASSET MANAGEMENT Its boss had an ambition to build Europe's biggest asset manager to compete with US rivals and avoid being squeezed in its home market. Amundi has achieved that target but now faces different pressures. By Owen Walker

W ithin days of taking over at Crdit Agricole's asset management division, Yves Perrier knew the business could only survive by doubling in size. It was late 2007 and while other executives at the French bank were grappling with the early signs of the financial crisis. Mr Perrier was starting to put together a strategy to turn the parochial unit   with assets of  480bn   into one of the world's biggest investment businesses.

"We wanted to be number one in Europe," he says.

His first step to meeting that target was to partner with the asset management branch of a former employer, French banking rival Socit Gnrale. He convinced senior managers at the two lenders to merge and spin off their fund management arms, creating Amundi in 2010. Years of fervent asset gathering followed, culminating in the  3.7bn acquisition of Pioneer Investments, the fund management business of UniCredit, the Italian bank, 12 months ago.

In parallel Mr Perrier also developed a plan to "industrialise" the business: boosting assets under management while driving down the cost of running it. Despite some internal opposition the ultimate aim was to build a company that could compete with the very biggest players in asset management: the trillion dollar club, which includes just a handful of names, such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.

Amundi was inducted into that club in 2016 just months after Mr Perrier took it public in the biggest flotation on the Paris stock exchange for a decade. The IPO raised  1.5bn for Mr Perrier's acquisition strategy and valued the group, still 80 per cent owned by Crdit Agricole, at  7.5bn.

But now Mr Perrier's vision is under intense scrutiny. The company's shares have lost a fifth of their value in recent months as a result of a flood of outflows from its Italian business, amid the country's political turmoil. But the questions confronting Amundi go beyond Italy: they strike at the heart of the group's strategy of using acquisitions and greater scale to withstand the immense challenges that the industry faces.

"If we think these [Italian outflows] are a one off, then fine. But if it is the start of a longer trend, then that's a concern," says Haley Tam, managing director of European diversified financials at Citigroup.

Asset managers play a critical role in the global economy, such as investing the retirement savings of hundreds of millions of workers. But while their influence has grown, the industry is undergoing profound changes that threaten the way they do business.

Fees are under pressure as customers move to cheaper products and costs are rising because of new regulatory burdens. And unlike the largest US managers, which invested heavily in developing passive funds over the past two decades, Europe's managers have tended to focus on more traditional pricier products such as actively managed funds. Supporters believe Mr Perrier's dealmaking will give Amundi the ballast to survive these problems at a time when other European asset managers are being forced to pull out of markets and lay off staff. But others warn that Amundi's growth spurt could just be a way of delaying the harsh realities in an industry that Boston Consulting Group likened last year to an exhausted athlete, accelerating, as they charge downhill.

"If assets stay the same or drop   which we expect   then you face the perfect storm of fees coming down, assets coming down and costs going up," says Renaud Fages, a partner at BCG. "Historically asset managers would just cut back bonuses in bad times. But that is not sustainable and will not be enough in the current environment. Instead they will have to start thinking hard about more fundamental changes."

Survival strategy The zeal to expand has spread across the asset management industry as executives came to the conclusion that their businesses will be consumed unless they are able to join the ranks of the very biggest players. M&A strategies have become less about market domination and more about survival.

On the surface that looks to have worked. Assets under management swelled to record levels in 2017. But most of that accumulation was the result of strong returns on the back of rampant equity markets. Managers are still being squeezed by long-term pressures that have fundamentally disrupted the industry.

One of the main drags has been the continual downward pressure on fees that began in the US and has spread to Europe. The rise in popularity of cheaper passive investing, where funds are designed to mimic an index, has forced traditional active managers to consider setting up passive products themselves and rethink their pricing.

Over the past two years, the amount of new investor money flowing into passive funds increased their total assets by 19 per cent, while active funds grew by just 1 per cent, according to Oliver Wyman, the consultancy. Active products still account for the vast majority   more than two-thirds   of managed money, but passives are catching up.

While a mountain of cash has flowed out of active products and into passives in recent years, the biggest cause of fall-ing fees is active managers reducing their prices to be more competitive. Over the past three years global charges across all funds, including passive and active products, have reduced by 3 per cent a year, according to BCG. For certain types of funds, the average fees have dropped by more than a third.

"In the past decade institutional investors have become more sophisticated and are putting more pressure on asset managers over fees," says Mr Fages. "Retail investors are being more sensitive on price and regulations are pushing them in that direction."

Technology costs Asset managers also face higher costs.

Since the financial crisis, the fund industry has been hit by an avalanche of regulation resulting in increased operational spending. They are also engaged in an expensive technology arms race   from artificial intelligence and data mining tools to distribution platforms   in a bid to stay in touch with competitors.

Lower fees and higher costs result in squeezed profits. BCG calculates that the average asset manager's profit margin has been cut from 41 per cent a decade ago, to 38 per cent today. While still a highly profitable industry, the reduction has had a profound impact on how managers allocate capital, say analysts. BCG expects margins to fall to 36 per cent by 2021.

Mr Fages says this fall in profit margins could force companies to close product lines, pulling out of markets and cutting jobs. Axa Investment Managers, the French active investment house, last month announced it would lay off up to 9 per cent of its global workforce in a move it said was partly driven by the need to invest in technology.

Oliver Wyman calculates that investment managers with more than $500bn in assets are more than twice as efficient as those controlling less than $100bn. However, the more complex the business, the more bloated its cost base. It means that European managers selling products in several markets cost up to 20 per cent more than US managers based only in North America.

According to Mr Perrier, these pressures have created an industry where the very largest are able to mop up assets, cut costs and reinvest in the pur-suit of growth, while smaller managers can continue to offer specialist products at a premium. Those caught in the middle are struggling to compete. "There is room for only two kinds of players," he says. "Those like Amundi   to a certain extent, we are a small Black-Rock   that will be asset gatherers, managing all asset classes with a global presence. But, you have room also for boutiques specialising in certain asset classes."

Coveting assets In November 2015, armed with the new firepower provided by the IPO, Mr Perrier set about pursuing potential deals to ensure that Amundi did not get caught in that middle ground. One business he had long coveted was Pioneer Investments, the fund management arm of Italian bank UniCredit. Pioneer was another business that had not fared well in a market that favoured providers of cheaper investment products.

He had first tried to buy Pioneer in 2012, but the deal was scuppered when UniCredit changed its chief executive and Italian regulators pushed back against it. Mr Perrier returned with a new offer in mid-2016, had the deal agreed by the end of that year and the $3.7bn transaction was complete by July 2017. The tie-up is designed to save  180m within three years. It also took the group's assets under management from  850bn to  1.1tn.

The deal made Amundi Europe's biggest asset manager. By leapfrogging over Legal & General Investment Management it rose from 16th to eighth globally, entrenching it in the trillion dollar club. A year on, its assets stand at  1.4tn, making it the sole European asset manager in the world's top 10.

However, a former Amundi executive warns that while the expansion up to now has been impressive, much of its organic growth is in lower revenue areas such as passive investing and fixed income. "I don't know how sustainable that is," he says. "You will see margins erode over time."

He adds that though the deal helped Amundi grow in the lucrative Italian and US markets, as well as bringing in Pioneer's high-performing investment teams, there are big cultural differences between the two companies that will need to be ironed out.

"Yves Perrier would say there is one star at Amundi and that is Amundi itself," he says. "If you are a well-regarded portfolio manager at Pioneer, that's not what you want to hear."

Italian outflows have been blamed for the share price plunge in the past two months. However, Toni Dang, director of equity research at Barclays, says this is an over-reaction by the market to problems in Italy that have little to do with Amundi's long-term strategy. "Amundi had a bit of a wobble in the second quarter, but it remains one of my top picks," she says, adding that it is one of the most disciplined on cost of all European asset managers.

Mauro Baratta, vice-president of global distribution solutions at Broadridge, a consultancy, says the integration of the Pioneer business is still taking its toll on the business. There were scores of overlapping funds between the two businesses that needed to be closed or merged. "They are still going through this massive clean-up operation," he says. "When you undergo this type of restructuring, sales will be affected."

Amundi's midyear results on Thursday will be scrutinised for signs of progress on that front.

Yet the former Amundi executive points to an equally big risk facing the company: while the rise has been driven by Mr Perrier, there is no obvious successor to the 63-year-old Frenchman. "I'm not aware of another asset manager that is as top-down. You take Yves out of the equation and the company does not function," he says. "If he was to step down in a year or two there would be one hell of a succession battle."

"Amundi is a remarkable European success story and the management deserve a huge amount of credit for that," he adds. "Whether they can continue that trajectory will be a challenge."

Scaling up Yves Perrier took Amundi public in 2015 in the biggest flotation in Paris for a decade, raising  1.5bn Falling fees Throughout the industry active managers have reduced their prices in a bid to be more competitive Ticking over One former executive says much of Amundi's organic growth is in lower revenue areas like fixed income M&A Groups merge to survive against the index trackers Between 2011 and 2016, there was an average of 142 mergers and acquisitions a year involving asset managers. That number spiked at 208 last year, according to investment bank Sandler O'Neill. The volume of assets managed by companies involved in those deals more than doubled from $1.3tn in 2011 to $2.9tn last year. Several of the biggest took place in Europe, as traditional investment managers tried to compete with more technologically advanced US rivals.

In late 2016, Anglo-Australian fund manager Henderson Group agreed to merge with US rival Janus Capital   home of veteran bond investor Bill Gross   in a $6.4bn deal that would create an investment house managing $331bn. Both groups, which specialise in active management, had struggled with the rise of technology-driven passive investment.

While Janus and Henderson painted the union   completed in May 2017   as one aimed at growing their geographic spread and increasing their suite of products, analysts were more sceptical. They saw it as a defensive move by two struggling mid-size managers in a market that increasingly favours the very big or the very small.

"There have been profound changes in the asset management industry and people have started to question their business models," says Andrew Formica, a 20-year Henderson veteran who negotiated the deal with Janus. "We feel we moved early on this trend and have positioned ourselves well."

A second major merger was struck just months later when two Scottish neighbours   Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management   agreed to combine. Again, both parties were middling global asset managers struggling to cope with the increased appetite for cheaper index-tracking funds. The 11bn merger to create Standard Life Aberdeen was completed last June.

Employers Eager to Hire Try a New Policy: 'No Experience Necessary'; Inexperienced job applicants face better odds in the labor market as more companies drop work-history and degree requirements

Corrections & Amplifications

Intel's career website advertises a position for a components researcher in Hillsboro, Ore. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the opening was in Ohio. (July 29, 2018)

Americans looking to land a first job or break into a dream career face their best odds of success in years.

Employers say they are abandoning preferences for college degrees and specific skill sets to speed up hiring and broaden the pool of job candidates. Many companies added requirements to job postings after the recession, when millions were out of work and human-resources departments were stacked with rsums.

Across incomes and industries, the lower bar to getting hired is helping self-taught programmers attain software engineering roles at Intel Corp. and GitHub Inc., the coding platform, and improving the odds for high-school graduates who aspire to be branch managers at Bank of America Corp. and Terminix pest control.

"Candidates have so many options today," said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Group, a staffing agency with about 10,000 company clients in search of employees. "If a company requires a degree, two rounds of interviews and a test for hard skills, candidates can go down the street to another employer who will make them an offer that day."

Ms. Glaser estimates one in four of the agency's employer clients have made drastic changes to their recruiting process since the start of the year, such as skipping drug tests or criminal background checks, or removing preferences for a higher degree or high-school diploma.

Cutting job-credential requirements is more common in cities such as Dallas and Louisville, where unemployment is lowest, Ms. Glaser said, as well as in recruiting for roles at call centers and warehouses within logistics operations of retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

In the first half of 2018, the share of job postings requesting a college degree fell to 30% from 32% in 2017, according to an analysis by labor-market research firm Burning Glass Technologies of 15 million ads on websites such as Indeed and Craigslist. Minimum qualifications have been drifting lower since 2012, when companies sought college graduates for 34% of those positions.

Long work-history requirements have also relaxed: Only 23% of entry-level jobs now ask applicants for three or more years of experience, compared with 29% back in 2012, putting an additional 1.2 million jobs in closer reach of more applicants, Burning Glass data show. Through the end of last year, a further one million new jobs were opened up to candidates with "no experience necessary," making occupations such as e-commerce analyst, purchasing assistant and preschool teacher available to novices and those without a degree.

It all marks a sharp reversal from the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, when employers could be pickier. Economists say job requirements were harder to track then, because many companies didn't post positions publicly and many rsums weren't delivered electronically.

Now, recruiters say, the tightest job market in decades has left employers looking to tamp down hiring costs with three options: Offer more money upfront, lower their standards or "https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-companies-will-pay-you-to-learn-your-job-1508245202".

Rodney Apple, president of SCM Talent Group LLC in Asheville, N.C., said if companies won't budge on compensation, experience or education requirements, he walks away.

"We tell them, 'I'm sorry, but we can't help you fish for the few underpaid or unaware applicants left out there,' " he said. SCM finds workers for dozens of small and midsize companies seeking supply-chain managers and logistics and warehouse operators across the U.S. Mr. Apple said talent shortages are more extreme than he has seen in nearly 20 years of recruiting.

Average wages have climbed steadily in the past year, but rising prices of household goods "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-prices-increase-at-fastest-annual-rate-since-2012-1531398709", keeping pressure on employers to increase salaries or re-evaluate their target hire.

To attract more entry-level employees, toy maker Hasbro Inc. divided four marketing jobs, which it previously designed for business-school graduates with M.B.A.s, into eight lower-level positions. The new full-time roles included a marketing coordinator, retail-planning analyst and trade merchandiser, all involving more routine activities supporting higher-level staff in the division.

Hasbro hiring managers originally sought candidates with a two-year degree for the jobs but ultimately dropped any college requirement, a spokeswoman said. The Pawtucket, R.I. company received more than 100 applications and hired nine people.

The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facing-historic-labor-shortages-companies-snap-up-teenagers-1523895726" bolsters a theory articulated by Alicia Modestino, a Northeastern University economist: When more people are looking for work, companies can afford to inflate job requirements to find the best fit and did so as unemployment spiked in 2008.

As college graduates and midcareer professionals raised their hands for jobs as hotel managers and bookkeepers after the recession, hires with more qualifications took a larger share of positions normally filled by the 75 million U.S. workers who lack a college degree.

After the recession, Terminix raised the bar for over 1,000 pest-control branch- and service-manager positions to require a two-year degree or a bachelor's degree. In January, it reversed course and made degrees "preferred" but not mandatory, said Betsy Vincent, senior director of talent acquisition.

Anthony Whitehead worked for five years as a Terminix branch manager in Florida before he was promoted to regional director in early July. That position now accepts candidates with college degrees or equivalent experience, helping Mr. Whitehead clinch the role despite his earlier decision to enter the military instead of college.

Mr. Whitehead, 35 years old, said his approach to jobs requiring a degree has been "apply anyways if I have the right experience, and then have the education conversation if I need to," he said, acknowledging his luck in working for companies like Terminix with flexible requirements.

A lot of employers are loosening college requirements even as the proportion of Americans with a bachelor's degree continues to rise. Bank of America Corp. currently has 7,500 job openings world-wide and fewer than 10% require a degree, said spokesman Andy Aldridge. Mr. Aldridge said a surprising number of jobs could be filled by nongraduates, including most of the bank's tellers and employees handling customer-service and fraud-protection calls from cardholders.

In June, the bank unveiled plans to hire 10,000 more retail workers from low-income neighborhoods over the next five years, with or without degrees, said Chris Payton, head of talent acquisition.

Not every company is relaxing requirements: Economists say positions that require high levels of technical expertise, such as information security, still need advanced knowledge.

The tech industry has been quick to dismiss credentials like a bachelor of arts degree as irrelevant, especially in emerging fields such as data analytics, where demand for talent has risen faster than universities can churn out new graduates.

GitHub, recently acquired by Microsoft Corp., said it hasn't required college degrees for most positions in years. Degrees are optional for many "experienced hire" positions at chip maker Intel, which also has a "tech grad" job category the company describes as fitting candidates with relevant classroom or work experience from technical programs, such as coding boot camps.

Intel's career website advertises roles, including a lab employee testing experimental devices in Santa Clara, Calif., and a components researcher improving the semiconductor process in Hillsboro, Ore., as available to candidates with a two-year degree, military training or other nondegree certifications.

Facebook's Hard Fall Shows the Pitfalls of Big Data ; Companies typically use only 5% to 10% of the data they collect. They're beefing up their efforts to use more but a consumer backlash is brewing.

For years, conventional wisdom said the smart way to build a blockbuster company was to amass big amounts of information on your customers. Now comes the downside: Big Data can also inflict big harm on a business.

Companies are facing an erosion of faith in their ability to do the right thing with what they've learned. Most of us are using Facebook, for instance, but "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trust-in-social-media-fallsraising-concerns-for-marketers-1529312580" to responsibly handle what we share.

Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is the most visible tech executive to face the music thus far. Facebook shares crashed this past week "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-conference-call-that-shook-investor-faith-in-facebook-1532589109?mod=hp_lead_pos4" in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.

The confidence problem transcends Facebook. Data breaches have hit companies nationwide, and executives have on more than one occasion appeared to be asleep at the wheel or orchestrating a coverup.

In 2017, credit-reporting firm Equifax Inc. disclosed that the personal information of nearly 150 million people was c"https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-identifies-additional-2-4-million-affected-by-2017-breach-1519918282". Before that, Uber Technologies Inc. paid hackers $100,000 to keep secret "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-reveals-data-breach-and-cover-up-leading-to-two-firings-1511305453". The list goes on.

Analysts have for a while now been predicting a downturn in public sentiment toward Big Data. In 2013, for instance, consulting firm Ernst & Young in a survey report titled The Big Data Backlash said "the Golden Age of anytime, anywhere, free-for-all access to customer data" would come to end in 2018.

Regulations could slow the ability to collect Big Data. Take the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation: Its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-questions-about-what-to-expect-when-gdpr-takes-effect-1527154200?mod=searchresults&page=2&pos=11" and led to a decline of 1 million Facebook users in that region during the second quarter.

Companies are responding by appointing more chief data officers who report directly to the CEO, Ernst & Young's global analytics leader, Beatriz Sanz Saiz, said in an interview. While this promotes better accountability, it is primarily because "the first priority for most executives is to leverage their own internal data."

Ms. Sanz Saiz estimates companies typically use only 5% to 10% of the data they collect. They would like to use more. That's why a slate of industries from oil to transportation to health care are beefing up internal data departments or "https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-courts-a-wary-oil-patch-1532424600" like Alphabet Inc. or Microsoft Corp.

Companies can't just leave these strategies to the tech guys, Andrew White, an analyst with tech research firm Gartner, said in an interview. Boards of directors need to look at the functions tied to Big Data (machine learning, artificial intelligence or cloud computing, for instance) with the same rigor as executive pay, financial auditing or management succession.

"IT cannot do the type of governance we're talking about," Mr. White said. "This is a business that provides a service and they are not entirely weighing the social consequences.  & It's not different than dealing with climate change."

Ernst & Young's survey found nearly 80% of respondents believe companies collect data in order to line their pockets rather than to simply make life easier. "As a result, they are becoming more selective about who they share data with and a backlash is building," the firm said.

To counter this, companies must prove they can do more than simply "monetize" our data.

Think about the impact Google Maps has on a rural road like the one I live on in southeast Michigan. For years, residents have fought to keep the narrow dirt road, which was a critical thoroughfare before the Civil War, from losing its historic character.

Traffic, however, is increasingly thick because traffic-and-map apps like Google's direct people to use it because it will shave a minute or two from their commute. This has led to higher maintenance costs, crashes (three vehicles have wrecked in our front yard in as many years) and an increase in dust.

"Municipalities and agencies responsible for managing roads and reducing traffic are free to take measures according to their individual needs (e.g. speed humps, changing speed limits, adding traffic lights)," a company spokeswoman said. "Google Maps will then strive to reflect that reality completely and accurately in our map model."

The Cleveland Plain Dealer recently published columns on "https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2018/05/why_is_giant_eagle_carding_70-_1.html": Older people were being "https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2018/05/new_giant_eagle_policy_require.html" before buying age-restricted items at Giant Eagle grocery stores -- and they were concerned about the protection of their personal information.

"They're not scanning it because of your age," Roy Hewitt, a 71-year-old-retired sports editor at that paper, told me. He's clearly eligible to buy alcohol, cigarettes or propane: "My beard is older than 21."

Mr. Hewitt alerted a columnist at the paper about the practice and the subsequent coverage triggered a robust response.

A Giant Eagle spokesman said: "We understand that some customers might have reservations about having their identification cards scanned and want to reassure those customers that Giant Eagle takes its responsibility to protect their personal data very seriously."

Mr. Hewitt says he no longer gets carded, but still has a dim view. "You can't trust some banks and some companies to look at your credit and not get hacked. How in the world are you going to trust a grocery store?"

M&T Bank Security Chief: Avoid AI and Other  Shiny Objects'

Not all cybersecurity spending is good cybersecurity spending.

Nearly one year after the massive data breach at Equifax Inc., some corporate boards and chief executives are more willing to approve budget requests from cybersecurity leaders, according to Gartner Inc.

The hope is that if more money is funnelled into cybersecurity tools and personnel, these companies can avoid an incident like the one revealed by Equifax in September 2017, in which sensitive data about 147.9 million people was compromised. But bigger cybersecurity budgets aren't always better, and often lead to waste, said David Stender, chief security officer at M&T Bank Corp., which has assets of about $119 billion.

"It's the wrong approach to say,  Here's a blank check, tell us what you need and we'll buy it," said Mr. Stender, who oversees cybersecurity as well as disaster recovery, fraud and physical security for the Buffalo, N.Y., lender. "It needs to be cost-effective security, not security at any cost."

Worldwide spending on security is expected to reach $96 billion this year, up 8% from 2017 and up 17% from 2016, according to a December 2017 forecast from Gartner Inc. "A large portion of security spending is driven by an organization's reaction toward security breaches as more high profile cyberattacks and data breaches affect organizations worldwide," said Ruggero Contu, a Gartner research director, in a statement, citing the Equifax breach as having "a direct effect on security spend."

Part of the problem is that cybersecurity is often driven by fear instead of numbers, said Mr. Stender, who spent more than six years at the Internal Revenue Service, including as associate chief information officer for cybersecurity and chief information security officer. He joined M&T Bank in 2014.

"Much of this world is still art rather than science," he said. Unlike lending and insurance, which have hundreds of years of data to help predict risks such as loan default rates, cybersecurity is only a few decades old, he said.

Without reliable metrics to measure efficiency or the success of risk mitigation tactics, some CISOs ask for bigger budgets than necessary, said Mr. Stender. Responsible security executives should instead look to cut waste, which can be pervasive, he said.

Doubts About AI

"I think companies are spending money in the wrong way," he said. "A lot of companies try to chase that next silver bullet--artificial intelligence being a great example--and they put way too much money into it way too early."

Proponents of AI say the technology allows companies to analyze vast amounts of data, which can help spot signs of anomalous behavior that may not be noticed by traditional tools or the human eye.

Mr. Stender said AI was an example of a "shiny object you might not use or you only take advantage of 10% of it" and is generally not worth the investment. Most companies that purchase AI-based cybersecurity tools aren't ready to adopt them, he said. For example, many companies see AI as a way to automate security and reduce headcount, he said. But once the technology is deployed, these companies realize they need to hire high-paid AI experts to effectively use the tools.

"They could take that money and put it into improving basic cybersecurity hygiene, which would do much more to protect their company," he said. Such practices include regularly patching devices and applications, constantly backing up data and educating employees on password management and phishing attacks.

M&T Bank does not use AI for cybersecurity, Mr. Stender said. He approaches the issue as he does with any emerging technology: let other companies experiment first.

Companies should keep tabs on what large companies and government agencies do with such technologies, and learn from their mistakes, he said.

The latest example of this is a combination of private-equity backed companies serving the public safety sector and public administration agencies. The newly combined business plans to incorporate artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things in its business as it seeks to expand.

This week, TriTech Software Systems, Superion and the public sector and health-care units of Aptean Corp. said they would merge. The combined company would generate revenue in excess of $400 million, said its new chief executive, Simon Angove.

TriTech is backed by Bain Capital Private Equity, while Superion and Aptean are backed by technology-focused Vista Equity Partners. Each firm brings its own set of networks and expertise to the combined company.

The new company is using data to help identify security and crime trends and cut down false alarms for first responders, said Mr. Angove, adding the business also is aiming to use Internet of Things technology to help firefighters respond to fires quickly. It also plans to leverage artificial intelligence for utility billing, as in keeping track of energy usage through smart meters and allowing customers to pay bills via Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant program, he said.

The deal is one of a number of private-equity investments involving companies offering new technologies to old-school industries to help them upgrade their business processes.

WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported firms increasingly have been integrating software and technological advances into companies in the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-seeks-to-retool-industrial-businesses-with-technology-1530876600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=14" space. Established sectors such as industrial machinery typically don't come to mind when one thinks of cutting-edge software products, which is exactly what attracts private-equity firms.

The effort to bring new technology to established industries, some of which often lack means of collecting data or using software to guide business processes, could generate more tie-ups with private-equity firms.

Companies with more experience in industries without much technology adoption may seek partnerships with firms specializing in tech assets. Doing so presumably allows the firms and companies to capitalize on each other's knowledge and expertise.

Of course, not all of these marriages will necessarily end happily. Firms may have different opinions when it comes to exit timing or strategic direction of a business.

However, as more established industries embrace technological innovation, private-equity firms should continue to find a role as drivers of change.

Big Employers Seek Startups' Help on Health Care; Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire an influencer

As employers become increasingly responsible for health-care purchasing decisions, more are turning to startups for help.

This year, the share of U.S. workers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/share-of-u-s-employees-offered-health-care-through-work-rises-1532112860"at work rose for the first time in six years, according to the Labor Department.

Targeting the health-care purchasing power of employers and an uptick in employer-sponsored plans and value-based care, startups offering new models of health insurance, customized health plans, and software to manage benefits are finding traction with customers and investors.

Venture investors have followed suit, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/record-investments-but-few-exits-in-health-care-services-1532431801"in the first half of 2018 into the health services sector that includes insurance startups, benefits brokers, and services like mental health.

Perhaps the best known is Oscar Health Insurance Corp., which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oscar-health-lands-3-2-billion-valuation-in-insider-led-round-1522279318"earlier this year. While it struggled with its initial approach of offering individual and Affordable Care Act plans, it later expanded to enterprise customers and said it expects to generate more than $1 billion in revenue in 2018.

Other employer-targeted startups include online benefits platform League Inc., which just raised $47.1 million by Telus Ventures and employer-sponsored health plan Centivo Corporation, which raised a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/centivo-raises-34-million-to-create-primary-care-focused-health-plan-1531908001"led by Bain Capital Ventures.

Managing employee health care is among the most expensive parts of running a company, and it is often beset by inefficient spending on plans that ultimately aren't used.

"Even though mid-sized to large employers have the option to offer different plans, there are no single entities purpose-built to serve a self-funded health plan whose mission is around achieving total cost control," said Centivo Chief Executive Ashok Subramanian, who previously founded employee benefits marketplace Liazon Corporation.

Centivo works directly with physicians and health plans so employers can effectively create their own local, narrow health networks. With customized plans, employers are able to offer employees benefits they will actually use, such as mental health or chronic care management, and offer technology that helps with connecting services and follow-ups.

"It's a lot like what Amazon, JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway are trying to do - build a new type of health system by direct contracting. That's a local game, and we always talk about how health care is really local," said Bessemer Venture Partners General Partner Steve Kraus, whose firm also backed Centivo.

The cohort of employers partnering with health benefits startups builds on another trend of focusing on primary care rather than endless referrals to specialists or clinics for specific conditions, Mr. Kraus said. With the recent shift to value-based care, primary physicians have been identified as the most effective source of coordinating care, preventing health conditions, and lowering costs.

Another approach is being taken by NEA- and Flare Capital Partners-backed Bright Health Inc., which contracts with health systems to create health plans for individuals and families.

But most startups are looking squarely at employers. Other than helping to create bespoke health plans, some startups aim to help employers simplify and streamline their health-care expenditures and offerings.

CollectiveHealth Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurance-provider-collective-health-receives-110-million-1519885124", and Artemis Health Inc., both offer employers benefits navigation and analytics platforms. Former General Electric Chief Executive Jeff Immelt announced Thursday he would join CollectiveHealth's board, and in a blog post he mentioned he spent more on health-care at GE in 2009 than steel.

In today's strong labor market, employers must weigh carefully how to rein in costs while still offering benefits that will draw talent and retain employees, said Maverick Ventures Managing Partner David Singer. His firm has backed Centivo, CollectiveHealth and Artemis.

"With unemployment as low as it is right now, there are genuine issues with recruiting and retaining," said Mr. Singer. "Employers need to show they understand more of the overview of all of the options out there and give employees what they want."

Wounded unicorn Bloom limps on to stock market

Technology

One of the most vaunted "unicorns" created during Silicon Valley's venture into clean technology limped on to the stock market yesterday, the latest sign Wall Street has become a haven for privately owned tech companies that failed to live up to the hype.

Bloom Energy was valued at $1.6bn when it began trading yesterday, a discount of about 75 per cent to what it was judged to be worth two years ago, when it last issued equity as a private concern.

Bloom was once held up as an emblem of the "clean tech" revolution intended to cut energy use. The company, whose "Bloom boxes" are used as back-up energy sources for data centres, was one of the stars in a portfolio assembled by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

Kleiner largely turned its back on the consumer internet more than a decade ago to focus on clean tech, a bet that failed when higher taxes on carbon did not materialise and many of the new technologies proved uneconomic.

"Down rounds", or fundraisings that value a company below their previous rounds, have been a stigma among private tech companies and were once rare in IPOs. They have become more common since payments company Square and online storage group Box went public at discounts of 30-50 per cent in 2015. Bloom represents a more recent phenomenon, as private tech businesses have accepted big discounts to access funding via the public market. Bloom had already raised $1.5bn in funding and $1bn of debt in its 17-year history, but still bleeds cash. It posted an operating cash outflow of $35m in the latest quarter and turned a gross profit for the first time in the final quarter of last year.

The IPO comes a month after that of Domo, another wounded "unicorn"   the name given to privately held startups valued at more than $1bn. The analytics software company was valued at a 85 per cent discount, and its shares have since fallen nearly 10 per cent.

Bloom priced its shares at $15, the top end of the indicated range, to raise $270m and value the company at $1.6bn. In another unusual step, it carried out a reverse share split in the days before its IPO, handing investors two shares for every three already owned to boost the nominal value of each share.

Bloom's shares opened strongly, trading up 37 per cent by lunchtime in New York.

Nielsen CEO to Leave at End of Year; The company also lowered some of its annual financial targets and announced it would launch a strategic review of its 'buy' business

Nielsen Holdings PLC said Chief Executive Mitch Barns intends to retire at year-end, and shares in the market-research company tumbled 25% after it lowered some of its annual financial targets.

The company said Chairman James Attwood, a managing director at Carlyle Group LP, will lead the Nielsen board's search for a new CEO. Nieslen, which plans to start the search immediately, also named Mr. Attwood as executive chairman.

Mr. Barns started at the company in 1997 and became CEO in 2014. He was previously president of the company's U.S. media business and its greater China business.

Nielsen said it would launch a strategic review of its "buy" business, or the part of the company that provides data on retail and consumer behavior.

Shares in Nielsen fell $7.46 to $22.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is off 42% so far this year.

Nielsen expects its revenue to fall 1% this year, down from its prior forecast of 3% growth. The company now expects to earn between 95 cents a share and $1 a share, off from between $1.50 a share and $1.56 a share.

For the quarter ended June 30, revenue was roughly flat from a year earlier at $1.65 billion. Revenue from the company's buy division fell 4.1%, while revenue at Nielsen's watch division which does analytics related to media audiences rose 4.5%. Profit fell 45% to $72 million, or 20 cents a share.

In prepared remarks Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson called the company's earnings results "disappointing."

UK fintechs aren't eating the banks' lunch just yet

In China, tech giants Ant Financial and Tencent have veritably upended the financial establishment, creating digital ecosystems that bring together social media, e-commerce and payments. In the process, they've left traditional banks behind in the dust. For instance, Ant Financial's Alipay handles more than half of the country's $15.5trn online payments market, reporting half a billion active users.

In Britain, though, it's a rather different story. We've been told for a few years now that fintech start-ups such as Monzo, Revolut and Starling Bank were coming for the high street banks' lunch. But, judging by a new set of data, they haven't even got started on their breakfast.

Despite the arrival in January of Open Banking, Britain's implementation of the  game-changing  EU's PSD2 directive which forced banks to share customer data -- therefore allowing challenger banks to contact customers in a bid to improve market share -- it seems UK consumers are still pretty loyal to their good old-fashioned banks. Even the ones whose IT failures have locked them out of their accounts for weeks at a time.

Mobile data analytics company Ogury carried out a study of just over 1.5m mobile users in the UK between April 9 and July 1 this year, and it found the top ten most-used  banking  apps, which include the fintech hopefuls, were all traditional high-street banks.

The top five most-used apps, measured by the share of the total visitors, were, in order, Halifax, Santander, Lloyds, Barclays, and NatWest. Even the technologically challenged TSB managed to hold onto about 7 per cent of the market share over the three-month period. The graph below shows the week-by-week visitor numbers (the tiny lines at the bottom are the fintechs):

Top of the fintechs is established payments unicorn TransferWise, with just 0.5 per cent of the visitor share in the most recent week. Revolut, which recently announced it had signed up 1 million UK users, has just 0.3 percent of the market share, while Starling Bank has 0.2 per cent.

Traditional banks even dominate the new downloads list, though Starling manages to sneak into the top 10, with 4.6 per cent of downloads in the most recent week (compared with Barclays' 15.7 per cent if you include its  Pingit  app with its regular banking one).

Perhaps the most telling piece of data is the one showing how many app users also use other banking apps.

While 67 per cent of Bank of Scotland users are in monogamous relationships with their banking app, only 22 per cent of users show such fidelity to the Monzo app, despite the start-up, as of October last year, offering its customers fully fledged current accounts. (And of course more than 78 per cent of those customers might have other bank accounts but might just not be using those banks' apps.) For Starling, which also offers current accounts, just 19 per cent of customers only use its app.

It should be pointed out that these numbers don't capture that many of the fintech apps, such as Monzo and Revolut, sends push-notifications as soon as a user spends money or tops up their accounts. Of course, this means customers don't go into the apps as regularly as the traditional banking apps, potentially skewing the data to favour the high street titans.

Another fly in the data ointment is the time spent on Apple Pay or Android Pay. Given tech-savvy users are likely to use their phones as payment methods once they've linked their cards, they'll have little need to check their transactions on their banking app as Apple Pay, in this example, also captures this data.

Still, UK bank executives probably aren't losing too much sleep over fintechs just yet. More likely to have them reaching for the Zopiclone are the US tech giants moving into the payments sector who -- somewhat perversely -- could end up being the biggest beneficiaries of PSD2.

Index funds must be activists to serve investors

E fforts by large index fund managers to engage with public companies have recently come under attack from some business leaders. They complain that we are misusing our rights as shareholders to enforce arbitrary political or social "values" because we raise environmental, social and governance concerns with the boards of the companies in which we invest.

This completely misrepresents the mission of State Street Global Advisors and other large index fund managers. We seek long-term value for millions of ordinary investors in a world that has become increasingly obsessed with short-term results. That goal, not some political agenda, is why we have developed a rigorous, research-based shareholder engagement programme. We raise all kinds of issues with boards that might materially affect their company's ability to generate sustainable returns over the long haul.

While our active funds can sell a company if we disagree with its executives, our index funds cannot choose the shares in which they invest. We are essentially permanent capital and cannot turn the S&P 500 into the S&P 499. That means we need to take a long-term perspective on behalf of our clients. At a time when some activist shareholders are keen on extracting short-term profits from companies, we provide a healthy and necessary counterweight.

Our primary fiduciary obligation to our investors is to maximise the probability of attractive long-term returns. Flows into index-based strategies have increased so dramatically over the past few years that we must take this responsibility more seriously than ever. Millions of individual investors count on the low-cost access to markets around the world provided by exchange traded funds and other trackers. This has democratised access to markets that were once available and affordable only to larger institutional investors.

We carefully select the issues we focus on with companies, based on rigorous research into their impact on investment performance. For example, numerous studies show that diversity at board level leads to better decision making, fewer reputational crises and ultimately better returns. This is the reason why we placed the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street and issued specific guidance to boards to take steps to improve diversity. Performance was our motivation, not politics.

This is just one example of how we seek to maximise transparency around our views, the research underpinning them, and our voting intentions. Others can be found in our new 2017 asset stewardship report that provides details on our proxy voting and engagement on thousands of management and shareholder proposals in 82 countries across the globe.

In addition, while we will use the data and analytics provided by proxy advisers, we never outsource our voting decisions and we urge other institutional investors not to do so. These issues are too important to outsource and they are growing more complex.

Increasingly, our clients are pushing for more clarity on non-traditional investment issues. They want to know how companies are incorporating climate risk into their long-term strategy; whether they are adopting best practices around corporate governance, board quality and pay policies; how they are adapting to technology disruptions that could threaten their industries.

We need only look to recent corporate scandals around poor internal controls to remind us of the importance of active shareholder engagement.

Far from injecting politics into boardrooms, we believe our focus on active stewardship in a rapidly changing and complex world is more important than ever for ensuring healthy public markets, resilient economic growth and shared prosperity. We are creating longterm value; not imposing values.

The writer is president and chief executive officer of State Street Global Advisors

Air Canada and a consortium of financial groups have offered to buy back the Canadian carrier s reward programme for C$2.25bn ($1.72bn), more than a decade after it spun off the business.

The Canadian airline said it would create a new company with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Visa Canada to purchase the rewards business from data analytics group Aimia.

The deal would include C$250m of cash and the assumption of Aeroplan frequent-flyer points worth C$2bn. Air Canada, TD, CIBC and Visa valued the offer at $3.64 per Aimia share. Aimia stock trading in Toronto climbed more than 30 per cent to $3.38, valuing the company at C$381m.

The group backing the proposed deal said the transaction would safeguard the rewards points for millions of Canadians as Air Canada shifts to a new loyalty programme in 2020.

 Given Aimia s current situation and future prospects, the proposed transaction delivers value to Aimia s stakeholders,  the consortium said in a statement.

A spokesperson for Aimia could not immediately be reached for comment.

Mr. Bossert served in the White House until April, when current National Security Adviser John Bolton reorganized the staff, according to Yahoo. U.S. cybersecurity coordinator Rob Joyce also resigned. Mr. Bossert told Yahoo he now is concerned about "who's minding the store in the coordination and development...of new and creative cyber policies and strategies."

Cybercriminals in January 2017 again used a phishing attack to breach the same bank and access software that manages customer accounts, according to KrebsOnSecurity.

On the heels of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bloom-energy-prices-ipo-at-high-end-of-range-1532517159?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", a handful of technology companies expect to go public by the end of next week.

First up is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cybersecurity-player-tenable-files-for-ipo-1530305573?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", which will make its debut Thursday. The security company sold 10.9 million shares at $23 a share, above the anticipated range of $20 to $22 a share. The company now has a market capitalization of $2.09 billion.

The company had raised over $300 million in private equity, despite being located thousands of miles away from Silicon Valley in Columbia, Md. Accel and Insight Venture Partners are among its largest venture backers.

Tenable is part of a wave of security companies to go public this year, following ZScaler Inc. and Carbon Black Inc.

Another debut slated for Thursday is Pinduoduo Inc., a mobile e-commerce business based in Shanghai that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-groupon-is-on-offerat-full-price-1531913943". Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed China Partners are investors.

IDG Capital and Accel-backed Aurora Mobile Ltd. is an additional Chinese company going public in the U.S. this week. The analytics platform for app developers follows other Chinese listings like Bilibili Inc. and iQIYI.com Inc. earlier this year.

However, some investors question whether many Chinese companies will continue to list in the U.S."https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-chinas-tech-ipos-pass-over-the-u-s-1530876600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3" makes it more amenable to founders.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/index-redpoint-set-for-sonos-ipo-payoff-1531135854?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4"

The spurt of IPOs is driven by the success of recent offerings. Excluding health care, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rejuvenated-ipo-market-poised-to-build-on-bullish-views-1531479601?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" The post-IPO performance of these companies is also one of the best years since the dot-com boom in 2000.

Other venture-backed companies looking to debut in the coming months include Eventbrite Inc. and SurveyMonkey.

GSK invests $300m in gene profiling group 23andMe

Equity stake in Google Ventures-backed group comes as drugmaker unveils  major restructuring 

GlaxoSmithKline has announced a wide-ranging partnership with 23andMe, including a $300m equity investment in the Silicon Valley gene testing company and a four-year exclusive collaboration in drug discovery.

The 23andMe deal was the centrepiece of a new research strategy presented on Wednesday by Hal Barron, GSK s chief scientist, alongside the UK pharmaceutical group s second-quarter results, which beat market expectations.

Shares in GSK rose 1.5 per cent after the announcement.

Mr Barron, who joined GSK in January after a career in drug development based in San Francisco, said the company would in future identify new medicines through three complementary approaches: modulating the human immune system, analysing genetic data from 23andMe and other sources such as UK Biobank, and applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the discovery process.

23andMe, founded 12 years ago with funding from US west coast investors such as Sequoia Capital and Google Ventures, has a chequered past, including a run-in with the Food and Drug Administration over the way it marketed DNA tests to consumers.

It has since made peace with the regulators and now has a customer base of more than 5m people, 80 per cent of whom have agreed that their genetic data can be used for research. Their information would be  de-identified  to safeguard individual privacy, GSK said.

Anne Wojcicki, chief executive of 23andMe, said:  This collaboration will enable us to deliver on what many customers have been asking for   cures or treatments for diseases. 

To help fund the new R&D programme, GSK will carry out what Emma Walmsley, chief executive, called a  major restructuring programme  that aims to cut costs by 400m a year by 2021. She said the savings would be achieved through  supply chain optimisation and reductions in administrative costs  but declined to disclose where cuts were likely.

GSK boosted its full-year earnings forecast after  an encouraging first half-year of trading  with the vaccines business performing especially well   Shingrix, its new shingles vaccine, is on course for 600m-650m sales this year, far ahead of analysts  estimates.

The company now expects to post adjusted earnings per share growth of 7 per cent to 10 per cent for 2018 at constant exchange rates, assuming that  no substitutable generic competitor  to its respiratory product Advair is introduced in the US market. It had previously forecast 4-7 per cent growth.

Ms Walmsley s priority is to turn round the pharmaceuticals division, which has performed relatively poorly in comparison with some other drug companies. Asked about the prospects of spinning off GSK s consumer division, as some investors have advocated, she said that the GSK board still favoured the current diversified structure, as long as the pharma, vaccines and consumer divisions all continued to perform well.

 The board s position today is unchanged,  she said, but did not rule out a spin-off in future.

Analysts reacted enthusiastically to the 23andMe deal and financial results.  Overall a very positive announcement,  said David Cox of Panmure Gordon.  On top of the good numbers and the cost savings, the outlook for the future remains confident with several [products] expected to launch 2018 to 2020.

Chinese Sour on U.S. Property

Chinese real-estate investors, facing pressure from Beijing, are reversing a yearslong buying spree in the U.S. where they often paid record prices for marquee properties like New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel.

Chinese insurers, conglomerates, and other investors have turned net sellers of U.S. commercial real estate for the first time in a decade. They have spent tens of billions of dollars to acquire hotels, office buildings, and vast swaths of empty land to build residential towers.

But Chinese investors sold $1.29 billion worth of U.S. commercial real estate in the second quarter, while purchasing only $126.2 million of property, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. This marked the first time these investors were net sellers for a quarter since 2008.

The more than $1 billion in net sales reflects how much the Chinese government's attitude toward investing overseas has changed in recent months.

Chinese investors began scooping up U.S. real estate a few years ago after Beijing officials loosened restrictions on foreign investment. They quickly made their mark in U.S. cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago with high-profile acquisitions -- including the $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria, the highest price ever paid for a U.S. hotel.

Now, the Chinese government has changed course again, cracking down on certain types of outbound investment that include real estate in part to help stabilize the currency. Chinese companies like HNA Group and Greenland Holding Group are unloading prize properties to repay debt and to comply with regulatory and market pressures from home, analysts said.

"I was shocked," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics. "They really curtailed their buying and stepped up sales."

Analysts say that increasing tensions over trade and national security between China and the U.S. also have contributed to the pullback.

"The China-U.S. outbound cross-border real-estate climate has been negatively impacted by the geopolitical climate," said David Blumenfeld, a Hong Kong-based partner at Paul Hastings LLP.

Likely sellers include Anbang Insurance Group, which was taken over by Chinese regulators in February and whose chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was convicted of fraud and abuse of power. Anbang is considering selling some of its U.S. hotels. But it has yet to strike any deals, and has been renovating its most prized purchase, the Waldorf in New York.

"The company is still in the process of reviewing overseas assets," said Shen Gang, an Anbang spokesman. "We currently do not have specific asset optimization plan, nor a specific timetable."

The retreat by Chinese investors could slow growth further in the U.S. commercial real-estate market. Property values have plateaued on average in the past 18 months after rising sharply in the early years of the post-2008 financial crisis recovery.

While Chinese buyers never represented more than a fraction of the buying power in any U.S. market, these companies often made headlines with the steep prices they were willing to pay, which helped push values higher in certain segments of the market.

In 2015, China's Sunshine Insurance Group bought the Baccarat Hotel in midtown Manhattan for around $230 million, a price that valued the luxury property at about $2 million a room. That was one of the highest valuations ever for a hotel by the popular industry metric.

Chinese investors had their own reasons for paying top dollar. Some of the executives running these firms felt that controlling trophy properties conferred prestige on their owners and built their brand recognition for future expansion, analysts say. A number of Chinese investors also planned to hold these properties for several decades, so they weren't worried about prices falling in major markets like New York, the analysts add.

For many Chinese firms, that long-term timetable has been scraped after the government began pressuring companies to reduce their debt levels and to cut credit risk in the banking sector.

Not every Chinese investor is under pressure to sell. Developers of smaller residential projects and insurers that own warehouses and senior living centers aren't in retreat, lawyers for these developers say.

And even for Chinese companies that face this pressure, some have been able to sell at a profit. The government has allowed investors to start by selling properties that have increased in value to avoid losing face, according to Chinese investors.

For example, this year HNA Group and a partner sold 1180 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan to Northwood Investors for around $305 million, according to data from CoStar Group. The conglomerate, which has its headquarters in Haikou, a city in southern China's Hainan province, bought a 90% stake in the office tower for $259 million in 2011.

HNA Group also has recently sold a stake in 245 Park Avenue to SL Green Realty Corp, and SL Green will have operating control of the building. HNA bought the tower for $2.2 billion last year.

"HNA Group has long said it will be disciplined and thoughtful about its asset dispositions as it realigns its strategy," a spokesman of HNA said. Late last year, HNA Group earmarked roughly $6 billion worth of properties for sale, according to a person close to the matter.

Chinese lenders also want to avoid the painful repercussions that losses would cause.

"If there is a fire sale, the banks also lose," said Edward Tse, chief executive of Gao Feng Advisory Co., a Shanghai-based consulting firm.

Real-Estate IPO to Test Investor Faith in Economic Expansion; Cushman & Wakefield is going public, but rising interest rates and fears the expansion is late in the cycle could frighten off some investors

Stock market investors are awaiting one of the real-estate industry's most closely watched initial public offerings in years, setting up what could be a Wall Street referendum on the current economic expansion.

Cushman & Wakefield, a global brokerage and real-estate-services firm that reported $6.92 billion in 2017 revenue, is hoping to sell $719 million to $931 million in shares in an IPO that would value the firm at roughly $6 billion including debt, according to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cushman-wakefield-sets-ipo-price-between-16-and-18-1532362497".

Trading is expected to begin in early August on the New York Stock Exchange after a roadshow in which backers of the offering will discuss Cushman with potential investors, the firm said.

The real-estate business is closely aligned with the health of the broader economy, and the success or failure of Cushman's IPO will reflect in part whether investors believe economic growth in many parts of the world will continue.

Like CBRE Group Inc., JLL, and other publicly traded real-estate firms, Cushman is highly dependent on sales and leasing brokerage commissions. These balloon when companies are expanding and real-estate investors are gobbling up office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial property.

But these revenues crater when economies contract. For example, CBRE reported $4.2 billion in 2009, the year after the stock market crash, down from $5.1 billion in 2008 and $6 billion in 2007.

Global brokerage firms have been trying to insulate themselves from this volatility by building up businesses with steadier revenue like property management. Such "recurring" revenue represented 47% of Cushman's total in 2017, according to papers the firm filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.

Still, the brokerage business draws the biggest profits from its more economically sensitive businesses, rather than those generating steady recurring revenue.

"Commercial real estate will continue to be a cyclical industry," said Louise Keeling, portfolio manager at RWC Partners Ltd., in an email. The London- based asset manager with about $15.5 billion in assets under management owns shares in CBRE and Savills PLC, a London-based real-estate services firm.

Real-estate bulls believe the current economic expansion may have years to run. They point out that shares of CBRE and JLL, the world's largest and second-largest commercial real-estate firms respectively, are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cushman-is-expected-to-set-ipo-pricing-1532094284".

"I think we're in for an extended cycle," said Ross Smotrich, an analyst with Barclays who follows CBRE and JLL.

But Wall Street bears point to signs that the strong rebound of commercial real-estate values that began shortly after the last recession ended is running out of steam. Values of properties owned by U.S. real-estate investment trusts have plateaued over the past 18 months, although some sectors, like industrial property, are doing better than others.

Meanwhile, rising interest rates have increased the likelihood that capital will increasingly shift from commercial real estate to the bond market, driving down property values. These concerns already have sent tremors through the real-estate investment trust sector causing it to underperform the broader stock market since the beginning of 2016.

Indeed, many thought the investment group led by private-equity firm TPG that acquired Cushman in 2015 made its bet on commercial real estate too late in the cycle. Their fears seemed to be borne out in 2016, when rising interest rates and other economic concerns caused shares of CBRE and JLL to fall.

Some of those worries eased last year. Property values in most markets didn't suffer the decline many feared, and the brokerage business strengthened as companies in Europe and the U.S. expanded. CBRE's revenue in 2017 was $14.2 billion, up from $13.1 billion in 2016.

Last year's tax overhaul, which many analysts believe will help extend the U.S. expansion, also boosted the commercial real-estate business. Continued appetite for commercial property by cross-border investors has also helped make up for concern about interest rate increases. Sales globally increased 15% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the first quarter of 2017, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"The commercial real-estate market is proving more resilient than investors had been expecting," said Jade Rahmani, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "If you would have told me the Fed is on track to raise rates four times this year on top of the rate rises we had last year and it's not going to impact the transaction market, I would have said, 'you're kidding me.'"

The macroeconomic outlook isn't the only possible concern that could cause the Cushman IPO to be a dud. The firm also has more and lower profit margins debt than many of its peers. The firm recorded net losses of $221 million and $92 million in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 respectively partly because of spending on integrating the three firms.

But if investor appetite is strong, it would be a good outcome for the TPG group, which wrote an equity check for Cushman and the two other firms of about $500 million, according to a person familiar with the deal. With a $6 billion valuation, TPG is poised to double its equity investment as that stake would be would with just over $1 billion, at least on paper, the person said.

Credit Suisse Unit Closes $261 Million Growth-Equity Fund

A Credit Suisse Group AG affiliate is betting there is money to be made in backing technology companies that serve the financial-services industry.

NEXT Investors, a growth-equity unit of Credit Suisse's asset management division, collected about $261 million for its second fund focused on investments in the sector. The fund held a $110 million initial closing in March 2017, said a Credit Suisse spokeswoman.

The vehicle, NEXT Investors II LP, collected money predominantly from outside limited partners, said Greg Grimaldi, a partner who co-leads NEXT.

The second vehicle is the first in which Credit Suisse isn't an investor, although the fund works with the bank on a number of areas, including sourcing deal flow.

The fund is a vote of confidence by institutional LPs for the team to continue its investment activities in the financial-services industry. Alan Freudenstein and Mr. Grimaldi began investing in the space at Credit Suisse in 2000, investing from the bank's balance sheet until 2013. In 2014, NEXT secured $404 million in total commitments for its first fund, including $135 million in new investments and the $269 million purchase of a portfolio that Credit Suisse transferred to the firm.

The fund invests in companies in areas such as financial technology, enterprise software, data analytics and specialty finance.

The NEXT team so far has deployed $498 million in 71 investments, according to a news release. The firm last year made a $6 million Series A investment in LUX Fund Technology & Solutions Inc., which provides technology to alternative asset managers. That investment was made out of NEXT's second fund, Mr. Freudenstein said.

NEXT generally invests $10 million to $15 million in equity per deal. This strategy is similar to that of the firm's previous fund, said Mr. Freudenstein, who added NEXT's strategy for investing in the space hasn't changed in the roughly 18 years the two men have been investing together.

The growth-focused vehicle invests in companies that "are at or near cash-flow positive and need additional cash flow to grow," Mr. Freudenstein said. The latest fund, which has a five-year investment period, is expected to make about 20 investments, he added.

Chinese Consumers to Get WebMD Content via WeChat; Tencent will translate and adapt the content for Chinese audiences, as well as focus on diseases that are more prevalent in China

HONG KONG China's Tencent Holdings Ltd. has struck a deal to provide WebMD's health-care content to the more than 1 billion users on its WeChat social network, according to both companies.

The content-licensing deal includes WebMD articles, videos and slideshows covering medical and health topics, such as the side effects of chemotherapy or the symptoms of appendicitis. Financial terms weren't disclosed.

WebMD, which is owned by private-equity firm KKR & Co. and based in New York, said the deal will raise the quality of health-care information available to Chinese consumers. The content, slated to be rolled out by year's end, will also be available on Tencent's QQ messaging app.

"There are tens of millions of people on WeChat today that are forming groups for specific disease information, whether it's cancer or diabetes," said Jeremy Schneider, senior vice president of corporate development and global strategy for WebMD. "There is a lot of talking amongst themselves, but there is not a lot of credible information."

Tencent will translate and adapt the content for Chinese audiences, as well as focus on diseases that are more prevalent in China, such as lung cancer, Meng Zhang, general manager of Tencent Healthcare Information Center, wrote in an email.

"There are quite some differences between Chinese and Western demographics, medical practices and cultures," Mr. Zhang wrote. "It is very important that we take into account these differences during the localization process."

Health care is a big and growing business in China, which is forecast to spend $1 trillion on health care by 2020, according to a report from McKinsey & Co. Its aging population is increasingly dealing with chronic conditions such as diabetes, but the health-care system doesn't have enough general family doctors who can direct patients to the right treatments and specialists, said Philip Leung, head of the Greater China Healthcare practice for consulting firm Bain & Co.

That leaves many people turning up at the hospital for care. Wait times can be so extreme that ticket scalpers book hospital appointments and then try to sell them for a big markup, a practice Beijing has started cracking down on, said Mark Natkin, managing director of research firm Marbridge Consulting.

In recent years, China has expanded insurance coverage, encouraged the growth of private hospitals and pushed for digitizing medical records. To further improve care, China last year tapped Tencent to be a "national champion" to develop uses of artificial intelligence technology in medicine.

Tencent has backed dozens of health-care companies both in China and around the world. Mr. Natkin said his firm has tracked at least 30 health-care-related investments since April 2012, and said there are probably more. Tencent declined to comment.

The new WebMD services will compete against a growing number of companies providing not only medical information but also online tools that help Chinese consumers navigate the system.

On WeDoctor, for example, users can consult doctors and book appointments online. The startup is backed by Tencent and slated to go public in Hong Kong later this year. Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co., which also provides online diagnosis and doctor-booking services, went public in May.

Politics Have Already Entered the Boardroom

Phil Gramm and Mike Solon's "Keep Politics Out of the Boardroom" (op-ed, July 19) criticizing the role of large index managers misrepresents State Street Global Advisors' core investment mission. We engage with companies not to force arbitrary political or social "values" on them, but rather to promote long-term value for millions of investors saving for the future in a world that has become increasingly obsessed with the short term. Unlike our active strategies, where we can sell a company when we disagree with management, in our index-based strategies we represent quasi-permanent capital. Our fiduciary obligation is to maximize the probability of attractive long-term returns for those who invest with us.

We have created a strategic engagement program that raises material issues with boards, including ESG concerns that might impact companies' ability to generate sustainable returns. We carefully select the issues, based on rigorous research identifying their materiality for investment performance. We seek maximum transparency around our views, the research underpinning them and our voting intentions through our thought leadership and conversations with both boards and our clients, who are demanding greater clarity around these issues.

While we will use the analytics provided by proxy advisers, we never outsource our proxy voting decisions. Far from injecting politics into boardrooms, we believe our focus on active stewardship and long-term value in a rapidly changing world is more important than ever for ensuring healthy public markets, resilient economic growth and shared prosperity. This is the future of long-term investing.

Vanguard has developed something called an Investment Stewardship program. The program brochure goes to great lengths to highlight Vanguard's advocacy for trendy issues such as board gender targets, board diversity targets, sustainability reporting and climate risks. Traditional concerns, such as executive pay, board experience, conflicts of interest and unequal voting-share classes, are included but not highlighted.

Vanguard seems to be seeking to immunize itself against curious regulators and others looking at legal issues surrounding its proxy voting by signing up with nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations to allow it to prominently display their logos.

All the Vanguard material reminds me of an article in Foreign Policy from Feb. 21 of last year: "Saving the World, One Meaningless Buzzword at a Time," about how the corporate world has turned human rights into a theater of meaningless programs, conventions, meetings and training courses.

Questions of culture divide Lehman from Goldman

The senior partner of a law firm asks colleagues a simple question to assess the health of the organisation's culture: "Why do you stay?" There is a twist, he told me. They should not answer when they are in the flow of an exciting case, basking in the prestige and pay of their position, or looking forward to a sunny weekend surrounded by their admiring family. Instead, they should recall their worst day   when a senior colleague had bawled them out, say, the workload seemed unmanageable, and they arrived home in a rainstorm, too late to kiss the children good night. Why did they stay on that day? For all the emphasis on scientific gauges of culture, powered by big data or artificial intelligence, this seems a good way of probing for organisational strengths and weaknesses. Last week, in a farewell note to staff at Goldman Sachs, outgoing chief executive Lloyd Blankfein half-answered the question: "When times are tougher, you can't leave," he wrote.

"And, when times are better, you don't want to leave."

How corporate cultures rise and fall is on my mind because I recently watched The Lehman Trilogy, Ben Power's adaptation of Stefano Massini's epic saga about the bank, in a new production at London's National Theatre. At the same time, the UK's Financial Reporting Council has published its revised governance code, in which it urges boards to "assess and monitor culture".

The regulator guides directors towards the features of good culture, including honesty, openness, respect and a sense of shared purpose. It sets these against symptoms of sickness: a dominant chief executive, pressure to meet overambitious targets, and low levels of meaningful engagement between leadership and staff. Exactly the sort of faults that were laid at the door of Lehman's last chief executive, the self-deluded Dick Fuld.

It is no plot spoiler to mention that The Lehman Trilogy, like Lehman itself, ends with Mr Fuld. In fact, the bank's tumultuous collapse in 2008 merits only 10 minutes of the three-hour show. Most of the play describes the values, influence, and trajectory of the three original Lehman brothers and their descendants over a century and a half. With forgivable simplification, it lays the blame for Lehman's eventual demise in part on how American capitalism distanced itself from real products such as those that the three brothers bought and sold in Alabama in the mid-19th century   textiles, cotton, coffee. The production suggests another, and more important, factor was the firm's catastrophic cultural decay.

The final decline starts in the 1970s and 1980s, when stewardship of the bank passes from the family to traders such as the repulsive Lew Glucksman (who used to wield a small axe in the office) and his protg Mr Fuld.

In the London production, the contrast is brought out by the fact that the actors portraying the brothers also play every other character. Even at the moment of bankruptcy, the darkest episode of the financial crisis, the trio are a visible onstage reminder, in their black frock coats and stiff collars, of the bank's entrepreneurial origins and its pioneering early success.

Of course, Lehman needed to evolve to survive, as did Goldman Sachs. Culturally, the firms were once not so far apart. Indeed, at the beginning of the last century, second generation scions of the founding German-Jewish families prospered through partnering on deals, such as taking retailer Sears Roebuck public.

But Lehman failed to heed the advice now offered by the UK regulator: to monitor and control its poisonous subcultures, the "hotspots and outliers [that] can alert the board to a possible problem".

Like Glucksman and Mr Fuld, Mr Blankfein was a trader. But, whatever you think of Goldman as an organisation, he proved able to assimilate the culture of investment banking and hold the bank together through the financial crisis. His successor, David Solomon, is an investment banker (albeit one with a sideline in DJ-ing) who will have to achieve the reverse cultural trick.

Another FRC culture tip is to conduct exit interviews with people who quit. It is a step that companies often skip or rush. Mr Blankfein's farewell note hints at a useful alternative. After a time, ask alumni what they miss most and least about the organisation.

Mr Blankfein forecasts he will miss Goldman's people. It is a predictable response, but analogous to the reply the law firm partner hears most often when he asks colleagues why they stay: we wouldn't want to let our mates down. There is one snag in using this as the ultimate test of good culture: many Lehman staff would have said the same 10 years ago, the day before the bank imploded. As Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman knew, a rotten culture at the top infects the whole.

Spend five minutes browsing cryptocurrency content on Telegram, the encrypted messaging app, and you ll soon discover dozens of  pump and dump  scams orchestrated with a brazenness that makes the Wolf of Wall Street look like a pussy cat.

The threads typically urge speculators to pile into one chosen cryptocurrency at a certain time, inflating the price. This sucks in other unwitting punters, driving the price up higher still, and at some point, the pumpers become dumpers and cash out rapidly.

 We guarantee you the x2 if everyone buys and promotes the coin. Never panic sell, trust us and we will take you to the moon,  one group called Crypto VIP Signals promises its 50,000 subscribers.

 Buy the f***ing dip! Make this pump great again!  another instructs its 25,000-strong community, without mincing its words.

Pump and dump schemes are just one example of market manipulation that is thought to be rife in loosely-regulated crypto land. Others include front-running, wash trading, which involves creating false volume by matching trades, and spoofing, where you place and then quickly cancel orders.

 [The market] is highly, highly, highly manipulated. The extent is truly humongous,  says Asaf Meir, a former software engineer at Goldman Sachs who has launched a startup called Solidus Labs to develop market surveillance tools specifically for crypto markets.

It's responding to demand, he says, as crypto firms realise that market manipulation is as big a worry for risk and compliance teams as money-laundering.

In many cases, dodgy behaviour can be facilitated by collusion over social media and messaging apps. In addition, crypto assets are held via electronic identities that in many cases allow traders to remain anonymous.

It is hard to get a precise sense of the scale of the problem as there is little data is available. Still, regulators  ears have pricked up.

Last week, the Financial Stability Board, the group of policymakers and regulators that makes recommendations to the G20, said some crypto data on prices, trading volumes and volatility was unreliable due to manipulation.

Across the pond, the US Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have announced a criminal investigation into possible cryptocurrency manipulation, and requested trading data from some large exchanges. It comes after several traditional US exchanges last year launched bitcoin futures, products that unlike the biggest cryptocurrency itself are directly regulated by US authorities.

The CFTC has even promised whistleblowers on pump-and-dump schemes that lead to  monetary sanctions of $1m or more  that they might be rewarded with between 10 and 30 per cent of the penalties. It s little surprise then that crypto market surveillance is gaining traction.

Mr Meir of Solidus Labs says his firm is working on developing a product for market makers, hedge funds and brokerages. Meanwhile, a wave of cryptocurrency exchanges have also announced they are taking action.

Gemini, run by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, said in April that it would use Nasdaq s surveillance technology called Smarts.

Last week, UK exchange Coinfloor followed in the footsteps of US exchange Coinbase when it launched a partnership with Chicago s Trading Technologies, a market surveillance company that has long offered its products to the traditional derivatives trading marketplace.

Obi Nwosu, Coinfloor s chief executive, tells FintechFT that without moves to stamp out crypto manipulation,  you will eventually have a market which is not functioning well and it will end up like a  tragedy of the commons  scenario &damaging the market and potentially destroying it .

But others are less open to the idea. In a snappishblog post, top 30 exchange Kraken said that being protected from market manipulation  doesn t matter  to most crypto traders.

 It s fair to say there s a split,  Mr Nwosu explains.  If you re quite short term in your focus you might not care about putting systems in place - unlike those with a long term view. 

Further fintech fascination

Millennials and their moneyThe mobile payments revolution in China has happened with breathtaking speed and scale. In only five years it has transformed daily life in Chinese cities and also laid the foundations for the country s mammoth financial tech industry, which last year generated revenues of Rmb654bn ($98bn), according to iResearch. Last year, the value of mobile payments in China overtook the worldwide totals of both Visa and Mastercard. Almost half the world s digital payments in 2017 were made in China, through apps such as Alipay and WeChat, according to PwC research.This transformation has been spearheaded by millennials, who were the early adopters of mobile payments, but it has rapidly spread across generations. Read the full article and see the rest of the FT'sMillennial momentseries.

Big Brother s backChina s authoritarian government is taking steps to create a  Big Brother  state, where artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology can be wielded to monitor citizens round the clock. The government says that by 2020, it wants to have a national video surveillance network that is  omnipresent, fully networked, always working and fully controllable . AI technologies have already allowed Chinese companies to give consumers a social credit score, conferring wider benefits on those with high scores and penalising those with low ones. But there is concern it could be used for more sinister purposes - such as spying on political dissidents and persecuted minorities.

Default-to-defaultA wave of defaults has hit China s $190bn peer-to-peer lending industry this year, as Beijing cracks down on debt and financial risk in the shadow-banking sector. About 150 online lending platforms have suffered  problems  since the beginning of June this year, data show, meaning investors have been unable to take out money, owners have run away or police have launched an investigation into a platform.

Bits and bobs

Compliance crunchRevolut has reported suspected money laundering on its digital payments system to the UK s law enforcement authorities and financial regulator. The move calls into question whether the fast-growing digital payments provider, which is currently advertising for its third compliance head in the past year, can maintain strong enough defences against financial crime.

Over exposedGlobal banking standard-setters are examining how material banks  exposure to  crypto-assets  is and considering introducing capital requirements. Such a move by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision could deter banks - who have already had to bolster their capital buffers post-crisis - from embracing cryptos. Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Board has published a framework for monitoring the risks from crypto-assets to financial stability.

ClonesAs part of a project on the future of banking, UBS has created an avatar clone of Swiss economist Daniel Kalt using the computer gaming industry s latest animation techniques. Potentially exciting for banks keen to cut costs - but will  robo advisers  ever take off?

CryptoFACFA Institute, the organisation that hands out the coveted  Chartered Financial Analyst  qualification to people who make it through 300 hours of study, is adding topics on cryptocurrencies and blockchain to its curriculum as of next year,Bloomberg reports.

Banks

Artificial intelligence could soon be powering a new way of making decisions across Barclays' trading, lending and risk management divisions after the UK bank became the flagship customer of AI simulation firm Simudyne.

Simudyne allows banks to create computer models that simulate millions of possible scenarios, allowing them to test how individual factors will perform and interact with each other in different situations.

Banks rely largely on models that extrapolate from historical data, complemented by complex and expensive simulations in niche areas such as valuing options.

"Simulations based on agent-based modelling techniques allow banks to account for the ability of agents   the people, firms, traders and so on   to deviate from rationality, optimise or exploit their environment," said Justin Lyon, Simudyne chief executive.

"Given a policy change, these models can be used to see how a system will reconfigure itself   allowing machine intelligence to stay ahead of the human responses."

Mr Lyon said the platform was particularly useful for exploring "tail events" such as trade wars or other unpredictable policy outcomes.

Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, has highlighted the potential for agent-based models to address complex macroeconomic questions, particularly those where "heterogeneity, networks and heuristics play an important role".

CS Venkatakrishnan, Barclays group chief risk officer, said the bank hoped agent-based models would help it to "spot and prepare for risks arising from dynamic and large, direct and contingent counter-party exposures". Banks' most elaborate modelling efforts to date have been focused on their trading rooms. Mr Lyon says Simudyne's software enables them to recreate the factors underlying an entire financial marketplace. "The most interesting things that can happen   the collapse of a bank, the spread of contagion   are the result of multiple factors that aggregate towards a tipping point."

For lending, Simudyne's software allows banks to build simulations based on inputs such as household incomes, how people spend their money and how they behave as borrowers.

EXCHANGE --- Banking & Finance News: State Street Intensifies Its Shift Into Data

State Street Corp. is paying $2.6 billion in cash to prove it is serious about its transformation from sleepy custodian to tech-savvy data manager.

The Boston bank said Friday it agreed to buy financial-data firm Charles River Systems Inc. The decision is its boldest move yet to step out of its financial-services clients' back offices and onto their trading floors, where State Street can offer data, analytics and trading tools to investment staff.

"Our overall strategy even before we started talking to Charles River has been about data, and about this idea that information delivered in an appropriate way and in a usable way is the most powerful tool we can provide to market," State Street President Ron O'Hanley said on a conference call with analysts.

Some investors said they were concerned State Street is paying too much and were skeptical the company would be able to meet all of the revenue targets laid out in the deal.

State Street's shares fell 7.4% Friday, their biggest one-day drop in more than two years. The stock closed at $85.87, down $6.87.

To help pay for the acquisition, State Street canceled plans to buy back about $950 million in company stock this year. The acquisition's price of $2.6 billion is nearly nine times Charles River's revenue in 2017.

State Street also reported quarterly results that fell short of some analysts' expectations.

"There's definitely some strategic sense to it," Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI, said of the Charles River deal. "Execution-wise, it will take time and will be hard to do."

Charles River, a closely held firm based in Burlington, Mass., runs a software platform used by more than 300 investment firms, wealth managers and other financial-services companies -- many of which overlap with State Street's client list. It has 745 employees and tallied revenue of more than $300 million last year.

Mr. O'Hanley said Charles River's founder and chief executive, Peter Lambertus, owns nearly all of his company's equity. He will serve in a consulting role as State Street completes the acquisition.

The bank will appoint a new CEO to run Charles River, which will be a stand-alone division within State Street. The bank expects the deal will begin to add to its earnings in 2020.

The deal comes as State Street and other custody banks look to pull out of a yearslong rut of low revenue growth as financial-services firms push to lower the fees they pay for custody and accounting. The industry's biggest players, including State Street and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., have slashed expenses in a bid to lift earnings.

But investors want them to boost revenue, too. Those firms are betting technology, and the sweeping digitization of financial markets, will emerge as a panacea of sorts -- allowing them to automate functions and lower costs, but also giving them the tools to harness the reams of data they collect from clients as custodian to trillions of dollars in assets.

State Street, which performs core administrative and accounting tasks for 86 of the world's largest 100 money managers, has been steadily adding to its own data and analytics offerings. The bank estimates there is an $8 billion market for those tools. Bloomberg LP and BlackRock Inc.'s Aladdin unit are among Charles River's biggest rivals.

The Charles River agreement is also the latest bid by Mr. O'Hanley to lean on acquisitions to speed up State Street's transformation. As head of the firm's asset-management business, he had championed State Street's 2016 purchase of General Electric Co.'s investments division.

Mr. O'Hanley did a series of deals as president of BNY Mellon's asset-management arm, and joined State Street in 2015 after a four-year stint at Fidelity Investments. He is slated to succeed Joseph Hooley as the bank's chief executive at the end of the year.

State Street announced the Charles River agreement minutes before it reported second-quarter net income of $698 million, or $1.88 a share. The profit figure marked a 20% increase from a year earlier, when the firm earned $584 million, or $1.53 a share.

Total revenue rose 7.7% to $3.03 billion.

Cooper's Take: Looking to Technology to Get an Edge in Deal Making; More private-equity firms are using artificial intelligence  technology to gain an edge in sourcing deals.

Venture-capital firms dominate the investment flow for artificial intelligence companies. But that doesn't mean that growth-equity and private-equity firms aren't getting in on the act as well, albeit for different reasons.

An increasing number of private-equity investors are leveraging AI and other technology products as a way to help them make the best deals.

It is no secret growth-equity and private-equity firms often compete for the same deals and court many of the same companies. Hoping to rely less on associates cold calling companies early on to establish relationships, private-equity shops have looked to software to expedite the process and find the best matches.

San Francisco-based Enter Capital has created its own proprietary in-house software platform the firm uses to track potential deals that fit its investment thesis. The software, known as Ivy, helps the firm manage its deal flow and generate leads for potential target companies.

Enter Capital began to work on the product designed to cut cold calling out of the equation for private investors 12 to 14 months ago and rolled the product out six months ago, said William Duran, a director at the firm.

"It does the same thing a person would do going through LinkedIn and looking for companies," he said, adding the software also grabs data from social media profiles as well as from business information platform Crunchbase. The data, he said, enables the software to narrow down a list of companies that best fit the firm's investment profile, rather than through the laborious work of reaching out directly by phone in hopes of a match.

The firm also provides the deal sourcing software as a service to 11 other firms that invest in sectors it doesn't back. According to Mr. Duran, firms that use its software platform learned about the product through word-of-mouth.

Technology-focused Insight Venture Partners is another firm that has leveraged artificial intelligence to help source deals. The firm is using a proprietary software platform that is currently in beta mode to help it source deals, said Deven Parekh, a managing director at Insight.

"We are investing in cutting-edge technology as a firm, we're making sure to apply that to our own businesses," he said. Continuing investment in this type of sourcing technology is an area Insight is plans to pursue in the future.

Although private-equity firms may not be snapping up that many early-stage artificial intelligence companies just yet, it is clear they're eager to leverage the technology to aid them in the investment process.

AI may never completely replace human beings when it comes to sourcing investments and managing deal flow, but it certainly gives firms some additional ammunition when seeking opportunities in an increasingly competitive environment.

Excluding the charge, State Street earned $2.05 a share. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence had expected a per-share profit of $2.01.

Total revenue rose 7.7% to $3.03 billion.

Cooper's Take: Looking to Technology to Get an Edge in Deal Making; More private-equity firms are using artificial intelligence  technology to gain an edge in sourcing deals.

Looking to Technology to Get an Edge in Deal Making

Venture-capital firms dominate the investment flow for artificial intelligence companies. But that doesn't mean that growth-equity and private-equity firms aren't getting in on the act as well, albeit for different reasons.

An increasing number of private-equity investors are leveraging AI and other technology products as a way to help them make the best deals.

It is no secret growth-equity and private-equity firms often compete for the same deals and court many of the same companies. Hoping to rely less on associates cold calling companies early on to establish relationships, private-equity shops have looked to software to expedite the process and find the best matches.

San Francisco-based Enter Capital has created its own proprietary in-house software platform the firm uses to track potential deals that fit its investment thesis. The software, known as Ivy, helps the firm manage its deal flow and generate leads for potential target companies.

Enter Capital began to work on the product designed to cut cold calling out of the equation for private investors 12 to 14 months ago and rolled the product out six months ago, said William Duran, a director at the firm.

"It does the same thing a person would do going through LinkedIn and looking for companies," he said, adding the software also grabs data from social media profiles as well as from business-information platform Crunchbase. The data, he said, enables the software to narrow down a list of companies that best fit the firm's investment profile, rather than through the laborious work of reaching out directly by phone in hopes of a match.

The firm also provides the deal sourcing software as a service to 11 other firms that invest in sectors it doesn't back. According to Mr. Duran, firms that use its software platform learned about the product through word-of-mouth.

Technology-focused Insight Venture Partners is another firm that has leveraged artificial intelligence to help source deals. The firm is using a proprietary software platform that is currently in beta mode to help it source deals, said Deven Parekh, a managing director at Insight.

"We are investing in cutting-edge technology as a firm, we're making sure to apply that to our own businesses," he said. Continuing investment in this type of sourcing technology is an area Insight plans to pursue in the future.

Although private-equity firms may not be snapping up that many early-stage artificial intelligence companies just yet, it is clear they're eager to leverage the technology to aid them in the investment process.

AI may never completely replace human beings when it comes to sourcing investments and managing deal flow, but it certainly gives firms some additional ammunition when seeking opportunities in an increasingly competitive environment.

U.S. News: Homeowners Are Underinsured as Hurricane Season Unfolds

By Nicole Friedman and Leslie Scism

Many U.S. homeowners are inadequately insured for natural-catastrophe damage ahead of the height of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Three major landfalling hurricanes in 2017 -- Harvey, Irma and Maria -- revealed a widespread lack of full insurance coverage for homeowners in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Those storms served as a wake-up call to some, but the underinsurance of Americans persists, according to regulators, trade groups and government data.

While most people have home insurance, many lack flood insurance, which is typically purchased from the U.S. government as a separate policy. Many homeowners also have home-insurance policy limits that are too low to cover the full cost of repairing or rebuilding their properties.

"Many people thought that they had a fully insured home or fully insured business" before last year's catastrophes, said Iraelia Pernas, executive director of Acodese, an industry group for insurers in Puerto Rico. "They discovered that there were some exclusions in their policies."

Javier Rivera Rios, the territory's insurance commissioner, said a lot of the houses in Puerto Rico that suffered losses weren't insured at all, let alone with flood coverage.

Jeremy Gundling of Friendswood, Texas, didn't have flood insurance when his home filled with two feet of water during Harvey. His home insurance covered some wind damage to the house, but Mr. Gundling took out a loan to pay for most repairs.

When he decided to forgo flood insurance, he felt it was the right call based on recommendations from his real-estate and insurance agents.

"It was disheartening . . . to find out that I was severely underinsured," Mr. Gundling said.

After the storm, he bought insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program and expanded his home-insurance coverage. The federal policies pay up to $250,000 for damage to a residence and $100,000 for contents.

The number of federal flood policies covering Florida homes and small businesses rose 2% between September 2017 and May 2018, to 1.76 million, according to government data. In Puerto Rico, the number of federal flood policies surged 77% over the period, to 9,199. In Texas, 17% more households and small businesses owned the policies, bringing the total to 702,800.

"We often see post-disaster increases in flood insurance policies in force, but unfortunately, it is not unusual to see some of these policies dropped when they come up for renewal," said David Maurstad, chief executive of the NFIP.

The Houston area was devastated by flooding after Harvey, and about 70% of the flood-related damage wasn't covered by insurance, according to analytics firm CoreLogic.

Insurers received 717,000 Harvey claims for damage to homes and vehicles as of Oct. 31, the most recent data available, according to the Texas Department of Insurance. About one-third were closed with no payment, indicating the damage wasn't covered under the policy or the loss value was less than the deductible.

Insurers in Florida received nearly one million Irma claims as of June 12, and 91% had been closed, according to the state's Office of Insurance Regulation. More than one-third of those closed didn't entail payment.

Lisa Wansley, a realtor in Middleburg, Fla., said a home insurer offered $800 to cover damage to her roof after taking into account her several-thousand-dollar deductible. "It costs more than that for a roof," she said. "This has just been a very frustrating battle."

Homeowners often fail to increase policy limits if they expand or upgrade their homes, regulators said. They also can find that their policy limits are insufficient after a disaster pushes up the cost of building materials and contractors.

The Property Report
Three Commercial Sectors Surge

Student housing, manufactured homes and industrial property were the top performing commercial real-estate sectors in the past 12 months, according to new data from Green Street Advisors.

These three sectors outperformed the broader commercial property market, where values remained flat between June 2017 and the end of the first half of this year. Meanwhile, values fell 10% in the hard-hit retail sector during the 12-month period, according to Newport Beach, Calif.-based Green Street, which tracks the market with its Commercial Property Price Index.

The index monitors office buildings, malls, warehouses and other commercial property owned by real-estate investment trusts. REITs tend to own larger and higher-quality properties than many private landlords.

The latest data provides a window into the large rise in real-estate values since the recession, as well as investor sentiment about different types of property as the current business cycle moves into its ninth year of growth.

The Commercial Property Price Index was at 100 in August 2007, its pre-2008 crash high. It descended to a low of 61.2 inMay 2009.

Since then, the index more than doubled as the improving economy pushed rents and occupancies higher and demand strengthened from yield-hungry investors who could borrow money easily because of low interest rates.

But broad market values plateaued at the end of 2016 and have hovered at that level since then. In June, the broad index remained unchanged from the month before at 126.9.

The plateau is partly because of rising interest rates, said Peter Rothemund, a senior analyst at Green Street. Rising interest rates make it more expensive to finance purchases and make the bond market relatively more attractive compared with property.

Investors' demand for commercial real estate has also begun to slow as their concern rises that the economic expansion might be running out of steam. In the first five months of 2018, investors bought $176 billion of U.S. commercial real estate, down 2% from a year earlier, according Real Capital Analytics.

But there are exceptions to these broad market trends. Investor appetite has remained strong for industrial property, which has experienced a 12% increase in values since June 2017, according to Green Street. Rents and occupancy rates have been particularly strong in this sector -- which includes warehouses and distribution centers -- thanks to growth in e-commerce.

Big industrial deals this year include Prologis Inc.'s agreement to buy logistics-property owner DCT Industrial Trust Inc. for $8.4 billion including debt. Also, private-equity giant Blackstone Group LP is buying industrial and office REIT Gramercy Property Trust for $7.6 billion, including debt. Blackstone's offer represents a 15% premium over Gramercy's closing stock price before the deal was announced.

"The general thesis around future property-value increases [is] that industrial rents are growing at an especially fast pace above inflation throughout most of the U.S. -- even with a healthy amount of new construction," said Eric Frankel, a senior Green Street analyst. "Investors generally assume this will continue as e-commerce sales grow."

Student housing also performed well over the past 12 months, chalking up a 10% increase in values, Green Street said. These properties are considered to be more recession-resistant than other asset classes because even in an economic downturn, college enrollments are expected to remain steady.

Manufactured-home parks also remained a popular niche sector among investors. They require low capital costs and tend to be supply-constrained because community groups and local governments in recent years have slowed permitting processes.

According to Green Street, manufactured-home values rose 10% in the past 12 months. The firm's index tracking only that sector hit 178.3 at the end of June, compared with 158.5 in June 2017.

"You wind up increasing rents 3% a year regardless of what the economy is doing," Mr. Rothemund said.

Shopping Centers

Under Pressure

Conditions aren't as sunny in other sectors. Values of malls and other shopping centers have stayed under pressureas consumers shop more online.

Mall values in June have fallen 9% over the past 12 months and 18% since the end of 2016, according to Green Street Advisors.

Merger-and-acquisition activity and portfolio deals, rather than single-property transactions, have driven most of the value changes for malls, said DJ Busch, Green Street's lead retail analyst.

In one of the biggest retail deals this year, Brookfield Property Partners LP said it would buy the remaining stake in mall owner GGP Inc. it didn't already own. The price Brookfield is paying is lower than some analysts expected, a sign of pressure on even top-quality mall portfolios.

Some owners are sitting on the sidelines, choosing to refinance their properties instead of trying to sell, said Jim Costello, a vice president at Real Capital Analytics.

Banking & Finance: Netflix Shorts Get Rare Reprieve as Stock Dives

Investors who bet against Netflix this year erased some of their steep losses on Tuesday.

The streaming-video service's stock price fell as much as 14% in morning trading before rebounding to close 5.2% lower at $379.48.

The move came after Netflix's second-quarter results late Monday showed the company missed its own forecasts for subscriber growth. The company blamed issues with its internal forecasting, a problem it has faced in the past.

Short sellers, who seek to profit from a stock's fall, had paper profits of $366 million on Tuesday, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics company.

Those betting against the stock have been reducing the number of shares shorted as the stock has skyrocketed.

But the rising share price means shorts still had nearly $7 billion of value at risk on Monday, placing Netflix's stock among the most shorted U.S. stocks.

Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund run by David Einhorn, is among the investors shorting the stock, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing an early 2018 investor presentation.

Short sellers typically borrow stock from a lender and sell it, hoping it has fallen by the time they buy it back to return it.

If it has dropped, the short seller captures the price difference after fees.

If the stock is up, as is the case with Netflix recently, losses can be unlimited.

Netflix shares have been flying higher this year as the company invests heavily in original content.

Even with Tuesday's fall, the company's shares have nearly doubled since the end of last year.

Short sellers are nursing paper losses of $3.9 billion for the year, S3 data show.

Netflix's rapid rise over the past two years has captivated Wall Street as well as brought out the short sellers who think the company's shares have run up too far.

"This expensive stock may take some time to find bullish footing again, but we continue to believe in the long-term value proposition for consumers and investors," Canaccord Genuity technology analyst Michael Graham said in a research note.

Connecting the dots at Ping An

Fintech arm OneConnect is rolling out blockchain technology for Asia s banks

Ping An is rapidly developing a global reputation as a financial technology pioneer. As if to reinforce this, the Chinese insurance and banking grouphas launched an entire business dedicated to what it calls  fintech inclusion , or spreading blockchain and cloud-based technologies throughout China s banking system.

The fintech arm, called OneConnect, has forfour years been selling its own homegrown technology to upgrade banks and other financial institutions with the latest in lending, fraud detection and credit assessment systems using big data and artificial intelligence.

Most recently, the company has been enlisted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to build one of the largest blockchain-based trade financing platforms in the world, which is due to go live next month.

OneConnect s roots reach deep into the back-end of Shenzhen-based Ping An, one of the world s largest financial groups with about Rmb6.5tn ($971bn) in assets at the end of last year and 166m retail customers.

After building an in-house tech team to service its own needs several years ago, Ping An spun out that core technology support division into a separate company that has now sold systems to more than 470 banks and 1,970 non-bank financial institutions. In the first three months of 2018 alone, it processed 180m credit inquiries for financial institutions in China. The company is now aiming for an IPO this year.

FT Video: Ping An bets on tech

The tech on offer includes everything from mobile banking applications to credit scoring for loans and financial products as well as platforms for interbank transactions around the banks  core systems using blockchain technology. Theseare systems that could take years and major investments for small banks to complete; OneConnect says it can have them running with a fraction of the time and money it would take a small bank to build by itself.

Until recently most of OneConnect s business has been in China. Building the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform, a blockchain-based system designed to streamline the flow of trade finance, is the company s first major project outside of mainland China.

"It's going to allow a vast amount of information to be shared between multiple parties with trust," said Jessica Tan, Ping An s deputy chief executive.

OneConnect was chosen to build the system because most of the technology needed is already commercially available in China.

By using blockchain to record each trade finance transaction, the system can detect common fraud. Companies often request more financing from banks than needed to fund trades. Once trades are logged in the blockchain, all parties will be able to view the level of financing requested and reduce the ability to acquire excess funds. In the same way it can cut back on over invoicing as well.

Small companies around the world struggle to get access to services such as trade finance because the cost for banks of doing due diligence does not justify the low revenues small businesses generate. OneConnect s technologies can extract a wide range of company data at a low cost to evaluate potential customers. This, the company says, will allow the trade finance platform   which will sign up 21 banks initially including HSBC and Standard Chartered  to take on more small businesses.

There may be some sceptics who argue that OneConnect would be better off focusing on more promising technology than the blockchain, given it remains relatively unproven and in light of China's ambiguous attitude towards some parts of the crypto-asset universe.

But what the company is doing for China s banking sector has been likened to what Amazon Web Services did for tech start-ups over the past decade. A handful of companies around the world, such as Germany s Fidor Bank and China's Ant Financial, have sought to market their own tech to other banks. But the sheer volume of the blockchain technology the company has rolled out over the past few years makes OneConnect the largest of its kind.

Further fintech fascination

Klarna thisVery few companies end up inspiring their own verb like Google. But there are small signs, at least in the UK, that it is happening to Klarna, the Swedish financial technology start-up.  Klarna it,  a young womanurges her friend on Twitter who is hesitating about a purchase with online retailer Asos. Asos offers Klarna s  pay later  function, which gives shoppers 30 days to settle their purchases and allows them to return items without ever having paid for them. Valued at $2.5bn last year and led by co-founderSebastian Siemiatkowski (pictured)Klarna has become one of Europe s biggest start-ups, second only to the recently listed Adyen in the fintech world. The Swedish group started by taking a traditional idea   the invoice   and adapting it to the online world. A year ago, it became the biggest fintech group in Europe to get a banking licence.

Free money endsChina s two mobile payments giants, Alipay andTencent, are poised to lose around $1bn in combined annual revenue to a new central bank requirement that third-party payment groups hold all customer funds in reserve.Previously, third-party payment groups were permitted to invest customer funds, much as banks use deposits to make loans and other investments, even though unlike banks,the payment groups pay no interest to users.That era of free money is now drawing to a close.

Le BrexitThe French central bank has turned up the pressure on hundreds of British payment providers and digital finance companies that have customers in France by asking them for details of their Brexit contingency plans. The move is being seen by British payments companies as the latest salvo by Paris in its campaign to challenge London as the European capital of the fast-growing financial technology sector.

Bits and bobs

Proof of workFujitsu has also filed almost 50 patents related to the technology in the hope that some day, these copyrighted blockchain-based inventions will generate cash. But much like most of the blockchain space outside of the magical world of ICOs, Fujitsu's long blockchain position is unlikely to have yielded any real returns so far. So now, the Japanese group is taking on a bolder approach to making some money out of the nebulous technology. For as little as 9,900 euros, the company is promising to develop a  blockchain proof of business  for any customers in Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, within just one working week,writes Alphaville.

Taking stockGlobal banking regulators are assessing the size of banks  exposure to  crypto-assets  such as bitcoin and looking at introducing capital safeguards, in a move that could deter banks from embracing the nascent market. A report revealed that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is  conducting an initial stock take on the materiality of banks  direct and indirect exposures to crypto-assets .

Compliance-Focused Firms Draw Investor Dollars; Private-equity and venture funds buy into firms that offer improved ways to sift through money-laundering and due-diligence data

Corrections & Amplifications

ThetaRay recently held a $30 million Series B venture round, and its chief executive is Mark Gazit. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said ThetaRay recently held a Series A venture round and misspelled the CEO's name. (July 17, 2018)

Recent investments in companies that deal with financial crime and compliance have put these firms on the radar of venture capitalists and private-equity funds, especially as they offer savvier ways to streamline compliance for banks and financial institutions.

Following years of big fines for money laundering and other compliance failures, banks bulked up on compliance staff, hiring thousands of employees, in some cases, to sift through transactions and monitor for suspicious activity. That manpower has become a cost burden for banks, observers say, especially as fines decline and a cultural understanding of compliance improves. Banks are looking to explore technological alternatives and analytical research that can augment the surge in human activity.

"We need better ways to process the data to find the signal in the noise," said Enrique Salem, a managing director at investment firm Bain Capital's venture arm. Mr. Salem was previously chief executive of Symantec Corp., a cybersecurity firm.

Compliance-focused firms that recently secured capital include consultancy Exiger LLC; Israeli startup ThetaRay; and Sigma Ratings, which evaluates company risks not related to credit. Exiger reeled in $80 million from Carrick Capital Partners, ThetaRay held a $30 million Series B venture round, and Sigma Ratings pulled $2.4 million in seed funding. Navex Global, a compliance software provider, said Tuesday it was acquired by private-equity firm BC Partners for an undisclosed sum; existing investors Vista Equity Partners will retain a minority stake in the company.

Their offerings range from consulting services to artificial intelligence software that helps banks with customer due diligence and transaction monitoring.

"Financial institutions are trying to approach compliance in a smarter way to eliminate manual, repetitive processes," said Sven Stumbauer, a managing director of AlixPartners, a consultancy that helps banks with compliance.

The market for anti-money-laundering software is expected to reach $4.1 billion by 2026, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 12.5%, according to a Credence Research report released last month. Transaction-monitoring software is the top-selling product, which the market research firm expects to continue.

"With advancements in technologies, the related regulatory framework is evolving continuously," the report said. "In order to accommodate these changes, developers are continually updating their anti-money laundering software to comply with enacted regulations."

Financial crime compliance, however, "doesn't fall neatly into one bucket" of investment, said Brandon Lee, an associate managing director in K2 Intelligence's regulatory compliance practice.

Investment areas in compliance can include financial technology, regulation technology, artificial intelligence and others, he said, adding that the firms offering transaction monitoring have seen particularly high interest from investors and financial institutions.

"Current transaction monitoring systems are ineffective at locating money laundering activity," Mr. Lee said. "Artificial intelligence and machine learning is trying to augment today's capabilities, to not only detect traditional money laundering behavior but also [to] self-reinforce and self-teach and self-learn new ways of money laundering."

Exiger, a consultancy co-founded by Mike Cherkasky, a former chairman of New York's Commission on Public Integrity, seeks to use its $80 million investment to make acquisitions and expand its technology offerings to banks. The firm got its start when Mr. Cherkasky served as the compliance monitor for HSBC Holdings PLC when HSBC settled accusations of insufficient money-laundering controls by U.S. authorities in 2012.

The firm has grown since then, with 470 employees managing 250 clients now, Mr. Cherkasky said in an interview. It quickly diversified away from monitorships, he said, moving toward embedding itself in financial institutions to work directly on bank compliance. Exiger's technology goes beyond curation and screening of databases, he said. "This is teaching computers to think and act like a human compliance researcher," he said.

ThetaRay's fundraising round included Jerusalem Venture Partners, General Electric Co. and Bank Hapoalim, and the firm said it would use the capital to expand its presence in Europe, Asia and the U.S. to help its largest customers, and to get into new areas, such as payment or credit-card fraud.

The company's machine learning and artificial intelligence technology is intended to help financial institutions identify the earliest signs of money laundering. Chief Executive Mark Gazit said in an interview that the technology can teach itself once given the proper initial instructions.

"Our system is like a human child's brain," he said.

Sigma Ratings offers a different kind of compliance product: It rates the financial crime risks of smaller institutions in emerging markets. Stuart Jones, the firm's chief executive, told The Wall Street Journal last year that Sigma's product was created as a response to changes in correspondent banking, with global financial institutions shying away from many markets due to risk.

Sigma, which seeks to compete with the likes of Standard & Poor's and Moody's, announced its first rating last year, of a Maltese bank, and it expects to have 500 rating decisions completed by the end of the month.

"Risk is evolving, and credit risk only gives you part of the picture," said Mr. Jones. "Risk associated with counterparty illicit finance and conduct risk is equally if not more important for companies operating in complex markets."

U.S. News: Chinese Rise as Investors in U.S. Startups --- Venture capital flows to hot tech sectors amid security reviews of higher-profile deals

Tighter national security reviews have curbed Chinese deal-making in the U.S., but a new study shows China is pouring money into cutting-edge American technologies at a record pace this year through loosely regulated venture-capital investments.

Chinese foreign-direct investment into the U.S., made through deals such as acquisitions, fell into negative territory during the first five months of the year, according to data that takes asset sales into account from the Rhodium Group, a New York consulting firm.

Yet the figures belie China's sustained interest in U.S. technology, which it is continuing to target through relatively unrestricted investments in startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, Rhodium said in a new report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The report's findings could give fresh momentum to national security hawks who have singled out Chinese investment as posing disproportionate risks to the U.S. because the entities may be directed and subsidized by the government of China, an economic and military rival.

Over the period from January to May 2018, Chinese venture capital investment in the U.S. had already reached nearly $2.4 billion, which was its previous full-year record set in 2015, according to Rhodium's analysis.

From 2000 through May 2018, Rhodium found more than 1,300 funding rounds of U.S. startups with at least one Chinese-controlled investor, representing an estimated $11 billion in Chinese investment. Around three-quarters of those transactions have occurred since 2014, says the report by Thilo Hanemann, Adam Lysenko and Daniel Rosen.

The estimates reflect some larger deals recently, as the total number of deals involving Chinese investors is down slightly from 2016 and 2017.

Venture capital is defined by investments targeting startups with big potential that require large amounts of money in early days. It typically involves groups of investors that each take small stakes and gradually put in more money as the company grows.

Chinese investors targeting startups have historically focused their investments in the information and communications technology sectors as well as the health, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology sectors, Rhodium found.

They are also targeting technologies such as 3-D printing, robotics and artificial intelligence, and recently have plowed money into companies such as Grail, a Silicon Valley cancer detection startup, the report said.

The new data on venture investing, which is notoriously hard to track given complex legal structures and limited disclosure requirements, comes amid an array of potential actions by the U.S. government to further regulate foreign tech investing.

The White House in June was close to imposing a set of tough new restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S., including through venture-capital funds, but backed away at the last minute, saying it would instead throw its weight behind proposed congressional legislation with similar objectives.

Lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on that legislation to curb a range of Chinese investment by strengthening the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.

The interagency committee, known as CFIUS, advises the president on when to block foreign deals on national security grounds.

While CFIUS has traditionally focused on foreign takeovers, the new legislation would strengthen the committee's authority to review minority investments from foreign entities, including venture-capital funds, in "critical technology."

U.S. venture-capital investors worry that could lead to slower deals, or could spur startups to avoid some foreign investors.
