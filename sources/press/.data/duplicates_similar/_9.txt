Can Computers Outperform Deal-Makers?

BlackRock Inc. is showing some stock pickers the door.

The world's largest asset manager concluded it had to do more to keep up with highly competitive algorithmic and other computerized trading, which has revolutionized the financial industry. In place of human asset managers who have created its trading strategies, BlackRock is putting computer models to work.

Many investing professionals of all stripes have struggled with similar concerns weighing on BlackRock. In today's hyperdriven financial industry, everyone is looking for an edge, and inevitably that draws them ever closer to data, analytics and, perhaps most dramatically, automation.

So why shouldn't venture capitalists follow suit?

Some already are trying it out. At Correlation Ventures, the managers say they have delegated the heavy lifting to computer models.

The co-investing firm, which closed its first fund in 2012, aims to achieve solid returns and mitigate risk by making dozens of investments each year across all sectors and investment stages. Its data-heavy approach relies almost entirely on proprietary analytics and predictive modeling to glean positive or negative investment signals, says Managing Director David Coats.

Mr. Coats says it's still a little early for his firm, which closed on $200 million for its second fund, to say how well the approach works. But he is confident its "empirical, objective" method enables Correlation to make quick decisions about writing checks, and lots of them, which are confined to co-investing. The first fund, with 121 portfolio companies, has had at least five exits.

Automation by definition takes the human out of the process. So is Sand Hill Road about to look like a ghost town? Even Mr. Coats hopes not. He says that for lead investors, "internal" human judgment is irreplaceable. But predictive modeling matters.

"If our thesis holds," says Mr. Coats, "our portfolio will be tilted to the more favorable outcomes."

Financial planners are fighting back against the rise of  robo advisers  by arming themselves with the weaponry of their automated foes.

Robo advisers   digital platforms that use artificial intelligence to provide low-cost online investment services   are tipped to take business from traditional wealth managers. But human advisers are using the same technologies that underpin such platforms to provide clients with more tailored advice and communication, which wealthy investors are willing to pay for.

Tools that help manage interactions with clients   known as customer relationship management (CRM) systems   will soon be able to analyse data such as a client s social media activity to work out their investment goals, says Gauthier Vincent, head of Deloitte s US wealth management consulting business.

 Advisers are thinking,  There s a lot of info out there I would love to have to create rich profiles of prospects so I can increase the odds of success when I [contact] them,   he says.

Technology is also helping advisers streamline estate planning and compliance, as well as shaping how, when and what they communicate with their clients. For instance, advisers plan to use technology to send tailored messages with portfolio details and projections to calm clients during periods of market volatility.

 For an adviser to call 100 clients, that will take a week or two,  Mr Vincent says, but these emerging tools allow advisers to  work with clients [in a way] that was previously unheard of. 

Some wealth companies have high expectations for what they can achieve with the new technology and are setting aggressive goals. Tej Vakta, head of wealth management services at Capgemini, a consultant and technology provider, says one bank he works with wants to increase the ratio of clients to each of its advisers from 55 to around 350. The bank is trying to achieve this by targeting clients with around $250,000 in assets whom it believes will become millionaires within 10 years.

 Banks want to go after these [clients] but have a limited workforce [and are asking] what are the different things they can do with machine learning, with automation, with large virtual advice,  Mr Vakta says.

Many advisers fear they will be left behind as more complex tools develop and clients demand tech-savvy service. Ensuring that technology tools are efficient is one of the top three challenges cited this year by FT 400 survey respondents. Those who are able to blend technology with a human touch stand to benefit: a 2015 survey by Fidelity, the asset manager, found that advisers who made greater use of technology had significantly more assets than competitors.

But how these tools are used by advisers will be critical to improving the client experience, says Ben Marks, chief investment officer at Marks Group Wealth Management, and an FT 400 adviser.

The 12 people in his practice   which oversees $800m in assets   note all client interactions in its CRM system, which can be used for data analysis. Staff also discuss clients in team meetings so everyone is up to speed and can deal with inquiries from clients directly.  From a client experience, that helps,  Mr Marks says.  It makes them feel special. 

The company recently began using financial planning technology, but the system alone is not enough to meet clients  needs. Mr Marks had to hire a specialist to input and analyse the relevant data.  There still has to be a human being involved, so I wouldn t say it necessarily saves us time, but it certainly adds an incredible amount of value,  he says.

Mr Marks  company is using a combination of technology with a human touch to communicate with clients, too.  You can use technology to help distribute information and formulate your recommendations, but I don t think you re going to replicate that human element,  he says.  People want and pay for advice no matter what generation they re from. 

National brokerages that offer a range of investment services, colloquially known as wirehouses, are also increasing their use of technology to gain better access to new and existing clients. This month Merrill Lynch, a wirehouse with around 16,000 advisers, updated its web portal to give clients easier access to services. Over the past few years the company has developed technology that monitors clients  investments and liabilities.

 The technology has allowed data analysis to come to be extremely extensive and comprehensive, not only internally, but as we present it to each client,  says Kent Pearce, a Merrill Lynch adviser.

Automation and big data mining are helping planners compete, says Richard Henderson

Short Sellers Pounce on Sears Landlord; Short interest on Seritage Growth Properties hit $368.5 million Wednesday

Short sellers are betting against Seritage Growth Properties, the real-estate investment trust spun off by Sears Holdings Corp. in 2015 that holds the struggling retailer's property assets.

The so-called short interest, a measure of negative bets, on Seritage hit an all-time high of $368.5 million on Wednesday, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

In 2016 and 2015, average daily short interest totaled $203.1 million and $80.7 million, respectively.

"One might look at Seritage Growth Properties as an alternative short play to indirectly gain exposure to Sears' demise," said Matthew Unterman, a director at S3 Partners.

In a short sale, an investor borrows shares of a company and sells them, in hopes of buying the shares later, at a lower price, to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Short interest tracks the number of shares that have been sold short but not repaid.

About 8.65 million Seritage shares have been sold short, or roughly 35% of the company's publicly traded shares.

Seritage declined to comment.

In a securities filing last week, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-stock-stumbles-after-going-concern-warning-1490191329" after seven years of losses. Sears' Chief Financial Officer Jason Hollar later sought to assuage investors by writing in a blog post that the retailer is "a viable business that can meet its financial and other obligations for the foreseeable future."

In early January, the retailer said it was shutting 150 stores across the country and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sears-sells-craftsman-brand-to-stanley-black-decker-1483623215".

Some investors expect shopping-center landlords, including Seritage, to struggle with a faster-than-expected pace of store closures.

In 2015, Sears Holdings"https://www.wsj.com/articles/seritage-raises-1-6-billion-to-begin-trading-after-spinoff-from-sears-1436185521" for $2.72 billion. Of these, 220 properties are leased to Sears Holdings and house Sears or Kmart stores.

Seritage has been diversifying its revenue stream in recent quarters. The New York-based REIT said it reduced its exposure to rental income from Sears Holdings to 64% at the end of 2016 from 80% when the REIT was formed.

Martin's Take: RBC Pitches Silicon Valley on Canada; A cradle of machine learning  ingenuity wants its talent back

Canada wants its machine learning talent back.

The Royal Bank of Canada sent its electronic trading chiefs to Silicon Valley on Wednesday to tout the bank's laser focus on machine learning. It was a pitch about all of the big problems in machine learning that RBC wants to solve. That's important because everyone knows techies need a big mission, especially if there's no FB stock involved.

"The compliance budget is massive, and these are not optional spends," said Stephen Bain, managing director of institutional equity trading at RBC, speaking of the need for regulatory-focused tech projects.

RBC's trading business needs leaps in machine learning to improve trading recommendations, sleuth out indicators of interest, anomaly detection, trading surveillance and risk aggregation reporting. Needless to say, it must also stay one step ahead of high-frequency traders seeking to exploit split-second information, asymmetry discovery and algorithmic advantages.

RBC's Shary Mudassir, director of global algorithmic trading, explained the bank had about a dozen algo spots unfilled but was seeking certain "unicorn" employees. These people had to deeply understand trading, algorithms and have people skills.

"There's an opportunity for machine learning to tell when and where you deploy certain tactics," said Mr. Bain, citing an ongoing war between HFT trading shops outside and big banks, popularized in Michael Lewis's book "Flash Boys."

Canada's University of Waterloo, of course, is a hotbed of machine learning experts, now part of an exodus of talent heading to the Valley to start companies.

As a lure back, Mr. Bain pointed out that people who made $150,000 to $200,000 earned just a basic livable wage in Silicon Valley and that property prices are far higher there than in Canada, where quality of life is better.

Polite as the Canadians were, they didn't mention an easy sell on leaving the Valley for Canada: the Trump factor.

And it doesn't take an algorithm to figure that out.

Lim's Take: North Carolina Pension Brandishes Ax on Funds in Cost-Cutting Push; Pension explores sales of stakes in funds it has cooled on

Live Video Event: The Artificial Intelligence-Biotech Convergence

Artificial intelligence startups are bringing their advances to biotechnology, betting that intelligent machines will revolutionize disease detection and drug discovery. Join WSJ Pro Venture Capital today at 2 p.m. Eastern for an interview with Gini Deshpande, founder and chief executive of biotechnology company NuMedii, and Bradford Cross, a partner at venture-capital firm Data Collective, on the potential of AI in biotech. Viewers' questions will be answered.

North Carolina Pension Brandishes Ax on Funds in Cost-Cutting Push

The North Carolina Retirement Systems wants to cut ties with several money managers and write bigger checks to fewer funds, in a push to slash its investment fees.

The $92 billion state pension fund is working with investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. to explore a sale of some stakes in real-estate and private-equity funds it has cooled on, according to a pension presentation. It is looking at ways to exit or restructure its fund-of-funds investments, a section of the market that faces mounting pressure to justify the extra layer of fees charged to pensions and endowments.

North Carolina's cost-saving drive on the heels of a campaign promise by North Carolina's new state treasurer, Dale Folwell, to reduce fees illustrates pressure among public funds to deploy money more cheaply as returns are squeezed by low interest rates. The pension is aiming to reap $100 million in cost savings from its investment program in the next four years.

As part of the effort, North Carolina plans to write larger checks to fewer funds across asset classes. It wants to invest in real estate, natural resources and other private markets through more separate accounts structured with special fees and terms, instead of parking its money in traditional funds.

The pension fund paid higher fees to money managers in real estate and private equity compared with what it paid to those that handled its money in other asset classes for the year ended June 30.

North Carolina paid outside real-estate managers an aggregate $196.1 million in fees and carried interest to oversee $8.35 billion in holdings. Private equity was the second-most-expensive asset class after real estate when external manager fees were calculated against portfolio holdings: North Carolina paid private-equity managers $92.9 million in fees and carry to oversee $4.38 billion in investments.

With pensions gaining more visibility into the fees and expenses they bear, they will be forced to weigh the trade-offs of investment shifts more closely.

North Carolina plans to push more money to indexed funds after a lukewarm showing by several active stock managers, according to the pension presentation. Direct lending funds as well as cheaper high-yield bond managers are slated to win more of the pension's money after a "disappointing performance" by some of its credit hedge funds.

As the state's cost-cutting drive continues, new winners and losers will surely emerge down the road.

The Property Report
Amazon a Force in U.K. Warehouses

By Art Patnaude

The warehouse property market in Europe just wouldn't be the same without Amazon.com Inc.

Amazon has become a major force in a logistics real-estate sector that is being reshaped by online shopping, according to investors and property brokers. In the U.K. alone, the U.S. online retail giant accounted for nearly a quarter of all warehouse property space leased last year, according to property broker Savills.

Once a dull corner of the commercial real-estate sector, warehouses have become vital for businesses offering same-day deliveries. E-commerce requires efficient networks linking massive distribution centers to smaller properties in towns and cities, a system often likened to a wheel with spokes.

Demand for space hit a record last year in Europe's biggest markets.

In all, 230 million square feet of logistics space was leased in the region, up from 205 million square feet in 2015, according to property broker CBRE.

As Amazon and other e-commerce companies pile into warehouses, investors increasingly are rushing to buy the properties.

While overall commercial real-estate investment volumes fell in Europe last year, industrial and logistics volumes hit a record 25 billion euros ($27.2 billion), up from 23.3 billion euros in 2015, according to CBRE.

"E-commerce is forcing investors to look at logistics and warehousing completely differently," said Andrew Jones, chief executive at LondonMetric Property PLC, a U.K. real-estate investment trust.

In Europe, online retailing has taken hold most strongly in the U.K., where last year, internet purchases accounted for 15% of retail purchases, according to data firm GlobalData. Germany followed at 9%, the data show.

Amazon, which dominates online shopping around the world, accounted for 27% of all U.K. online sales last year, according to consumer-market research firm Euromonitor. In Germany, Amazon's market share was even bigger, accounting for 40% of internet shopping sales, the data show.

Amazon leased 18 units last year in the U.K., 11% of the total number of units leased, according to Savills, but the 8 million square feet accounted for more than 23% of the total space leased.

The level "is largely unprecedented," said Kevin Mofid, a Savills research analyst.

In recent months, Amazon has said it would open several fulfillment centers across the region, including in France, Germany, Slovakia and Poland.

Amazon might not be as dominant in the U.K. this year after an exceptional 2016, brokers said, but it has continued to scoop up space. LondonMetric said last week it had leased warehouse space to Amazon.

LondonMetric aims to increase its logistics property holdings to 80% from about 60%, with a particular focus on properties in urban areas, Mr. Jones said. The company last week raised GBP 95.5 million ($119.9 million) through a share placing to fund such acquisitions.

'Last Mile' Crucial

To Same-Day Service

Warehouses near cities are known as the "last mile" of a delivery network, which has become increasingly important to firms such as Amazon.com Inc. offering same-day services.

Blackstone Group LP, among the most active investors in European warehouses, has picked up on the trend. The U.S. private-equity firm last week agreed to buy, alongside U.K.-based real-estate group M7 Real Estate, a portfolio of last-mile warehouses in Germany and the Netherlands for 1.28 billion euros, according to Hansteen Holdings, the seller.

Blackstone also is selling its expansive European warehouse arm, Logicor. The private-equity firm is marketing the sale at 13 billion euros, while simultaneously working on an initial public offering. While the sale is Blackstone's preferred route, experts said, either path would result in one of the biggest real-estate transactions ever in Europe.

In one of the biggest European real-estate deals last year, GIC Pte. Ltd., Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, bought warehouse-property company P3 Logistic Parks for 2.4 billion euros.

Strong investor demand has sent yields sharply lower. The average capitalization rate, a measure of yield, on European industrial properties was 6.4% in the fourth quarter last year, steadily falling from 7.8% three years earlier, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"E-commerce has changed our markets globally," said Jack Cox, head of industrial and logistics capital markets at property broker CBRE. "And it's only just starting."

SoftBank Weighs New Rides Deal --- Company considers $6 billion investment to help China's Didi make self-driving push

SoftBank Group Corp. has approached Didi Chuxing Technology Co. of China about investing roughly $6 billion to help the ride-hailing firm expand in self-driving-car technologies, two people familiar with the matter said.

The bulk of the investment would likely come from SoftBank's planned $100 billion Vision Fund, in hopes of unlocking new value in China's expanding ride-hailing market, one of the people said. The technology fund, originally slated for a launch in January, has been delayed as SoftBank considers different demands from investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Development Co., Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp., according to another person close to the fund.

Didi became China's ride-hailing champion after it merged with rival Uber Technologies Inc.'s China operations last year. SoftBank -- like Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. -- has been hunting for stakes in car-hailing apps. The Japanese group led a $750 million fundraising push last year in Singapore-based Grab, which is locked in a price war in Southeast Asia. Grab also counts Didi as an investor. SoftBank also led a $600 million financing round in Kuaidi Dache in 2015, which later merged with Didi.

Through the Vision Fund, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son hopes to target multimillion-dollar investments in areas such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.

Since announcing the fund, SoftBank has invested in shared-office-space firm WeWork Cos. and satellite operator Intelsat SA, with plans to have the Vision Fund take stakes in the companies as well. It also plans to sell a stake in its U.K. semiconductor designer ARM Holdings PLC to the fund, people familiar with the matter have said.

Didi was valued at roughly $36 billion after the Uber China merger. As part of the deal, Uber also became the largest shareholder in Didi. Didi counts all three of China's largest technology companies -- Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu -- as shareholders.

The Property Report: Amazon Gobbles Up U.K. Warehouses --- E-commerce giant leads way as demand for logistics properties has surged in Europe

The warehouse property market in Europe just wouldn't be the same without Amazon.com Inc.

Amazon has become a major force in a logistics real-estate sector that is being reshaped by online shopping, according to investors and property brokers. In the U.K. alone, the U.S. online retail giant accounted for nearly a quarter of all warehouse property space leased last year, according to property broker Savills.

Once a dull corner of the commercial real-estate sector, warehouses have become vital for businesses offering same-day deliveries. E-commerce requires efficient networks linking massive distribution centers to smaller properties in towns and cities, a system often likened to a wheel with spokes.

Demand for space hit a record last year in Europe's biggest markets. In all, 230 million square feet of logistics space was leased in the region, up from 205 million square feet in 2015, according to property broker CBRE.

As Amazon and other e-commerce companies pile into warehouses, investors increasingly are rushing to buy the properties. While overall commercial real-estate investment volumes fell in Europe last year, industrial and logistics volumes hit a record 25 billion euros ($27.2 billion), up from 23.3 billion euros in 2015, according to CBRE.

"E-commerce is forcing investors to look at logistics and warehousing completely differently," said Andrew Jones, chief executive at LondonMetric Property PLC, a U.K. real-estate investment trust.

In Europe, online retailing has taken hold most strongly in the U.K., where last year, internet purchases accounted for 15% of retail purchases, according to data firm GlobalData. Germany followed at 9%, the data show.

Amazon, which dominates online shopping around the world, accounted for 27% of all U.K. online sales last year, according to consumer-market research firm Euromonitor. In Germany, Amazon's market share was even bigger, accounting for 40% of internet shopping sales, the data show.

Amazon leased 18 units last year in the U.K., 11% of the total number of units leased, according to Savills, but the 8 million square feet accounted for more than 23% of the total space leased.

The level "is largely unprecedented," said Kevin Mofid, a Savills research analyst.

In recent months, Amazon has said it would open several fulfillment centers across the region, including in France, Germany, Slovakia and Poland.

Amazon might not be as dominant in the U.K. this year after an exceptional 2016, brokers said, but it has continued to scoop up space. LondonMetric said last week that it had leased warehouse space to Amazon.

LondonMetric aims to increase its logistics property holdings to 80% from about 60%, with a particular focus on properties in urban areas, Mr. Jones said. The company last week raised GBP 95.5 million ($119.9 million) through a share placing to fund such acquisitions.

Warehouses near cities are known as the "last mile" of a delivery network, which has become increasingly important to firms such as Amazon offering same-day services.

Blackstone Group LP, among the most active investors in European warehouses, has picked up on the trend. The U.S. private-equity firm last week agreed to buy, alongside U.K.-based real-estate group M7 Real Estate, a portfolio of last-mile warehouses in Germany and the Netherlands for 1.28 billion euros, according to Hansteen Holdings, the seller.

Blackstone also is selling its expansive European warehouse arm, Logicor. The private-equity firm is marketing the sale at 13 billion euros, while simultaneously working on an initial public offering. While the sale is Blackstone's preferred route, experts said, either path would result in one of the biggest real-estate transactions ever in Europe.

In one of the biggest European real-estate deals last year, GIC Pte. Ltd., Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, bought warehouse-property company P3 Logistic Parks for 2.4 billion euros.

Strong investor demand has sent yields sharply lower. The average capitalization rate, a measure of yield, on European industrial properties was 6.4% in the fourth quarter last year, falling from 7.8% three years earlier, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"E-commerce has changed our markets globally," said Jack Cox, head of industrial and logistics capital markets at property broker CBRE. "And it's only just starting."

HFT as an insight into where fintech is going

Markets are cyclical, Darwinian and subject to diminishing returns. Nothing new in that observation. But people do seem to forget it all the time.

Case in point: high-frequency trading (HFT). Circa 2009-2010, algorithmic trading techniques were considered a veritable goldmine for those who knew and understood how to deploy them against dumb human competitors.

But as with most innovations, markets evolved. Dumb competitors got wise and began to employ similar strategies to defend their wealth stores. A rush of new competitors meanwhile turned up to eat the lunches of all the first entrants. In no time at all, the lucrative profits to be had from HFT began to encounter limits (fast-as-light trading, regulation, et cetera) bringing forward a new equilibrium.

Now, tellingly, with their profits under threat, HFT companies are looking to invest in new techniques to recapture their edge. Much of this is focused on big data analytics, and of course AI and machine learning.

In a "http://streetwiseprofessor.com/?p=10451" Streetwise Professor Craig Pirrong, a market structure expert from the University of Houston, makes a valuable point about the nature of these sorts of cyclical transitions. Namely, they always happen. So don t be surprised when they do.

Remarking on Alex Osipovich s story about HFT traders "https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-frequency-traders-fall-on-hard-times-1490092200", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/virtu-financial-makes-bid-to-acquire-kcg-holdings-1489609032", Quantlabs "https://www.ft.com/content/a6ac732e-0e4b-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d" and Interactive Brokers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/options-trading-pioneer-blames-retreat-on-fast-trading-sharpshooters-1489099725", he notes, with our emphasis:

Alex s story repeats Tabb Group data documenting a roughly 85 percent drop in HFT revenues in US equity trading. The Virtu-KCG proposed tie-up and the Quantlabs-Teza consummated one are indications of consolidation that is typical of maturing industries, and a shift it the business model of these firms. The Quantlabs-Teza story is particularly interesting. It suggests that it is no longer possible (or at least remunerative) to get a competitive edge via speed alone. Instead, the focus is shifting to extracting information from the vast flow of data generated in modern markets. Speed will matter here he who analyzes faster, all else equal, will have an edge. But the margin for innovation will shift from hardware to data analytics software (presumably paired with specialized hardware optimized to use it).

What s interesting is what Pirrong goes on to say about "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/06/15/260141/all-eyes-on-broker-dealer-internalisation/", incentives to keep investing in information collection and the related "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grossman-Stiglitz_Paradox".

The short story is this. As markets get increasingly competitive they encounter physical limits, such as fast-as-light trading. At this point it sometimes becomes cost effective to invest in protectionist inefficiencies. The illegal version of this comes in the shape of cornering, manipulation or front-running. The legal version, on the other hand, can take the form of further fragmentation, dark pools or internalisation   a euphemism for doing as much business as possible in-house and out of sight of the public market (ideally without ever taking any of it onto a public market at all).

A key requisite for establishing a  dark  internalised market is access to reliable retail flow that can be easily offset with more informed flow to someone s corresponding advantage or disadvantage. If internalised flow was both balanced and perfectly symmetrical in terms of information advantage, there d be little to no incentive to provide that market matching function in the first place. Money is made by knowing exclusively what portion of flow is failing to match at any given moment and taking the temporal position. This is information the internaliser has which no-one else does.

Informed entities understandably don t like this state of affairs since it allows less informed entities to free-ride on their information collection efforts. What s more, once their trades are run through the internaliser or HFT, the overall price signals are dampened in the public market to the disadvantage of the informed traders. Eventually, this reduces their incentive to keep digging for info. Accordingly, there is some controversy over how economically constructive the practice generally is.

Nevertheless, Pirrong stresses, there s a good argument to be made that all informed trading is really rent seeking anyway: resources spent on information collection for temporal forecasting advantage are always wasteful since the information is going to come out soon anyway. Meanwhile, adverse selection can set in, threatening the wider efficiency of the market. In the classic case, retail is put off from trading at all because they know they don t know what better funded and equipped traders might know.

Quid pro quo, if HFT market-makers or internalisers scoop up some of those rents for themselves they not only potentially put off investment in what was a wasteful activity to begin with but diminish the overall adverse selection effect in the market as a whole, encouraging retail punters to properly express themselves without fear of being taken advantage of.

As Pirrong notes:

 &by reducing the ability of informed traders to extract rents from uninformed traders, internalization (and dark markets) reduce the incentives to invest excessively in information collection (an incentive Hirshleifer the Elder noted in the 1970s).

What s all this got to do with fintech, you might ask? Well, if by fintech we understand an opportunity to invest in computer intensive analytical processes which cultivate information advantages for those doing the investing (from insurance companies, credit provision agencies to retail banks and hedge funds), then it indicates we have probably come full circle.

Put differently, market dynamics which previously incentivised a transfer of wealth from informed traders to less informed traders (to the retail user s cost advantage) are no longer cost effective. Since it no longer pays to benefit from someone else s information collection efforts, the disruptor must either turn to data collection and analysis directly (becoming the new informed entity) or quit the market altogether with everyone else, allowing inefficiencies to reemerge in the public market once again.

Either way, the fintech narrative implies that for rentier returns to continue at any significant level, huge amounts of investment are now needed in mass data collection and analysis.

But if Pirrong is right, all this really cultivates is an environment which encourages more adverse selection not less. In the worst case scenario, those who know they re being disadvantaged withdraw from the market completely, sabotage the data as best they can or   one might imagine   openly revolt against the system altogether (say by finding a way to nab some of the returns for themselves HFT-style or voting in powers which promise to protect them no matter what).

Which begs the question: what really is the most cost effective way to compete with entities who have bagged all the data, all the processing power and the smartest of algorithms or to disempower them?

If it s the cultivation of non-compliant, anonymous, privacy-obsessed dark markets which will be impossible to penetrate: "http://dealbreaker.com/2017/03/bitcoin-existential-crisis/"

If on the other hand it s the cultivation of a new breed of fintechs which can use brand popularity to get an edge on data collection, then that seems to be exactly what s happening now. Problem is   as with HFT   if and when everyone starts doing it, diminishing returns will lead to another scenario "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo"

Tronc/Oaktree: Trib tribulations

Private equity is generally the winner when embroiled in a boardroom brawl. Tronc, the media company once known more sensibly as Tribune Publishing, spent most of last year fighting off bids from Gannett, a rival publisher.

Now its two largest investors are at odds with each other. Shareholders should follow the example of the third biggest - Oaktree Capital - and sell.

A lengthy bidding process in 2016 culminated in a tentative deal at $18.75 a share, only for Gannett's bankers to then withdraw support. During that saga, Tronc chairman Michael Ferro enlisted the help of biotech magnate Patrick Soon-Shiong to fend off Gannett's overtures, citing his experience in artificial intelligence.

But relations have soured. Mr Soon-Shiong is reported to be shocked by Mr Ferro's behaviour and a perceived lack of independence at Tronc. In response, he has increased his own stake in Tronc to 24 per cent.

But Mr Ferro has upped the ante. Using shareholders' money, the company has spent $56m buying Oaktree's shares in Tronc at $15 each, a 12 per cent premium. If Tronc is subsequently acquired, Oaktree is owed the difference between that buyout price and the price it obtains for the remainder of its stake. This exercise has cost Tronc nearly a third of its gross cash balance (it also has $370m of debt). The company has lifted the ownership ceiling for Mr Ferro but not for his rival. Mr Soon-Shiong has been sidelined. Tronc has removed him from its list of director nominees. Perhaps the company will offer to buy his stake now, too.

Ordinary shareholders know Tronc's managers made a mess of the bidding process and are now spending money entrenching themselves. Investors also know they are unlikely to get as good a deal as Oaktree did on its way out.

Even so, Tronc's shares are up 40 per cent since the deal died. Given the actions of the board, selling is now a sensible choice.

BoE set to raise the bar on resilience; Banks: Stress tests

Institutions to be checked against long-term challenges and consumer credit risks

The UK's largest banks face their toughest test of resilience yet after the central bank unveiled an extra assessment of their business models and separately launched a review into lenders' consumer credit standards.

The Bank of England will put the seven largest lenders - including Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland - under further examination alongside its annual stress test, which measures how banks would fare in certain conditions, at the end of this year.

The new "exploratory" test, which will be carried out every other year, will assess banks' resilience to a wider range of risks beyond those emanating from the financial cycle - such as persistently low interest rates and high costs.

The longer-term test involves banks submitting projections for seven years and will help the BoE identify how the financial system will be reshaped if, for example, there are persistent headwinds to bank profitability. The BoE will not publish details of the results on a bank-by-bank basis.

The new assessment will include weak global growth, continuing low interest rates, falling world trade, increased competitive pressure on large UK banks and misconduct costs.

One adviser said no other central bank had launched such a test before and that it was "uncharted waters for both the BoE and banks".

David Strachan, a head of regulatory strategy at Deloitte, said of this year's assessment: "I think the way that it tests business models and capital levels . . . in terms of organisation and administration and logistics then it is more challenging this time around."

Lee Thorpe, a manager at SAS UK and Ireland, an analytics company, added there would be more pressure on banks as a result of the new test. "A substantial change in approach to identify risks in the business model may require an alternative methodology, further challenging banks to deliver in tight timeframes," he said.

The BoE also said yesterday that its Prudential Regulation Authority would launch a review into banks' lending standards in relation to consumer credit following soaring growth in the sector.

The review will focus on underwriting standards and the risk models employed by banks.

Consumer credit is one of the largest risks on a bank's balance sheet. Last year, UK banks had 19bn of impairments on credit cards, compared with 12bn on mortgages.

The BoE's Financial Policy Committee said it would also oversee banks' contingency plans to mitigate risks as the process for withdrawing from the EU unfolded. It said: "Risks to financial stability will be influenced by the orderliness of the adjustment to the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union."

The BoE is including for the first time an "anchor" on levels of severity used within its annual stress test. This means it will only get more severe in areas where the BoE thinks risks have increased. The test, the results of which will be published in the fourth quarter, will examine how lenders deal with a rise in UK unemployment to 9.5 per cent - the same as last year - and a 33 per cent drop in house prices, slightly more than the previous year's scenario.

The bank is testing against a hypothetical 40 per cent decline in commercial real estate , compared with 42 per cent the previous year.

But the global economic scenario will be made more severe, with global gross domestic product contracting by 2.4 per cent and Chinese GDP by 1.2 per cent, implying that the BoE sees global economic hurdles as a greater threat.

High-profile venture-capital firms have put a total of $69.2 million behind an effort to be the first company to develop a viable business around quantum computing.

Rigetti Computing announced that it raised $64 million in Series A and B funding. Andreessen Horowitz led a $24 million Series A, and Vy Capital led a $40 million Series B, bringing the company's total funding to $69.2 million. It isn't clear when the rounds closed.

Major investors in both rounds included AME Cloud Ventures, Data Collective, FF Science, Morado Ventures, Western Technology Investment and Y Combinator through its Continuity Fund. Institutional investors in the Series A included Bloomberg Beta, Lux Capital, Streamlined Ventures, Susa Ventures and Sutter Hill Ventures.

Rigetti Computing, formally known as Rigetti & Co., was founded by Chief Executive Chad Rigetti in 2013 and has offices in Fremont and Berkeley, Calif. The company said it is building a cloud quantum computing platform for artificial intelligence and computational chemistry.

The concept of quantum computing, in which the properties of quantum mechanics are harnessed for computing power, has been around for decades. Only more recently have companies begun attempting to use quantum computing to solve complex problems.

Other venture-backed companies working in quantum computing include "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150130eb1usir3u", which has raised at least 174 million Canadian dollars from investors.

Vijay Pande, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has been appointed to Rigetti's board.

SoftBank Considers $6 Billion Investment in China Ride-Hailing Firm Didi; Money would help Didi expand in self-driving car technologies

SoftBank Group Corp. has approached China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co. about investing roughly $6 billion to help the ride-hailing firm expand in self-driving car technologies, two people familiar with the matter said.

The bulk of the investment would likely come from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-confirms-1-billion-investment-in-softbank-vision-fund-1483552846", in hopes of unlocking new value in China's expanding ride-hailing market, one of the people said. The technology fund, originally slated to launch in January, has been delayed as SoftBank weighs different demands from investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Development Co., Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp., according to another person close to the fund.

Didi became China's ride-hailing champion after it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403" last year. SoftBank like Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. has been hunting stakes in car-hailing apps. The Japanese group led a $750 million fundraising push last year in Singapore-based Grab, which is locked in a price war in Southeast Asia. Grab also counts Didi as an investor. SoftBank also led a $600 million financing round in Kuaidi Dache in 2015, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-alibaba-backed-chinese-taxi-hailing-apps-to-merge-1423883210".

Through the Vision Fund, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son hopes to target multimillion-dollar investments in areas such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. Tech giants are racing to corner key technologies as gadgets become increasingly connected, exchanging information without human input.

Since announcing the fund, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-invests-300-million-in-wework-1490051107". and satellite operator Intelsat SA, with plans to have the Vision Fund take stakes in the companies as well. It plans to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-transfer-25-stake-in-arm-to-vision-fund-1488968018" to the fund as well, people familiar with the matter have said.

Didi was valued at about $36 billion after the Uber China merger. As part of the deal, Uber also became the largest shareholder in Didi. Didi counts all three of China's largest technology companies Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu Inc. as shareholders.

A SoftBank investment could give Didi a boost when the company is facing regulatory hurdles in China. Several cities issued proposed industry regulations late last year that would restrict the types of vehicles that can be used and who can drive them, potentially crimping a large chunk of Didi's business. Meanwhile, the country's antitrust regulators opened an investigation on Didi's deal to acquire U.S.-based Uber's China unit. It isn't clear whether the investigation has concluded.

SoftBank's possible investment in Didi was "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-28/didi-said-to-be-weighing-6-billion-softbank-backed-investment".

Buyouts

Alpine Investors, San Francisco

Alpine Investors has collected more than $300 million so far for Alpine Investors VI LP, said a person familiar with the matter. The fund, which has a $500 million target and a $525 million hard cap, is expected to hold a final closing in the second quarter, the person said. If the firm gathers the amount it is seeking, the pool will be a step up in size from its predecessor, a $406 million fund raised in 2014. Alpine invests in founder-owned U.S. companies in the software and business-services sectors as well as in online enterprises such as publishers, media businesses and digital marketplaces, according to its website. The firm aims to back companies with $5 million to $15 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, though it can invest in software businesses with as little as $1 million in Ebitda.

Apollo Global Management LLC, New York

Apollo Global Management LLC has collected at least $360.4 million so far for its maiden special situations fund, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The fund, Apollo Special Situations Fund LP, is seeking $750 million for opportunities that fall outside the mandate of the firm's flagship buyout fund. Joshua Harris, co-founder and senior managing director of Apollo, said on a call with analysts last year that the fund will target investments in "longer dated private-equity, royalties, infrastructure and minority investments." The vehicle held a first closing on $250 million in May. Apollo already has begun investing the fund. In August, Apollo entered into a partnership with sportswear company Nike Inc., through which the firm and footwear maker said they would increase manufacturing capabilities in the Americas.

Blackstone Group LP, New York

Blackstone Group LP has collected $5 billion for its first longer-life fund, a person familiar with the matter told Private Equity Analyst sister publication Private Equity News. The fund has hit its target and isn't likely to raise more capital, though it hasn't held a final close, the person said. The vehicle has a 20-year lifespan compared with a typical fund life of 10 years. It also will invest in companies for more than twice the typical three-to-five-year hold period, the person said. The fund will target less than the usual 20% internal rate of return a private-equity fund aims for, Private Equity Analyst previously reported.

Edgewater Funds, Chicago

Edgewater Funds is seeking $1 billion for its latest fund, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The firm in the filings didn't record any capital commitments to Edgewater Growth Capital Partners IV LP and a parallel vehicle. The fund's predecessor was seeking $650 million and had gathered at least $363.2 million by June 2011, according to a separate filing. It isn't clear on what amount that fund ultimately closed. Edgewater makes both buyout and growth-equity investments in midmarket companies. The firm manages $2.4 billion, according to its website. Among its recent activity, Edgewater in December said it sold Southern Petroleum Laboratories, a Houston company that performs outsourced hydrocarbon measurement, analysis and reporting services for oil and gas producers, to Industrial Growth Partners.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., New York

Petershill, a group within Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset management arm, is pitching its first fund devoted to taking minority positions in private-equity shops, said a person familiar with the matter. The fund, which is branded as Petershill Private Equity, is seeking $2 billion and closed on $950 million in February. The vehicle will hunt for stakes in smaller private-equity firms poised to become marquee names in the asset management world. It could offer to buy founders' stakes, spreading the wealth of these firms more evenly to help a new generation of deal makers rise. Goldman's Petershill unit is considering taking a pool of its stakes in private-equity firms public in five to seven years. It also could sell the portfolio to a large strategic buyer. The pool will take passive stakes of 10% to 30% in the management companies of firms, mostly focusing on those with assets of $5 billion to $15 billion, the person said. The fund will have no deadline by which it must sell its holdings.

HealthpointCapital, New York

HealthpointCapital is raising its fourth fund for transactions in the musculoskeletal sector, the only market in which it invests. The firm said the new vehicle will target both emerging businesses and established companies. HealthpointCapital said it also would "seek out established but undernourished segments and products" that are owned by medical technology companies. HealthpointCapital currently has $800 million under investment.

J.F. Lehman & Co., New York

J.F. Lehman & Co. raised $833 million for its latest fund, exceeding a $700 million target. The firm, which seeks deals in the aerospace, maritime and defense industries, reached the hard cap for JFL Equity Investors IV LP. The vehicle will target controlling positions in companies based in the U.S. and U.K. The fund's predecessor closed with commitments of $575.5 million in 2011.

BANK REGULATION

ECB Official Urges

More Mergers

Europe's top banking supervisor touted regulators' achievements in pulling eurozone banks back from the brink, though they said more should be done to improve the sector's profitability, repeating a call for more mergers among banks.

The eurozone economy is moving to slow, steady growth -- giving the region's banks a shot in the arm -- after a long contraction following the 2011 euro crisis.

"I hope [economic] recovery will help us to have even more success in the future," said Daniele Nouy, head of the supervisory board of the European Central Bank, speaking at a media conference.

Ms. Nouy runs the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the ECB's banking-regulation arm, which supervises nearly 130 of the largest lenders across the 19-country eurozone.

The ECB supervisor stressed the need for more mergers in the banking sector, noting that this would improve lenders' profitability. "We need consolidation of the banking system," she said, adding that this could take place either within a country or across borders. "It would make sense in certain cases to have cross-border consolidation."

ENERGY

Oversupply Fears

Hold Gas in Check

Natural-gas prices fell, reversing early gains as fears of oversupply keep a rally in check.

Natural gas for April delivery settled down 2.4 cents, or 0.8%, at $3.052 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices rose as high as $3.124/mmBtu before flipping to losses late in the day.

A steady retreat began just after prices hit that high, prices unseen since Feb. 9. The market is range-bound now because of the prospects of low demand that traditionally follows the end of the winter-heating season and for more supply later this year, said Donald Morton, senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims & Co., who runs an energy-trading desk.

Supply is down 2% to 3% from a year ago, according to Platts Analytics, a unit of S&P Global Platts.

The number of working gas rigs in the U.S. has nearly doubled from last year, according to oil-field services company Baker Hughes Inc. The number of oil rigs, which also typically produce gas as a byproduct, has more than doubled, causing some to expect a wave of new natural gas across the country later this year.

UK banks face further scrutiny on top of annual stress test

The UK s largest banks face their toughest ever test of resilience after the central bank unveiled an extra assessment of their business models and separately launched a review into lenders  consumer credit standards.

The Bank of England will put the seven largest lenders   including Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland   under further examination alongside its annual stress test, which measures how banks would fare in certain conditions, at the end of this year.

The new  exploratory  test, which will be carried out every other year, will assess banks  resilience to a wider range of risks beyond those emanating from the financial cycle   such as persistently low interest rates and high costs.

The longer-term test involves banks submitting projections for seven years and will help the BoE identify how the financial system will be reshaped if, for example, there are persistent headwinds to bank profitability. The BoE will not publish details of the results on a bank-by-bank basis.

The new assessment will include weak global growth, continuing low interest rates, falling world trade, increased competitive pressure on large UK banks and misconduct costs.

One adviser said no other central bank had launched such a test before and that it was  uncharted waters for both the BoE and banks .

David Strachan, a head of regulatory strategy at Deloitte, said of this year s assessment:  I think the way that it tests business models and capital levels 	. 	. 	. 	in terms of organisation and administration and logistics then it is more challenging this time around. 

Lee Thorpe, a manager at SAS UK and Ireland, an analytics company, added there would be more pressure on banks as a result of the new test.  A substantial change in approach to identify risks in the business model may require an alternative methodology, further challenging banks to deliver in tight timeframes,  he said.

The BoE also said on Monday that its Prudential Regulation Authority would launch a review into banks  lending standards in relation to consumer credit following soaring growth of the sector.

The review will focus on underwriting standards and the risk models employed by banks.

Consumer credit is one of the largest risks on a bank s balance sheet. Last year, UK banks had 19bn of impairments on credit cards, compared with 12bn on mortgages.

The BoE s Financial Policy Committee said it would also oversee banks  contingency plans to mitigate risks as the process for withdrawing from the EU unfolded. It said:  Risks to financial stability will be influenced by the orderliness of the adjustment to the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. 

The BoE warned a year ago, ahead of the EU referendum, that the vote represented the most significant near-term domestic risk to financial stability. However, Mark Carney, governor of the BoE, said earlier this year that this risk had abated.

The BoE is including for the first time an  anchor  on levels of severity used within its annual stress test. This means it will only get more severe in areas where the BoE thinks risks have increased.

The test, the results of which will be published in the fourth quarter, will examine how lenders deal with a rise in UK unemployment to 9.5 per cent   the same as last year   and a 33 per cent drop in house prices, slightly more than the previous year s scenario.

The bank is testing against a hypothetical 40 per cent decline in commercial real estate, compared with 42 per cent the previous year.

But the global economic scenario will be made more severe, with global gross domestic product contracting by 2.4 per cent and Chinese GDP by 1.2 per cent, implying that the BoE sees global economic hurdles as a greater threat.

Analysts at Citigroup said the  tougher global assumptions may have implications for HSBC s buyback programme 	. 	. 	. 	and the timeframe for StanChart to reinstate dividends. 

The changes are not designed to increase the overall severity of the test but rather show a shift in where the risks are expected to arise.

The BoE said:  In the annual cyclical stress test of the UK banking system, the sizes of the shocks to different sectors and economies are adjusted each year to deliver a similar stressed outcome.

Banking & Finance: State Street Tool Eases Social Investing

Corrections & Amplifications

The U.S. market in 2016 for investments that take into account environmental, social and governance risks was $8.7 trillion, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment. A Banking & Finance article Monday about State Street Corp.'s analytical tools for responsible investing incorrectly said the ESG market in the U.S. last year was $40 trillion.

(WSJ March 29, 2017)

(END)

Asset managers, pension funds and endowments will soon be able to screen their investments more easily for environmental, social and governance risks.

The development is thanks to State Street Corp., which is launching a new set of analytical tools aimed at capitalizing on the appetite for responsible investing. Many firms have made similar strides to help investors tackle what is called ESG exposure, but few can harness as much data as State Street, whose custody business safeguards $29 trillion.

The custody unit gives State Street a window into clients' entire portfolios, allowing them to offer ways to analyze reams of data on those holdings. That core custody business has produced steady, if underwhelming, profit margins, compelling State Street to hunt for new ways to tap into the data and potentially undiscovered investment ideas buried within.

At the same time, interest in ESG investing is surging. More investors are looking to ensure their holdings more closely reflect their values on everything from workforce diversity to limits on their carbon footprint. The overall market for ESG investments swelled to $40 trillion in U.S. assets under management last year, up 33% since 2014, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.

"We have the root data, everything about the company itself," said Lou Maiuri, head of State Street's analytics and markets businesses. "We sit on 12% to 15% of the world's assets."

To help in its effort, the Boston-based bank has held discussions with more than 15 research firms, including MSCI Inc., Sustainalytics and TruValue Labs, to license their data. State Street plans to add those companies' research and ESG ratings alongside its existing risk-management and analytics systems for some 300 clients.

The plans follow efforts by State Street's money-management division, State Street Global Advisors, to add several exchange-traded funds and other offerings that invest in assets that screen stocks for environmental and social-justice criteria. The money manager said earlier this month it would push companies to put more women on their boards, a campaign punctuated by the placement of the "Fearless Girl" statue near Wall Street's bronze bull.

State Street formed its Global Exchange business in2013to showcase the bank'sanalytics. Some of the division's recent offerings include aprivate-equity index based on the data produced by its clientsand a quantitative-investment tool, called MediaStats, that tracks patterns in consumer behavior and media coverage.

Natural Gas Declines, Reversing Early Gains; Fears of oversupply keep rally in check

Natural-gas prices fell Monday, reversing early gains as fears of oversupply keep a rally in check.

Natural gas for April delivery settled down 2.4 cents, or 0.8%, at $3.052 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices rose as high as $3.124/mmBtu before flipping to losses late in the day.

A steady retreat began just after prices hit that high, prices unseen since Feb. 9. The market is range-bound now because of the prospects of low demand that traditionally comes after the end of winter-heating season and the prospects for more supply later this year, said Donald Morton, senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims & Co., who runs an energy-trading desk.

Supply currently is down 2% to 3% from a year ago, according to Platts Analytics, a unit of S&P Global Platts. That dropoff has help prices rise 10% month to date.

But the number of working gas rigs in the U.S. has nearly doubled from last year, according to oil-field services company Baker Hughes Inc. And the number of oil rigs, which also typically produce gas as a byproduct, has more than doubled, causing some to expect a wave of new natural gas across the country later this year.

"We have more rigs coming online and then more gas coming on to the market," Mr. Morton said. "I would not be surprised to see (prices) stuck here for the next 30 to 40 days."

Weather forecasts have also turned warmer, limiting the amount consumers may burn for heat in the weeks to come. Part of the recent rally came from heating demand that shrank storage levels from 21% above the five-year average in the week ended March 10 to below 15%. But that drastic reduction isn't likely to continue if weather turns much warmer than normal, Tim Evans, analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said in a note.

"The warmer than normal temperatures that follow will begin expanding the storage surplus again," Mr. Evans said.

Retailer Woes Depress Mall REITs --- Investor unease about broad shifts in the sector takes toll on real-estate shares

By Ben Eisen

Accelerating troubles among big retailers are weighing on a corner of the market for real-estate investment trusts, a rare bout of underperformance for one of the hottest sectors in recent years.

As Sears Holdings Corp. said Wednesday that it may struggle to continue operating, an index of regional mall REITs dropped 2.2%. Some individual REITs fared worse that day: CBL & Associates Properties Inc. fell 4.9%, Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust dropped 3.5% and Washington Prime Group Inc. fell 3.3%.

All three stocks are down more than 17% this year, reflecting investor fears that store closures and financial struggles among the biggest tenants of shopping malls will hit the companies that finance mall real-estate assets.

Short interest in retail REITs is up about 20% from the end of last year, though it has fallen recently, according to S3 Partners, a financial-analytics firm. Investors who short a stock seek to profit from its decline.

"We believe some of the movements of these stock prices are warranted," said Laurel Durkay, associate portfolio manager of real-estate securities at Cohen & Steers. "We think we're in the third inning, with regard to store closures and the rationalization for real estate within the space."

REITs, which can hold real estate of all types, have been star performers in aggregate, boosted in recent years by the Federal Reserve's low-rate policies that made high-income holdings more attractive. The asset class returned nearly 11% annually between 2002 and 2016, the best performer among 10 investment groups tracked by J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

Last year, the S&P 500 added real estate as an 11th sector of the benchmark. With rates ticking higher this year, the sector is trailing the S&P's 4.7% rise in 2017; it is up just 1.9%.

The drop in mall REITs underscores investor unease about wider shifts in the retail sector as e-commerce sites like Amazon.com Inc. take market share from traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund has dropped 19% over the last two years, even as the S&P 500 climbed 12%.

Ms. Durkay said her firm has trimmed its mall-REIT exposure over the past year while adding to REITs that hold other assets, like data centers, particularly as companies accelerate online sales.

Some see the stock-price moves as an overreaction to a secular trend that has been ongoing. Sears is just one retailer to stoke concerns; GameStop Corp. said Thursday it would close 150 stores. Last month, J.C. Penney Co. said it would close as many as 140 of its 1,000 stores by June. Macy's Inc. said it would close nearly 70 stores. Sears said earlier this year it would shut a combined 150 Sears and Kmart stores.

"Retail REITs are getting oversold because malls are either dead or alive," said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare, which invests in real estate and infrastructure. "This has been a slow-moving train wreck for many years."

Many of the malls in REIT portfolios that have lost major tenants are finding they can replace those tenants, according to Calvin Schnure, senior economist at the National Association of REITs, a trade group.

He pointed to REIT data showing that among regional malls that have been open for more than a year, net operating income was up 3.4% in the final three months of last year from the same period a year earlier.

Still investors are largely in agreement that a good portion of the lower-tier malls will cease to exist in the coming years as their tenants continue to be pressured. Higher-tier malls, meanwhile, could be poised to benefit from consolidation in the sector.

Alteryx Inc. stock on Friday closed 10.7% higher in its trading debut, the latest initial public offering from an enterprise software company.

Irvine, Calif.-based Alteryx, a data-analytics startup, had priced the shares at $14, the high end of its estimated range, to raise $126 million. The stock closed up $1.50 at $15.50.

Iconiq Capital and Insight Venture Partners are among its investors. Insight Venture Partners's 27% stake in the company is now worth nearly $236 million. Iconiq Capital had a 5.6% position and Toba Capital had 6%. Sapphire Ventures Fund I L.P. owns 13%, while Thomson Reuters LLC owns 13.1% of its shares.

The initial public offering comes on the heels of a successful placement of MuleSoft Inc., whose software helps integrate disparate data. Its shares climbed nearly 50% on the first day of trading last week.

Other enterprise software companies, such as Okta Inc. and Yext. Inc., have also recently filed for IPOs following the blockbuster offering of Snap Inc., parent of Snapchat.

Bankers and analysts have been bullish about 2017 as a year of enterprise software IPOs.

Alteryx reported increasing losses for the past three years, losing $24.3 million in 2016, according its most recent SEC filing. Its revenue has grown from $38 million in 2014 to $86 million in 2016.

Rate Rise Puts Squeeze on 0% Financing --- A go-to sweetener for many retailers and manufacturers gets more difficult to offer

The Federal Reserve is pushing interest rates higher. Don't tell that to people who have become accustomed to buying everything at 0% financing.

Years of rock-bottom interest rates have led to a proliferation of no-interest financing offers for people looking to buy everything from cars to lawn mowers, jewelry and furniture. Manufacturers and retailers have come to lean heavily on these deals, which are an inducement for shoppers considering large or discretionary purchases.

Now, with interest rates climbing, the cost of these arrangements will rise, pinching profits at companies that derive a large chunk of their sales from shoppers who prefer to pay in bite-size pieces. Most retailers will likely absorb the higher costs to stay competitive because customers may turn elsewhere if they are asked to pony up interest charges.

The cost of providing 0% financing varies from company to company, but generally retailers pay a middleman -- usually a bank or finance company -- a few percentage points of a product's purchase price upfront. The practice is known as "buying down the rate to zero" because retailers are in effect footing the financing costs for their customers.

For a shopper buying a $10,000 hot tub with 0% financing over three years, that may translate into the retailer paying a bank or finance company around $1,000 upfront, or around 10% of the purchase price. The consumer then makes monthly payments to the finance company.

The upfront fees retailers pay are often tied to a short-term London interbank offered rate, which tends to rise in tandem with the Fed-guided federal-funds rate. As interest rates climb, banks are likely to increase these fees. The six-month Libor has risen to 1.43% from 0.9% a year ago, according to Bankrate.com, as the fed-funds rate has risen by half a percentage point.

The 0% deals will get more expensive, says Mike Rittler, head of retail card services at TD Bank, which provides no-interest financing to customers of 25 U.S. retailers, including sellers of furniture and tractors. Retailers could limit their costs by providing no-interest financing for shorter terms, he notes.

Companies in many cases say they don't plan to ditch the offers, which have become a cornerstone of their marketing efforts since the financial crisis.

But if profit margins get compressed, analysts say companies may be forced to act.

"Cash has been free for so long that everyone has been able to offer these no-interest deals," says David Bassuk, a managing director and co-head of the retail practice at consulting firm AlixPartners. "As it becomes more expensive for companies, the game is going to change."

In general, the longer the no-interest payment term, the higher the cost to the seller. "The offers that were the most generous will become harder to find, because retailers will have to give up more income to provide them," says Bill McCracken, CEO of Phoenix Synergistics, a consumer research firm.

So far, there are few signs that offers are fading. After all, interest rates, and most companies' funding costs, remain relatively low. Several retailers say shoppers also have come to expect the deals.

General Motors Co., which has long provided 0% financing for up to 72 months on many new car and truck models, expects to continue the deals. "The beauty of 0% is that it's pretty easy to understand." says Jim Cain, a GM spokesman.

In 2002, GM and other auto makers did away with 0% financing deals and moved to other types of sales incentives to woo customers. Roughly a year later, they brought back the deals to counter sluggish sales.

Television shopping network QVC last year started selling a $399 Dyson high-speed hair dryer that many people purchased using a six-month no-interest installment plan. "The product is a want and a desire, and not a need, and being able to pay in smaller amounts" makes the items more affordable for customers, says Peter Goodnough, QVC's vice president of customer insights and analytics.

The retailer has no plans to change its offers for no-interest financing.

At electronics and furniture chain P.C. Richard & Son, close to one-third of shoppers' purchases are made with store-branded credit cards that automatically let customers pay in interest-free installments, says Chief Financial Officer Tom Pohmer. Shoppers can get 12 to 60 months' financing on expensive items such as $2,000 mattresses. "The promotions are very important for our customers, and we will offer them when interest rates are high or low," Mr. Pohmer adds.

Although they acknowledge that rising interest rates will increase their costs, many retailers are hoping the Fed's rate increase is a sign of an improving economy, which should help their sales grow.

Consumers, meanwhile, can be very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Patrick Williams, senior director of marketing at Jacuzzi Group Worldwide, a Chino Hills, Calif., maker of hot tubs and other bath products, says his company has in the past experimented with 1.99% and 2.99% financing offers, with mixed results. "Consumers have become conditioned to seek out 0% financing," he says.

In recent years, credit-card issuers also have aggressively used 0% offers to persuade people to transfer their card balances over from rivals.

SAP Gets Into Early-Stage Game; Six years after spinning off Sapphire Ventures, the software giant launches new VC arm

SAP SE is getting back in the corporate venture capital game this time, with a focus on early-stage deals.

The software giant has seeded a new investment vehicle for seed and Series A deals, SAP.io Fund, with an initial investment of $35 million.

SAP spun out its first venture capital arm as Sapphire Ventures in 2011. While Sapphire remains independent from SAP, the software giant is Sapphire's largest limited partner. SAP offers Sapphire portfolio companies support and introductions to potential customers, according to a spokesperson for Sapphire.

While Sapphire will continue to be SAP's watchful eye on the late-stage deal market, SAP.io is looking out for seed and Series A startups that are using SAP data and technologies, such as integrating with SAP's application programming interfaces, said SAP Chief Strategy Officer Deepak Krishnamurthy, who will lead the fund.

Startups that receive investment from SAP.io will often adopt SAP's cloud APIs or cloud data from SAP cloud applications after receiving the investment, Mr. Krishnamurthy said. The fund will typically write checks between $100,000 and $250,000, he said.

SAP.io will share deal flow with Sapphire, Mr. Krishnamurthy said. "They probably see a lot early-stage companies that come knocking on the door, but they feel like it's too early for them to invest in," he added.

SAP.io has invested in Paradata, a San Jose-based big data analytics company incorporated as Parable Sciences Inc.

The fund has also launched an incubator program called SAP.io Foundry, with locations in San Francisco and Berlin. Its Berlin office will be managed by Techstars. SAP.io plans to spend its initial seed investment over three years, Mr. Krishnamurthy said.

Judging by the comments belowthe FT's Big Readfrom earlier this week on Capital Group, the huge California-based active fund manager, and its attempts to hold the line against the rising tide of passive management, many readers felt that it lacked a discussion of Capital's performance. I understand that concern, and my colleague Robin Wigglesworth also said in the comments that with hindsight he wished he had included a summary chart to show how Capital had done.

He also made the point, reasonably, that performance data for mutual funds is easily available at no cost. Readers could have looked this up for themselves.

For those who did not feel like doing so, I have spent some time at the Bloomberg terminal running some performance numbers for the Growth Fund of America, the flagship fund of Capital's American Funds group. The results are fascinating. My apologies, but I will have to present most of them as Bloomberg screen grabs.

For the sake of the exercise, I compared Growth Fund with SPY, the largest S&P 500 ETFand the most obvious passive competition these days, and Fidelity Magellan, which was for many years the largest, most famous and best-performing active mutual fund of them all. Its assets under management have fallen by almost 90 per cent since its heyday at the end of the 1990s, so it is a very interesting comparison with two funds that have been far more successful in recent years, in terms of pulling in money.

Over the past five years, Capital's Growth Fund is indeed ahead of the index, although not by much.

Well done, Capital Group. This is how the differing performance shows itself over time. I have not had the time to calculate Sharpe Ratios, but it is obvious by eyeballing the charts that there has been no significant difference in volatility for these funds over the past five years, which have by historical standards been very calm ones for the US stock market:

So Capital did do better, but they have done barely anything different than from tracking the index.

Over longer periods however, Capital comes out looking much better. We also begin to see the magic of compound interest. Over 24 years (the maximum for which Bloomberg had data), Capital's advantage compounded into huge extra returns:

This is what that looks like graphically:

Academic studies show frequently that repeated active outperformance over many years is hard to pull off, and that the number of active managers beating the index dwindles over time. This shows what you can do if you do manage to compound superior returns for a while.

Note, however, that almost all of this derives from one dramatic period, as the late 1990s bull market turned into a bubble, when Capital managed to handle the market far more adroitly than Magellan  or the index.

Having prudently decided to sit out the early stages of the final bull market phase, laggingbehind both Magellan and the index in 1996, it made two great decisions. First, it loaded up on growth stocks as the bubble came to a head, allowing it to outperform the market. And once at the top, it managed to shift into enough of the right stocks that its decline from there was no worse than that of the market. It is in thehopeof brilliant (or lucky) timing like this that people try an active manager rather than an index tracker.

It is no coincidence that Capital enjoyed a brief ascendancy as the largest mutual fund group, and Growth Fund of America took over as the largest mutual fund, in the period between the dotcom bust of 2000 and the credit crisis seven years later. It had handled the dotcom bust very well. How did it handle things when the top was reached in 2007? Nothing like as well. These numbers are for the five years starting from the S&P's top in October 2007:

Magellan evidently played that market break far worse, but the managers at Capital added no value to what their clients could have achieved by tracking the index. It is not surprising that since this incident, money has flowed ever more towards passive funds. Active funds (certainly not just Capital) failed to protect their investors during the most recent bear market.

Since the top in 2007, the similarity between Growth Fund and SPY is uncanny. Effectively, they have both given their investors exactly the same thing (SPY is very slightly ahead). It is just that Capital has paid more people and gone to much more trouble to come to exactly the same result:

This brings me to a defence of active investing that increasingly annoys me, because it is often stated without any evidence being offered to back it up. It is a popular contention that active is superior to passive because its managers can take evasive action in a downturn, while index trackers must blindly track the index downwards. Here is a choice comment from Robin's Big Read on Capital:

Bear in mind that I am generally known (fairly) to have been too negative about the US stock market as it has made its ascent. The choice between active and passive is not about asset allocation (I would not be too heavily in US equities, which will not seem bad in the event of a market break, but has not looked good of late), but about how to gain your exposure to equities. Almost everyone should always have at least exposure to equities.

Now, will I have reason to reproach myself for my enthusiasm for passive equity investing when the next equity downturn arrives? Here is how Growth Fund and Magellan performed, compared to the S&P 500 ETF, from the 2000 top to the 2002 bottom of the market:

OK, so Growth Fund did manage to outperform during that traumatic period, but by only 1.35 percentage points. Nobody could possibly look at the chart of that experience and conclude that Growth Fund of America had offered any kind of useful drawdown insurance:

Yes, again, Growth Fund outperformed the market very slightly. If you wanted to avoid a drawdown, it was hopeless: you needed to make a big asset allocation bet and do something else.

Note also that poor Magellan, which over many decades had earned the right to be regarded as the best actively managed fund of all time, underperformed the market in both of those drawdowns. And most active managers were more like Magellan than Growth Fund of America. Capital Group is indeed an excellent active management shop, but if it is operating a fund that has told investors it will stay fully invested in equities, then it is going to participate in any equity sell-off to the full.

This is all backward-looking but at least it is based in fact. Now let me try a little forward-looking analysis. Is there anything about Growth Fund's current portfolio that might incline me to believe that it will make money during the next big market downturn?

Going from public information, it is interesting to note first that its managers have made some great calls. All the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) feature among its 10 largest holdings, as does Microsoft. Some 15.4 per cent of the fund is in the internet sector, its heaviest weighting.

Hats off to the managers for spotting so many of the winners of the past few years. Having done so, it is intriguing that they have not beaten the index by far more. But when it comes to the notion that this portfolio will offer you more protection in a downturn, I think that is ridiculous. We do not know how thenext downturn will play out, but I would expect the FANG stocks to hurt. And its holdings are so huge that it will be difficult to get out of them in a hurry and move on to something else. For example, its stake in Amazon, some 6 per cent of its portfolio, is worth some $8bn. 

And are these stocks particularly cheap? Bloomberg's analytics show that the top 10 holdings are on a price/earnings multiple of more than 60 times (which shows the limitations of p/e multiples), and a price/book multiple of more than three. Little drawdown insurance there.

As for asset allocation, it is not fully invested, having only 93.6 per cent in stocks. Only 1.5 per cent is in cash, as it has a small holding of bonds.In the event of another Lehman-type event, that should enable it to beat a tracker fund by a percentage point, maybe. By no leap of the imagination does it offer any insurance against another huge market sell-off.

So, this quick and cursory examination confirms that Growth Fund of America is an excellently run fund. It has done no worse than the index over the past decade, and anyone who has been in it for the very long term is still enjoying the compounded benefits from its adroit handling of the dotcom bubble. But I see no compelling reason to buy it rather than a passive tracker. It seems at present to be tracking the index while loading up on the hottest stocks of the moment. And we are, of course, talking about the very best that active management has to offer. As a general rule, minimising costs with a passive fund strikes me as the better idea.

And as for HoundDog's rather offensive notion that I will live to have a guilty conscience about recommending passive funds when the next downturns happens,I have only this to say to you:

Senate Panel Floats Ideas for Securing IoT

A proliferation of internet-connected technologies, alongside emerging platforms like blockchain, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, have created new and yet-to-be-discovered risks that must be addressed, according to a March 22 hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

Senators questioned experts from Intel Corp., the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, International Business Machines Corp., the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Cylance Inc. about how threats posed from new technologies can be met, sometimes by the new technologies themselves.

Some suggestions included using blockchain technology for safer, verifiable and anonymous information sharing between private sector firms, and establishing programs early that allow government and industry to anticipate the potential of quantum computers to quickly break existing encryption. A focus on the "shelf life" of internet-connected devices brought several suggestions, including a ratings system for security of those devices and consideration of a "sell by" date.

Focus on  IoT'

Several speakers questioned the feasibility of expecting private companies to protect against threats from military-grade attackers, particularly with the growing number of internet-connected devices belonging to the collective Internet of Things, or IoT. Committee chairman Sen. John Thune of South Dakota referenced a statistic that IoT devices will exceed 50 billion by 2020. Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire questioned whether and how private businesses could fend off IoT attacks from sophisticated adversaries.

Eric Rosenbach, former assistant secretary of defense for homeland security and global security, said that private companies can't be expected to defend themselves against a state-sponsored onslaught, and government intervention is often warranted. "Otherwise, the investment they would have to make in defending themselves would put them out of business," he said.

Venky Ganesan, a partner with Menlo Ventures, said there were promising solutions for de-risking IoT devices, and that he had been impressed with start-ups that provide company-level and individual product security "scores - similar to Standard and Poor's or Moody's," that could help businesses and consumers make more informed decisions about the security levels of various devices.

Steve Grobman, chief technology officer with Intel's security division, said his company had focused on ensuring IoT devices have "field repairability," in that devices are able to be accessed in the field in order to provide security updates. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut suggested a recall process similar to that in place for products that cause physical hazards, while Caleb Barlow, vice president with threat intelligence at IBM, said the concept of an expiration date for devices could be considered.

Mr. Grobman said the issue of proliferation in the IoT marketplace raises some "very challenging questions."

"If a manufacturer sells a device for $30 with a three-year warranty, if a vulnerability is discovered in year seven, are they still subject to being required to deploy fixes? What about in cases where manufacturers no longer exist, and we are still left with millions of vulnerable devices?" said Mr. Grobman.

"I think one of the most important things that we can do in the near term is have consumers think about security in much of the same way that they think about reliability or safety in other products," said Mr. Grobman. "We really need to raise awareness that security in all devices is key."

Finance & Markets: Chinese Group Pays Up for New York Tower

A Chinese conglomerate is in contract to buy a Park Avenue office building for $2.21 billion, among the highest prices ever paid for a New York tower, according to a person familiar with the deal.

HNA Group has entered into a deal to buy the 1.8 million square-foot skyscraper from sellers Brookfield Property Partners LP and the New York State Teachers' Retirement System, according to the person.

The agreement reflects the increasing allure of New York City real estate for major Chinese investors looking for property in so-called gateway cities in the U.S., said real-estate executives and analysts.

"For trophy-quality assets in New York City, particularly office buildings, there continues to be significant interest from Chinese investors who can write extraordinarily large checks and who, in all likelihood, are long-term holders," said Dustin Stolly, managing director of capital markets for real-estate services firm JLL. He wasn't involved in the deal.

The agreement was first reported by The Real Deal. Brookfield has a 51% stake in the tower, and its partner holds 49%.

Completed in 1967, the 45-story building at 245 Park Avenue has financial tenants including Societe Generale SA and Ares Capital Corp., and sits just north of Grand Central Terminal in the heart of Midtown Manhattan's traditional office corridor. Such properties are considered safe investments, said Ken McCarthy, principal economist at real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.

"It's more a focus on capital preservation than on the rate of return," Mr. McCarthy said. "There definitely has been a significant pickup in Chinese investment in properties in the U.S. overall and in New York City in particular."

In 2008, Boston Properties Inc. and investors, including the sovereign-wealth funds of Kuwait and Qatar, paid $2.8 billion to buy the General Motors Building at 767 Fifth Ave.

In 2014, Chinese investments in New York City commercial real estate totaled $500 million, according to Cushman & Wakefield and Real Capital Analytics Inc. It grew to $5.4 billion in 2015, the same year Anbang Insurance Group Co. bought the Waldorf Astoria hotel for $1.95 billion. Last year, Chinese investments in commercial real estate reached about $8 billion, representing about half of all foreign investment in the city.

Two trends are obvious from the latest ranking of the world s largest investment banks: JPMorgan s climb to the top and Deutsche Bank s fall from grace. Expect this divergence to continue.

US banks are already in much better shape than their European rivals. Now they have the added advantage that they may be able to convince the new Washington administration to loosen strict domestic regulations. Rules burdensome to foreign lenders would probably stay in place.

The latest data from analytics company Coalition show that in all geographies and almost all sectors, JPMorgan already occupies first place. Only Morgan Stanley has managed to best it   outranking the bank in equities.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank is slipping down the league table. Across fixed income it has fallen from third place. In Asia, it has moved from top spot to third place   where it ties with three other banks. Jefferies, the US investment bank, has increased its fixed income revenue 48 per cent, which bodes well for those that have managed to hold on to the largest footprint in this segment. In the past year, the top three were all American.

Regulatory outperformance should give US banks a further boost. KBW estimates that removing extra buffers that domestic regulators have added to international rules could boost per share earnings 12 per cent next year.

Blanket Basel III capital requirements, for example, require a 3 per cent minimum leverage ratio, while US depository institutions must hold 5 per cent to be considered well capitalised. The excess can be returned to shareholders or invested into expanding balance sheets at the expense of European competitors.

The turning of the regulatory tide   if it happens   will come at exactly the right time for US institutions. It is in their interest to agree to regulatory standards high enough to keep European competitors at bay. Team Europe s loss will be financial stability s gain.

Octopus Ventures rides on AI success to raise 120m funding

Octopus Ventures, the 10-year-old British venture capital firm that has backed three high-profile artificial intelligence start-ups acquired by US tech giants, has raised a fresh 120m tranche of funding to invest in new AI talent in the UK.

The 660m venture fund, which is the tech investing arm of UK fund management business Octopus Group, invested in natural language processing company Evi Technologies, predictive keyboard maker Swiftkey and AI video start-up Magic Pony, sold to Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter respectively.

Octopus has also backed several other successful British companies such as Lovefilm, which was also bought by Amazon, and property website Zoopla; but the three AI start-ups in its portfolio have led the firm to develop a specialism in such early-stage companies.

The industry could be extremely lucrative for the UK: Accenture, the consultancy, has estimated that AI could add up to 654bn to the national economy by 2035.

 Evi Technologies in Cambridge was sold to Amazon and now powers Alexa, the voice-activated speaker. We also backed Swiftkey which went to Microsoft last year [for $250m] and made a seed investment in Magic Pony, which went to Twitter [for $150m],  said Alex Macpherson, chief executive of Octopus Ventures.

 We have expertise in the machine-learning field, but the challenge today is pretty much every business that comes through to us is machine learning or artificial intelligence. 

Octopus is currently in discussions with two new British AI start-ups to provide seed funding from its fund over the coming months.

British AI skills have been particularly appealing to international companies, including the big US tech businesses such as Google, Apple and Uber.

In 2014, Google paid $400m for DeepMind, a London start-up that is now arguably a world leader in AI with a team of more than 250 academic experts in the fields of deep learning and machine intelligence.

A year later, Apple acquired UK-based speech technology start-up VocalIQ, and last December, Uber bought Geometric Intelligence, a partly Cambridge, UK-based AI start-up, to staff its new AI lab focused on transport.

It is not just the Americans looking to Britain to exploit AI expertise: late last year, Chinese private equity firm CSC Group funded an AI incubator in Britain, in a multimillion-pound partnership with British start-up incubator Founders Factory, led by entrepreneur and investor Brent Hoberman.

The goal was to invest in and grow five early-stage AI start-ups and launch two companies from scratch each year.  The UK has innovative artificial intelligence technology,  said Dania Zhou, senior managing director of CSC Group, who has been overseeing the deal.  We want to fuse the technology we find in the UK with the Chinese market. 

Ultimately, Octopus wants to build British companies that become world leaders in their own right. Mr Macpherson said:  Our whole concept is how can we help support British entrepreneurs to take their business the whole way, and not sell out to the Americans or others a bit too early.

GTCR sold Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., a maker of speciality lab equipment, to fellow private-equity firm Golden Gate Capital.

Cole-Parmer, of Vernon Hills, Ill., manufactures and distributes laboratory and industrial fluid-handling products, including chemicals, equipment, pumps, safety products and other items, to companies in the biotechnology, environmental, safety and pharmaceutical sectors.

GTCR acquired the business from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in 2014. The Chicago firm bought the company for $480 million, according to a news release at that time.

GTCR's sale of Cole-Palmer is the result of a "narrow and focused process" that involved both private-equity firms and strategic companies, said Dean Mihas, a managing director at GTCR.

Goldman Sachs & Co. and Jefferies LLC advised Cole-Parmer on the transaction. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised GTCR. Kirkland & Ellis LLP and PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP advised both Cole-Parmer and GTCR.

Mr. Mihas said GTCR helped carve out the company from Thermo Fisher in six months. In addition to stimulating organic growth, the firm helped Cole-Parmer complete six acquisitions over the course of its ownership. Mr. Mihas said that GTCR helped Cole-Parmer nearly double the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the business.

GTCR invests in the industries of financial services and technology; health care; growth business services; and technology, media and telecommunications.

The parent company of GTCR-backed public relations software firm Cison Inc. disclosed plans to go public by purchasing a publicly traded blank check company this week. Cision makes public relations software and analytics for companies to send out news releases, contact journalists and handle other campaigns.

Golden Gate has more than $15 billion in committed capital. The San Francisco firm targets six industry verticals: software; semiconductors and information technology hardware; retail and restaurants; industrials; IT and business services; and financial services.

Blackstone Is Cashing Out --- A sale or IPO of its European warehouse unit should bring more than $10.8 billion

By Art Patnaude

Blackstone Group LP is gearing up to unload its European warehouse property arm in a bet investors will buy into the rise of internet shopping.

The U.S. private-equity firm has been working simultaneously toward a sale or initial public offering of Logicor, which it created in 2012 to operate industrial properties it owns across Europe.

Either route is likely to result in a deal of more than 10 billion euros ($10.8 billion), people familiar with the processes said, potentially making it one of the biggest real-estate transactions ever in Europe.

Warehouses have become vital holdings for companies that sell goods online. High-tech distribution centers are crucial for businesses offering home deliveries, such as retailers like Amazon.com Inc. or logistics firms like DHL Worldwide Express Inc.

Blackstone has been building up its portfolio at Logicor, which operates more than 630 properties in Europe, into one of the region's biggest.

As demand for warehouse space increases, investors are piling into the sector. European logistics investment volumes hit a record 12.9 billion euros in 2016, rising from 12 billion euros in 2015, according to Real Capital Analytics. Overall, commercial-property transactions in Europe were 274 billion euros in 2016, down 15% from a year earlier.

In one of the biggest real-estate deals in Europe last year, GIC Pte. Ltd., Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, bought P3 Logistic Parks for 2.4 billion euros from private-equity firm TPG and Ivanhoe Cambridge, the property arm of Quebec's state pension fund.

"There's a growing acceptance that e-commerce is part of all our lives," said Jack Cox, head of industrial and logistics capital markets at property broker CBRE.

For years, Logicor's management made clear that a sale or IPO were Blackstone's two exit strategies. But plans have been picking up pace, and a deal is widely expected this year, people familiar with both possible options say.

A direct sale of Logicor could be preferred to an IPO because of uncertainty over how long it would take Blackstone to sell its whole stake, observers said. Blackstone will market the direct sale for about 13 billion euros, people familiar with the sale process said.

Blackstone embarked on a similar push in the U.S. in 2010 with its IndCor Properties business. It sold IndCor to GIC for $8.1 billion in 2014.

Should Blackstone take the IPO route for Logicor, the fourth quarter of this year looks likely, a person familiar with the process said.

Blackstone isn't completely turning away from European warehouses. U.K. real-estate investment trust Hansteen Holdings on Monday said that it was selling industrial-property portfolios to Blackstone and M7 Real Estate for 1.28 billion euros.

And Logicor isn't the only major industrial-property platform up for sale. Global Logistic Properties, whose shares are listed in Singapore, last month said it had received several offers. Global Logistic, which is backed by GIC, operates warehouses in China, Japan, the U.S. and Brazil.

Returns on real estate look attractive compared with other asset classes like bonds because of ultralow global interest rates.

Founded by a former stockbroker who dodged the 1929 crash, Capital Group used active stockpicking to become one of the largest mutual companies. Now it is leading the fightback against passive investment. By Robin Wigglesworth and Stephen Foley

When Tim Armour graduated from Middlebury College, a liberal arts institution in Vermont, he faced a conundrum. He could either accept a graduate programme slot at a West Coast investment group, or go and run a windsurf shop in Florida.

Because he loved to windsurf but did not want to turn down a more sensible job, he asked the asset manager whether he could put off the traineeship for a year. He was grudgingly given nine months, so off he went to the beaches of Sanibel, an island off the south-west coast of Florida.

"It was one of the best experiences of my life because it taught me, in the first two weeks, that that's not what I wanted to do and I was so thankful to have a job to come back to," he says.

It worked out just fine for Mr Armour . Since 2015 he has been chairman and chief executive of the investment company he joined over three decades ago: Capital Group, one of the oldest and biggest in the world, with more than $1.5tn of assets under management. But he has taken the reins at a perilous time.

Traditional asset managers face an epochal battle against the rise of passive investing . Even Capital, one of the industry's best-regarded players, has felt the ground shift beneath its feet, with outflows for much of the post-crisis era. In 2007 its Growth Fund of America was the biggest mutual fund. Today, it is dwarfed by Vanguard and State Street's flagship passive funds .

That is why the company has ripped up a decades-old policy of operating in relative anonymity and is advancing new research that aims to destroy the "myth" that active management is doomed. "I feel we're yelling from the top of a mountain, and no one is listening," Mr Armour says. "Passive is here to stay, and it's an important option. But we are better than passive."

He has a reasonably strong argument to make. Although Capital's funds did poorly in the financial crisis - tarnishing a reputation for dodging bubbles - it has regained its footing. Thanks to improving performance and buoyant markets, its assets under management are now again close to the 2007 peak of $1.55tn. In 1993, Capital's American Funds was the fourth-largest US mutual fund brand, behind Fidelity, Vanguard and Franklin Templeton; now it is second, behind Vanguard, the all-conquering passive specialist .

This year it launched one of its root-and-branch reviews of the entire business - a project codenamed "Delta" - to "step back, re-examine and innovate". But the Los Angeles-based company is battling a fundamental change in investor preferences that will be hard to reverse, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange traded funds and mutual fund research at CFRA.

"The shift to passive is not abating, it is accelerating, and unlike many other asset managers, Capital is entirely focused on active," Mr Rosenbluth says. "It tends to offer lower fee products, so their returns are going to be competitive, but . . . as investors seek out passive products, Capital is going to get caught up in the trend regardless of their performance."

Not just about the fees

For the investment industry, the post-crisis era has been marked by steady growth - but also disruption.

On the plus side, central banks have boosted markets to new highs, lifting the size of the US mutual fund industry to more than $16tn, up from $12tn on the eve of the crisis in 2007, according to the Investment Company Institute.

Yet mutual funds have proven progressively poorer at navigating markets. Over the past 10 years, 87.5 per cent of US equity funds underperformed their benchmarks, for example, and more than half of all international and emerging markets equities funds also lagged behind, according to an S&P study.

Meanwhile the likes of Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street have continued to slash the costs of their passive products, while smaller providers have unveiled a dizzying array of ETFs that allow investors to put money in any investment style or theme at a fraction of the cost of a traditional mutual fund.

But Capital's analysis of historic fund performance - research that has been corroborated by Morningstar, an industry data provider - has shown that two factors are strong indicators of long-term, market-beating returns: fund managers having plenty of their own money in a fund; and low fees. Capital scores well on both measures.

Almost two-thirds of American Funds' share classes have fees rated as "low" by Morningstar, while another fifth were below average. And 97 per cent of Capital's assets are managed by a portfolio manager with at least $1m of their own money invested.

"I feel really good about the battle we're waging," says Steve Deschenes, director of client analytics at Capital, the architect behind much of its research on active management.

Beating the drum loudly does not come naturally to Capital. Its profile was long so low that when Theresa May became British prime minister, a UK newspaper that wrote about her husband Philip's role as a client relationship manager at Capital could still mistakenly describe it as "a little-known hedge fund".

No longer. Capital's ads have taken on a mad-as-hell-and-not-gonna-take-it-any-more feel. "American Funds has done what sceptics claim is impossible," says one. "Don't buy the myth. You can beat the index," says another.

Mr Armour has even taken on Warren Buffett, whose latest annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders exhorted readers to put their money into cheap index funds. "We agree that the average investment manager does not outpace the market over meaningful time horizons [but] Mr Buffett and others acknowledge that there are exceptions," Mr Armour said when the letter came out.

Capital's fightback against passive is not just about marketing. In perhaps its boldest gambit, it is aiming to change the rules of engagement, by eliminating something it says tilts the battlefield in favour of ETFs: distribution fees.

These fees are passed on to distributors such as broker-dealers, and come on top of the fee that managers like Capital charge, potentially doubling the cost (or more). Mutual fund performance is calculated net of fees, which means active managers not only have to beat the index, they have to beat it by more than the fund's fees to be deemed a success, and distribution fees make that hard. Capital won permission from regulators this year to start selling what it calls "clean shares", which, unlike most mutual fund share classes, do not include a distribution fee baked in.

Clean shares will include only Capital's own management fee. Investors may not necessarily see the benefit - brokers will add their fees by another means - but clean shares will automatically record better performance numbers than traditional mutual fund shares. If clean shares catch on, the statistics will start to show fewer active managers falling short of the index.

"When people are comparing passive returns to mutual fund returns, they're often comparing apples and oranges," says Mr Armour. "We want to simplify things."

Capital is also trying to burnish its bond business. In 2015 it poached Michael Gitlin, head of fixed income at mutual fund rival T Rowe Price, to lead its bond team - an unusual move for a company that prides itself on promoting internal talent rather than hiring outside stars. Mr Gitlin has even been promoted to its management committee.

Mr Gitlin has gone on a hiring spree, snapping up about a dozen people to boost the asset manager's capabilities in junk bonds, emerging market debt and municipal finance among other areas.

The bond business is now growing at a healthy clip, from $225bn at the start of 2015 to $263bn by the end of last year. Mr Gitlin is targeting $500bn of assets in the next four to five years. "The business has a substantial size already, without scratching the surface of what we can do," he says.

Capital's culture is different from many other investment groups, and was primarily shaped by its former head Jon Lovelace , whose daughter once labelled him a " Buddhist businessman " for his distaste of hierarchy.

The company was founded in 1931 by his father Jonathan Bell Lovelace, a former stockbroker who dodged the 1929 crash. But its egalitarian "multi-manager" system was fostered by the son, who wanted to ensure Capital would not suffer the "key person" risk that has bedevilled rivals, where the brand of one star money manager overshadows the fund.

Each of Capital's funds is run by a team of sometimes more than a dozen portfolio managers and analysts, all of whom are responsible for investing independent slices of the fund, adding up to hundreds of individual stock picks. Critics argue that such a broad approach means its performance is likely to hew closely to the broader market index; active managers are increasingly electing to place fewer but bolder bets, making their funds look more like the concentrated portfolios of a hedge fund manager or a Mr Buffett.

That is the direction taken by Dale Harvey, who quit as a portfolio manager at Capital in 2007 to launch Poplar Forest. But he concedes his approach may not be right for the more conservative savers targeted by Capital's American Funds, who want insulation from market rollercoasters.

The company's bonus structure is also heavily tilted towards rewarding long-term performance. Almost half of compensation is tied to results over eight years - while most other asset managers rarely reward performance beyond five years. "Capital is a get-rich-slow kind of place," Mr Harvey says.

A new era of volatility?

Fund managers hope US president Donald Trump's unorthodox policies might usher in a new market era that will be kinder to active asset managers, who struggle when assets rise and fall in unison, but thrive - at least in theory - when turbulence causes divergence.

"A more volatile world, I think, is good for us. It fits right into what we do well and so we're pretty excited about what we see coming down the pike," says Mr Armour.

Yet so far the evidence of a stockpicking renaissance remains elusive. And the central challenge confronting Capital is that the shift in investor preferences towards cheap passive investment vehicles seems so seismic that even strong performance can only ameliorate the trend.

The assets of Capital Group's biggest fund - the Growth Fund of America - peaked at $193bn at the end of 2007, when it was almost twice the size of State Street's SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the biggest US equity ETF . But at $157bn it is now one-third smaller than its passive rival, despite returns in the top decile over the past five years.

"Over the last couple of years there's just been this great sucking sound of money flowing out of active and into passive," says Marc Pinto, the head of Moody's asset management rating division. "You'll always have the old masters - the Van Goghs that tend to over perform over time - but there just aren't that many out there. Cheap is good, but even cheaper is better. That is the mantra of markets at the moment."

Technology and risk

New hires aim to profit from disruption

The hottest hires in the asset management industry are no longer MBAs and CFAs, but data scientists and programmers. Jobs advertised for the latter outnumber those for fundamental analysts by a factor of eight, according to Bank of America. And Capital Group is also dipping its toe in the tech waters.

Highlighting the sense of the asset manager trying to shake things up, last year it lured Heather Lord from Charles Schwab to be its head of "strategy and innovation". She has been tasked with bringing some disruption to the investment group, examining what processes can be automated or augmented with technology.

"What's on my mind at night is, how do you balance the thoughtfulness that's let this place exist for nine decades - and pivot as many times as it did over that period of time - with the need to move faster over the next three to five years," Ms Lord says. "This period of disruption and instability creates threat and opportunity."

Capital has also set up an innovation lab called the "Emerging Technology Group", led by former Accenture partner Jeff Roedersheimer who answers to the investment group's chief information officer, Julie St John.

It has quietly started to invest in tech companies with products that might be useful for Capital's more digital future.

But it can be hard to modernise a company as old and big as Capital, Ms Lord acknowledges.

"How do we get comfortable in some areas, taking a little bit more risk and failing fast? We're not a place that does that," she says. "And I think to really take advantage of some of the emerging technologies becoming available, we've got to be comfortable with that ambiguity [of not knowing what will work]."

Social media management startup Hootsuite Media Inc. has purchased software to help brands track analytics on their Snapchat presence from Naritiv Inc.

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Hootsuite will pick up three product and engineering team members from venture-backed Naritiv to continue to support a software tool they built to help brands track the performance of their Snapchat content, and may build further Snapchat integrations.

Hootsuite's software allows brands to track their media and advertising on social platforms, including Facebook and Twitter. Until the Naritiv transaction, Hootsuite didn't offer tools for Snapchat, said Matt Switzer, Hootsuite's senior vice president of business development.

About seven to 10 people remain on Naritiv's team, said Naritiv co-founder and Chief Executive Daniel Altmann. Naritiv is backed by investors including Third Wave Digital, Walt Disney Co., Greylock Partners and Luminari Capital. Mr. Altmann declined to say whether the company's investors would receive any consideration as a result of the Hootsuite deal.

Functioning as a kind of agency, Los Angeles-based Naritiv helps brands create promotional snaps, often joining with Snapchat's biggest stars. Naritiv was part of the Disney Accelerator's inaugural class in 2014, and it has since taken on several projects for Disney as well as other clients.

Hootsuite, which has raised more than $200 million from investors including Accel Partners, Blumberg Capital and Hearst Ventures, has acquired a number of startups offering social media management services, including AdEspresso and Sales Prodigy.

Y Combinator Drills Into AI Startups; Accelerator focuses next batch on automation

Y Combinator is ramping up its focus on automation and artificial intelligence in the tech industry.

The accelerator and venture firm recently hired Daniel Gross, who previously sold his startup to Apple Inc., to head its first "vertical" for its next accelerator batch, which is specifically for AI or automation-related startups. It's a recognition of the heightened interest in the area and the technology's rapid improvement.

"We can't afford to ignore what might be the biggest technological leap since the internet," Mr. Gross wrote in a blog post announcing the move.

On Monday at YC's demo day in Mountain View, Calif., several companies pitched automation to assist or replace the work done by people in various industries, including AlemHealth Pte. Ltd. for radiology, Clear Genetics Inc. for genetic counseling, and Algoriz for automating the creation of algorithms for equities trading.

Clear Genetics told the audience its AI version of a counselor performs better than a person, and at one-third of the cost.

But these technologies generally won't replace humans just yet, Mr. Gross said in an interview.

"With the exception of self-driving cars, this is a little further out than we expect," he said. "We tend to be excited and optimistic about these things. The era at which robots will do everything for us and we sip cocktail on the beach is a little further away."

SEC

November Trial Set

For Leon Cooperman

A federal judge in Philadelphia declined to dismiss an insider-trading case against hedge-fund manager Leon Cooperman, setting the stage for a legal showdown between the famous investor and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

U.S. District Judge Juan R. Sanchez on Monday ruled the claims against Mr. Cooperman were plausible enough for the case to proceed and set a trial date for Nov. 6.

The SEC sued Mr. Cooperman and his firm, Omega Advisors Inc., in September, alleging he traded on confidential information obtained from an executive of Atlas Pipeline Partners LP, which planned a $650 million asset sale.

The SEC said Mr. Cooperman, during a July 2010 telephone conversation with the executive, had agreed not to trade on information he was given. The SEC alleged several funds managed by Mr. Cooperman, as well as others for which he directed trading, made a total of more than $4 million in illegal profits by trading in Atlas securities.

Mr. Cooperman's lawyers have argued that the SEC hasn't shown that he agreed not to trade before he received the information, which they say is required to establish an insider-trading case. Mr. Cooperman has denied wrongdoing, saying, that the SEC was wrong about his profits and that the investment lost money.

Daniel Kramer, an attorney for Mr. Cooperman at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, declined to comment on the decision. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Investors bet $9.6bn on a fall in bond prices ahead of Federal Reserve meeting; Exchange traded funds

Short positions against three BlackRock ETFs increased significantly

Investors placed bets worth around $9.6bn that bond prices would fall ahead of last week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve that resulted in an increase in interest rates.

The bets on a fall in bond prices, which move inversely to interest rates, were placed via three exchange traded funds run by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.

The value of short positions against the ETFs - essentially bets that bond prices would fall - had increased by $3.2bn since the start of March, according to S3 Partners, a US-based financial analytics provider.

Janet Yellen , who chairs the Federal Reserve, is expected to begin accelerating the pace of interest rate increases as the US central bank responds to an economy that is reaching maximum employment and inflation that is nearing target.

Bets against the largest US high-yield bond ETF, a BlackRock fund known as HYG, registered a 60 per cent increase this month to a record $6.4bn.

Short interest in LQD, a second BlackRock ETF that tracks the US investment-grade bond market, surged 68 per cent higher from the start of March, to $1.2bn on the eve of the Fed meeting.

Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, said: "Traders are primarily using these three ETFs as hedges to protect against fixed income positions that will lose value when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates."

Bets against a third BlackRock fund known as TLT, which tracks US Treasury bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years, rose 17 per cent from the start of March to $2bn.

The central bank's decison to raise interest rates on Wednesday, the first tightening of monetary policy under the presidency of Donald Trump, was followed by a reduction of around $431m in the short positions held across the three ETFs.

Strong US employment data released on Friday, March 10, has strengthened expectations that the central bank will accelerate the pace of rate rises later this year.

The rise in ETF short positions has coincided with an increase in withdrawals from actively managed high-yield corporate bond funds .

High-yield corporate bond funds recorded $4.2bn of outflows in the week to March 15, the largest weekly redemption since 2014, according to EPFR, the data provider.

A fall in crude oil prices to below $50 a barrel was an important factor driving the outflows as energy companies are big issuers of high-yield debt.

But passively managed ETFs linked to the US high-yield market have attracted robust interest so far this year, with net inflows of just under $1.5bn, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.

Aflac. Inc. is raising a $100 million fund over three years to invest in early-stage companies developing products and software related to the insurance company's core business.

Aflac Corporate Ventures plans to join with technology accelerators to quickly identify and invest in early-stage companies. The fund will maintain offices in Charlotte, N.C., and in Sunnyvale, Calif., as part of a partnership with a technology accelerator, the company said.

In both the U.S. and Japan, Columbus, Ga.-based Aflac is actively pursuing investment opportunities as part of its overall corporate venture strategy.

Just over a year ago Aflac acquired Empowered Benefits, a Charlotte-based technology company that provides cloud-based benefits administration and exchange platform solutions to insurance carriers, brokerages and employers.

In recent years more insurance companies have begun launching their own investment arms.

The Swiss insurer Helvetia Insurance started a venture fund to back insure-tech startups that align with the company's core business in early 2017. The fund aimed to invest 55 million Swiss francs (more than $55 million) in about 25 young companies over the next few years.

In late 2016 financial solutions firm Annexus launched a fund to capitalize on the rising popularity of insurance technology startups.

British Aviva PLC's fund, starting in late 2015, backs startups the Internet of Things, data and analytics, innovative customer experiences, and distribution.

Aquiline Capital Partners has sold Bisam Technologies SA to FactSet Research Systems Inc. for $205.2 million.

Publicly traded FactSet in a press release said it had acquired the financial analytics provider from both the firm and "company insiders."

Bisam provides portfolio construction and analytics, market risk analysis, and GIPS (global investment performance standards) composites management and reporting services, according to a news release about the sale. The company, which is based in Paris and has more than 160 employees globally, serves clients that include asset managers and insurance firms, among others.

Bisam had more than $28 million in annual revenue as of Dec. 31, 2016, according to the release.

Aquiline became the majority shareholder in Bisam in July 2012, according to a news release issued at that time. The firm made its investment in the software company through its second fund, according to the firm's website. Aquiline Financial Services Fund II LP closed in 2012 and raised a little less than $750 million in total commitments, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.

Bisam in March 2016 announced it had acquired FinAnalytica, a provider of market risk, portfolio construction and investment decision analytics.

FactSet, which provides analytics, service, content and technology to investment professionals, noted that the acquisition would add complementary products to its existing products. The company borrowed $575 million under a new revolving credit facility to fund the transaction and repay existing debt, according to the news release.

New York-based Aquiline Capital Partners makes investments in companies in the financial-services sector, including financial technology, banking and credit, insurance and investment management and markets, according to its website.

Most recently, the firm sold its online insurance brokerage Simply Business to The Travelers Co. for an enterprise value of about $490, including the repayment of debt and other obligations at closing.

New Wave of Puerto Rico Bond Troubles Hits Mutual Funds; Oppenheimer, Franklin Templeton, others see market value plunge

Another downturn in Puerto Rico bonds is rippling through mutual funds on the mainland.

A new fiscal plan that leaves the troubled island commonwealth with less money to cover its debts pushed the value of certain bonds down as much as 9% last week through Thursday, according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data.

That means tens of millions of dollars in paper losses for U.S. mutual funds that are some of the largest holders of Puerto Rico's $70 billion in debt. That includes OppenheimerFunds, said a person familiar with the matter.

Oppenheimer and Franklin Templeton Investments are among more than 50 U.S. fund companies that own $14 billion in bonds issued by the commonwealth, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

The market value of that $14 billion has dropped to $8 billion as Puerto Rico's financial condition worsened over time, according to the most recent information available from Morningstar.

The lower value doesn't necessarily equate to $6 billion in losses because the funds could have purchased the bonds at any time over the past several years as the value dropped. The date of the mutual funds' bond purchases aren't public.

Oppenheimer's $6.6 billion investment now has a market value of $3.5 billion, according to Morningstar. Franklin Templeton's $2.7 billion holding has a value of $1.4 billion, according to Morningstar. About 7% of Franklin's debt is insured, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello had initially proposed earmarking about $1.2 billion a year for debt repayment over the next decade. But the fiscal control board that Congress created to oversee a debt restructuring required him to revise his economic forecasts downward. That left about $800 million for annual debt service.

The move affected various Puerto Rico bonds in different ways. One considered a benchmark a $3.5 billion general- obligation bond maturing in 2035 fell about 9% for the week through Thursday, according to trading data from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's Electronic Municipal Market Access website. That is a big move in the normally sleepy municipal-bond world. The bond price, which had been climbing since Mr. Rossello took office in January, is now a few cents above its one-year low.

Paper losses on that bond for mutual funds were about $10 million, based on trading data. Mutual-fund holdings of that particular bond could have sold for about $98 million as of Thursday, compared with $108 million at the end of the prior week, based on trading data Thursday tracked by MSRB.

Other commonwealth bonds also dropped in value during that period. Prices on four sales-tax bonds and two other general-obligation bonds fell between 2% and 10%, according to an analysis by ICE Data Services. Those bond groups together make up much of U.S. mutual funds' holdings.

More declines are likely, said Matt Fabian, a partner with the research firm Municipal Market Analytics. "Even if the fiscal plan is the start of a negotiating process, bondholder losses are probably larger than current market prices imply," Mr. Fabian said.

One big U.S. mutual fund company isn't worried: MFS Investment Management's Puerto Rico bonds have a market value of $508 million, according to Morningstar, but the mutual fund said the "vast majority" is insured, making it far less vulnerable to changes in the island's financial condition.

A total of about $12 billion of the island's outstanding debt is insured, according to filings by the island's five biggest bond insurers

"Our direct exposure to the credit of Puerto Rico is limited," a MFS spokesman said.

Credit Markets
Funds Feel Puerto Rico Pain --- Market value of the island's bonds plunges for Oppenheimer, Franklin, other holders

Another downturn in Puerto Rico bonds is rippling through mutual funds on the mainland.

A new fiscal plan that leaves the troubled island commonwealth with less money to cover its debts pushed the value of certain bonds down as much as 9% last week through Thursday, according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data.

That means tens of millions of dollars in paper losses for U.S. mutual funds that are some of the largest holders of Puerto Rico's $70 billion in debt. That includes OppenheimerFunds, said a person familiar with the matter.

Oppenheimer and Franklin Templeton Investments are among more than 50 U.S. fund companies that own $14 billion in bonds issued by the commonwealth, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

The market value of that $14 billion has dropped to $8 billion as Puerto Rico's financial condition worsened over time, according to the most recent information available from Morningstar.

The lower value doesn't necessarily equate to $6 billion in losses because the funds could have purchased the bonds at any time over the past several years as the value dropped. The date of the mutual funds' bond purchases aren't public.

Oppenheimer's $6.6 billion investment now has a market value of $3.5 billion, according to Morningstar. Franklin Templeton's $2.7 billion holding has a value of $1.4 billion, according to Morningstar. About 7% of Franklin's debt is insured, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello had initially proposed earmarking about $1.2 billion a year for debt repayment over the next decade. But the fiscal control board that Congress created to oversee a debt restructuring required him to revise his economic forecasts downward. That left about $800 million for annual debt service.

The move affected various Puerto Rico bonds in different ways. One considered a benchmark -- a $3.5 billion general-obligation bond maturing in 2035 -- fell about 9% for the week through Thursday, according to trading data from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's Electronic Municipal Market Access website. That is a big move in the normally sleepy municipal-bond world. The bond price, which had been climbing since Mr. Rossello took office in January, is now a few cents above its one-year low.

Paper losses on that bond for mutual funds were about $10 million, based on trading data. Mutual-fund holdings of that particular bond could have sold for about $98 million as of Thursday, compared with $108 million at the end of the prior week, based on trading data Thursday tracked by MSRB.

Other commonwealth bonds also dropped in value during that period. Prices on four sales-tax bonds and two other general-obligation bonds fell between 2% and 10%, according to an analysis by ICE Data Services. Those bond groups together make up much of U.S. mutual funds' holdings.

More declines are likely, said Matt Fabian, a partner with the research firm Municipal Market Analytics. "Even if the fiscal plan is the start of a negotiating process, bondholder losses are probably larger than current market prices imply," Mr. Fabian said.

MoneyBeat: This Short Paid Off Big

William Ackman may be nursing losses over his investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., but short sellers who bet against the company's stock are riding high.

They are up $2.8 billion since the stock peaked in August 2015, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. Shares have cratered by 96% to near $11 last week from their record of $262.52 about 19 months earlier.

Mr. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management LP sold its 8% stake in the company, taking a loss of about $4 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. It capped a turbulent ride for the investment, which Mr. Ackman once compared with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. He predicted the shares could climb to $330.

Valeant had been a hedge-fund darling known for buying up smaller rivals, slashing research-and-development costs and increasing drug prices. But soon after hitting their all-time high in August 2015, Valeant's shares began to slide. Drug pricing drew scrutiny from politicians and questions began to mount about its accounting and business practices.

A spokesman for Pershing Square declined to comment beyond a press release on its share sale. A spokeswoman for Valeant declined to comment.

Those who bet against Valeant -- and against Mr. Ackman -- made a hefty profit each year since the hedge-fund manager began amassing his shares in 2015. Their total returns have amounted to 343% after the cost of financing short positions, according to S3 Partners.

Short sellers typically bet against a stock by borrowing shares from a securities lender and selling them. They then look to buy back shares at a lower price and return them to the lender, hoping to profit on the difference.

If the share price drops off dramatically, as happened with Valeant, short sellers can profit handsomely.

CFTC Chief Gets Ovation, but Warns on Enforcement

BOCA RATON, Fla. It's rare that a Washington policy maker receives a standing ovation at the conclusion of a "http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagiancarlo-20" to bankers and traders outlining how he plans to regulate them. But that's what happened here earlier this week after J. Christopher Giancarlo wrapped up remarks laying out his approach to oversight, hours after President Donald Trump "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-nominates-j-christopher-giancarlo-as-cftc-chairman-1489538771" to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Mr. Giancarlo, currently the CFTC's acting chief, has long argued that the top U.S. regulator of swaps interpreted the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law too broadly, unduly restricting how financial firms execute trades in the multitrillion-dollar swaps markets. The vision he outlined in the speech fleshes out a few more details of his likely approach. It involves a review of the agency's rules dubbed Project KISS, for "Keep It Simple, Stupid" that could lead to easing some of them, an overhaul of the CFTC's surveillance of markets and using his clout on a panel of financial regulators to push for a revision of bank capital requirements. He also called on the agency to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fintech-firms-get-chance-to-apply-for-banking-license-1489599873".

"The overly prescriptive regulation of American derivative markets is a part and parcel of the overregulation of the U.S. economy that thwarts revival of American prosperity," Mr. Giancarlo said in the speech at the annual Futures Industry Association conference. The remarks echoed ones made by President Donald, who has repeatedly assailed what he sees as regulatory overreach during the Obama administration.

Swaps are contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in interest rates or other benchmarks.

Mr. Giancarlo's approach reflects a sea change for the swaps industry, which was targeted by U.S. lawmakers for greater oversight and transparency after the instruments played a central role in the financial crisis. As CFTC chief, he is expected to take a more accommodating approach to Wall Street than either of his immediate predecessors, Timothy Massad or Gary Gensler, the latter of whom was known for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304906704579113472232135630" to oversee derivatives markets over the objections of Wall Street.

For his part, Mr. Giancarlo joked about a smooth transition during his speech: "One 50-ish bald guy had replaced two 50-ish bald guys."

And while industry executives described a sense of relief at the new CFTC chief's expected lighter regulatory touch, Mr. Giancarlo's remarks did come with a notable caveat: He promised not to let up on the agency's policing of the vast markets it oversees, pledging "aggressive and assertive" enforcement against market manipulators and others who commit wrongdoing.

In a sign of his seriousness, he said he would move a team of surveillance experts, charged with monitoring for market signs of manipulation or fraud, into the agency's enforcement division. That could help the regulator better identify wrongdoing, he said.

"Let me take this moment to warn those who may seek to cheat or manipulate our markets: You will face aggressive and assertive enforcement action by the CFTC under the Trump administration," he said.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Fed Signals Easier Review Process for Smaller Bank Mergers

By Liz Hoffman and Ryan Tracy

The Federal Reserve is making bank mergers a little easier.

In approving the tie-up of two mid-Atlantic banks Thursday, the Federal Reserve made it easier for smaller bank mergers to be approved without a rigorous analysis of whether the resulting firms would pose a threat to the stability of the financial system.

The change is unlikely to unleash a flood of bank deals. But it comes amid efforts to make life simpler for smaller banks, and as the Trump administration is weighing a host of regulatory rollbacks in the financial sector.

The ruling was buried in a document otherwise unlikely to attract much attention: the approval of the merger of People's United Financial Inc. and Suffolk Bancorp. Under the old regime, it would have required a full analysis of whether the resulting bank with about $40 billion in assets and 400 branches across New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts would have posed a threat to the entire U.S. financial system.

But the Fed approved the deal without doing the analysis, saying that its "experience has shown that proposals involving an acquisition of less than $10 billion in assets, or that result in a firm with less than $100 billion in total assets, are generally not likely to create institutions that pose systemic risks."

Previously those thresholds were $2 billion and $25 billion. The new limits free up the two dozen U.S. banks with assets between $25 billion and $100 billion to do bigger acquisitions without going through the rigorous Fed "systemic risk" analysis. They also make the roughly 1,700 U.S. banks with less than $10 billion in assets more attractive targets.

The change is narrow, but notable because it suggests the Federal Reserve is more open to approving mergers of small and midsize banks. That fits with the broader trend over the past few years likely to accelerate under President Donald Trump of officials looking for ways to ease the regulatory burden on those banks, many of which were swept up in the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul meant to rein in the largest Wall Street firms.

The order "represents some regulatory loosening of the scrutiny applied in the post-Dodd-Frank world," said Keith Noreika, a Washington-based lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, which advised People's United on the deal.

Recently, the Fed changed the rules to its annual "stress tests" to make them easier for banks with less than $250 billion in assets. Some in Washington are pushing to raise the threshold for a bank to be deemed "systemically important" to $250 billion in assets from $50 billion, and Mr. Noreika said Thursday's move would likely encourage those efforts.

Banks considered "systemically important" are subject to stricter oversight because their failure is seen as a potential risk to the entire system.

The current cutoff of $50 billion is written into law and can only be changed by Congress.

Regulation, among other factors, has contributed to the dwindling of bank mergers in recent years. There were 229 such deals last year, according to Dealogic, the lowest tally since the company began tracking the figures in 1995. Bank executives have complained that the inability to merge has made it harder to cut costs and provide services at scale.

For the largest Wall Street firms, acquisitions are likely to remain a nonstarter in Washington. But there are more than 5,400 community banks in the U.S., many with just a few billion dollars in assets. They have been hurt by low interest rates and flagging demand for loans, and could find savings and customers by joining forces.

Deals still could get close scrutiny if the Fed has other concerns, such as worries about the new firm's management or about compliance with regulations such as the Community Reinvestment Act. The Fed also generally conducts more extensive reviews of deals that receive adverse comments from the public.

WSJ Pro: Trump Budget Calls for Cutting Flood-Insurance Funds

By Rachel Witkowski

WASHINGTON President Donald Trump's proposed budget calls for cutting some government funding for the National Flood Insurance Program, specifically the section that maps flood zones.

The blueprint released Thursday cuts $190 million from the map program, which received government funding of $278.6 million in fiscal year 2016 and also draws from payments made by consumers for flood insurance. The White House said the change would "ensure that the cost of government services is not subsidized by taxpayers who do not directly benefit from those programs."

The proposed budget calls for cutting discretionary spending across various programs and agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard. Mr. Trump's plan calls for beefing up the budgets of the Pentagon budget and the Department of Homeland Security, which will get funding to build the southern border wall and ramp up immigration enforcement. The National Flood Insurance Program is also funded through the Homeland Security Department.

Mr. Trump's plan is a blow for the program, which already faces significant challenges. Congress has been grappling with what to do about the program's $24.6 billion debt to the Treasury Department, worsened by storms such as Hurricane Katrina and superstorm Sandy. Some lawmakers and industry proponents worry that cutting funding would exacerbate the program's debt woes, especially in the event of another catastrophic storm.

Meanwhile, the flood maps are widely seen as outdated and the entire program is set to expire Sept. 30.

The mapping process "is designed to reduce the future supplemental appropriations when we have the next disaster, and with global warming there will be more weather disasters and flood disasters," Rep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.) said at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Thursday. "An effective flood insurance program &starts with mapping."

The funding being targeted helps the program draw flood maps nationwide and is a key part of how it assesses premiums on the more than 5 million properties it insures. Private insurers, mortgage lenders and the real-estate market also rely heavily on those maps to price and process transactions. And any government-backed mortgage requires the property to have flood insurance if it is in a flood zone as determined by the program.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns about the program using outdated maps. The program's administrator is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which falls under the Homeland Security Department.

"Communities are frustrated by the accuracy of FEMA's flood maps and the amount of time it takes for maps to be approved," said Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.) at a March 9 hearing.

Mr. Trump's proposal to remove funding from the mapping part of the program could hurt congressional efforts to improve the maps, some argue.

"We learned today that the president zeroed out in his budget discretionary appropriations, or NFIP's mapping and mitigation activities. &We think that it would be devastating," said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D., Mo.) at Thursday's hearing.

Congress is considering legislation that would force FEMA to upgrade its mapping technology. But updating the technology is difficult when the program is already running at a deficit and drained all its reserve funds by the end of 2016. A FEMA official recently told House Financial Services Committee members it is unlikely the program could pay off its debt at this point, even if Congress mandated rate increases on property owners that were more in line with the risks assessed through the flood maps.

"To pay off the debt seems impractical to me," said Roy Wright, an insurance and mitigation administrator at FEMA, during the March 9 hearing. "The idea that we would then go to future policyholders and say they have to pay for that debt, I think, becomes a difficult mountain to climb."

The Banker-Turned-Seminarian Trying to Save Citigroup's Soul

By Christina Rexrode

Can a big bank have a conscience? Citigroup hired one.

David Miller is an on-call ethicist the bank consults on weighty questions of right and wrong, supplementing its armies of lawyers and compliance officers. A Princeton University professor by day, Dr. Miller has worked with Citigroup intermittently for the last three years to tackle abstract issues about banking and morality.

Those are squishy topics for Wall Street, where aggression is a virtue and making money a necessity. Dr. Miller, who spent years in banking before going to seminary, acknowledges the dichotomy and the ribbing from friends and colleagues who thought he had sold his soul when he agreed to work with Citigroup.

"You need banking, just like you need pharmaceuticals," says the 60-year-old New Jersey native. "And pharma can save lives, or it can kill and cause addictions."

If the topic is philosophical, the stakes aren't. As Citigroup's president James Forese pointed out in a 2015 industry conference, the bank made $1 million in revenue from dubious foreign-exchange trading and paid roughly $2.5 billion in penalties.

Dr. Miller's role at Citigroup is strategic. He doesn't walk the trading floor, hold office hours at call centers or even have an office. Instead he reviews projects, ideas and locations where top executives have concerns.

The bank describes his role as providing "advice and input to senior management." His conversations with top executives like Chief Executive Michael Corbat filter through the organization.

At a meeting with managing directors, for example, Mr. Corbat raised an idea that came from Dr. Miller. In an uncertain situation, Mr. Corbat said, ask the four M's: What would your mother, your mentor, the media and if you're inclined your maker think?

Dr. Miller also tries to get the bank to look beyond programs such as whistleblower hotlines and compliance training to human impulses. The problem, he adds, isn't the bad apples. Rather, it is how easy it is for good employees to justify bad decisions when they face gray-zone questions.

Citigroup, with a reputation for ethical problems before and after the financial crisis, brought on Dr. Miller at the behest of Mr. Corbat. The CEO was surprised when employee surveys found some workers weren't comfortable escalating concerns about possible wrongdoing.

Mr. Corbat was also motivated by the banking industry's image problem. "If you look today at what the poll numbers say, what the general population says, there is distrust of banks," Mr. Corbat said in an interview.

Despite that, Dr. Miller believes banks can change. "To make the assumption that an organization cannot be more ethical than it was is to give up before you start," said the professor, who declined to say how much the bank pays him. "It is not naive. It is a realistic and necessary goal."

At Princeton, where Dr. Miller runs the university's Faith & Work Initiative, he works from a cramped room piled with books by John Bogle and John Calvin, Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr. Posters advertise Q&As he conducted on the intersection of faith and work with Mr. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard Group, and former pay czar Ken Feinberg.

That wasn't always his career trajectory. As an undergraduate at Bucknell University, he studied business and helped run fraternity parties and a rock-concert committee. His career featured stints at IBM, State Street and what was then Midland Securities in London.

Dr. Miller's poise impressed colleagues at Midland, which in the early 1990s was struggling. "You walk into a room where you would think, 'Oh God, I can't deal with this guy, he's immaculate, he's tall, he looks like a movie star and had this 200-watt smile," said Richard Greensted, who worked with him at Midland. "But he was very, very good at putting people at ease."

Dr. Miller eventually fired Mr. Greensted, who wasn't a good fit for the bank, according to Mr. Greensted and confirmed by Dr. Miller. The two remain friends and are still in touch.

While in London, Dr. Miller's wife, Karen, left her job as an attorney at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP to teach law and ethics at Notre Dame law school's London campus. Soon Dr. Miller felt a similar tugging.

When he penned a letter to announce he was going to study theology at Princeton, he was embarrassed to use the word "calling."

"I never thought of Dave as a scholar," said Patty Hurley, a longtime friend. "He was a sales guy, he was a people person. And then he was learning Greek and Hebrew and he loved it."

Dr. Miller assumed he would return to finance, but ended up pursuing a doctorate in ethics. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he spent nine months working overnight shifts at ground zero as a volunteer chaplain.

During his doctoral studies, Dr. Miller also began advising senior executives. While he has worked with different companies, Citigroup posed unusual challenges including operations in nearly 100 countries where local customs produce varying standards of right and wrong.

Last month, Citigroup confirmed that it, along with other banks, is being investigated over whether it improperly hired the adult children of foreign officials in Asia where it can be a common practice, but can violate U.S. laws.

The bank has embraced Dr. Miller's idea of three lenses to apply in ethical decision-making, an approach influenced by Plato and Aristotle: Is it right, good and fitting? Citigroup executives composed their own three questions: Is it in our clients' interest, does it create economic value, and is it systemically responsible?

Citigroup is sharing the idea with employees and plans to work it into training manuals. It is also posting the questions at its offices around the world, including in big letters in the lobby of its Manhattan headquarters.

China Bitcoin Rules Would Require Exchanges to Verify Clients' Identity

By Chao Deng

BEIJING China's central bank is moving to regulate its domestic bitcoin industry, circulating new guidelines that, if enacted, would require exchanges to identify clients and adhere to banking regulations.

Recent scrutiny by the central bank has already led exchanges to impose trading fees and suspend withdrawals of bitcoin from their platforms. Chinese investors have fled the market.

A draft of the guidelines says Chinese bitcoin exchanges would be subject to current banking and anti-money-laundering laws, and required to collect information to verify the identity of their clients, according to people familiar with the matter. They say the rules, if implemented, would require exchanges to install systems for collecting and reporting suspicious trading activity to authorities. The People's Bank of China would be in charge of handling violations by the exchanges.

The people said officials could still revise the guidelines, which were given to exchanges in recent days.

The PBOC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move to regulate bitcoin exchanges brings assurance that authorities will tolerate some level of trading after months of uncertainty. The central bank opened up investigations in January at the country's three largest bitcoin exchanges, Huobi, OkCoin and BTCC, and delivered a terse warning last month that platforms risk being shut down if they skirt rules on money laundering and foreign exchange.

In the past 30 days, yuan-denominated bitcoin trades accounted for 17% of global volume, down from 97% in the past six months, according to data tracker Bitcoinity.

But regulation also means Chinese exchanges would face a tighter operating environment.

Since the scrutiny started, Huobi, OkCoin and BTCC have said they are working with authorities. An OkCoin spokeswoman said in an email on Friday that the firm continues to work with the PBOC and welcomes a balanced, risk-based regulatory framework.

Analysts say a major reason the central bank started probing the exchanges this year was concern that Chinese investors were using bitcoin to get money out of the country, albeit in small amounts. China has been struggling with a depreciating yuan and waning confidence in its economy. The bitcoin network flies under the radar of authorities, who have allowed holders to move bitcoin from an exchange based on the Chinese mainland to a foreign location.

When Chinese investors first snapped up bitcoin and drove up prices in 2013, the central bank banned banks and third-party payment platforms from engaging in the industry and defined bitcoin as a virtual good, not a financial asset. They stopped short of issuing direct regulations on bitcoin exchanges, which flourished in the following years.

Authorities continue to regard bitcoin as a virtual good, according to people familiar with the matter. The latest guidelines apply to any "trading platform for virtual internet goods," these people say.

EU's Antitrust Chief Sounds Alarm Over Risk of Automated Online Price Collusion

By Natalia Drozdiak

BRUSSELS The European Union's antitrust agency is closely scrutinizing whether algorithms make it easier for companies to collude over prices online and is considering stricter fines for cartels using those tools, the bloc's competition chief said Thursday.

At issue are programs companies use that continuously crawl the internet to check prices in online shops. That software allows the companies to monitor or adjust prices automatically, thereby potentially helping cartels operate more effectively.

"We need to keep an eye out for cartels that use software to work more effectively," EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a speech at an event hosted by Germany's Federal Cartel Office. "If those tools allow companies to enforce their cartels more strictly, we may need to reflect that in the fines that we impose."

In a joint report last year, the German and French competition authorities raised the issue of tacit or explicit collusion through transparency of online prices.

Ms. Vestager said the practice of using automated price systems was common. About two-thirds of retailers who track rivals' prices use automated systems, some of which also use the software to automatically adjust prices.

She referred to one example where two different companies sold posters of music artists such as Justin Bieber and agreed not to undercut each other's prices on Amazon.com Inc. by using pricing algorithms to ensure their prices were matched.

Still, she said, not all automated pricing systems are necessarily suspicious, such as algorithms to find the lowest prices for airfares.

Antitrust authorities in the U.S. and Britain have already investigated some automated pricing cases, such as the posters case. The EU, meanwhile, is looking at whether software has limited the ability of retailers to set their own prices for consumer electronics, in a recently announced e-commerce case, she said.

The EU watchdog said that while the previous antitrust cases dealt primarily with agreements put in place by people and implemented by computers, she said there was capacity for illegal collusion agreements to be struck directly between different companies' software.

"We need to make it very clear that companies can't escape responsibility for collusion by hiding behind a computer program," she said, adding that companies should build pricing algorithms in a way that doesn't allow them to collude with others.

U.K. Venture Capitalists Fear Funding Drought Post Brexit

By Julia-Ambra Verlaine

BRUSSELS Venture capitalists fear they may be one of the financial sector's big losers from Brexit.

London is Europe's venture capital center but the funds backing the bloc's fintech and startup culture could lose billions of euros of funding once the U.K. officially leaves the European Union.

A main source of cash for VC funds in London comes from the European Investment Fund, an institution mainly backed by the EU that pumps money into venture capital funds and small nascent businesses.

The EIF has guaranteed a steady stream of funding over the past two decades to VC firms, 20% of which are based in the U.K.

According to Invest Europe, a lobby group representing venture capital and private-equity funds, the EIF committed  10.9 billion ($11.7 billion) to venture capital and small private-equity funds between 2012 and 2016. Of that amount,  2.8 billion, or nearly one quarter, went to the U.K. directly.

Venture capital is an important source of funding for startup and growing technology companies, many with high potential but facing higher risks with untested business ideas.

Unlike in the U.S., where the Harvard University endowment alone totals $35.7 billion and there are dozens of other endowments over $1 billion, Europe lacks the large-scale university endowments that invest in venture capital. Cambridge University's endowment, the largest in Europe, amounts to nearly 6 billion ($7.3 billion).

"European endowments and pension funds allocate assets to venture capital, but it is mostly narrowed to the largest two or three funds" said Christian Hernandez, a partner at venture-capital firm White Star Capital. "The role of the EIF has therefore been critical to fill this gap."

In 2015, the EIF provided U.K. startups with  655.8 million, which it estimated would generate an additional  2.87 billion in capital from other sources. At that point, it had supported 144 U.K. private-equity and venture funds and almost 30,000 small businesses, according to the EIF.

Such funding could disappear when the U.K. leaves the EU unless the U.K. strikes a special deal giving it access to EIF funds.

The loss of EIF cash would inflict pain on venture capital funds given the percentage of commitments to British-domiciled funds from the EIF, Mr. Hernandez said in an interview.

At the moment there is no clear guidance on what might replace EIF cash.

"The prospect of the U.K. no longer having those funds to invest creates a high level of uncertainty for the U.K. tech community," said Romilly Dennys, executive director of the Coalition for a Digital Economy, a lobby for U.K. digital and tech startups.

The lobbying group is pushing the U.K. government to seek continued collaboration with the EIF and advocates that the commercial arm of the state-owned British Business Bank becomes a stand-alone institution with expanded funding before Brexit.

But the British Business Bank is currently less equipped than its EU counterpart. EIF has a staff of 369 compared with 10 in the commercial arm of the British Business Bank, the U.K. lobbying group said.

Like other financial firms, venture capital managers in London are assessing the consequences of the U.K. leaving the single market, said Invest Europe Chief Executive Michael Collins. "For some, this may comprise relocating to Europe's other VC capitals, including Berlin and Helsinki, to ensure they will still have access to the money."

Mr. Collins said that while London's scale, combined with deep pools of talent and capital, isn't easy to replicate, there are other cities with thriving startup scenes that are attractive to venture capital funds.

Berlin, for example, is strong in digital media, Helsinki in mobile gaming and Paris in e-commerce. The Association for Financial Markets in Europe, which represents firms in wholesale financial markets, said in a March report that the EU VC industry is concentrated around 10 members of the bloc.

Moreover, most VC firms employ small numbers compared with banks and aren't trapped in long-term leases, making staff moves less onerous.

White Star Capital, which invests in the tech industry, for instance, is based out of London's "Second Home," a workspace in London's hip Brick Lane neighborhood that boasts original Bauhaus furniture and weekly yoga classes.

While the loss of EIF funding could lead to a stronger VC presence in Paris, Berlin, and the Nordics, Mr. Hernandez said tax incentives and a tech ecosystem boosted by a handful of universities focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning give the U.K.'s VC scene an advantage.

"While I believe the uncertainty of Brexit might slow it down and allow others to benefit," said Mr. Hernandez, "I am hopeful that the government will realize the asset the digital economy has been thus far and continue to invest in incentives that support funding."

Lloyd Blankfein Defends Goldman Sachs From  Government Sachs' Label

By Liz Hoffman

Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein defended the pipeline of alumni moving into top roles in Washington, a funnel that has been a spark for populist criticism at both the bank and the Trump administration.

His former deputy, Gary Cohn, is now the National Economic Director. Other Goldmanites in the administration include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a f0rmer mortgage-trading executive; Jim Donovan, a private banker tapped for the No. 2 spot at Treasury; and Dina Powell, who oversaw Goldman's philanthropic efforts and will be a national security adviser.

Mr. Blankfein said Goldman doesn't get special favors from alumni who land in seats of power. They "bend over backward to avoid any perception of favoritism," he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.

Goldman has long encouraged alumni toward public service. Mr. Blankfein is fond of telling how, as a young trader, a mentor told him that a Goldman employee's obituary shouldn't have more than a few paragraphs about his or her time at the firm.

"Gary was not the first person from Goldman Sachs to join the government, and we hope and expect that he will not be the last," Mr. Blankfein wrote in the letter. "Five of my most recent predecessors went into government service, and that has not been by happenstance."

Sidney Weinberg, who ran Goldman from 1930 to 1969, was a confidante of President Johnson and helped shape his cabinet. A successor, John Whitehead, became deputy secretary of state under Reagan. Hank Paulson, who preceded Mr. Blankfein as CEO, was Treasury Secretary.

The firm's pipeline to Washington is helped by the fact that many Goldman employees have made enough by their late 40s to take a government wage.

Swift to Delist Four North Korean Banks Sanctioned by U.S.

By Katy Burne

Four North Korean banks that were still able to use the Swift money-transfer messaging system despite U.S. Treasury sanctions will be deactivated from the network in coming days, leaving none of the country's banks with access.

Swift spokeswoman Natasha de Teran told The Wall Street Journal in a statement Thursday that the four North Korean banks "will no longer have access to the Swift" service. She said that, "given the increased ongoing international attention" on Pyongyang, Brussels-based Swift had informed Belgian and European authorities of its decision to cut them off.

The Journal reported Tuesday that the latest sanctions squeeze on Pyongyang had failed to completely shut off the regime's access to the global banking system, as the four banks retained access to the Swift network as a potential gateway for moving money.

The four banks to be delisted are the state-owned Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's primary foreign-exchange bank; Kumgang Bank; Koryo Credit Development Bank; and North East Asia Bank.

The U.S. designated for sanctions the Foreign Trade Bank in 2013, saying it facilitated weapons of mass destruction programs in North Korea. The other three were sanctioned in December for supporting the North Korean government and its weapons programs following the Asian nation's September 2016 nuclear test.

Calls to the permanent mission of North Korea to the U.N. weren't returned, and attempts to reach the banks were unsuccessful.

Swift, formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, doesn't itself move money between customers and countries. It is a member-owned cooperative operating under European Union law that provides the messaging platform necessary for users to order payments to one another.

While regulated by Belgian authorities, the company intersects daily with U.S. financial institutions, processing tens of millions of payment instructions.

But Swift, because of its European base, has been more responsive to EU sanctions than U.S. ones, a U.S. Treasury official told the Journal this week. Companies in the EU, including Swift, are required by law to comply with U.N. sanctions.

Representatives for Belgium's Ministry of Finance didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A U.S. Treasury spokesman declined to comment on Swift's decision.

As a general rule, Swift doesn't block service to a customer or country, although its bylaws say that it reserves the right to terminate a user if it hurts the company's "reputation, brand or goodwill." Last year, it threatened to remove some users for material security breaches.

In the case of the four North Korean banks, Swift said it would delist them for noncompliance with its membership criteria, not any sanctions pressure. Swift wouldn't provide details on what it considered to be the banks' noncompliance.

In 2012, when Swift disconnected some Iranian banks for sanction purposes, it was because the EU had written a law prohibiting financial messaging to those firms. That move affected only the EU-sanctioned banks in Iran; other Iranian institutions remained.

Swift's decision to cut off the remaining North Korean banks followed its delisting of three others that fell under U.N. sanctions: Bank of East Land, Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking Corp. That decision came after a Feb. 27 report by a U.N. panel of experts called attention to the activity, and the Belgium Ministry of Finance rescinded the authorizations Swift used to service them.

Another four North Korean banks under U.N. sanctions previously volunteered to be removed from the Swift network: Amroggang Development Banking Corp., Daedong Credit Bank, Tanchon Commercial Bank and Korea United Development Bank.

"Swift seeks, and has always sought, to cooperate fully and transparently with its competent authorities," the financial messaging company said in a statement Tuesday.

Some in the U.S. Congress had been considering legislative options for cracking down on Swift for conducting business with North Korean firms. Last week, Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.) urged Swift to revoke all North Korean banking privileges.

In 2012, a legislative amendment was approved to provide the U.S. with authority to sanction Swift if it facilitates financial transactions with Iran.

New York Pension Fund Dismisses a Third Brokerage Amid Bribery Scandal

By Justin Baer

A New York state pension plan said it cut ties last week with Amherst Pierpont Securities, a brokerage that won nearly $2 billion in annual bond-trading business during the tenure of a portfolio manager now facing federal bribery charges.

The New York State Common Retirement Fund took the step, according to people familiar with the matter, because of concerns about a connection between a former Amherst salesman, Joseph Daher, and Navnoor Kang, the $186 billion retirement system's former manager who was indicted last December. Mr. Kang pleaded not guilty to the charges in federal district court in Manhattan. The state pension fund said it is reviewing his actions.

Messrs. Daher and Kang knew each other when both worked on the West Coast for other financial firms, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Daher helped Amherst apply for the New York pension fund business, one of the people said.

Amherst asked Mr. Daher to leave after he failed to cooperate with an internal review, and he resigned in late December, according to a January regulatory filing. It had initiated a review of Mr. Daher's "entertainment expenses and possible business-related gifts" after being contacted by regulators, the filing stated.

Mr. Daher, through his lawyer, declined to comment. Neither he nor Amherst have been accused of any wrongdoing. "Amherst is not the subject of any investigation related to this matter," said a spokesman for the privately held New York firm that specializes in debt securities and employs nearly 200 people.

U.S. prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Mr. Kang steered trading business to outside brokerages in exchange for weekend getaways, cocaine, prostitutes and other bribes. The government also charged two salespeople at other brokerages Gregg Schonhorn and Deborah Kelley with participating in the alleged scheme.

Ms. Kelley has pleaded not guilty to the prosecutors' charges; the trial is set to begin in December. Mr. Schonhorn pleaded guilty to charges including securities fraud and bank fraud and is cooperating with the government.

The firms that employed the two salespeople, FTN Financial and Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., no longer do business with the pension fund. The firms haven't been accused of wrongdoing.

Amherst, like FTN and Sterne Agee, was among the firms that benefited from an expansion of trading that Mr. Kang engineered after joining the New York pension fund in January 2014, according to its annual reports.

The New York pension fund became a more active bond trader to boost returns weighed down by ultra-low interest rates. As the fund traded more frequently, additional brokerage firms were needed because new regulations limited the amount of bond trades big banks were willing to handle, people familiar with the matter said.

In November 2014, Mr. Kang sent a memorandum to his chief investment officer recommending that Amherst, FTN and Sterne Agee be added to the pension fund's list of approved brokers, according to the SEC complaint and people familiar with the matter. Mr. Daher was a central figure in the new Amherst relationship.

As a regional bond salesman based in San Francisco, Mr. Daher cultivated relationships with money managers on the West Coast, people familiar with the matter said. In that role, he came to know Mr. Kang, who previously worked for Pacific Investment Management Co. and Guggenheim Partners.

In or around 2010, Mr. Daher introduced Mr. Kang to Mr. Schonhorn, according the SEC filing and people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Daher had worked with Mr. Schonhorn at Bonds Direct Securities and Jefferies LLC, according to regulatory filings.

Amherst was formed from the October 2014 merger of Amherst Securities Group LP and Pierpont Securities LLC, two brokers that wanted to create a bigger player in underwriting and trading mortgage-related securities. Pierpont announced Mr. Daher's hiring in a March 2014 press release. After the New York pension fund approved Amherst as a broker, the fund became Mr. Daher's client.

Amherst went from zero bond trades with the pension fund in fiscal 2014 to transactions valued at $1.88 billion two years later, the fund reports show.

A 2016 inquiry from the SEC prompted Amherst to begin an internal review of Mr. Daher last October, according to people familiar with the matter and a filing Amherst submitted to the Central Registration Depository, a nonprofit regulatory database of individuals in the securities industry.

"After contacts by regulators, the firm began a review of the representative's business-entertainment expenses and possible business-related gifts," according to the filing. "The representative did not inform the firm of contacts with him by regulators and declined to respond to the firm's requests for related information."

Amherst asked Mr. Daher to resign days after Mr. Kang's December indictment, according to the filing. Last week, New York pension officials directed their investment staff to cease trading with Amherst.

Defending  Government Sachs'

Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein defended the pipeline of alumni into top DC roles in his annual shareholder letter today. His former deputy, Gary Cohn, is President Trump's National Economic Director, and other Goldmanites in the administration include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Treasury #2 Jim Donovan and Dina Powell, a national security adviser. "Gary was not the first person from Goldman Sachs to join the government, and we hope and expect that he will not be the last," Blankfein wrote. "Five of my most recent predecessors went into government service, and that has not been by happenstance." Goldman has long encouraged alumni toward public service -- a push helped by the fact that for much of its history, its bankers and traders had made enough to retire young.

Merrill to Act as Fiduciary to Institutional Retirement Plans

Bank of America's (BAC) Merrill Lynch business told brokers Wednesday the firm will soon act as a fiduciary with all of its institutional retirement plan clients, including 401(k) plans and other institutional retirement accounts. The move follows Merrill's decision to work with most of its retail retirement clients in fee-based accounts, where brokers are held to a fiduciary standard. The move to shift institutional retirement accounts to a fiduciary relationship will include brokers obtaining certain designations or choosing to partner with other employees who already have the appropriate credentials to work with such clients. Merrill hasn't announced a timeline for when it will shift all of its institutional retirement clients to a fiduciary relationship. (michael.wursthorn@wsj.com; @4BetterOrWurst)

Banks Send Letter to Congress Urging Durbin Repeal

Nearly 800 banks signed a letter that was sent to the House of Representatives urging the repeal of the Durbin amendment, a piece of the Dodd-Frank Act that capped the fees merchants pay to banks when consumers use their debit cards to make purchases. The amendment, which has been in effect since 2011, has once again become a hot topic on Capitol Hill as banks, credit unions and the big card networks Visa and Mastercard are pushing for a repeal, while retailers are urging congressmen to maintain the status quo. The letter sent today was signed by banks of all sizes, including JPMorgan Chase and US Bank, as well as 49 state bankers associations. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com)

Deposit Insurance Erodes Market Discipline

Government-backed deposit insurance increases moral hazard and promotes financial risk, weakening the banking system in the process, writes Mark Calabria "http://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/report/deposit-insurance-bank-resolution-and-market-discipline". Mr. Calabria, who recently became Vice President Mike Pence's chief economist, writes that government deposit insurance shifts investment away from equity markets and toward bank-based finance. A shift from government insurance towards private deposit insurance or shareholder equity would increase customers' and capital suppliers' incentives to "care about the financial risks and health of banks, thus introducing market discipline into the system," he writes.

How to Reduce the Regulatory Reporting Burden

Improving the quality of financial data can help reduce the regulatory reporting burden, Richard Berner, director of the Office of Financial Research, "https://www.financialresearch.gov/public-appearances/2017/03/16/financial-data-summit/". "Government can reduce the cost and improve the quality of data significantly by adopting common data standards," he said. To do so, Mr. Berner recommends "promoting the use of data standards, identifying duplication and overlaps in financial data, and enforcing best practices in data collection." Inefficiencies in the fragmented financial regulatory structure and the "shortage of collaboration" on data sharing between regulators are also major areas for improvement, he said.

U.K. Venture Capitalists Fear Funding Drought Post Brexit; Funds backing fintech and startups could lose billions in financing

Cooper's Take: Making an Orderly Exit; Study finds many firms reactive in making exits and that data and tax planning could lead to a more orderly departure

For private-equity players planning an exit, better data and tax planning could help create a smoother exit process and maximize returns, according to EY's Private Equity Global Divestment Study 2017.

Bill Stoffel, the EY US Private Equity leader, said his firm has seen more work assisting private-equity firms with selling their businesses, a change from five years ago when they had only a few of these projects.

The Private Equity Global Divestment Study found 56% of those surveyed including private-equity executives across the Americas, Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East and Africa said they sometimes have an exit plan, while 30% said they never use them.

The study found many private-equity firms leave exit strategies to deal teams rather than to internal committees focused on planning for exits. Many private-equity firms are often reactive often responding to inbound interest in their portfolio companies and as a result, some value may be left on the table through a "poorly timed" exit.

According to the study, 86% of the respondents said they don't have a systematic playbook for an exit, while 47% of respondents said their firm's last exit was "too early or too late, and value was sacrificed as a result."

Although there has been much uncertainty surrounding the Donald Trump administration, many in the financial community believe he has improved the climate for doing business. Mr. Stoffel said the past few years have seen a consistent volume of exit activity and that "from an overall perspective, people are bullish on what [a Trump presidency] could mean for business."

Mr. Stoffel said private-equity players could benefit from using the data it receives from portfolio companies including customer volume and other internal data to support the growth story of a company that is on the way out. Predictive analytics, Mr. Stoffel said, is something that could benefit sellers because it often takes a while for data to play out in real time. The challenge, he said, is dealing with poor quality data that can be transferred from portfolio companies to private-equity firms.

In addition to predictive data, Mr. Stoffel said tax planning for an exit is crucial to a well-executed exit.

"There's real tax planning that has to go on to maximize an exit," he said. "It's really understanding your potential buyers and what attributes they would pay up for."

China's Regulators Struggle With Risky Investment Products

China's financial regulators are trying to put their heads together in dealing with a booming asset-management sector. They have a long way to go.

Investment products have run amok here, coming from banks, securities companies, trust firms, insurers and their subsidiaries. The value of country's asset-management sector totaled around 60 trillion yuan ($8.7 trillion at current exchange rates) as of June 2016, approaching the previous year's gross-domestic-product level, according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The tally nets out overcounting due to funds investing in other funds.

Much of the risk can be found at banks, which hold trillions of U.S. dollars' worth of investment products off their balance sheets products that fly under the regulatory radar. Wealth-management products from banks made up more than 40% of total assets under management by asset managers, followed by products from trust firms and mutual funds, according to the securities regulator. The products fall under the scope of a different financial regulator depending on the issuer.

China's central bank and the securities, banking and insurance regulators have drafted a set of rules for asset managers, aimed at streamlining oversight. If the plan is implemented, fund managers would have to set aside reserves, cap leverage in their products and rein in the risk of assets they invest in; they wouldn't be able to guarantee returns. The draft still needs to be approved by the State Council, China's cabinet.

But already, there's a good dose of skepticism about its implementation, as well as how effective the rules would be.

"History shows that Chinese financial institutions are extremely innovative," said Chen Long, an economist with research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. "I would not exclude the possibility that they would come up with something more innovative that dodges regulations."

Last year, China's top leaders "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-takes-aim-at-regulatory-overhaul-1468507534" to address regulatory loopholes that allowed the rise of risky investment products. There was talk of putting the People's Bank of China in charge of the other financial regulators but nothing has materialized since. The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-shakes-up-top-economic-team-ahead-of-major-power-shuffle-1487840024" to head the China Banking Regulatory Commission has fueled expectations that China might merge its banking and insurance regulators, handing more power to Mr. Guo. At his first press conference as head banking regulator earlier this month, however, Mr. Guo played down that possibility, calling it a rumor.

Most analysts aren't hopeful that Chinese leaders will make a decision soon on how to proceed. President Xi Jinping transitions to a second term this fall, making it possible that any regulatory overhaul would drag out to next year, some say.

Without greater collaboration between regulators, financial risks from China's asset-management sector continue to loom large.

"It seems there are more signs of coordination over the past six months," Mr. Chen said. "But when a merger is going to happen is anyone's guess."

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

BOE Deputy Governor Hogg Resigns After Critical Report

By Jason Douglas

LONDON A senior Bank of England official resigned after a panel of lawmakers said her failure to disclose a potential conflict of interest meant she lacked the professional competence to do her job.

Charlotte Hogg, who was appointed chief operating officer at the BOE in 2013 before being named deputy governor for markets and banking in February, quit on Monday, the BOE said Tuesday.

Her resignation came after parliament's treasury committee said Ms. Hogg's failure to disclose that her brother worked in a senior role at U.K. lender Barclays PLC during almost four years at the bank represented "a serious error of judgment."

"The committee considers that her professional competence falls short of the very high standards required to fulfill the additional responsibilities of deputy governor for markets and banking," the panel said in a report into her appointment as deputy governor made public Tuesday.

The resignation of a senior official after such unusually harsh criticism is unprecedented. The panel said the episode raises wider concerns over the governance of the 322-year-old central bank, which faces multiple policy challenges as the U.K. heads toward its departure from the European Union.

Prime Minister Theresa May won parliamentary votes Monday that clear the way for her to begin two-year exit talks before the end of March.

For Ms. Hogg, her resignation marks a low point in a long and successful career in finance that took her from the BOE to senior positions at banks including the U.K. unit of Banco Santander SA before her return to the central bank almost four years ago alongside Mark Carney, the institution's Canadian governor.

Mr. Carney handpicked Ms. Hogg to handle the day-to-day management of the central bank to leave him and other top officials to focus on policy. In a statement, Mr. Carney said he deeply regrets Ms. Hogg's resignation but respects her decision, which he said was taken with the best interests of the BOE in mind. "The Bank of England today is stronger, more diverse, secure and effective in large part because of Charlotte Hogg," he said.

In its report, parliament's treasury committee said Ms. Hogg's failure to disclose that her brother was director of group strategy at Barclays breached the BOE's code of conduct for senior staff guidelines that Ms. Hogg had herself helped draft.

It dismissed Ms. Hogg's assertion, given in written evidence to the committee this month, that as chief operating officer a potential conflict of interest never arose with regards to her brother's work. "The committee considers that such a potential, actual or perceived conflict could well arise," it said, given that Ms. Hogg served on the BOE's board of directors, known as its court.

The BOE is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady Thursday following officials' March policy meeting.

Thomas Vartanian in Running to Be Fed Vice Chair for Supervision

By Kate Davidson and Nick Timiraos

A lawyer who has represented shareholders and financial firms in lawsuits against the government is under consideration for a top financial regulatory post at the Federal Reserve, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Thomas Vartanian, a partner in the law firm Dechert LLP, is on the shortlist to become the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, the people said.

Mr. Vartanian couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The position was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to oversee the largest U.S. banks, but President Barack Obama never nominated anyone to the job. Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, who has served as the de facto vice chairman for supervision, will step down in April, leaving three vacancies on the Fed board.

Officials in the Trump administration have said filling the vice chairman's job is a priority and have broadened their search for the job in recent weeks. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.

A leading contender for the position, GE Capital executive David Nason, took himself out of the running earlier this month.

Mr. Vartanian has worked as a financial regulatory attorney in Washington for years, representing banks in complex financial transactions including failures, conservatorships and enforcement challenges. He filed a legal brief on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supporting MetLife Inc. in its legal battle over the decision by a council of regulators to subject the insurer to federal oversight.

Mr. Vartanian represented hedge-fund firm Paulson & Co. when it invested in the purchase of the failed thrift IndyMac Bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2009. Steven Mnuchin, who is now serving as Treasury secretary, oversaw the turnaround of IndyMac, later rebranded OneWest Bank. Mr. Vartanian also represented investors in the sale of BankUnited, which was purchased from the FDIC by a private equity group that included Wilbur Ross, who is now the commerce secretary.

Mr. Vartanian also served as general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and chief legal officer of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. during the Reagan administration, according to a bio on his firm's website. Before that, he served in the legal division of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another big bank regulator.

WSJ Pro: FDIC's Hoenig Details Idea for a New Glass-Steagall Law

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTON Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig proposed a plan Monday that would require banks to separate their commercial and investment activities and hold more capital in exchange for simplified regulatory requirements that could reduce compliance burdens.

In a speech at the Institute of International Bankers annual conference, Mr. Hoenig detailed a proposal for large bank holding companies to separately capitalize and manage their traditional commercial banking activities and their nontraditional activities, such as investment banking.

That aspect of Mr. Hoenig's proposal closely resembles the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that was repealed in 1999. Mr. Hoenig has long praised Glass-Steagall and has been a vocal proponent of breaking up big banks.

While on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump repeatedly called for a "21st century Glass-Steagall Act," an idea that White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated last week.

Mr. Hoenig has been under consideration for several top economic posts in the Trump administration, and he has reportedly expressed interest in a position like Federal Reserve vice chair of supervision or chairman of the FDIC. Nominations for these positions haven't been announced.

"Through the booming 20th century and during the era of Glass-Steagall, investment banks underwrote companies that helped to build the modern economy and became part of the national fabric," Mr. Hoenig said Monday. "These recommendations...will provide a more competitive playing field among and between commercial and investment banks."

As part of the separation, banks would "get relief from the Volcker rule" on speculative investments, Mr. Hoenig said. While banks would still be prohibited from engaging in proprietary trading, "the separately managed and capitalized affiliates would be able to do so with proper controls in place and assurances that the safety net was appropriately confined and risk adequately capitalized."

Parts of the proposal dovetail with similar regulatory-overhaul efforts on Capitol Hill. Mr. Hoenig proposes, as he has previously, a 10% capital threshold for banks while removing risk-based capital and liquidity requirements, which he has criticized as arbitrary and burdensome.

The same 10% level has also been proposed by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, who is expected to release broad regulatory overhaul legislation in the coming weeks.

Currently, U.S. banks are required to meet a 6% leverage ratio, higher than the 3% buffer required by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Basel Committee guidelines aren't binding and it is up to individual countries to set their own regulatory requirements.

Mr. Hoenig pointed to simpler requirements and higher capital threshold as a boon to regional and community banks. Most community banks already meet a 10% capital threshold.

Mr. Hensarling's legislation doesn't include the Glass-Steagall-like elements in Mr. Hoenig's proposal.

WSJ Pro: Don't Expect Total Repeal of Obama Financial Regulation, Top Lawyer Says

By Rachel Witkowski

WASHINGTON The Trump administration is likely to take a more limited approach to financial deregulation than what many in the industry were hoping for, a top Wall Street lawyer said Monday.

H. Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, told the Institute of International Bankers annual conference not to expect a total repeal of Obama-era regulations, playing down the bank-stock surge following President Donald Trump's election.

The new administration's "approach to deregulation won't be necessarily all inclusive or uniform and it's likely to focus on smaller and midsize banks," Mr. Cohen said. "Accordingly, I think the focus will be more on repealing or revising the existing regulations as opposed to shaping or blocking new regulations."

Mr. Cohen pointed to three pending regulations the Trump administration is likely to block entirely. One is the Labor Department's "fiduciary rule" restricting compensation for retirement advice, which President Trump delayed through an executive order in February. Other pending rules likely to be blocked are a regulatory proposal that restricts certain incentive-based compensation for financial-company executives and stricter liquidity requirements, known as the net stable funding ratio.

In terms of modifying existing rules, Mr. Cohen said revisions to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act could include relieving some of the regulatory requirements on banks' liquidity coverage, easing the capital requirements portion of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, and changing the Volcker rule banning certain types of bank trading and investing.

Some Republicans have called for modifying other areas of Dodd-Frank, including the "orderly liquidation authority" given to federal regulators to wind down a failed firm in an emergency situation. Mr. Cohen said the idea was troubling. A "repeal could increase the economies of exposure and the event of a future financial crisis &and encourage more stringent international regulation of the largest banks," he said.

If the GOP proposes legislative changes to Dodd-Frank that can garner some Democratic support, "there is a realistic prospect that we will have some banking legislation within the next 18 months," he said.

However, any change in the supervision of banks won't happen until Mr. Trump nominates and Congress confirms the appointees for top regulatory agencies such as the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry, speaking later Monday at the same conference, stressed the importance of maintaining heightened supervision.

"Some will suggest easing safeguards. A few will even suggest eliminating them," Mr. Curry said in prepared remarks. "We must not forget the lessons of the past crisis. There is exceptional value in strong supervision value that, regrettably, sometimes only becomes clear in its absence. We cannot let our guard down."

Mr. Cohen said there is a "sleeper, and potentially momentous, legislative proposal" hinted at in Mr. Trump's financial executive orders last month the idea of consolidating the three primary bank regulators: the Fed, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

At the very least, Mr. Cohen said he was pushing for the regulators to harmonize their approach to enforcing cybersecurity.

"Even if we can't get to consolidation generally, what we desperately need to do now is have consolidation of their cyber areas so that we have uniform cyber review of this exponential threat to the banking industry," he said.

Many regulators say they have significantly ramped up their cybersecurity supervision. Mr. Curry said the OCC has collaborated with international regulators to enhance systems for defending against cyberattacks, including launching a school for anti-money-laundering training with foreign supervisors.

"Succeeding in the fight against cyber risks requires international collaboration, and open communication across our borders, so that our defenses are equally strong," Mr. Curry said.

North Korean Banks Under U.S. Sanctions Remain on Swift Network

By Katy Burne

At least four North Korean banks under U.S. Treasury sanctions remain on the Swift money-transfer messaging network, even after the network deactivated a handful of the country's banks sanctioned by the United Nations the latest sign a squeeze on Pyongyang has failed to completely shut off the regime's access to the global banking system.

The U.S. Treasury-sanctioned banks that remain on Swift include the state-owned Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's primary foreign-exchange bank; Kumgang Bank; Koryo Credit Development Bank; and North East Asia Bank, according to people familiar with the network. A search on Swift's website listed active bank identifier codes for the institutions as of Monday.

The U.S. designated for sanctions the Foreign Trade Bank in 2013, saying it facilitated weapons of mass destruction programs in North Korea. The other three were sanctioned in December as the U.S. targeted entities it said supported the North Korean government and its weapons programs following the Asian nation's September 2016 nuclear test.

The apparent sanctions gap raises questions about how easily North Korea could move currency through alternative banking channels, something the U.N. said it has been known to do in the past through fronting companies.

Calls to the permanent mission of North Korea to the U.N. weren't returned, and attempts to reach the banks were unsuccessful.

Swift, formerly known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, doesn't itself move money between customers and countries. It is a member-owned cooperative operating under European Union law that provides the messaging platform necessary for users to order payments to one another.

While based in Brussels and regulated by Belgian authorities, the company intersects daily with U.S. financial institutions, processing tens of millions of payment instructions, including through a large facility in Culpeper County, Va.

But Swift, because of its European base, has been more responsive to EU sanctions than U.S. ones, a Treasury official said. Companies in the EU, including Swift, are required by law to comply with U.N. sanctions. But Swift would have to comply with U.S. law, including U.S. sanctions on North Korea, only where its activities fall under U.S. jurisdiction, the Treasury official said. Nothing in the U.S. sanctions regime prohibits Swift's activities when the company operates completely outside of the U.S.

If a European bank traded with a sanctioned North Korean bank using a U.S. intermediary or correspondent bank, the U.S. firm would have a legal obligation to block the flow of funds, the Treasury official said.

Swift said in a statement that "any decision to lift or impose sanctions on countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent government bodies and legislators." The company said it had a legal requirement to comply with EU regulations, being incorporated under Belgian law.

Swift's lead regulator, the National Bank of Belgium, said sanctions were within the remit of the Belgian government, not the central bank, and had no further comment regarding U.S.-sanctioned North Korean banks still using the network. Representatives for Belgium's Ministry of Finance didn't respond to requests for comment.

As a general rule, Swift doesn't block service to a customer or country, although its bylaws say that it reserves the right to terminate a user if it hurts the company's "reputation, brand or goodwill." Last year, it threatened to remove users for material security breaches.

In 2012, when Swift disconnected a group of Iranian banks for sanction purposes, it was because the EU wrote a law prohibiting financial messaging to those firms. Iran's Swift traffic was robust at the time, but activity from North Korea ranks among the lowest in the more than 220 countries on the network. Some said the impact of disconnections would become clearer in time.

"It may start to encourage these rogue regimes to figure out alternative ways to move money," said Leonard Schrank, who was chief executive of Swift for 15 years until 2007.

Swift had been servicing the U.N.-sanctioned banks because the Belgian government was providing authorizations for it to receive fees from those firms, as long as they met certain criteria and a transaction limit wasn't surpassed.

A Feb. 27 report by a U.N. panel of experts called attention to the activity. The Belgium Ministry of Finance rescinded the authorizations, and Swift said it promptly delisted three of the seven North Korean firms under U.N. sanctions: Bank of East Land, Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking Corp.

Another four North Korean banks previously volunteered to be removed from the Swift network: Amroggang Development Banking Corp., Daedong Credit Bank, Tanchon Commercial Bank and Korea United Development Bank.

"Swift seeks, and has always sought, to cooperate fully and transparently with its competent authorities," the financial messaging company said. "Swift neither receives fees from, nor makes payments to, designated entities in the absence of these authorizations."

The issue of the remaining banks on Swift that fall under U.S. sanctions could be resolved with diplomatic initiatives between the U.S. and the EU. But some in Congress are considering legislative options for cracking down on Swift for conducting business with North Korean firms. Last week, Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.) urged Swift to revoke all North Korean banking privileges.

In 2012, a legislative amendment was approved to provide the U.S. with authority to sanction Swift if it facilitates financial transactions with Iran.

Brian Kaveney, a spokesman for Rep. Ted Yoho (R., Fla.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, said his office was organizing a March 21 hearing where one component was expected to focus on Swift and its role in offering financial tools to North Korea.

J.P. Morgan Moves Ahead With Plan to Drop Commissions in IRAs

By Michael Wursthorn

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is moving ahead with its plan to drop commissions in retirement accounts that use a financial adviser, the latest brokerage to push forward with efforts to comply with an Obama-era retirement rule that is under review for repeal or revision.

The New York bank told some wealth-management customers with individual retirement accounts that as of April 7 their "financial adviser will no longer be able to provide investment guidance," according to a letter sent to clients and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Affected clients will be automatically moved to a self-directed retirement account on that date, the letter added.

About 5% of J.P. Morgan's $1.1 trillion in wealth-management assets are held in retirement accounts, and only those that are charged commissions are affected by the change, said a bank spokesman who also confirmed the letter.

J.P. Morgan said in its letter "it may not proceed with this transition" of accounts if the new regulation requiring brokers to act in the best interest of retirement savers isn't implemented as planned.

The regulation known as the fiduciary rule and expected to affect some $3 trillion of retirement assets in the U.S. has been thrown into limbo since the Labor Department proposed delaying its April 10 implementation date by 60 days. That proposal came after President Donald Trump signed an executive action in February ordering the Labor Department to conduct a comprehensive review of the rule and its effects.

Proponents of the rule sought to eliminate conflicts from investment advice that has been estimated to cost American families $17 billion a year and pushes down annual returns on retirement savings by a percentage point. Many financial-industry leaders have said those figures are inflated and have fought against the regulation, arguing that it would cut small retirement savers off from advice and would be a costly burden for brokerages to implement.

J.P. Morgan said in November that it would stop accepting commissions in retirement accounts in an effort to avoid the more-stringent compliance standards required under the rule. The bank said affected retirement clients in its Chase Wealth Management, Private Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities units would be steered toward accounts where they manage the investments themselves or accounts that charge fees based on a percentage of assets, which could be costlier for those who trade little.

Most of J.P. Morgan's clients in recent months were given the choice of moving to a fee-based account or a self-directed option, the bank's spokesman said. Those who elected to move to an account where they manage their own investments received letters recently, the spokesman said, while others who haven't made a decision were also issued the notice.

The bank followed Merrill Lynch last fall when it announced it would abandon Wall Street's traditional sales model of charging commissions whenever retirement investors who worked with a broker bought or sold stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investment products. Merrill is now considering relaxing its plan.

Wells Fargo Official Says Cyber Investments Pointing Way to Better Risk Management

By Steven Norton

Wells Fargo & Co.'s chief information security officer says cybersecurity investments in recent years have reduced overall risk and provided the bank with the foundational infrastructure it needs to begin managing that risk in a more preemptive and proactive way.

Now the bank is working to apply those security capabilities available across business units to improve risk-based decisionmaking.

"Investments made to enhance the program have helped reduce risk to a level that good, sound risk management or return-on-investment decisions can be made in the future," said Rich Baich, the bank's chief information security officer since 2012.

The bank views cyber risk in much the same way it views broader business risk. Mr. Baich reports to Wells Fargo's head of operational risk and compliance and the CISO job "is much more risk management than technical security," he said.

Far beyond securing laptops and mobile devices, broader risk management has become a strategic imperative inside the CISO's office. "We think about cybersecurity in the context of risk," John Hering, co-founder and executive chairman of Lookout Inc., said last month during the CIO Network conference in San Francisco.

In 2015, McDonald's Corp. CISO Marc Varner said risk management had become one of the most interesting parts of his job. "Any idiot can secure a computer; just throw it in the ocean or something," he said. "The trick is  & can you help your enterprise manage risk, and that balance between risk and reward."

Wells Fargo's Mr. Baich said the most important metric he tracks is a cyberattack's probability of occurrence. "That's probably the one thing in the risk formula you can change," he said. Seeing other organizations fall victim to a particular attack might increase the probability that hackers are using similar techniques, indicating the bank should take greater steps to protect against them.

Wells Fargo uses a number of tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and measure the probability of occurrence. Increasingly the bank must be able to look at multiple threat indicators and determine whether they point to different or larger vulnerabilities. "It is not a discrete science whatsoever," Mr. Baich said.

He laid out a three-pronged strategy for boosting the bank's cybersecurity: bolster the foundation, make that foundation operational, then optimize those operations.

A number of investments have set the stage for what he called "cyber correlation automation," essentially the ability to collect and digest large amounts of data from many different sources to quickly identify, predict and respond to attacks. "It's really big data," Mr. Baich said. "That's what some of these investments have allowed you to do. Do you know what you need, can you get it, and can you use it."

Next, Mr. Baich plans to work with groups across the bank, such as fraud and corporate investigations, to help them use those correlation capabilities to enhance their own controls.

"In essence it's turning [cybersecurity] into enablement," Mr. Baich said. That means getting the right information to the right decisionmakers quickly so they can improve risk-based decisionmaking and enhance internal controls.

Bharara's Probes Likely to Continue After His Exit

The sudden departure of the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, raises uncertainty about the federal government's approach to trying financial crimes and global terrorism cases, though it isn't likely to change the course of several high-profile investigations. The firings don't force pending investigations across the country to be put on hold, as US attorney's offices have career prosecutors who will fill in until new ones are confirmed. In Manhattan, Bharara's departure is unlikely to have a significant impact on continuing probes, largely because the interim leader of the office, Joon Kim, is a close friend and longtime colleague.

Italian Banks Need EUR25 Bln in Fresh Capital to Sell NPLs

Credit Suisse says that Italian banks need EUR25 billion in fresh capital on top of the EUR20 billion public backstop fund to be able to sell nonperforming loans at current market prices. Credit Suisse says that its calculations are based on the need of an additional EUR20 billion in provisions to cover for losses on NPLs to fill the gap between NPLs net book value of 42% and market price of 25%. It adds that the market is pricing a capital shortfall risk for Italian banks, capping the upside potential for these stocks. (giovanni.legorano@wsj.com)

"Capital isn't the problem. Instead, the blame for the 2008 crisis and the Great Recession rests largely with regulators," they write.

Beijing vows to clean up digital small lenders

Chinese authorities are preparing new rules to reduce risks caused by the rapid growth of online small-loan companies, which have emerged as among the most active lenders in the country following a crackdown on peer-to-peer rivals.

Chinese companies including Wanda, Ctrip, and LeEco have launched small-loan units over the past year. Earlier this month, JD.com said it was spinning off JD Finance, while retaining a share of profits in a deal that valued the lender at Rmb50bn ($7.2bn), mirroring Alibaba s spin-off of Ant Financial.

While the government has looked favourably on large companies with troves of proprietary data to expand into lending, regulators are growing concerned about a fleet of upstarts with little expertise in risk control. The regulator is considering ways to curb excesses in the small-loans market.

 We ve noticed that some so-called  internet small lenders  or  online small lenders  fundamentally lack a real customer base or real internet technology or big data. They just put out their name and blindly launch their business,  Li Junfeng, director of the financial inclusion department at the China Banking Regulatory Commission, told the small-loan industry association recently.

Loans outstanding among China s 8,673 small-loan companies totalled Rmb927bn at the end of last year, according to government data. That is more than the Rmb673bn outstanding from peer-to-peer lenders, according to Online Lending House.

But even that figure understates the true scale of activity by small-loan companies because these groups are among the most active issuers in China s burgeoning securitisation market. Securitisation of small-loan assets hit Rmb82bn in 2016, up from Rmb13bn a year earlier, according to data from Wind Info.

 These large companies want to cultivate new profit sources, and online small loans are a natural entry point,  says Wang Haimei, analyst at Splendid Profit, a fintech consultancy in Shanghai.  By lending upstream and downstream in their industry chains, they can consolidate their business relationships. 

Dalian Wanda Group   the mall developer that has expanded into movie production, sports and amusement parks   launched a lending app last July. Wanda Online Loans offers collateral-free loans to Wanda s smaller shopping-mall tenants, with loan approval available in as little as one day. Wanda also offers consumer loans with credit assessments based on customer data from Wanda's hotels, movie theaters, and ecommerce platforms.

Ctrip, the online travel agency, offers loans to Chinese tourists who must show proof of a minimum level of bank deposits in order to obtain travel visas. Haier, the home appliance maker, offers loans to online appliance retailers and street-side mobile phone shops.

Mr Li said the CBRC is preparing new regulations to address rising risks in the industry and advised provincial authorities to exercise caution in approving new online lenders in the meantime.

Traditional, offline small-loan companies are restricted to lending within their home provinces where they know local businesses. But provincial governments have approved a new wave of online small-loan companies in recent years. These new online groups are not subject to regional restrictions, opening the door to new risks.

Fenqile, whose name translates as  Installment Payments Joy , targets students with an army of 50,000 part time sales staff at 3,000 universities. Its website acts as an ecommerce platform that allows customers to buy cell phones, clothes, or holiday travel on credit, even without credit history or a parent s permission. Its slogan is  Love what I love, don t wait . The company declined an interview request.

Online small-loan approvals have become a valuable commodity amid aggressive enforcement ofnew rules on P2P lending announced last year. The rules cap P2P loans at Rmb200,000 for an individual and Rmb1m for a company. They also forbid peer-to-peer lenders from operating  fund pools  that allow platforms to fund payouts on maturing investment products with inflows from new product sales.

The goal of the ban on fund pools is to force P2P groups to serve as pure intermediaries that match investors with loans. Yet fund pools have been crucial to enabling these platforms to offer products with both short maturities and high yields. By contrast, small-loan companies rely on their own capital to fund loans, which means they have greater freedom to manage liquidity.

 Without fund pools, it s unlikely that peer-to-peer companies can be profitable, but online small loan companies don't have this kind of a limit,  says David Wu, executive director for financial service risk at EY in Shanghai.  In China, once the government starts limiting approval of something, it becomes a scarce resource. The message is very clear: this is worth something.

Regulatory easing will not kill off financial risk model makers

There are plenty of bankers who would applaud if Donald Trump s drive to ease global banking regulations reduces the influence of the risk managers, a group that has grown more powerful since the financial crisis.

After all, these are the risk managers who sucked up hundreds of millions of dollars of their banks  annual budgets to pay for obscure models and arduous compliance processes at a time when lenders were battling through a crisis and investment was in short supply.

These are the risk managers who installed themselves in the middle of banks  trading floors and critical processes so they could monitor exactly what was going on and prevent any potential problems before they blossomed   but ended up putting the brakes on profitable and safe trades too.

And these are the risk managers who created the often-tedious compliance programmes that bank employees must undergo regularly or face the consequences such as   in some institutions   losing their bonuses.

But risk managers will remain a force to be reckoned with for years to come, according to bank executives and industry experts. They say that even with Mr Trump s vow to row back the Dodd-Frank Act that heaped regulation on banks, and even with the failure of global policymakers to reach agreement on the next Basel capital measures, there are plenty of other factors that mean risk management will remain a priority.

There is ample space too for developers of complex models   tools that help assess the risk involved in a given activity   that have proliferated since the crisis. This is in spite of the fact that such models are expected to become less important under new capital rules that give banks less flexibility in how they assess the risks of their loan books.

 We believe there is also economic benefit of applying these models to our portfolios and positions,  says Christian Bluhm, chief risk officer at UBS.  We are not doing this just for the regulators, but also for ourselves as a bank. 

Peter Hahn, professor at the London Institute of Banking and Finance, says models were largely invented for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans and they have been very useful for banks when they make decisions about which customers they take on.

Since models were first built, regulations have rewarded banks that can show their portfolios are less risky. This has tempted risk managers to come up with models that show their banks require less capital and can therefore report better earnings, says Mr Hahn.

Under new capital rules, banks expect to have much less flexibility to use models to reduce the risk weighting of mortgages and other loans, and in turn reduce the amount of capital those loans demand. This could lead to less investment in some areas of risk management.

But bankers stress that some aspects of the changing regulatory environment will require more modelling, not less. The fundamental review of the trading book   a Basel initiative that deals with how much capital banks must hold for the stocks and bonds they trade with clients, which is due to come into force in 2019   heavily incentivises banks to use models to calculate the risks from changing market prices.  It s pretty clear that all banks will heavily invest in risk models,  says Mr Bluhm, describing the fundamental review of the trading book as a  game changer  that requires more sophisticated models.

International accounting rules coming into force next year, called IFRS 9, will require banks to set aside money in advance for potential loan losses. They put added emphasis on models, as do the stress tests banks go through all over the world to prove they can withstand crises. The US stress test, in particular, puts additional emphasis on modelling.

 The regulatory pressure on modelling comes from a number of different directions. Capital requirements isn t the only one,  says Tom Huertas, a partner at EY, the professional services firm, and a former alternate chair of the European Banking Authority.

Mr Bluhm says banks will continue to invest heavily in operational risk management, ploughing resources into automation, new technology, fraud prevention and artificial intelligence in a bid to reduce the risk of something going wrong with their operations.

Investors have been horrified by the soaring cost of risk management, which has left some wondering whether banks will be able to produce the return on equity they expect. Mr Huertas says he expects banks to make efficiencies as they invest further. He also suggests lenders may try to cut costs by using in-house staff to do work on risk management that is currently carried out for them by expensive consultants.

THE MONDAY INTERVIEW
France's tech champion turns venture capitalist; The Monday Interview: Fleur Pellerin, Chair, Korelya Capital

The former minister laid the foundations for a digital economy. Now she is putting them to the test, writes Harriet Agnew

When Fleur Pellerin set up the venture capital firm Korelya last year, the first contact the former French Socialist minister had with the government was a letter from the revenue outlining the taxes her business would pay.

"It's not a very friendly way to start," laughs 43-year-old Ms Pellerin, who as a government minister from 2012 to 2016 spearheaded a push to make Paris a "start-up republic". She says: "The administration still could do better to make the relations with entrepreneurs a bit smoother."

We are in Korelya's Paris offices, in an area becoming known as Silicon Sentier as start-ups and investors move in. This is due in no small part to Ms Pellerin's efforts to nurture tech during two years as minister for small and medium-sized enterprises, innovation and the digital economy.

Now her career has changed direction. Last year she raised  100m from Naver, the South Korean internet services company, to invest in French and European start-ups working in "deep tech" - artificial intelligence, big data and machine learning.

So far Korelya has invested alongside US rapper Jay Z in Devialet, a French sound technology business founded in 2007, earning her a seat on the board. Last month it invested an undisclosed amount in the latest fund from Atomico, the venture capital firm run by Niklas Zennstrm, co-founder of Skype.

For Ms Pellerin, Korelya marks a return to her roots. She was born in Seoul, South Korea, but abandoned on the streets when she was days old. Ms Pellerin was eventually adopted by French parents and had a modest upbringing in the suburbs of Paris. Strong academic performance helped her to attend prestigious French schools, including cole nationale d'administration, training ground for the French technocratic elite - for her, proof that "France is still a country where you can achieve social mobility".

After nearly 15 years as a civil servant and working on three Socialist presidential campaigns, Ms Pellerin was appointed a minister by Franois Hollande when he was elected president in 2012. She says: "It was very difficult in Europe to grow great companies that would compete with the big American or Chinese players . . . There was a need for an ecosystem."

She focused on start-ups and her plan had three parts: education, funding and branding. She encouraged France's education system to develop expertise in areas such as big data and coding. Then there was funding. French - and European - start-ups suffered from a lack of capital to help companies scale up. The government created a public investment bank called Bpifrance in 2011, which has since invested more than  1.6bn in France's tech industry.

Capitals across Europe were competing for tech business and Paris was not on the map, says Ms Pellerin. Inspired by efforts such as Tech City in London and Silicon Allee in Berlin, she helped brand the project French Tech.

Collective efforts from Ms Pellerin and others, including telecoms entrepreneur Xavier Niel (whose  250m Station F incubator in Paris will house 1,000 start-ups), have paid off. Momentum is growing in French tech, which last year accounted for a fifth of all the money raised by European start-ups, equal to Germany and behind only the UK, according to an EY report.

For Ms Pellerin, Korelya came about somewhat "unexpectedly" after she was ousted from government. She had been discussing the "digital revolution" with Lee Hae-jin, Naver's chairman , "a sort of Steve Jobs in Korea". On hearing that Naver wanted to increase its exposure to Europe, she proposed to work with it on a venture capital firm.

Ms Pellerin's demeanour is calm, efficient and friendly. She acknowledges she has no investment experience, but can bring an understanding of how the French government works. And Korelya's access to the Asian market through Naver appeals to companies seeking investment.

She talks about the agility of running a start-up and the relative ease of motivating a small team compared with the bureaucracy of government.

Her four years in government ended in 2016, when Ms Pellerin lost her job in a reshuffle. By then she was culture minister. But she provoked outrage in France when she failed in an interview to name a book by French novelist Patrick Modiano after he won the 2014 Nobel Prize for literature. She admitted she had not read a book for two years.

Now, less than two months from France's presidential election, the Socialist party is facing crisis. Left-winger Benot Hamon beat former prime minister Manuel Valls in the presidential nomination, marking a shift to the left and exposing divisions within the party. Some pro-business Socialist MPs and supporters have backed centrist Emmanuel Macron, who is standing as an independent candidate.

The Socialist party "is in a bad state", says Ms Pellerin, because of "a lack of work on the clarification of our ideology" on globalisation, the digital revolution and labour market reform. Mr Hamon campaigned on a return to leftwing policies such as a monthly universal income, which would be partly financed by a tax on robots. Ms Pellerin is against such a tax. But she agrees that the consequences of automation on the workforce is a problem.

She says she will not be galvanising pro-business Socialists to support Mr Macron. Ms Pellerin believes his proposed economic reforms could not be implemented without strong parliamentary support, "which he will certainly lack".

She adds: "A lot of people have difficulties with Macron because they don't perceive him as a socialist. His programme is the same as [centre-right candidate Franois] Fillon's, almost.

"This is the first time in my life, six weeks before the first round of elections, that I don't know for whom I'm going to vote. It's a bit sad."

Second opinion

The prime minister

Bernard Cazeneuve, France's prime minister, met Ms Pellerin when the pair worked on Franois Hollande's presidential campaign, and they became friends. He says: "French tech was invented by Fleur. She tried to involve French business people in it on their trips to the US. We had to explain what we were doing, as people thought we weren't business-friendly.

"She has a strong will and strength due to her intellect and ability to bring people together," he adds.

TDR Hires Big-Data  Gurus; Hires come as London firm nears  3 billion final close on latest fund

London-based private equity firm TDR Capital, which owns the David Lloyd fitness chain, has appointed two data analysts as it nears a  3 billion ($3.20 billion) final close on its latest fund, according to people familiar with the matter.

Eduardas Afanasjevas and Gregory Weegenaar both joined the firm at the end of 2016 to form its first data science unit, which will use data to analyse and improve the performance of portfolio companies. The hires come as a final close on TDR's  3 billion fund is "imminent", the people said.

The vehicle is expected to close above its  2.5 billion target on its  3 billion hard cap after just seven months in market. Private Equity News previously reported that the fund began marketing in August 2016.

The fund will be the largest capital pool that the firm has raised, to date, exceeding its third vehicle which closed on  2.1 billion in 2013. It has received commitments from a number of institutional investors and fund of funds including HarbourVest, Adams Street, CPPIB, Hamilton Lane, Ardian.

The two new hires will sit in the firm's operating team. Mr. Afanasjevas, who previously led the analytics function at PwC Strategy, will lead the data science operation. Another former member of the PwC analytics team, Mr. Weegenaar, will work alongside him using data to improve the performance of portfolio companies.

The decision to boost TDR's operating function by hiring data scientists comes as private equity firms have to work harder to generate returns in an uber-competitive deal environment.

Typically, firms drive value creation at portfolio companies by changing management teams, improving a company's existing internal infrastructure and hiring operating partners with expertise in certain industries.

Finance & Markets: Government Bonds Sink

Government-bond prices on both sides of the Atlantic dropped again Thursday amid signs that the European Central Bank won't pursue additional stimulus measures.

As expected, the ECB on Thursday left its key interest rates and plans for bond purchases unchanged. But at a news conference following the central bank's policy meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said the risk of deflation in the eurozone had diminished, removing the urgency for taking further actions.

Those comments sparked an especially large selloff among German bonds, with the yield on the 10-year German bond rising to 0.429% from 0.376% Wednesday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, meanwhile, climbed to 2.596% from 2.552% Wednesday.

Yields rise when bond prices fall.

Before Mr. Draghi's remarks, U.S. government bonds had already had a tough few days, extending a selloff that began last week when Federal Reserve officials strongly signaled plans to raise interest rates at their March 14-15 policy meeting.

The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is especially sensitive to the Fed's policy outlook, rose to 1.370% on Thursday from 1.354% Wednesday. That was its highest close since June 8, 2009.

One catalyst for higher yields was a report Wednesday from payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics that showed the U.S. private sector added 298,000 jobs last month, the most since April 2014.

That report is seen as a preview of the more closely watched jobs report from the Labor Department, which was to be released Friday.

With investors now expecting tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe, "the momentum is definitely there" for bond yields to keep rising, said Stanley Sun, interest-rates strategist at Nomura Securities International in New York.

At the same time, if the Fed signals next week that it still expects three interest-rate increases this year, that could "calm down the market a little bit," he added.

Nutanix investor Blumberg Capital has raised a $200 million fourth fund, its largest to date.

San Francisco-based Blumberg Capital plans to invest the new capital in areas including digital security, financial technology and big data.

Blumberg Capital was an early investor in recently public Nutanix Inc. and Hootsuite. The new fund, dubbed Blumberg Capital Fund IV LP, will allow the firm to strike early stage deals and do follow-on investments, according to founder and Managing Partner David Blumberg.

"We saw that even though the price started to rise pretty early in their lives, we should have continued to wheel barrow in the money," said Mr. Blumberg of the firm's stakes in Nutanix and Hootsuite.

Nutanix, a data center infrastructure company, staged an IPO in September in which shares "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nutanix-stock-soars-in-ipo-valuation-hits-5b-1475282062". Social media management startup Hootsuite, which has raised $250 million, has seen its valuation swell.

The venture firm plans to continue to write checks of $500,000 to $5 million, he said, and will consider special purpose vehicle funds as it has done in the past when opportunities arise.

Government Bond Yields Rise After ECB's Draghi Signals No Extra Stimulus; Yields have been climbing steadily after Federal Reserve officials signaled plans to raise rates

U.S. government bonds sold off again Thursday amid further signs that major central banks could be close to turning the page on an era of ultraloose monetary policies.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.596%, its highest close since Dec. 16, compared with 2.552% Wednesday.

Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, have been climbing steadily over the past week after Federal Reserve officials "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-signals-likely-rate-increase-at-march-fed-meeting-1488564006" that they plan to raise interest rates at their March 14-15 policy meeting.

On Thursday, attention shifted to the European Central Bank, which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-leaves-rates-borrowing-costs-unchanged-1489064015" and made no changes to its bond-buying program at the conclusion of its latest policy meeting. That decision initially caused a modest rally in government bonds, which reversed when ECB President Mario Draghi made several comments at a press conference that suggested the central bank was becoming more optimistic about the eurozone economy and less inclined to provide additional stimulus.

In recent years, government bond yields have been held at historically low levels in large part because central banks have gone to unprecedented lengths to bolster moribund economies by keeping interest rates at or below zero and pursuing large-scale bond purchases.

Though the Fed ended its bond-purchase program in 2014, it raised interest rates only once in each of the past two years while its counterparts in Europe and Japan stepped up their stimulus programs, helping to keep a lid on bond yields globally.

Even with no official change to its key policies, just the suggestion that the ECB was shifting its outlook caused a significant reaction in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year German bond closed at 0.429%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 0.376% Wednesday.

This is hardly the first time that government bonds have sold off in recent years. Episodes such as the "taper tantrum" of 2013 were followed by large bond rallies as expected economic growth and interest-rate increases failed to materialize.

More recently, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note reached 2.6% in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's electoral win. Investors at the time were betting that Mr. Trump's campaign promises of large tax cuts and infrastructure spending could become law and boost growth and inflation.

Since then, enthusiasm for the so-called "Trump trade" has dissipated somewhat among bond investors but may have been replaced by something more substantial, with strong economic data potentially giving Fed officials reason to quicken the pace of their interest-rate increases.

In just the latest in a run of solid data, a report Wednesday from payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics showed the U.S. private sector "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-sector-added-more-jobs-than-expected-in-february-1488980927", the most since April 2014. That report is seen as a preview of the more closely watched jobs report from the Labor Department that will be released Friday.

Some investors and analysts have speculated that the bond selloff could pick up additional momentum if yields cross key thresholds, such as 2.6% for the 10-year note.

At the same time, yields may have climbed high enough already that the bar has been raised for upcoming events, such as the jobs report and next week's Fed meeting.

With investors now expecting tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe, "the momentum is definitely there" for bond yields to keep rising, said Stanley Sun, interest-rates strategist at Nomura Securities International in New York. But if the Fed signals next week that it still expects just three interest-rate increases this year that could "calm the market a little bit," he added.

When the bond market first came under pressure at the end of last year, one concern was that higher yields on their own could ultimately lead to lower yields by causing interest rates to rise more broadly and constraining economic activity.

So far, there has been little sign of that happening. Rather than falling along with Treasurys, prices on riskier corporate debt have climbed in recent months, ensuring low borrowing costs for even heavily indebted companies.

At some point, though, there probably is a limit to how high yields can rise in the current economic environment, with it difficult to imagine a 10-year yield much above 3.25%, said Nick Maroutsos, a fixed-income portfolio manager of Janus Capital Group.

Typically, the market "overshoots in either direction and then it readjusts," he added.

Graphic novels, coding competitions, mammoth pay packets and even entire university research centres are just some of the tactics hedge funds are turning to as they seek to win an intensifying war for technology talent.

So-called quantitative hedge funds and investment banks have long fought with Silicon Valley for the brightest programmers and data scientists, but traditional asset managers are now throwing themselves into the fray, in a big bet that the future of investing is machine intelligence and Big Data, not human nous and quarterly corporate results.

 The talent war is unprecedented,  said Yin Luo, head of quantitative research at Wolfe Research and a former top strategist at Deutsche Bank.  It s nearly impossible to find people with experience in both computer science and finance. So it s all about raw talent. 

To unearth this raw talent, investment groups are trying unorthodox approaches such as coding competitions and freestyle data challenges to unearth hidden gems outside the usual elite universities.

Two Sigma, one of the biggest quant hedge funds, is running a "https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling", an online platform popular with data scientists, where contestants will have three months to code a trading algorithm based on four gigabytes of financial data provided by the US hedge fund. The winner will soon pocket $100,000.

Ostensibly the aim of the contest is to raise awareness and interest in finance, but the hedge fund also hopes to find some potential hires among Kaggle s 730,000 user base from across the world.

Instead of a traditional but staid leaflet, potential hires at Two Sigma are given a graphic novel that explains the hedge fund s approach and benefits, such as a  Monte Carlo Hill Climbing Lunch , where a Monte Carlo algorithm once a week selects four  Sigmas  to invite. If at least three accept, the lunch is arranged.  As if there were a better way to pick people to eat with,  the graphic novel says.

 While attracting talent is never easy, we find that our culture and people are a differentiator as we speak with potential candidates,  said Scott Grabarski, head of engineering human resources at Two Sigma.

The Kaggle competition follows in the footsteps of WorldQuant, a hedge fund that manages $4.5bn for Izzy Englander s Millennium Management. It runs a   "https://websim.worldquantchallenge.com/en/cms/wqc/home/"  designed to give  curious and strategic-minded individuals the opportunity to learn about quantitative finance, compete with global participants and potentially earn a research consultant position  at the hedge fund.

Underscoring the battle for talent as new players enter the space, WorldQuant late last year sued a former "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/data-scientists-making-millions-vie-with-fund-managers-over-pay"for breach of contract when he left to join Dan Loeb s Third Point, alleging that he had been promised a tenfold increase in his salary to $2m. The case was quickly settled out of court.

Several UK hedge funds have led the way in partnering with universities to access the talent pipeline directly. For example, Man Group has financed a centre for  machine learning    a field of artificial intelligence   at Oxford university, and last year Cambridge university opened the Cantab Capital Institute for Mathematics of Information, funded by Cantab Capital.

For smaller firms the challenges in finding good staff can be particularly intense.  The talent is the hardest part. A lot of my time is simply spent cultivating people,  said Scott Borgerson, the head of CargoMetrics, a Boston-based quant hedge fund.  World-class people are very sought-out.

Nearly a decade after the sector's near collapse humbled some of Goldman Sachs' leading financial scientists, computer-driven quantitative investing is once again the hottest trend in finance. Is it safe yet? By Robin Wigglesworth

It was a typical New York summer day, the kind where arriving at Goldman Sachs' perfectly air-conditioned offices in downtown Manhattan was a blissful release from the humid weather outside. But for Gary Chropuvka it proved to be one of the worst days of his life.

Mr Chropuvka worked at Goldman's money management arm, specifically at Quantitative Investment Strategies, a division staffed by mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists. Even at Goldman, the QIS employees were considered intellectual superstars. Their prowess at decoding the signals of financial markets meant the unit managed $165bn at its peak - more than any hedge fund group .

But on August 6 2007, everything unravelled. As soon as US markets started trading, the previously wildly successful automated investment algorithms coded by the QIS brainiacs went horribly awry, and losses mounted at a frightening pace.

What became known as the "quant quake" subsided in a week and was largely contained within the computer-powered investment industry. It was soon overshadowed by the global financial crisis. But it scarred a generation of financial scientists on Wall Street. Even Renaissance Technologies, the legendary hedge fund co-founded by cold war codebreaker James Simons , suffered painful losses, and it nearly obliterated Goldman's QIS.

"All this worked academically, and for a long time it worked in practice, and then all of a sudden you have this horrible event," Mr Chropuvka says. "It was the most humbling experience of our lives."

Nearly a decade later, quantitative investing is once again the hottest trend in finance. Computer-driven hedge funds have just notched up their eighth straight year of client inflows, doubling their assets from 2009 to $918bn, according to Hedge Fund Research. Even this understates the interest, as many traditional hedge funds and big mutual fund managers are all trying to blend more quantitative techniques with their traditional approaches.

QIS is emblematic of the quant renaissance . In 2011 Goldman Sachs put its top computer wizard, Armen Avanessians, in charge of the division. He has helped turn round its fortunes. The arm's assets under management reached a nadir of $38bn in 2012, but it now manages $91.8bn - still below the unit's pre-crisis peak.

"The first thing I did was to fly to our biggest clients and apologise," he says. "All bad things involve crowding and leverage, and the quant crisis was no different. But the core idea that computers can do a lot of this better than humans was right . . . I feel that we're just at the early stages of this quant revolution, and that gets me excited."

The explosive growth of algorithmic investing - whether high-frequency traders, next-generation exchange traded funds or artificial intelligence-powered hedge funds - has transformed the markets. Some analysts fear that another 2007-style meltdown would be more severe due to the proliferation of quant strategies.

"It's the biggest worry I have," says Richard Bookstaber, a former risk manager at Morgan Stanley and Moore Capital, now a research principal at the US Treasury's Office of Financial Research. "What is going on now is not just the growth of quant hedge funds, like before the crisis. Now it's system-wide across the investment world. In 2007 it was localised because no one else was pursuing these strategies. Now everyone is."

Persistent signals

Roughly a dozen analysts and fund managers shuffle into an airy corner office at Goldman's New York headquarters to hear the co-heads of research at QIS's Equity Alpha Strategies team, Dennis Walsh and Takashi Suwabe, present some of their data crunching.

Mr Walsh outlines how they can profit from even the most common of corporate events: quarterly earnings calls. Using an AI technique called "natural language processing", Goldman's algorithms can systematically look for verbal cues from analysts on the call that might indicate whether they were pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised at the results - and therefore upgrade their outlook in response.

"There's a tendency towards praise to keep in management's good books, but only marginally. If 20 out of 30 analysts say 'great quarter' then it probably was," Mr Walsh says. It may seem sketchy, but success for quants depends on detecting small but persistent signals that they can feed into trading algorithms.

QIS has been radically restructured since its near-death experience in 2007, and focuses on three main areas. Its biggest part is the $35bn "tax-efficient strategies" unit which structures investment products for wealthy Goldman clients. But QIS executives say the main priorities are its $31bn "smart beta" ETF business , which invests in specific market factors or characteristics, the $16bn Equity Alpha arm and a small but promising $3.2bn "alternative risk premia" business, where financial engineers try to deconstruct and cheaply replicate hedge fund returns.

The future of the business will be powered by data. "The amount of data out there is awesome," says Mr Chropuvka, one of two Goldman partners at QIS. "Figuring out the linkages between companies has become more complicated, and quants like using computers to help figure these things out. We have for decades played the breadth game, but with big data we can play the depth game. We can do it more comprehensively, and in real time."

Another signal explored by Goldman's quantitative analysts is something they term "geographic momentum", based on how companies in one corner of the planet can often offer clues to how others in the same region are performing.

QIS has crunched the data of its 14,800 stocks across 1m locations, using "machine learning" to find and quantify hidden relationships and linkages that might often cross state, regional or even country borders, and sliced the world into 200 distinct "economic clusters" where companies tend to move in tandem. A French bank with a big loan book in eastern Europe might offer clues to how Polish contractors are doing, or Texan developers might indicate the health of Mexican cement sales.

Leveraged complexity

The investment industry's enthusiasm for the potential of big data, superfast computers and AI is palpable - and not just among quant hedge funds. State Street, a $2.4tn asset manager, believes this is the "next evolutionary step" for the sector. BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, has said it "represents a watershed moment in the history of investment management".

The enthusiasm mostly reflects a view of where markets and investing are heading. Aside from a few elite firms, even the industry's more sophisticated players can struggle for consistent returns. HFR's quant hedge fund index has been far less volatile than the broader industry universe, but gained only 1.7 per cent last year.

Yin Luo, head of quantitative research at Wolfe Research, says the pre-crisis era was the "golden age" for the industry, when "almost everything worked, even if it wasn't fancy". Now, it is much harder, with many common signals and strategies copied into oblivion.

Nor is hiring a lot of smart data scientists a silver bullet. BlackRock has poured money into its Scientific Active Equity division, but almost two-thirds of its quant funds underperformed their benchmarks last year, according to a presentation acquired by Bloomberg. Jeff Shen, the unit's co-head, attributes the poor performance to the turbulent start to 2016. But it still highlights that quantitative investing can be tricky.

The head of one big quant hedge fund compares the phenomenon to Kodak, the camera company that saw the rise of digital photography coming but was still unable to refocus the business, and eventually went bankrupt. "Even if you recognise something is changing, it's not easy to revamp the business," he says.

Nonetheless, the quant revolution is transforming investment. The convoluted but broadly explicable financial markets of previous generations have evolved into an electronic jungle of unfathomable complexity.

Understanding how markets function increasingly requires knowledge of a Greek-based alphabet soup of concepts and phenomena - such as alpha generation, smart beta, gamma scalping, delta hedging and option theta. Their speed has accelerated markedly, and the number of market anomalies, odd trading patterns and mysterious "flash crashes" have increased in tandem with the ascent of algorithms.

Yet one of the biggest fears is that the money pouring into quantitative investing could be laying the seeds of a bigger re-run of the 2007 quant quake.

The precise trigger for the quake might never be known, but analysts generally agree the pot was brought to a boil by too many big investors unknowingly making the same trades while juicing up their returns with leverage. When the financial crisis began, one of the bigger players was likely to have been hit by subprime mortgage losses, forcing it to sell its more liquid but highly leveraged equity portfolio to satisfy investor withdrawals. Losses hammered participants with similar trades and triggered fresh rounds of liquidation.

Goldman's QIS division is sometimes fingered as one of the potential culprits in triggering the quant quake - specifically its once-imperious Global Alpha fund that was closed in 2011 - something its executives vehemently deny. QIS was simply one of the biggest victims because several of its funds had used "an unbelievable amount of leverage", Mr Chropuvka says.

'We focus on what can go wrong'

The kind of leverage used in 2007 has largely been banished from the financial system. President Donald Trump's planned regulatory rollback might shake things up, but much of the reduction is attributed to heightened caution after the crisis. Moreover, while billions of dollars have been poured into quantitative strategies in recent years, their variety has increased significantly.

Indeed, the rise of big data could lead to a new golden era for the industry, Mr Shen says. "The world is more complex and diverse now. That makes it harder [to perform], but it makes crowding less of a risk."

QIS is a case in point. While its quants might have tapped into only a dozen or so signals in 2007, they now use more than 250 with much less leverage. That means the dangers of crowded strategies that proved so toxic nearly a decade ago should be reduced.

While Mr Avanessians is "always paranoid that I'm missing something", he says Goldman's quants have learnt the lessons of 2007. "We now have a maniacal focus on what can go wrong, rather than what can go right."

Not everyone is convinced. Mr Bookstaber points out that while leverage is more limited, the swelling "smart beta" industry is a way that another quant quake could hit the masses. With quants becoming more dominant, fears of another electronically generated market meltdown will persist.

"We're caught in a tug of war between Moore's Law and Murphy's Law," says Andrew Lo, finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to Gordon Moore's prediction that computing power would double nearly every year, and the adage that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. "Our technology has outgrown our ability to manage it, and the financial world is increasing in complexity and fragility."

Alt-risks

Quants bid to beat hedge funds at their own game

One of the smallest but potentially most intriguing units at Goldman Sachs' Quantitative Investment Services is arguably its "alternative risk premia" unit, where a bunch of financial scientists attempt to reverse-engineer and then replicate the secret sauce of hedge funds.

Over the years, quantitative analysts have discovered that a lot of the market-beating "alpha" returns produced by supposedly skilled fund managers can often be attributed to specific factors and market characteristics, such as momentum or cheap valuations. These factors are now often packaged into exchange traded funds as "smart beta".

But recently, quants say they have even been able to deconstruct and rebuild many of the "risk premia" components of sophisticated hedge fund strategies - such as arbitraging mergers and acquisitions, or placing bets on global bond and currency movements - and sell them at a fraction of the cost.

In April 2012 Goldman Sachs transferred about 20 of its financial engineers from the investment bank's securities side to QIS, where they set up an alternative risk premia division to decipher and duplicate an array of hedge fund products for institutional clients.

So far it has only been a modest success. At the end of last year, the unit's assets under management stood at $3.2bn. But Goldman executives have pinpointed it as one of its three main priorities, convinced that it can become a money-spinning factory for mass production of cheap hedge fund returns for its clients.

Nonetheless, some quants - let alone many hedge fund managers - are sceptical, arguing that a lot of the supposed success of hedge fund replication is based mostly on "backtests", running the models against historical data. And a lot of strategies that work when tested on backward-looking data can fizzle out when confronted with moving markets.

Heavy losses Groups such as Goldman Sachs' quantitative division suffered a rout in the August 2007 'quant quake'

Crowding fears The post-crisis growth of quantitative investment has stirred fears over another market storm

Alphabet Inc.'s Google has acquired Kaggle Inc., which operates a community for data scientists to solve problems together, in a bid to increase its mindshare in the booming field of artificial intelligence.

Kaggle runs competitions for its AI developers and has public datasets for its users. Kaggle will fall under Google's cloud unit, which has its own aggressive AI initiatives.

Google Cloud AI chief Fei-Fei Li said the company acquired Kaggle because there's "a bigger and bigger need" for data in the AI field.

Kaggle had raised $12.8 million in venture funding from investors including Index Ventures and Khosla Ventures, which led the company's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020111101e7b1avmw3", as well as SV Angel, Yuri Milner's Start Fund and Stanford Management Co.

Google Chases Rivals in Cloud Push

Google conquered internet search. It is having a tougher time winning the rapidly growing cloud-computing industry.

Google is pitching potential corporate customers on its vast network of computers and artificial-intelligence tools, and often undercutting the prices of the two incumbents that dwarf it, cloud-computing pioneer Amazon.com Inc. and corporate-tech veteran Microsoft Corp.

But to catch those rivals, analysts say Google must build more credibility among corporations wary of running their businesses on the servers of an internet-search company with little experience supporting the technology needs of big companies, other than its own.

In response, Google has been expanding its sales, marketing and customer-support staff in an effort to cater to traditional industries.

But Google Cloud chief Diane Greene says the company's technology, and not its business fundamentals, will help it succeed. "The business-side stuff is not rocket science. It is blocking and tackling," she said. "The part that is rocket science, that's the part I like coming to the party with."

Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., touted its progress at its cloud conference in San Francisco on Wednesday and announced new customers, including global bank HSBC Holdings PLC. HSBC, which also uses Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud services, said it is using Google's technology to improve its money-laundering detection, run simulations and make complex calculations.

The shift to cloud computing threatens to displace billions of dollars of technology spending as companies from corporate giants to hot startups store their data and run their digital businesses on other companies' computer servers.

Google faces an uphill battle against Amazon and Microsoft. The industry juggernaut, Amazon Web Services, had $12.22 billion in cloud revenue last year, while Deutsche Bank estimates $2.42 billion for Microsoft's Azure cloud service and $900 million for Google. Those numbers don't include sales of cloud-based productivity tools, such as Microsoft's Office 365 and Google's Gmail and Google Docs.

Ms. Greene said Google is gaining traction, winning most of the time when competing with Amazon or Microsoft for new companies moving to the cloud.

Amazon and Microsoft rebuff that suggestion. "We rarely see [Google] among the last two finalists for big deals -- especially when it comes to larger customers or enterprises," said Ariel Kelman, vice president of marketing for AWS.

Google is only included in about one in 20 of Microsoft's sales engagements, said Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president of world-wide commercial business. "And when they do, most customers chose Microsoft."

Finance & Markets: SoftBank May Shift ARM Stake

Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. is in talks to transfer a roughly 25% stake in U.K.-based chip designer ARM Holdings PLC to its proposed $100 billion technology fund, a person familiar with the matter said.

The SoftBank Vision Fund, which SoftBank's billionaire founder Masayoshi Son is hoping to launch in the next few weeks, is backed by a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund, as well as other investors such as Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Technologies Inc. Its purpose is to invest in technologies that Mr. Son sees as vital to future trends, such as sensors and artificial intelligence.

Mr. Son sees ARM -- which SoftBank bought for $32 billion in September, and whose chip designs are used in the vast majority of smartphones and mobile devices -- as an important developer of such technologies. The talks to transfer a stake to the Vision Fund are driven by the desire of some of the fund's partners to have an indirect investment in ARM, the person familiar with the matter said.

Negotiations over valuation for the stake are continuing, the person said.

Mr. Son is also eager to transfer a stake in ARM to help finance debt-strapped SoftBank's $25 billion contribution to the Vision Fund, another person familiar with the matter said. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has said it would invest up to $45 billion in the fund, with smaller investments coming from Apple, Qualcomm, Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison and Taiwanese manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.

ARM's research is likely to play a key role in guiding Mr. Son's investments in the Vision Fund, providing him a road map on what devices will be able to do, when, as consumer and industrial devices become increasingly connected to one another, said people close to SoftBank's plans. Mr. Son has told ARM it need not focus on profits, but instead should accelerate its research and development, the people said.

SoftBank, founded in 1981 by Mr. Son, was an early investor in Yahoo Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. He staged a coup in Japan's telecom market by buying Vodafone's Japan arm in 2006 and supplying the iPhone exclusively. The three investments have paid Mr. Son handsomely, helping him to secure financing for further deals, including his 2013 purchase of U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp. for $22 billion.

The proposed stake transfer in ARM was reported earlier by the Financial Times.

The HR start-up founded by Bridgewater alumni   based on Bridgewater principles

The group of college seniors had gathered for a relaxed, celebratory dinner. Each of the roughly dozen students had survived a rigorous interview process to earn a coveted job offer from Bridgewater Associates, the wildly successful and wildly iconoclastic hedge fund based in Westport, Connecticut. The dinner was a chance for the new recruits to meet Bridgwater professionals and each other, as they decided whether to accept entry-level positions.

Yet despite the variety of schools represented, the Bridgewater team was startled to learn that most of the kids were already acquainted with each other, having already met during their high school days. Two students had competed on the Teen Jeopardy television quiz show. Several others had met during Model United Nations competitions.

 There was this web of connectivity among this group of students who fit the culture at Bridgewater and we were able to fortuitously tap,  said Robin Levine, a veteran of various management and operational roles at Bridgewater.  We thought,  What if we re able to take the flip side and proactively find students based on the traits of this web?   

Ms Levine, 37, and Jacqueline Loeb, 30, separately left Bridgewater in 2013 and have since together founded an online recruiting company, "http://scouted.io/", which uses video interviews, written questions, and a machine-learning algorithm to match college seniors and recent graduates with employers seeking young talent.

Ms Levine had been with Bridgewater since 2001 and Ms Loeb since 2008. Both had joined out of Dartmouth College, though Ms Levine left for two years to attend Harvard Business School before returning. They had each served in different operational roles during a time of aggressive growth, when Bridgewater s assets under management climbed from under $40bn to $150bn and its workforce rose to around 1,500 employees.

Why leave

For most people in the asset management sector, a career change such as theirs would be unusual. But for those departing Bridgewater, such a gambit may be a natural leap.

The fund attributes its success in part to the blunt internal culture, known as  radical transparency , evangelised by founder and co-chief investment officer Ray Dalio. In a "https://www.ft.com/content/fba5b9da-fe15-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30", Mr Dalio stepped down from the co-CEO post, though he will remain co-CIO. In an example of its trademark directness, the fund said that co-CEO Jon Rubinstein was also departing after less than a year on the job because  they mutually agree that he is not a cultural fit . (No euphemisms about  spending more time with his family  for Mr Dalio.)

Mr Dalio s meditations on organizational theory are captured in a voluminous manifesto he has written that is simply titled   "https://www.principles.com/#Principles" . At last count, the manifesto includes 210 said principles. Perhaps the most curious manifestation of the Bridgewater culture is its practice of recording or videotaping internal meetings and interactions, and widely sharing the videos within the firm as teaching points.

As one Bridgewater alum shared, speaking about why Bridgewater had become an incubator of entrepreneurism:  I wouldn t have worked at any other hedge fund besides Bridgewater; Ray shaped a culture based on principles, to try to understand how the world works, how do you build an engine to understand the world, markets, talents, and test your ability to apply that understanding and create value. Jacqueline, Robin and a number of other Bridgewater alumni who have become entrepreneurs are highly conceptual, and systematically think about some aspect of how the world works and derive a meaningful opportunity from that. 

The unorthodox atmosphere at the firm has also sparked questions about a possible darker side. A now-departed employee "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/business/dealbook/bridgewater-associates-hedge-fund-culture-ray-dalio.html" against Bridgewater with the Connecticut state human rights commission. The employee stated that Bridgewater was  a cauldron of fear and intimidation , and that the firm had both discouraged him from pursuing his charges and had retaliated against him. In a related action, the US National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Bridgewater that challenged the legality of confidentiality agreements that employees are required to sign when they join.

The employee and Bridgewater ultimately "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/business/dealbook/bridgewater-hedge-fund-sexual-harassment-claim.html". And in October, the NLRB and Bridgewater reached their own accord on the confidentiality agreement issue. Most of the details of that agreement "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/dealbook/bridgewater-associates-labor-board-employee-confidentiality-contract-settlement-.html", at Bridgewater s request.

Apart from his theories on organizations, Mr Dalio is also becoming known as a media critic, publishing his thoughts on LinkedIn. He took issue with how the New York Times depicted Bridgewater in the newspaper s reporting on the harassment case, labelling its story a   "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-york-times-story-distortion-reality-ray-dalio" . Mr Dalio has condemned the Wall Street Journal s December story on the firm s artificial intelligence initiative for containing   "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fake-distorted-news-epidemic-bridgewaters-recent-experience-ray-dalio?trk=mp-reader-card" . And just this week, the New York Times again published "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/business/dealbook/ex-employees-note-a-hint-of-turmoil-in-bridgewaters-recipe-for-success.html" about Bridgewater s work environment. Mr Dalio s "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/business/dealbook/bridgewater-response-times-reporting.html" was published by the paper.

Scouted

While Ms Loeb and Ms Levine decline to comment on specific Bridgewater matters, the Scouted marketing materials plainly tout their years of experience there. When asked if the salacious Bridgewater headlines may taint their enterprise, they told us,  The most frequent comments we receive based on our Bridgewater background is that Bridgewater people are known to be smart and analytical, and hopefully that is reinforced when people meet with us! 

Scouted s philosophy on recruiting explicitly draws on several Bridgewater tenets. The pair organized Scouted on the idea that structured, data-driven thinking is the best way to solve ambiguous problem.

 You have this institutional elitism where the access to talent is systematically skewed,  said Ms Loeb.  For a company, this makes it expensive and inefficient for finding great and diverse talent. 

 It took a lot of time and energy at Bridgewater to find really great talent   and there we were at a firm that had a great brand, cared a lot about young talent, and had almost unlimited resources. Campus recruiting was so offline and fragmented, it was more efficient to find the 100 best kids at Dartmouth, Harvard or Brown than to look more broadly even though Bridgewater didn t care about where talent came from. They just wanted access to people that fit. But we would still get a lot of econ majors. And that s fine: econ majors can be great. But how could we find those more creative, lateral thinkers? 

The two say that Bridgewater thought of teams as  collections of values, abilities, and skills . The conceit of Scouted is to then  nudge  companies into understanding the underlying personal traits a position requires, and also to nudge applicants into understanding what they fundamentally desire in a job and what they can offer an employer. The consequence is that both employers and employees obsess less about superficial factors like the brand name of a school or company and more about the intrinsic fit between a job opportunity and candidate.

 A client will be hiring for a sales role, will say, `I need someone who is really hardworking, and really smart, and a great-problem solver.  And they give you a laundry list of everything that is important. But if you ask them to force-rank those items, nine times out of ten it is different from where they started. A lot of times the raw horsepower, the intellectual ability, is far second to having high EQ and strong diligent follow-up,  offered Ms Levine.

 A lot of hiring is done through intuition   or at least that s how many hiring managers make decisions. But often, that intuition is premised on logic. We re bringing that logic to the forefront of the process and systemizing it to reduce bias and up the odds that you re hiring the right person. We have about 15-20 core attributes that we ve derived from a combination of expert research and common sense; we use these as the foundation of our evaluation process. We learned from our Bridgewater experiences that there s no such thing as a single silver bullet to understand complex systems. We take this lesson, along with elements of portfolio theory, and apply that concept to our assessment algorithm by using multiple indicators to build confidence in our understanding of a candidate. 

The indicators that Scouted is trying to capture, besides the typical cognitive abilities, are subtle characteristics that companies increasingly are seeking. These include grit, tenacity and emotional intelligence.

While it collects traditional data points from CVs and test scores to feed into its algorithm, video interviews are a critical element to initial screening of key applicant attributes. Candidates answer on camera how and why they made a difficult personal decision, or how they would spend an ideal Saturday. In another query that Scouted calls the  Peter Thiel question,  applicants are asked for some principle the candidates believe to be true that few else do.

The data collected are fed into the algorithm that generates not just job matches but also the key strengths and weaknesses of each candidate. (The candidates are also asked to self-rank their traits.)

Scouted then shares the matches with students and employers in batches every few weeks, rather than instantaneously, which it believes leads to more thoughtful decision-making by both sides. Employers also get access to an online dashboard with candidate s summaries and interview videos.

The result, Ms Levine and Ms Loeb claim, are searches that are six times as effective as traditional recruiting methods   a company can find a new employee among a pool of 15 candidates recommended by Scouted rather than the average of 90 it takes through traditional means according to "http://www.jobvite.com/".

Ms Levine and Ms Loeb have so far relied upon their savings to fund Scouted. But they now have recently closed a  pre-seed  fundraising round from early-stage investors as well as individuals from their Bridgewater network.

Results

Ultimately, Scouted is attempting to connect candidates and companies that otherwise would not have found each other. One success story is Samantha H, who, after graduating from a large, public university in the Midwest, worked for three years at a large well-known asset manager in New York. But she grew out of that position and wanted a more entrepreneurial job. After little traction through traditional channels, she turned to Scouted which she found through a friend who had himself found a job through Scouted and eventually landed a general management position at a fashion start-up.

 After three years in finance and wanting to move out to a start-up, I had a really hard time getting connected,  Samantha said.  Coming from a large financial institution, it just wasn t that easy. The job I m at now I never even thought there was a way for me to get here. Getting asked questions by Scouted that went beyond just my resume is a really big difference .

Scouted so far has placed about 130 positions. Their clients so far are typically private equity firms and hedge funds as well as buzzy startups like Casper, Oscar (co-founded by a Bridgewater alum), and Code Academy. Like any matching service, there are more sellers than buyers with Scouted currently having 2,500 active candidates

The company is now up to six full-time employees with its most recent hire, a marketing executive from LinkedIn.

So far, the company s challenges with large employers have been their risk aversion and inertia.  We are still at a nascent stage having only placed candidates for a year. There are a lot of big companies that buy in at the conceptual level, but want someone else to take the first bullet. Plus there is still an emotional attachment to keeping recruiting at alma maters , says Ms Levine.

Even companies that have embraced innovation are still trying to balance old and new hiring methodologies.

 There s no one tool we re looking to put into play that s going to make a hiring decision for us,  says Mike Desmarais, head of global recruiting at Goldman Sachs, which has been early adopter of video interviews, hackathons, and machine-learning that it blends with traditional human evaluation.

Like online dating, the marketplace is crowded with software companies searching for the most efficient way to link applicants and open positions. "https://www.planted.com/" and "https://www.wayup.com/" represent two well-known start-up competitors of Scouted. For any of these upstarts to stand out and prosper, they will need large companies to migrate their traditional methods to new, technological-based ones. While Scouted is currently fulfilling ad hoc searches, it wants to be hired as a recurring Software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendor embedded in companies  talent departments.

But big business can be both slow to embrace change and also have the resources to build their own in-house recruiting products tailored to their own preferences. Wall Street investment banks demonstrate this hybrid approach. Goldman Sachs now conducts all "https://www.ft.com/content/5183ff92-3945-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f" using an outside vendor, "https://www.hirevue.com/". Deutsche Bank has an "https://www.ft.com/content/b83108fe-72b4-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a" run by the vendor "http://www.joinkoru.com/".

The social network

A key element of Scouted s successful placements so-far has been the deep involvement of the founders in candidate searches along with their reliance on the Bridgewater network. One of the interesting things we learned was how many non-investing start-ups have been spawned from Bridgewater. These included:

* "http://www.entrypointvr.com/"(virtual reality)

* "http://incandescent.com/"(management consulting)

* "https://climbcredit.com/"(online student loans)

* "http://www.talentism.com/"  (management consulting)

* "https://medium.com/@brendanfwallace/clara-lending-reinventing-the-mortgage-industry-88b1041cc4eb#.ywflkc15v"  (online mortgages)

* "https://angel.co/imagen-technologies"(Healthcare AI)

* "https://www.dominodatalab.com/"  (analytics)

* "https://www.hubblecontacts.com/"  (contact lens)

* "https://www.hillflint.com/"  (hipster college sweaters)

One Bridgewater alum, Ben Spector, explained why his firm Atalaya Capital has hired multiple junior investment professionals through Scouted.

 Scouted really seems to spend time on what makes people good at the job over time: what are the important strengths that you don t learn in a week, or learn in two weeks, but that are the things that differentiate people over a year, or two, or three,  said Ben Spector, who has hired multiple junior investment professionals at private credit fund Atalaya Capital and who was a colleague of the founders at Bridgewater.

Those are the traits, he said,  that make people successful much more than  can you build a DCF model in Excel,  which can be taught in three weeks .

While the intense involvement of Ms Levine and Ms Loeb has been instrumental in Scouted s early successes, the question has become whether the algorithm is powerful enough for Scouted to become more than a niche headhunting service.

 When you re young, often your own limiting factor is not your inherent capabilities, but your understanding of how you navigate that world,  Ms Loeb said.  So we re trying to better equip our candidates so they understand how to put their best foot forward. We re almost like a translating engine: how do we communicate a candidate s story to a company in a way a company can digest it in their language? How do we communicate that company to a candidate so a candidate can digest it in their language? We want to use technology where it makes sense and use people where it makes sense. 

 This is really hard to do well and hard to copy. If it was easy to do, if we could perfectly replicate ourselves within a year, then everyone would be doing it already. Where we are now, is that in the last year we have built out the technology so that the culling and matching is done by the algorithm and humans are only needed to check the results .

The algorithm can now process and match 240 candidates in 24 hours. Initially it took the pair three months to process 80 candidates manually.

Still, Ms Levine says,  Talking to candidates at the decision phase is one of the points where human interaction has a high ROI .

It s also in those interactions where Bridgewater s  radical transparency  seems to manifest itself the most.

 For every job posting, we ll have why Scouted thinks this job is awesome, and we ll be very honest. We ll say,  look this is a finance job, but if you re a spreadsheet junkie and you want to spend all of your time in front of a computer crunching numbers, this is not the job for you. This position is about relationship management and this is about people. If that s your jam, go for it. 

The Property Report
Bears Are Targeting Mall REITs

As U.S. retailers grapple with slumping sales, bearish investors are turning their attention to the struggling chains' landlords.

Shares of retail-focused real-estate investment trusts, which own malls and shopping centers, have slumped since August last year, when Macy's Inc. said it would close 100 stores. Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. later said they would close more than 100 stores each.

A regional-mall REIT index plunged about 22% from late July until March 6, according to data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.

Short sellers, who bet a stock's price will decline, have been especially active. The amount of short interest, a measure of short-selling activity, on retail-focused REITs increased to $7.6 billion as of March 6 from $5.6 billion as of the end of December, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

In a short sale, investors borrow shares and quickly sell them, with the intention of buying shares later at lower prices to repay the loan, pocketing the difference.

Short sellers are betting landlords will face higher costs to spruce up their centers or struggle to replace stores that close, especially in weaker locations.

Short trades against REITs with more mid- to low-quality malls, known as class B and C properties, such as CBL & Associates Properties Inc., Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Washington Prime Group, have been more profitable, according to data from S3 Partners.

But even shares of class A mall REITs, which own the most productive malls in the country, have faced pressure. Short interest on Simon Property Group Inc. jumped to $1.3 billion on March 3 from $916 million at the end of 2016, near its record. Over the same period, short interest trades in GGP Inc. increased to a record $689 million from $430 million.

"There has been a steady drumbeat of negative reports from anchor retailers in the mall," said James Sullivan, managing director at BTIG LLC, a financial-services firm. "As a result, when we keep hearing bad news it adds to the impression that there is a problem in the malls."

Other short sellers are focusing on mall debt. Losses on securitized mortgages tied to retail property rose to $1.7 billion last year from $1.3 billion in 2015, the only property segment that showed an increase in losses, according to Moody's Investors Service.

Yield spreads on BBB-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities that have more retail real-estate exposure are widening, according to Trepp LLC, a real-estate data service. Widening spreads -- the difference in yield between a Treasury bond and debt with the same maturity -- indicate the perceived risk of default is rising.

Some investors are wagering against mortgage-backed securities through the CMBX, a credit-default-swap index that tracks the values of bonds backed by mortgages on malls, office buildings and other commercial property. They are betting against securities backed by malls in weaker locations.

Still, some analysts, including BTIG's Mr. Sullivan, argue that some mall REITs, especially class A mall operators, have been oversold.

The department-store closures haven't hit REIT-owned malls much so far, and mall REITs have been able to fill other vacancies with new tenants, analysts said.

Software Maker Market Track Explores a Sale

Market Track LLC, a software maker backed by Aurora Capital Group, has engaged investment bank Harris Williams & Co. to weigh a sale, said people familiar with the situation.

The Chicago company, whose software analyzes data and subsequently optimizes marketing campaigns, generated about $40 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in 2016 and is projected to generate about $50 million of Ebitda in 2017, the people said.

In the event of a sale, the company could garner an Ebitda multiple in the teens, the people added.

Market Track is exploring a sale nearly five years after Aurora "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0020120810e88ar86e0" in August 2012.

Under Aurora's ownership, Market Track has been an active acquirer, having purchased Brandtale, Channel IQ LLC, New Momentum Inc. and Media IRIS LLC, among others. The data-analytics software provider named Dennis Moore as its president in 2016.

Market Track created in 2004 as a result of a merger between Market ADvantage Inc. and Media Track provides software for a range of industries, including retail, manufacturing, health care and financial services.

Private-equity firms are showing no signs of slowing their push for software deals. Investors have been particularly drawn to the sector's predictable revenue streams and consolidation opportunities, industry observers have said. Industry watchers also said the space is becoming a competitive landscape for private equity, with larger firms looking to invest in smaller, founder-backed companies. Investors have continued to write bigger checks for quality assets.

Recent deals made in the sector include KKR & Co.'s "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-invests-50-million-in-cherwell-software-1488297968" and the acquisition of ITRS Group Ltd. by TA Associates, a transaction announced Monday.

Elsewhere in the space, Avista Capital Partners-backed Telular Corp. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/avista-backed-telematics-company-weighs-sale-1486470604", WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.

Aurora typically invests in companies with enterprise values of $100 million to $1 billion across the industrial services and distribution; specialty manufacturing; and software and technology-enabled services sectors.

The Los Angeles firm in August received regulatory approval from the Federal Trade Commission"https://www.wsj.com/articles/aurora-capital-cleared-to-buy-stake-in-sunglasses-maker-solaray-1472580736", which sells sunglasses, wireless accessories, lighters and gifts.

Chicago-based GGP has signed new tenants such as Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., department store Belk Inc. and gym operator Life Time Fitness Inc. to replace Macy's stores. Only a handful of the planned J.C. Penney closures are expected to occur in REIT-owned malls.

Curry in a hurry as Just Eat delivers

What value can be put on a technology that has revolutionised the way we interact with people, music, video and information?

How much is the artificial intelligence that makes driverless cars a reality worth?

And what price an app that makes ordering a chicken tikka masala, saag aloo and a plain naan marginally easier than phoning up The Star of India and simply explaining what you d like?

Helpfully, the stock market makes these assessments for us: it currently values iPhone maker Apple on 16.7 times earnings, algorithm developer Google on 29.9 times, and takeaway food app Just Eat on 96.7 times.

Sometimes, it seems tech company multiples are more about growth rates than great leaps. This would certainly appear to be case with Just Eat, even if its smartphone app is now rated five-star by customers.

Its full-year results suggest that there remains huge scope for connecting people whose only recipe is grilled bread surprise with local short-order chefs.

Even after a 52 per cent rise in annual sales, to 376m, the group still has the 51 per cent of orders placed by telephone and notepad to go after. In the UK, this takeaway food market is now worth 6.1bn, having grown 10 per cent in the past year.

But is this enough to justify a valuation like that of a pizza-munching app developer? Arguably not   but then Just Eat now differs from an app developer in several ways.

It keeps beating profit forecasts   underlying earnings were 4 per cent ahead of consensus estimates.

Its cash generation is strong   net operating cash flow was up 31 per cent to 97m last year.

It is improving its profit margin even as it expands geographically   based on underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, its margin last year rose 700 basis points.

It is not buying sales   the UK business saw marketing costs dip as a percentage of revenue, as reordering rates increased.

And it appears to have technology that is easy to use, even with one hand on a deep fat fryer   more than 50 per cent of UK orders were processed in kitchens using its tablet-based platform.

However, the risk factors will smell all too familiar to tech investors. It is about to lose the chief executive who drove its growth, pre- and post-flotation.

One analyst described David Buttress as  one of the UK s standout entrepreneurs of the last decade , and no successor has yet been found. Its like-for-like order growth has also slowed for a second consecutive year.

As Just Eat s earnings improve, though, its valuation looks less rich: 33 times 2017 s earnings, 24 times 2018 s. It may not be delivering a technological revolution. But it has perhaps worked out the iPhone s   and the driverless car s   ultimate function.

A bet on Sports

Now Lombard knows why Sports Direct looks so familiar, writes Kate Burgess. It is not so much a merchant of trainers and swimsuits as a hedge fund making big currency bets.

No wonder hedgie Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management is such a fan. He can see that majority owner Mike Ashley likes a punt, whether on the football field or in financial markets.

On Tuesday, Sports Direct clarified its stake in Agent Provocateur, purveyor of upmarket briefs and bras. It is the latest in a line of retail investments. many of which were made using the complex derivatives of which hedge funds are so enamoured.

Also on Tuesday, Sports Direct reminded investors that its contracts hedging the euro against the dollar will expire in April.

Next year, the cost of supplies to Sports Direct s 200-plus stores in Europe could rise by 40 per cent. This euro-dollar hedge held up profits from Europe. But other currency punts have been more miss than hit.

In October, a complex hedging arrangement backfired and sterling weakness cost the group 15m. If sterling averages $1.20 to the dollar for the rest of the year, says Sports Direct, it could cost another 20m.

A jog through the group s accounts hints at the extent of the group s forward fixed-rate currency purchases and options contracts.

It seems that if sterling were to depreciate further, Sports Direct s pillow would be small and hard. In which case, yesterday s 5 per cent fall in its shares will seem sporting.

Not a sporting bet

With just a week to go until the Cheltenham Festival leaves Irish parishes and certain FT newsdesks somewhat depleted, bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair has been keen to garner headlines for its  drones to deliver winnings  publicity stunt, and its 35 per cent rise in underlying earnings.

But a 5 per cent share price fall suggests investors see a risk that it cannot lay off so easily: a government crackdown on lucrative but, in the words of its co-founder,  dangerously addictive  fixed-odds betting terminals. Results of this stewards inquiry are due in May.

The investment industry s excitement about the swelling world of Big Data is palpable at the moment.

A quantitative fund manager has entered into a partnership with Microsoft to use the tech giant s  Bing Predicts  data engine to improve its economic forecasting, another indication of how the investment industry is piling into the world of Big Data.

Boston-based Acadian Asset Management   which manages about $80bn   hopes that adding Microsoft s prediction tool will offer a real-time gauge of economic activity and help improve returns .

Bing Predicts uses a field of artificial intelligence called  machine learning  to scrape data from social media and Microsoft s Bing search engine, a distant rival to Google, to produce potentially predictive signals of consumer sentiment and economic growth.

The investment industry is scouring the world for new alternative datasets that they can use to augment traditional information sources to navigate markets, which has proven increasingly difficult in recent years. Hopes are high that the massive datasets now produced in real-time by consumers, companies and even governments will eventually become a vital source of market-beating  alpha .

John Chisholm, chief investment officer of Acadian, said in the statement:

 For the last thirty years we have used data to make objective investment decisions. Throughout our history we have been early adopters of new and novel sources of data to help us make better decisions and we are excited about the ways that new technology can help draw insight from large information sets. Microsoft is an ideal partner in this project, given its internet expertise and prediction capabilities.

Markets
Short Sellers Target Mall REITs; Bearish bets on retail-focused real estate investment trusts have risen, reflecting short sellers' belief that mall landlords will struggle

As U.S. retailers grapple with slumping sales, short sellers are turning their attention to the struggling chains' landlords.

Shares of retail-focused real-estate investment trusts, which own malls and shopping centers, have slumped since August last year, when Macy's Inc. announced it would close 100 stores. Sears Holdings and J.C. Penney Co. later said they would close more than 100 stores each.

A regional-mall REIT index plunged about 22% from late July until March 6, according to data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.

Short sellers have been especially active. The amount of so-called short interest, a measure of short-selling activity, on retail-focused REITs increased to $7.6 billion as of March 6 from $5.6 billion as of the end of December, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

Short sales are bearish bets in which investors borrow shares and quickly sell them, with the intention of buying shares later at lower prices to repay the loan, pocketing the difference.

Short sellers are betting landlords will face higher costs to spruce up their centers or struggle to replace stores that close, especially in weaker locations.

So far, short trades against REITs with more class B and C malls, such as CBL & Associates Properties Inc., Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Washington Prime Group, have been more profitable, according to data from S3 Partners.

But even shares of Class A mall REITs, which own the most productive malls in the country, have faced pressure. Short interest on mall giant Simon Property Group jumped to $1.3 billion on March 3 from $916 million at the end of 2016, near its record high. Over the same period, short interest trades in GGP Inc. increased to a record $689 million from $430 million.

"There has been a steady drumbeat of negative reports from anchor retailers in the mall," said James Sullivan, managing director at BTIG LLC, a financial-services firm. "As a result, when we keep hearing bad news it adds to the impression that there is a problem in the malls."

Other short sellers are focusing on mall debt. Losses on securitized mortgages tied to retail property rose to $1.7 billion last year from $1.3 billion in 2015, the only property segment that showed an increase in losses, according to Moody's Investors Service.

Kin Lee, senior portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors, said his firm, which invests in commercial mortgage-backed securities, is becoming more selective in buying CMBS backed by malls.

"We don't favor deals that have too much exposure to malls," said Mr. Lee. "These headlines haven't been completely new."

Spreads on the BBB-rated CMBS deals that have more retail real-estate exposure are widening, according to Trepp LLC, a real-estate data service. Widening spreads indicate the perceived risk of default is rising.

Some investors are short-selling CMBS through the CMBX, a credit-default swap index that tracks the values of bonds backed by mortgages on malls, office buildings and other commercial property. They are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bonds-tied-to-dying-malls-could-be-the-next-big-short-1487073601" where stores could close in quick succession, triggering debt defaults.

While investors are betting in part on continued store closures, some analysts including BTIG's Mr. Sullivan argue that some mall REITs, especially class-A mall operators, have been oversold.

The department-store closures haven't hit REIT-owned malls much so far, and mall REITs have been able to backfill other vacancies with new tenants, analysts said.

Chicago-based GGP, for instance, has signed new tenants such as Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., department store Belk Inc. and gym operator Life Time Fitness Inc. to replace Macy's stores. Only a handful of the planned J.C. Penney closures are expected to occur in REIT-owned malls.

Why CIOs Aren't Prepared for Big Data ; Richard Sherlund of Barclays says the challenge for CIOs in dealing with big data  is what to do with all this information

As companies scale their use of big data, the move brings a lot of questions. Does it require new architecture? Does it require new platforms? The Wall Street Journal's Jay Greene discussed the topic with Richard Sherlund, managing director and chairman, software investment banking, at Barclays. The discussion covered everything from going beyond big data that looks to the past to newer applications that will be able to learn and make predictions.

Edited excerpts follow.

MR. GREENE: You have this idea that we are at the precipice of a big change in the way systems architecture is set up and that many CIOs are unprepared.

MR. SHERLUND: I think the Internet of Things has enabled industrial companies to start thinking about the need to move to big data.

Because in the past you really couldn't aggregate big data. It was too expensive. But we have available to us in the cloud now, we can start to collect big data.

The next challenge is what do you do with that. Because companies that just had big data have been disappointed that it's not creating value. But once you can find the correlations in the data through machine learning, you can then begin to have predictive capabilities.

MR. GREENE: What is making CIOs unprepared for this change?

MR. SHERLUND: I don't know that CIOs are building the next generation of applications. What they're doing is building apps where they have some domain expertise. We're seeing this everywhere.

Data in the air

MR. GREENE: What's fueling this platform are Internet of Things devices, right?

MR. SHERLUND: The new Airbus has 70,000 sensors. None of that data comes down to earth. That stays on the airplane. That has to be processed locally. There are security reasons that you don't want that data going back and forth.

If you're running GE's jet engines, a lot of the correlation's going to be done in the cloud on Amazon or Microsoft. But some of that data's going to be processed on the edge [of the data network].

MR. GREENE: You talk about how this data is about systems of prediction essentially. So walk me through a little bit of that. Are we talking about these sensors predicting on an airplane when an engine's about to fail or when it needs maintenance?

MR. SHERLUND: First of all, you have to have the data scientists to optimize for machine learning. Because for an aircraft engine you may be looking at [performance data such as] temperature, vibration, pressures, whatever.

There was an example of a carrier over in Europe. And they were trying to figure out, "Well, why is the engine wearing out faster than machine-learning predictions?" And it turns out they were short-haul flights. So you're at lower elevations wear and tear with more friction.

You have to have some domain expertise to be intelligent as a data scientist in looking at that industry. Every industry has its quirks.

There are probably 100 or more [machine-learning companies] out there. They're just so small, you know? You've got half a dozen or a dozen data scientists that get together, and [the companies are] for sale now at $100 to $200 million. You buy it, and then they leave, you're kind of hosed.

You wish there were a couple big machine-learning companies out there. As an investment banker, I'd be all over them now because there's such high demand for them.

The progress at hand

MR. GREENE: Are there companies that you think are further along in this architecture, are doing it well?

MR. SHERLUND: I think there are industries that are further along. I think the industrial sector is kind of hyperfocused on this right now.

I think health care, there's just enormous predictive value in the health-care field. You get physicals. And you can do correlations and realize kind of predictive things. Hospitals are huge in terms of the kinds of systems that need to be tied together. So, I mean, virtually every industry will be significantly impacted by this.

One of the things that's exciting to me is at the highest level, which is the applications level. So if I know when a machine's going to fail, let's say it's a jet engine. You know, a 95% probability in 200 hours that it's going to fail. If I'm a software company in the business of providing a sales-force automation system, I want that data to be surfaced to the salesperson [so that he or she can attempt to make a sales call to that jet-engine customer about the need to repair or replace the engine].

Because that now becomes a lead-generation system. Not a more static customer-relationship-management system. I'm now telling a salesperson, "Call that customer."

And because I integrate with the data, I know about the product. I can say, "This is the part. This is how old it is. Should be repaired or replaced. Call the customer now and notify them."

CIO Network (A Special Report) --- What's Next in Technology: Three venture capitalists -- Steve Herrod, Peter Levine and Rich Wong -- predict the coming wave of emerging technologies

What is the next wave of emerging technologies going to look like? The ones that chief information officers should be paying attention to?

The Wall Street Journal's Rolfe Winkler spoke with Steve Herrod, managing director of General Catalyst, Peter Levine, general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, and Rich Wong, partner at Accel Partners. The conversation touched on machine learning and the future of big data and cloud computing. Edited excerpts follow.

MR. WINKLER: VCs are supposed to predict the future. So, what's coming next?

MR. WONG: A lot of the traditional categories just redone in a modern way. I'm sure we'll talk a little bit about [machine learning and artificial intelligence]. Those are two areas that I think are interesting.

MR. LEVINE: I have this theory that cloud computing goes away in the not-too-distant future.

If we look at the ebb and flow of computing over the history of computing, we've seen things go from [centralized mainframes to the centralized web]. The cloud-computing phenomenon right now is really centralized, it's basically a mainframe.

I believe there is now a shift, a return to the edge where computing gets done much more at the edge than in the cloud. The Internet of Everything, specifically if you think about self-driving cars, is a great example of this. A self-driving car is a data center on wheels. And it has 200-plus central processing units. It's got to do all its computation at the endpoint and only pass back to the cloud, if it's connected at all, important bits of curated information.

If the car had to wait for the cloud to respond to the information being processed, it would blow through stop signs and crash because of the latency and because of the processing. As we see these new devices come as part of the edge, I believe that edge computing will start to dominate the landscape. And it will unlock a whole level of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I believe we will see a proliferation of edge computing come back into vogue.

MR. HERROD: The future, as the past has always been, is heterogeneity. New apps, old apps. I'm sure a lot of you go through a bucketing exercise where you take all of these apps that you have, and you put them into different buckets. New ones that you're going to invest in, old ones that you want to put in a corner and not break. You take applications from one place to the future or leave them where they are and try to make them more digestible.

MR. WINKLER: As you think about your hot new technologies, how do CIOs react?

MR. LEVINE: Every company these days is becoming a software company. Old companies that had nothing to do with software in the past all have software development activities to unlock the invention that's occurring inside of these organizations. And so the developer is a very important part of that overall ecosystem. I would argue that the developer is the tail wagging the dog these days.

When I was a developer, I couldn't buy a pencil. I had no budget, nothing. Now developers are very opinionated about what they want, the needs of the organization. We've seen situations where if the organization doesn't provide the developer what the developer needs, the developer leaves and goes to work at another company where they sort of get the tools and services that they think are more adequate for them to do their job.

MR. HERROD: The challenge I would give to all the startups that we invest in is, how can you make it incredibly digestible? Really simple to show some kind of value without sending someone on site. Give some kind of assessment that says, "If you used us, here's how we'd save on people cost, on capital cost."

MR. WINKLER: Hype versus reality, as you guys see it, when it comes to machine-learning AI. What's hype and what's reality?

MR. WONG: What's hype is the all-seeing, all-knowing chatbot that can handle unbounded conversation. I think reality is, I can find a photo of my daughter in Google photos when she was two years old to now that she's 10, geotagged in every location. There are a ton of commercial applications to make business processes more efficient. What are the percentage of help-desk calls that are change password or reset password? That probably can be automated in a way that doesn't require as much human interaction.

MR. LEVINE: If we were sitting here a couple of years ago talking about big data, in my mind big data, that was sort of 1.0 of big data. Now the Holy Grail is not to be reactive, what happened in the past, but be predictive about what's going to happen in the future.

MR. WONG: We have a background-check company. Uber does all the North American background checks through them. They use machine learning rather than doing it in a manual way. They can deliver a product that's more accurate, faster and about a third of the cost.

MR. LEVINE: We think about infrastructure going to the cloud. There probably [will be fewer employees as more services move to the cloud], but at least they provide a higher-level service. What I'd like to see is instead of us spending time managing [cloud infrastructure, that would be] handled automatically in the not-too-distant future and elevate our staffs to go solve more-critical business issues on top of that underlying infrastructure.

The unknowable future is becoming just a bit more knowable.

It's the next stage in the evolution of information technology, beyond the early systems of record and the systems of engagement that allowed companies to interact with customers and employees in new ways, according to Richard Sherlund, chairman of software banking at Barclays PLC. "Now, we're going to systems of prediction. . . .I think this delivers a lot more value to the market," he said at the annual Wall Street Journal CIO Network meeting in San Francisco.

This latest generation of machine learning and artificial intelligence can reason in new ways. Neil Jacobstein, chair of artificial intelligence and robotics at Singularity University, said an AI recently beat some of the top poker players in the world. "This is a big deal," he said, because it signals the ability of AI to deal with incomplete information, bluffing and misinformation -- skills that businesses and public officials could use in any number of ways.

Here's a look at how conference participants see this latest evolution of technology -- and all it implies -- unfolding.

CIO Network (A Special Report) --- The Keys to Transforming IT Architecture: Dheeraj Pandey and Lise Buyer say migrating to a new system poses a lot of crucial questions

Competitive advantage in business today means having the computing power to analyze oceans of data on the back end while providing a seamless customer experience up front. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud computing are the new tools of the trade, and companies everywhere are striving to adopt them -- with varying degrees of success.

Wall Street Journal reporter Steven Norton discussed the challenges with Dheeraj Pandey, co-founder of Nutanix, a cloud-based platform that helps companies transform their IT infrastructure, and Lise Buyer, a partner at the IPO consultancy Class V Group. Edited excerpts follow.

MR. NORTON: What are some common obstacles to getting companies to transform their IT architecture to artificial intelligence, machine learning and the cloud?

MR. PANDEY: The big one is inertia. The big question is, how do you migrate from your current to the new? How do I go from what I really want to do versus keeping the lights on today as well?

MR. NORTON: If you are a board member being asked to endorse a shift in the data center or a new strategy, what questions do you ask the CIO?

MS. BUYER: I surveyed a bunch of folks in that position to say, "Hey, what matters?" And, of course, the answer is flexibility. Am I stuck into a rigid architecture? Or do I have something that can grow with me? Two is security. Three, scalability. And fourth is the economics of it all. Not just the economics of purchasing the specific equipment and software. But how does that affect the people in the field? How does that affect the people whose data is being migrated? And what risks am I taking in all of that? I want the agility of the cloud. I also want some stuff over the public cloud. But I also want some stuff that I control. I've got service-level agreements I've got to be responsible for, and nobody out there is going to do it for me. So how do I make sure I am delivering to my customers while I am effectively transitioning?

MR. NORTON: More and more, we're seeing automation applied to IT. Do you envision a future where machines are self-healing and are using analytics to basically run themselves? And if so, how does that impact the structure of the IT organization?

MS. BUYER: This is not just, "Oh my goodness, we have to keep jobs for people." You need folks who understand your system, how your system operates, what to do when something is running amok. That's one of the issues a lot of folks are thinking about in terms of making the decision of going all to the big providers versus keeping some of the solutions on the premises.

MR. PANDEY: At the end of the day, there's a 12- to 24-month target that CIOs should have. How much do you pay your systems integrators, how much do you pay your managed-services people? Because that's tactical. There's so much money being invested. You know, "I'm going pay a systems integrator in India to watch for my server, which doesn't go down, and if it goes down, they go and put people or bodies to throw at the problem." There's a rate for it, like $75 per server. I'm like, "Wow, you pay 75 bucks an hour for somebody to watch it, when machines should be doing this stuff?"

So there's a 12- to 24-month renegotiation with these managed-services contracts to unravel. But in the longer term, I think it is absolutely true that if you can't really do continuous innovation, continuous consumption, like the way your Gmail, your Facebook, your Google apps, and all that stuff is being constantly upgraded -- that's the idea of cloud. These mundane things about how do you upgrade every one month are probably as important as anything else that you can think of. And systems integrators don't get it, because they don't own the different formwares and softwares and hardwares. So it's very hard for them to actually get it right. It has to come from the factory of the operating system, one-click upgrades and the fact that you're able to migrate from old hardware to the new. It's all happening in pure software.

MR. NORTON: So what are the people who were watching the servers doing now?

MR. PANDEY: I think they're scratching their heads. What would India do now if it's going to get more automated and more cloudy and so on? What happens to the skills? Because the skills are not there to really think of a world where machines are more intelligent, able to self-heal and able to self-upgrade.

MR. NORTON: What's your advice for CIOs about how to start to communicate a change in architecture and business process? What things should they be looking out for when making a big architecture change?

MS. BUYER: That's been a challenge for CIOs since time immemorial, for everything from hand-held devices issued by the company to, "Hey, bring your own." There's really got to be a "Here's why you need to do this. Here's why this is in your best interest as well as in our best interest."

MR. PANDEY: There's this natural convergence that's happening in the overall architecture, because we are spinning up things faster. We're going from waterfall, which is the mainframe approach, to more agile methodologies where people really want to spin them up and spin them down and so on. That is probably the biggest shift, and it's happening with our customers.

The CIOs, their attention spans are becoming smaller. We are throwing out our phones every two years, every one year, as opposed to what it used to be with land lines and so on. So, in that scheme of things, a lot of the re-architecture has to happen in the application as well, to where you are not thinking about five years of deployment, but months and weeks, and having that elasticity in your architecture.

Carlyle Group LP stands to more than triple its money on the sale of ITRS Group Ltd., a maker of software for the financial-services sector, to TA Associates.

The global buyout firm is expected to return about 3.5 times its investment on the sale, said a person familiar with the transaction, although the person didn't specify whether the return is gross or net.

The deal is expected to close in April.

London-based ITRS sells real-time monitoring and analytics software to financial-services enterprises to help them manage their technology infrastructure and business operations.

Washington, D.C., firm Carlyle invested in ITRS in 2011 through Carlyle Europe Technology Partners II LP, according to the release. The 2008-vintage fund wrapped up with  522 million. The ITRS sale represents the sixth exit for the vehicle.

William Blair & Co. and Travers Smith LLP are acting as financial adviser and legal adviser, respectively, to ITRS on the transaction. Goodwin Procter LLP is acting as legal adviser to TA Associates.

TA Associates leads buyout and minority recapitalizations of companies in the business-services, consumer, financial-services, health-care and technology sectors.

The Boston firm also Monday said it acquired a minority equity interest in Interswitch Ltd., a digital payments and commerce company in Africa.

Leaders  summit in Versailles

French President Franois Hollande will host the leaders of Spain, Italy and Germany this week at a  mini-summit  in Versailles to prepare for a larger EU meeting later in the month that will mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.

Mariano Rajoy, Paolo Gentiloni, Angela Merkel and Mr Hollande will discuss their visions for the future of the EU after Brexit. Mr Hollande said that the four-nation Versailles meeting is important so that leaders  can defend the European project together and with strength .

On March 25, a larger group of EU leaders will gather in Rome to remember the day 60 years ago when France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the treaty that established the European Economic Community and paved the way for the modern EU.

The Versailles meeting comes amid speculation about whether Mr Hollande will seek a senior EU role when he steps down as president of France after the French election in May. He has been rumoured as a possible replacement for European Council head Donald Tusk, but aides have publicly denied this is on the cards.

Hammond delivers UK Budget

Philip Hammond will present his first and his last spring Budget. The Budget is moving to the autumn this year and the chancellor has promised there is no need for two occasions for tinkering with the tax system every year. Out goes the Autumn Statement to be replaced by a Budget and in the spring there will be an update to the economic forecasts. That is Mr Hammond s current intention at least.

The chancellor has told the Treasury that to build credibility behind the idea of only one fiscal event a year, he will make the Autumn Budget the main event of 2017 and this week s Budget has been downgraded to include few tax or spending measures.

As ever, the backdrop to the Budget will be framed by the economic and public finance forecasts produced by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. It will need to revise higher its growth forecast for 2016 and 2017 because the UK economy has performed more strongly than it expected at the end of last year. Tax receipts have also been stronger than forecast. But the improvement in the 2016-17 outlook is unlikely to carry forward for the whole forecasting period, as consumer finances are squeezed by higher prices this year following the sharp fall in sterling.

Although the chancellor will refrain from large tax reforms, he will act to resolve some thorny political problems. The Treasury will probably increase the generosity of transitional relief in business rates for those facing the largest increases and give more money to social care to relieve some pressure on services. This is really a holding statement and the chancellor s known desire to modernise the tax system to reflect the nature of society in the digital age will wait for the autumn.

Full-year results from Adidas

After a difficult 2015, last year was a strong one for Adidas, with the world s second largest sportswear group raising its profit forecast four times, sending its shares rocketing.

Precisely how strong will become clear on when the German group spells out its final figures for 2016. Analysts expect net income of  1bn from revenues of  19.3bn. That would be a big improvement on 2015, when Adidas managed a net profit of  640m from sales of  16.9bn. But it would still leave Adidas s margins some way short of those of arch rival Nike.

As such, much of the focus will be on how new chief executive Kasper Rorsted, who succeeded veteran chief Herbert Hainer in October, plans to close the gap.

Mr Rorsted   who was successful in boosting margins in his previous job as boss of consumer goods conglomerate Henkel   has already made clear that he does not intend to scrap Mr Hainer s strategy. But he is likely to indicate some changes. His plans for North America, where Adidas lags furthest behind Nike, will be particularly closely watched.

Thursday

Aviva and L&G results due

Expect some unhappy noises when insurers Aviva and Legal & General announce their full-year results, on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.

At the end of February, Aviva said that its numbers would include a 385m hit because of changes to the way that large personal injury claims are calculated. The changes are likely to increase costs sharply for the insurers.

Aside from that, analysts are hoping that the company will provide some concrete signs that its digital strategy is bearing fruit, such as evidence of better cross-selling. Panmure Gordon is expecting full-year operating profits to rise 8 per cent to 2.9bn.

At Legal & General, there could be dissatisfaction with the EU s Solvency II capital rules. The insurer has made its unhappiness with the regime clear in the past, saying that it makes it much more difficult for insurers to invest in assets such as infrastructure. Some rivals, such as Prudential, have reacted to Solvency II by exiting those markets most affected by the rules, such as annuities. Lega l& General has made no such move, so watch out for its comments on the outlook for the annuity market.

The results will be the last presented by Mark Gregory, the outgoing finance director. He will be replaced later this year by former EY partner Jeff Davies. Panmure Gordon is expecting L&G to produce operating profits of 1.6bn, up 13 per cent on last year.

ECB meets amid inflation rise

The European Central Bank s governing council is set to meet in Frankfurt, where it will discuss the recent rise in inflation across the single currency area.

After years of undershooting the central bank s target, inflation is around the 2 per cent mark once more.

Few expect this to lead to any immediate changes in the central bank s policy. With most of the rise in price pressures driven by higher oil costs, policymakers think inflation is likely to decline over the course of the year. That means the central bank s interest rates will remain on hold at their current record low levels. Plans to buy  780bn-worth of bonds under the quantitative easing programme are likely to remain on track.

The council s hawks could, however, push for an early debate on slowing the pace of the bank s bond buying spree next year. Jens Weidmann, Bundesbank president, suggested last week that the central bank would need to upgrade its forecasts for inflation. The last set showed prices were expected to rise by 1.3 per cent over the course of 2016. The next round of forecasts are unveiled when ECB president Mario Draghi meets the press at 1.30pm UK time.

Friday

US non-farm payrolls out

Following hawkish remarks from a handful of Federal Reserve speakers and upbeat economic data, traders will look to the US jobs report   that comes during the central bank s communications blackout period   for further evidence of strength in the US economy that could cement the Fed s case for raising rates.

Economists currently expect that data will show the US economy added 180,000 jobs last month, compared with the 227,000 jobs added in January. They also expect the unemployment rate to slip to 4.7 per cent, from 4.8 per cent previously.

But even if payrolls turn up light, Tom Porcelli, economist at RBC Capital Markets, argues that  wages will be the linchpin to whether the Fed  likes  this report enough to vindicate hiking in March .

And economists do expect that wages did improve. Average hourly earnings are projected to rise 0.3 per cent in February from the previous month, when they climbed 0.1 per cent. That would leave earnings up 2.8 per cent from a year ago, compared with 2.5 per cent in January.

An uptick in wage inflation would help strengthen the case for a March move, as the Fed s preferred inflation measure is approaching the central bank s 2 per cent target.

With federal fund futures currently pointing to an 90 per cent chance that the Fed lifts rates in two weeks a better than expected jobs report could bolster those odds further.

The "https://www.ft.com/content/fc2f4515-ce73-386a-9a9c-aa31acd6cbbc" will offer shareholders a 20 per cent increase in their full-year dividend, further indicating the group is preparing for the expected failure of its  29bn merger with Deutsche Borse.

The UK group said this week that it was unlikely the deal, more than a year in the making, was unlikely to get clearance from antitrust regulators in Brussels because the LSE was unable to meet one of the watchdog s demands. The deal will proceed until regulators make a formal decision in a month s time.

On Friday the LSE proposed final dividend of 31.2p, making a full-year dividend increase of 20 per cent to 43.2p, to reflect  the strong outlook for the group .

For the year to December 31 total income at the LSE rose 17 per cent to 1.7bn. Operating profit rose 6 per cent to 426.1m. Pre-tax profits fell to 192.9m from 357.1m a year ago on increased costs relating to the deal and higher tax charges.

The world s biggest advertising group made revenues of 14.4bn in the year ending 31 December 2016, an increase of 12.5 per cent on the previous year at constant currency rates.

Like-for-like revenues   a key measure for the multinational media agencies   were up three per cent in line with analysts  expectations and reflecting a more difficult final quarter of 2016.

The company, which is run by Martin Sorrell, recorded profit before tax of 1.9bn, up 12.5 per cent in constant currency.

However, WPP said it had experienced a  relatively slow  start to 2017 with January like-for-like revenue up 1.5 per cent and net sales up 1.2 per cent, against stronger comparatives. It predicted 2 per cent growth in revenue and net sales this year   slightly lower than analysts  expectations.

Financial publisher "https://www.ft.com/content/c9d840a9-f692-3b84-add1-9069f012e40f" has struck a deal to buy RISI, a US-based  price reporting agency for the global forest products markets. 

The $125m deal will give it full control over RISI, which was founded in 1985. For those unfamiliar &

Its product suite consists of pricing data, mill intelligence and analytics as well as news, research and conferences covering the pulp, packaging, wood products, wood fibre and saw logs markets. Its price indices are critical to the daily business operations and trading activities of major paper and board, packaging and other forest-product companies.

Euromoney says its new target generated revenues of $29.6m in 2016. The deal is subject to regulatory approval. On a similar note, last year, Euromoney bought FastMarkets, a metals market information provider.

From "https://www.ft.com/content/5fcbaa28-ff56-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30":

In the 1930s, in-flight refuelling involved someone throwing a hose out of a Handley Page biplane, while Sir Alan Cobham   or his co-pilot, the not-yet-novelist Nevil Shute   leaned out of the window of an Airspeed Courier, and tried to catch it without being drenched in kerosene. Photographs of the procedure resemble scenes from the cartoon show Stop The Pigeon, in which the villainous Dick Dastardly and sidekick Muttley pursue avian messengers in vintage aircraft.

Today, with the animated duo s real-life counterparts announcing a $54bn increase in US defence spending, it is hard to see how mid-air refuelling could have got harder. But the successor to Sir Alan s company thinks it has. Problems with Cobham s US Air Force KC-46 tanker contract led the FTSE 250 group to announce a 150m charge last month, 574m of non-cash impairments and a profit warning   its fifth in 15 months.

On Thursday, alongside a 32 per cent hit to operating profit, Cobham also launched a 500m rescue rights issue   its second in nine months.

New chief executive David Lockwood blamed the instruments and the weather. He had found  weaknesses in management and financial controls; contractual and commercial failures and 	. 	. 	. 	more challenging market conditions . He knows how easily control can be lost: his previous company, Laird, issued a profit warning just three months after he left.

Beyond the Square Mile

Asian markets went into reverse on Friday after Wall Street pulled back from a "https://www.ft.com/content/6e0ef938-fef1-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30". Australia s S&P/ASX 200 index was down 0.8 per cent, while Tokyo s Topix index was off 0.6 per cent and the Hang Seng index was 0.6 per cent lower in Hong Kong. China s Shanghai Composite was down 0.4 per cent, while the technology-focused Shenzhen Composite was flat.

In the US overnight, the S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent.

In Japan, data released on Friday showed core inflation had turned positive for the first time since December 2015.

The US dollar index, a measure of the currency against a basket of global peers, was down 0.1 per cent in Asia on Friday, after a rise of more than 1 per cent over the previous two sessions.

Yields on US 10-year Treasuries, which move inversely to price, rose as much as 1 basis point on Friday before falling back to be near flat at 2.4815. The chances of the Fed raising short-term interest rates in March now sits at 90 per cent, according to market pricing, and has triggered a five-day slide in the 10-year Treasury price.

Gold was down 0.2 per cent in Asia at $1,232.14 an ounce, the yellow metal s 1.2 per cent fall in the previous session was its largest one-day drop since mid-December.

Oil prices were recovering after a more than 2 per cent drop on Thursday. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 0.1 per cent at $55.13 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate climbed the same amount to $52.67.

Intraday

US index futures suggest the S&P 500 will shed 6 points to 2,376, when trading gets under way later in New York.

Also in the US, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is due to speak on Friday, when investors will also be able to pore over another batch of employment data. Her speech comes after Fed governor Lael Brainard, one of the bank s most cautious members, said another rate rise would be  appropriate soon    joining her colleague Jerome Powell and making a rate rise in March all but certain.

Corporate earnings reports out today include LSE, WPP and Berendsen.

Tech
Bet on Snap Shows Luck's Role in Venture Business; Lightspeed's $8 million investment yielded stock worth $2.1 billion after IPO

Corrections & Amplifications

Google bought Nest Labs in 2014. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it purchased the company last year. (March 3, 2017)

Jeremy Liew got lucky. A colleague at Lightspeed Venture Partners told him that his daughter and her friends were hooked on a new app called Snapchat. Mr. Liew, sensing the next hot thing in tech, wanted to invest.

It took days for the venture capitalist to track down the young man behind the company, a Stanford University senior named Evan Spiegel, and then "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-jeremy-liew-became-snapchats-first-investor-1485199846" to persuade him to stop by Lightspeed's office.

That meeting in early 2012 led to one of the most lucrative startup bets since the dot-com boom. Lightspeed's $485,000 seed money, plus another $7.5 million investment, yielded stock that is worth about $2.1 billion after the company now known as Snap Inc. traded up 44% to $24.48 on Thursday. Venture firm Benchmark, another early Snap investor, put in $24 million for a stake worth about $3.2 billion after Thursday's close.

Mr. Liew declined to comment about the IPO and the company's future prospects.

Striking gold in the venture business is exceedingly rare, the product of not only investment acumen and business connections but also lots of luck. Blockbuster investments can cement a firm's reputation for years to come, and give it an inside track on the next wave of promising entrepreneurs.

Accel Partners"http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2012/02/01/facebook-ipo-who-is-getting-rich/" of an investment made 12 years ago after its investment principal Kevin Efrusy got a tip from an intern at Stanford about a website called Thefacebook. Mr. Efrusy all but broke down the startup's door to convince the company to take his firm's money.

Accel's $15 million investment ultimately returned $5.6 billion after Facebook Inc. went public in 2012, a nearly 400-to-1 payout, according to the firm's spokesman.

Years of lackluster returns may have taken some shine off Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, yet it still has a top venture brand name 18 years after it struck deals for dot-com era winners like Alphabet Inc., then called Google. That $12 million investment in 1999 reaped $4.8 billion for Kleiner, said a spokeswoman for the firm.

Kleiner missed the ensuing social-networking craze, betting on Friendster instead of Facebook, and steered vast sums of money into capital-intensive clean-technology projects, a troubled investment that is taking years for Kleiner to shake off. Kleiner did invest in Snap in 2014, and will roughly double its return in the IPO, and has had several successful investments such as in Nest Labs, bought by Google in 2014 for over $3 billion.

Mr. Efrusy says finding startups like Facebook or Snap is akin to getting struck by lightning, but that smart investors prepare themselves by looking for companies and founders with unique characteristics. "You have to be holding a metal rod in a thunderstorm in the middle of Kansas," he said.

Mr. Liew watches for social-media companies exploding in popularity among young women, who he says are the trendsetters.

Even for the best funds, the vast majority of venture deals aren't lottery winners. Of the more than 14,300 U.S. companies that raised venture capital in the past decade, Snap will become one of just 30, or 0.2%, that later got valued in an IPO at $1 billion or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

The venture industry hopes Snap's offering ignites the IPO market, which dried up last year in part because public investors haven't shown a willingness to pay up for private tech companies whose valuations rocketed past their business fundamentals. Fewer IPOs mean venture firms are struggling to turn their paper gains into cash.

Lightspeed, founded in 2000, hopes investments in Snap, and other companies like Nutanix Inc. and AppDynamics Inc. that have gone public or were acquired, will solidify its place as a top firm.

Back in 2012, Mr. Liew tried at least three different ways to reach Snapchat before he located Mr. Spiegel's name. His lucky break was that Mr. Spiegel was a Stanford student, where Mr. Liew graduated, giving him access to the university's Facebook group. Mr. Liew messaged Mr. Spiegel and got a response in minutes.

When Mr. Spiegel visited Lightspeed's office he shared internal analytics data that showed user growth exploding. The 21-year-old impressed Lightspeed's partners with his insight that evaporating conversations meant people shared more spontaneously on Snapchat than other social networks.

"Accidents don't last," Mr. Efrusy said. "Entrepreneurs get lucky, but they also have to be good. Look at the difference between the trajectories of Facebook and Myspace."

Fears Snapchat was "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/04/16/snapchats-spiegel-on-sexy-selfies/" were allayed by data that showed most photos were shared while teens were in school. About two weeks after that meeting, Lightspeed struck a deal while Mr. Spiegel was on spring break in Argentina.

Lightspeed's trophy investment is slightly tarnished, though. A condition of the firm's investment, earlier reported by the New York Times, guaranteed Lightspeed the right of first refusal to invest a large amount in Snap's subsequent funding round.

The idea was to protect its economic interest in the company if things went well. But when a new investor, General Catalyst Partners, emerged in the summer of 2012, Lightspeed exercised its right to boost its ownership and that investor walked away. This angered Mr. Spiegel, who blamed Lightspeed for the broken deal, according to people familiar with the matter. Rival venture capitalists have seized on the episode, calling it a blemish on Lightspeed's record.

A Snap spokeswoman declined to comment.

Mr. Liew declines to discuss the episode in detail. He still communicates on occasion with Snap executives, according to people familiar with the matter, contrary to rumors that all communication has ceased in recent years. He was in attendance at the company's IPO roadshow event in San Francisco on Monday.

SEC freezes accounts in SoftBank-Fortress insider trading probe

The US Securities and Exchange Commission secured an emergency court order freezing the brokerage accounts of investors who engaged in  highly suspicious  trading ahead ofFortress Investment Group s acquisition bySoftBank of Japan.

The unidentified traders reaped $3.6m by placing a series of perfectly timed orders for Fortress shares and derivativesthrough Maybank Securities in Singapore and RJ O Brien in London, according to the top US markets watchdog.

The Maybank traders began buying Fortress shares just 33 minutes after the company s board of directors received an email confirming the on-again, off-again deal would proceed, the "https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/SEC" said. Shares in the US-listed private equity house rose 28 per cent on February 14, the day the deal was disclosed.

The narrow window between news of the apparent deal and the first trades  strongly suggests insider trading in a very high position, meaning directors, officers, lawyers or bankers associated with the deal,  said John Coffee, head of Columbia Law School s Center for Corporate Governance.  This wasn t the usual slow gossip among half-a-dozen hedge funds. 

All the Maybank trades were made within a 24-hour period before the deal to buy theprivate equity firm was announced, the SEC said. The purchases of derivatives known as  contracts for difference  through RJ O Brien took place between February 10 and 14, it said.

At one point over the weekend, the deal nearly cratered , Thomas Bosch, an SEC enforcement attorney, told the US District Court in New Jersey.  The timing, size and profitability of these trades are highly suspicious,  the SEC said in its civil complaint.

The action was filed in New Jersey because the trades at issue passed through computer servers in the Garden State, according to the SEC court filing, which asks US District Judge Claire Cecchi to order the traders to disgorge their profits and pay a penalty.

The unusualsize of bets in the options market before the deal led to speculation that word of Softbank s $3.3bn acquisition had leaked. The volume of options trading in Fortress was more than eight times the normal level ahead of the deal s public announcement.

Insider trading cases involving unidentified foreign defendants usually end with the accused settling the charges within six to 12 months, said Donald Langevoort, a former SEC attorney.

But Prof Coffee said the SEC might struggle to uncover the traders  identities. The commission can pressure the foreign brokerages to surrender their names, but they could be just a  front  for the actual account owners, he said.

Eventual extradition of those accused also is unlikely, meaning enforcement action will be limited to civil penalties.  There s no possibility of a criminal case even though this looks like a clear-cut case of insider trading,  he said.

The SEC s anti-insider trading campaign has been fuelled by its number-crunching data analytics office. A team of 10 specialists has compiled  billions of lines  of brokerage trading data that they review for evidence of abusive trading, Mary Jo White, the former SEC chair, said late last year.

 The SEC s computers today with respect to any trading in any US-listed company are extremely sophisticated,  said Mr Langevoort, who teacheslaw at Georgetown University.

In its most recent fiscal year, the SEC charged 78 parties with insider trading, down from 87 cases one year earlier.

The customers of Maybank bought 950,000 shares in Fortress hours before the announcement, selling them the next morning for $1.7m. RJ O Brien s customers bought CFDs and shares in Fortress, which they sold on February 15 for $1.9m, according to the SEC s complaint seeking the freeze.

Discussions between SoftBank and Fortress began in December, and the two companies initially planned to finalise the deal over the weekend of February 10-12, putting it to a board vote at Fortress on February 12.

The RJ O Brien clients began buying CFDs on February 10, through an account with Merrill Lynch, just before that weekend.

The only other time Maybank customers bought any Fortress stock through the broker s account at UBS was in February 2016, when 10,000 shares were bought and then sold in April.

The emergency court order, obtained by the SEC on February 24, will prevent the traders from accessing any of those gains. As yet, the SEC said it did not know the identities of the traders, but said in the complaint they are  believed to be foreign traders trading through foreign accounts .

A phone call to RJ O Brien and an email to Maybank after hours in Singapore were not immediately returned.

Man Group ends tough year with swing into loss; Financials

Hedge fund takes hit from decline in fees and $281m writedown at trading unit

Man Group is managing more money than ever, but losses and redemptions in many of its funds during a difficult year led to a pre-tax loss for 2016 and a writedown of the value of GLG, its discretionary trading unit. The world's largest publicly traded hedge fund group managed $80.9bn at the end of 2016, up 3 per cent from the end of 2015.

The company was buoyed by a 20 per cent increase in investments in its quant alternative strategies, which use computer algorithms to make investing decisions, positive performance in its long-only and credit funds, and the purchase of Aalto Invest, a $1.7bn US property manager. But GLG was hit by redemptions in alternative and long-only strategies, driven by poor returns and a move among investors towards cheaper, passive products.

The company reported a pre-tax loss of $272m, down from a profit of $184m in 2015, largely driven by the impairment of GLG's carrying value, currency swings and investment losses. Its overall investment movement, however, was positive, netting $3.2bn.

Both management and performance fees at Man also declined, but one of the biggest hits was from foreign exchange translation and other moves, which cost it $2.9bn, just slightly less than in 2015. Shares in the group fell nearly 10 per cent after the news, and closed down nearly 2 per cent at 143.5p.

"The market environment was very unforgiving for the first three quarters and Man found it difficult to generate performance for clients and performance fees," Luke Ellis , chief executive, said. "This led to disappointing profits."

The company has started 2017 with "a good pipeline of interest from clients and encouraging performance across most of our strategies", he said, adding that Man had started to benefit from "an improved environment for active management" under US president Donald Trump. "In a Trump world, there are 'winners and losers' and everyone is not equal, which means the divergence between favourable and unfavourable asset classes and companies becomes increasingly significant," Mr Ellis said.

Despite the writedown of GLG by $281m, Mr Ellis said the unit "remains a crucial part" of the business. Several initiatives, such as increasingly using quantitative analysis and machine learning to inform the discretionary traders, "will improve the consistency of performance", he added.

The company also said it was undergoing a restructuring, which it began last year after Mr Ellis took over as chief executive. The restructuring will cost the company about $21m, with $17m of that accounting for compensation charges in 2016.
