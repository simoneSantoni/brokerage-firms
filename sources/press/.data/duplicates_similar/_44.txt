A Quant Program Is the Reason You Just Bought That ETF

At the exact moment a mom-and-pop investor considers buying bank stocks, an advertisement pops up on their desktop promoting a financials-focused fund.

The scenario isn't science fiction, it is BlackRock Inc.'s latest business plan.

The world's largest money manager with $5.4 trillion under management is developing a new advertising system that uses sentiment analysis from messages on Twitter Inc. and other data to help determine when to advertise specific funds in its vast lineup of exchange-traded funds.

The effort, a partnership with advertising firm WPP PLC, is the latest example of fund firms experimenting with new ways to attract cash in an increasingly competitive market for low-cost index-tracking funds. It shifts the use of computer programs beyond investing to using algorithms to woo retail investors.

"The same value we get on the investing side from big data and algorithms and looking at trends and responding to them we'd like to do that on the advertising side," said Jennifer Grancio, head of global business development at BlackRock's iShares ETF business.

BlackRock competes with rivals including Vanguard Group, State Street Corp., Invesco Ltd. and Charles Schwab Corp. for investor cash in the $2.8 trillion U.S. ETF market.

The financial services industry spent $2.5 billion on automated online-ad buying and selling in 2016, according to estimates from market research firm eMarketer.

Algorithms have been a part of the digital ad-buying process for years, where ad space is traded on exchanges like stocks in financial markets. But BlackRock and WPP are now trying to apply quantitative strategies to determine when to ramp up those trades. These algorithms even adjust how much money the firm is spending on such ads.

ETFs have become the epicenter of growth in the asset-management industry, attracting hundreds of billions in new investor money in recent years. They have tax advantages over mutual funds and trade on exchanges like stocks. Money managers have raced to one up each other on new product launches and ultralow fees.

BlackRock, which has cut prices aggressively for some products, also is trying to respond faster to economic and political changes that shape investor decisions. To do so, the firm is relying on social media sentiment data and analysis of news stories to determine which ETF ads to display.

Ahead of the U.K.'s June 23 vote to leave the European Union, BlackRock advertised its iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF, an unhedged ETF that invests in U.K. stocks. It quickly opted to switch the ads to a hedged version of the fund after U.K.'s surprising decision to leave the EU.

But the money manager wants to do more and at a faster pace while staying ahead of rivals. BlackRock is using analysis from firms such as iSentium LLC to start ramping up or scaling back targeted ads in sync with investor sentiment.

Funds also have another bridge to cross.

Hagan Major, co-founder of ad firm Yellowhammer Media group, said asset managers face a balancing act in pushing targeted ads about financial decisions without encroaching on the privacy of clients.

"There's a very fine line between really effective and really creative and something that feels invasive for a consumer," he said.

Funds Battle Tech Firms For Talent

The battle for quantitative talent has turned some of the richest money managers into underdogs. Why? Because they are up against the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. for hiring the world's top minds.

"Google is trying to hoover up every data scientist in the world," said Luke Ellis, chief executive of Man Group PLC, the world's largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager. "Google has got more money than I have. I can't compete with Google just on that."

London-based Man Group attempts to get these data scientists at their source. The firm has donated millions to Oxford University to put its name on a quantitative research laboratory, hoping that prospective employees get acclimated with the firm and its culture early in their career.

The trouble is that across the corporate world -- be it hedge funds, tech giants or even the Fortune 500 -- companies are desperate to hire the same type of people. They seek top graduates or postgraduates who can build software that learns to spot patterns in anything from photos on social media to financial futures markets. To appeal to tech talent, some financial firms offer the kind of office perks common at tech companies.

At Kenneth Griffin's hedge fund Citadel, the firm pitches candidates on running their own projects hand in hand with the company's top stock pickers, rather than being one more member of a Silicon Valley engineering squad. Citadel can also offer an immediate payday to staffers whose work helps boost the hedge fund's bottom line -- a contrast to the uncertainty of signing up at a fledgling startup.

"You get to see the work you're contributing go into production and be used by our investment teams at an incredibly fast clip," said L.J. Brock, Citadel's chief people officer.

Point72, which is building models to process data from the likes of Twitter Inc. and elsewhere, lets employees take as much vacation as they want. London-based Aspect Capital rolls out a beer trolley on Fridays. Quant firm Two Sigma hosts a new-hire orientation in which recruits are encouraged to enter a "Hacker Lab" reminiscent of the coding contests popular in Silicon Valley.

Recruiters also may send a personalized gift such as free golf lessons or arrange for a private dinner with the hiring company's founder, said Boris Epstein, co-founder of staffing firm Binc Inc. "We call it a 'love bomb,' " he said.

Software engineers often laugh off some of these perks. In the end, it is either about the day-to-day science or money.

"At tech companies, the permeating value is that they're about trying to make the world a better place, whereas at hedge funds it's about making more money," Mr. Epstein said.

Nina Kuklisova, a quantitative associate at a large financial-services firm in New York, said she gets between three and five inquiries a week from recruiters about job opportunities at other finance firms and technology companies. The 27-year-old, while not actively looking for a job, said she is open to switching to the tech sector. However, negative feedback from friends employed in tech gives her pause.

"They worked on projects that turned out not to be used by anyone," Ms. Kuklisova said. At the bank, she is part of a team that aims to minimize the risk that stock traders take. "We are basically trying to prevent the next financial crisis," she said.

Recruiters say a candidate with a doctoral degree straight out of school can expect a minimum base salary at a hedge fund of around $100,000, plus a bonus of 50% to 100%. Graduates of elite schools or with rare specialties may earn three or four times that, they say.

The bigger enticement is that after a few years, a computer scientist writing programs that turn out to be moneymakers can earn millions at a hedge fund. Tech firms, particularly startups, counter by offering a share of the business overall. That can be a very attractive package if the firm becomes successful, but it is unpredictable and risky for a new graduate.

To compete, some hedge funds are having to do the previously unthinkable and publish parts of their complex and valuable code. Man Group, for instance, has made its database for collecting vast quantities of trading data publicly available. The reason: Computer scientists often prefer the more collaborative culture of academia or tech firms to the secrecy of hedge funds.

Hedge funds also are opening offices in new locations to be closer to talent.

London-based computer trader Winton Group, which manages more than $30 billion in assets, opened an office in San Francisco's financial district last year to house engineers involved in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The office's head of data was previously a director of engineering at Netflix and co-founded a gameplay data startup in Palo Alto, Calif.

There remain some high-end perks that startups can't match.

Citadel this year will gift employees tickets to the Chicago and New York productions of "Hamilton," a person close to the firm said.

Finance & Markets -- The Quants: Humans Still Rule Machines in Insurance

[Machines and their masters are the undisputed new kings of Wall Street]

American International Group Inc. uses one of the industry's leading algorithmic models to determine how much companies should pay for insurance. It just doesn't trust what the model computes on its own.

As part of an approach it started rolling out last year, the global insurance conglomerate pairs its models with human underwriters. The approach reflects the company's belief that human judgment is still needed to size up most of the midsize to large businesses it insures. AIG even has a nickname for underwriters who keep the same price as the model every time: "flat liners."

Insurance companies such as AIG are among the original financial quants, from tracking ships to derive marine-insurance prices to using quantitative analysis to determine the likelihood of automobiles crashing, hurricanes wiping out beach towns and juries finding doctors liable for malpractice.

Now, promising new techniques including algorithms can help carriers tap into a growing array of detail to price risk: sensors in factories, devices worn by construction workers, employee-sentiment data and satellite imagery, to name a few.

AIG's commercial-insurance unit alone pays $75 million each business day in claims. The insurer is a major seller of policies that cover such diverse things as the cost of injured workers, wrecks of corporate-owned vehicles, fire and other damage to premises, hacking, contaminated products and offshore drilling rigs.

When an underwriter "turns off his or her brain, we're done," said Madhu Tadikonda, chief underwriter for AIG's commercial unit. "The models by themselves are not perfect" for many of the risks posed by policyholders.

Still, in an example of how data analysis can make a difference, AIG recently informed a hotel client that it should mop its floors at 3 a.m. to reduce slips and falls. It also has advised clients that employees with carpal tunnel syndrome are at high risk of repeat injuries, so the customary push to quickly get a person back on the job can backfire.

Underwriters such as Matthew Lebron call on business clients keeping an eye out for characteristics that distinguish them, "so I can make the judgment call to go upward or downward" from the computer-generated average price. Among questions he asks: Is a business up to snuff with industry safety standards? Is it working with AIG's loss-control program to try to minimize risk of claims?

"There's definitely an element of human touch," said Brett Herrman, who works as a technical underwriter at AIG, running the model when colleagues go out in the field. "We're diving in on detail and collaborating as a team."

The need to pair with humans hasn't stopped the arms race for data and innovative technology in the industry.

In a recent survey by consulting firm Accenture, 37% of about 550 insurance executives said they plan to invest "extensively" in machine learning over the next three years, and a further 44% anticipate "moderate" investment.

More "insurers are doubling down on their efforts to combine their human intelligence with the fast, effective decision-making capabilities of machine intelligence," said John Cusano, Accenture's global head of insurance.

Progressive Corp. is among the elite few with successes in hand. Back in the 1990s, the car insurer identified correlations between credit histories and claims, testing a hypothesis that financially responsible people are more cautious drivers. Previously, insurers relied on underwriters to place applicants within broad categories such as age, gender and car type.

More recently, insurers have begun using algorithms to issue policies to small to midsize businesses online. They can draw on data such as construction features of a business's premises, proximity to fire hydrants, and code violations.

J.Crew's Mickey Drexler Confesses: I Underestimated How Tech Would Upend Retail; Retail legend didn't understand how speed and price would drive internet shoppers; 10 quarters of falling sales

Millard "Mickey" Drexler, the fashion genius whose ability to spot trends reshaped how Americans dress, has a humbling admission. He missed what might be the biggest trend of all how quickly technology would change the retail industry.

"I've never seen the speed of change as it is today," the 72-year-old chairman and chief executive of J.Crew Group Inc. said in an interview at his New York office. "If I could go back 10 years, I might have done some things earlier."

The retail veteran, who redefined Gap Inc. in the 1990s and then transformed J.Crew into a household name, is now scrambling to keep the company he took private in a leveraged buyout from ending up in bankruptcy.

Sales at J.Crew Group stores open at least a year have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-crew-sales-fall-as-slump-continues-1472681978" the kind of slump that got Mr. Drexler ousted from the Gap in 2002. This time he owns 10% of the company, and it is lenders, not the founding family, that are putting on the pressure.

For decades, fashion was essentially a hit or miss business. Merchants like Mr. Drexler would make bets on what people would be wearing a year in advance, since that's how long it took to design and produce items. Hits guaranteed handsome returns until the next season.

Now, competitors with "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fast-fashion-how-a-zara-coat-went-from-design-to-fifth-avenue-in-25-days-1481020203" and move them into stores in a matter of weeks. Online marketplaces drive down prices, and design details such as nicer buttons and richer colors are less apparent on the internet. Social media adds fuel to the style churn consumers want a new outfit for every Instagram post.

"The rules of the game have changed," said Janet Kloppenburg, president of JJK Research, a retail-focused research firm. "It's not just about product anymore. It's also about speed and pricing."

Mr. Drexler's plan is to emphasize lower prices, pivot toward more digital marketing and adopt a more accessible image. "We became a little too elitist in our attitude," he said.

Many visionaries focus on doing what they do best, even when the ground shifts beneath them. From newspapers to television, successful companies have been upended by disruptive technologies. Facebook Inc. is now the world's largest publisher; Netflix Inc. is worth twice as much as CBS Corp.

"The incumbent leaders never see it coming," said Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who introduced the theory of disruptive innovation 20 years ago. "They focus on their best customers and try to provide what they need, but the customers who first defect [to new technology] are usually the least profitable."

Mr. Drexler, known as the "merchant prince," built some of America's most recognizable apparel brands, including Old Navy, Banana Republic and most recently Madewell. He focused on details such as the feel of the fabric, the weight of the buttons and the plaid inside waistbands, according to former executives who worked with him at J.Crew and Gap. Higher quality allowed J.Crew to charge a premium for its casual, preppy styles.

The New York City native, who doesn't have his own Instagram, Facebook or Twitter account, was sharing thoughts with employees on a loudspeaker hooked up through his phone before Twitter was launched. He paid attention to firsthand shopper feedback on frequent visits to stores long before Amazon.com Inc. was collecting user data. He was also selling clothes online before many other specialty retailers. Nearly half of J.Crew's sales now come from the web.

But Mr. Drexler didn't appreciate "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-gap-struggles-its-analytical-ceo-prizes-data-over-design-1480282911", where prices drive decisions, or how social media would give rise to disposable fashion. Online, price has more impact than the sensory qualities of clothing. "You go into a store I love this, I love this, I love this," he said. "You go online and you just don't get the same sense and feel of the goods because you're looking at a picture."

J.Crew has about 460 stores, a smaller base than many other chains that are now shrinking their footprints. But it has still struggled as more shoppers compare prices online and buy less expensive, trendy clothes rather than a lasting wardrobe. Amazon.com and other algorithm-based websites can change prices by the hour based on demand, and the variety of options makes it easy to mix and match brands.

"The days of people wearing head-to-toe J.Crew are over," said Carla Casella, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Zinniah Munoz, a 20-year-old makeup artist in New York City, said she would rather buy a style at a lower price than pay extra money for a brand name. "I'm always vigilant of not posting the same style twice" on Instagram or Facebook, she added.

At an industry conference in 2010, Mr. Drexler played down the impact of technology on prices, arguing that quality products are the key to success: "At the end of the day, I think the franchise lasts as long as the creative product gets flown through."

Today, with nearly two billion people using Facebook every month, he feels differently: "You cannot be successful without being obsessed with the product, obsessed with social media, and obsessed with digital," he said. "Retail is now about all that."

Mr. Drexler said he hasn't given up on quality. Instead, he is now lowering prices on about 300 items and creating an analytics team dedicated to optimizing prices for each garment.

"We're being much more competitive in our pricing," he said. "We're not going to allow our competitors to take from us."

Madewell, which caters to younger shoppers and offers cheaper prices, has outperformed the J.Crew brand, but represents only about 14% of the group's annual revenue.

Mr. Drexler is also expanding the company's supply base beyond predominantly China to get better deals and shorten the time it takes to get products into stores.

The moves are aimed at keeping prices consistent, rather than unloading leftover inventory through discounts, and at retuning J.Crew's identity as an affordable and accessible brand for everybody not just the fashion-forward crowd.

Last month, Mr. Drexler "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-crew-plans-to-cut-250-jobs-1493129069", and said he would "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-crew-creative-director-jenna-lyons-to-leave-retailer-1491240209" the group's longtime creative chief who was the driving force behind J.Crew's most high-price and daring styles, such as sequined blazers and feather skirts.

Mr. Drexler is also putting more of the brand's resources behind digital marketing, and shifting away from a one-size-fits-all monthly catalog. Mailings will be targeted based on customer data gleaned from the company's online business.

The New York-based company is carrying more than $2 billion of debt and has less than $150 million in cash, following Mr. Drexler's leveraged buyout in 2011 with TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners. It has paid its past three interest payments by issuing new debt.

To buy time, Mr. Drexler and his fellow directors performed a complicated financial maneuver that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-crew-sues-lenders-to-block-potential-default-declaration-1486070997". Investors are fighting the moves in court, arguing it is tantamount to a default.

At least $560 million of debt is due in 2019. The company is negotiating with lenders to push back the due date and lower its debt load by offering to swap some of the debt for equity.

"It's unclear whether they will come to an agreement," said Raya Sokolyanska, an analyst at Moody's. "It would still leave the company highly leveraged," adding that J.Crew's capital structure is unsustainable.

Private-equity firm TPG's first big bet on J.Crew was in 1997, when it acquired a majority stake. It recruited Mr. Drexler to run the business in 2003 after cycling through four CEOs in five years. By the time TPG sold the last of its shares in 2009, the firm had made more than seven times its investment.

Mr. Drexler had nearly tripled revenue and transformed what was largely a catalog business by going in the opposite direction of his predecessors and competitors. He increased prices and elevated quality even creating a library at headquarters to document the unique hues the brand invented each season.

When sales slipped in 2010, TPG swooped back in. In 2011, the firm partnered with Leonard Green and took the company private in a $2.8 billion deal.

In 2014, TPG and Leonard Green were negotiating a sale of the company to Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing Co. while at the same time hiring bankers for a potential IPO, when clothing sales began to fall again. The sale plans evaporated, and by the end of the year the company wrote down the value of its stores by more than $500 million and its brand name by $145 million.

TPG co-founder David Bonderman recently acknowledged J.Crew and its peers are struggling with declining mall traffic and the shift to online shopping. "The internet has proven much more resilient and much more important than most of us thought a decade ago," he said at a conference earlier this month.

In an email, TPG co-founder James Coulter wrote, "We believe Mickey and the J.Crew management are getting the strategy and team in place to position J.Crew to succeed in this new world."

In recent years, customers have become closely attuned to prices. After sales began to fall, Mr. Drexler said he addressed style problems such as "boxy" cuts that were unpopular among J.Crew customers and quality issues, particularly pilling cashmere and T-shirts with thin fabric. Still, the company had to offer discounts of 40%-50% to move inventory.

J.Crew eventually determined shoppers were looking for better value and that many people were put off by the $800 skirts and $1,900 sweaters in the "J.Crew Collection" an expensive line spearheaded by Ms. Lyons featured prominently in marketing and window displays, even though it represented a small portion of merchandise.

"We gave a perception of being a higher-priced company than we were in our catalog, online and in our general presentation," said Mr. Drexler. "Very big mistake."

Ms. Lyons didn't respond to requests for comment.

Some of the quirky designs were too much for Tricia Louvar, a 42-year-old writer and illustrator in Sisters, Ore. She had shopped at J.Crew in the past, but began finding the clothes increasingly impractical and unaffordable. In a widely shared "https://thehairpin.com/an-open-letter-to-jenna-lyons-23c9b5c9c771", she wrote: "I still can't wrap my head around the price of an 'everyday outfit,' " which she tallied up at $596 and said was equivalent to the price of a new computer or 298 school lunches.

In April, Mr. Drexler named Somsack Sikhounmuong, who has been with the company since 2001, to the post of chief design officer, but he won't take the high-profile role that Ms. Lyons had. J.Crew "won't be about any designer," Mr. Drexler said. "We're getting back to being who we are much more comfortable, approachable, democratic and friendly."

Ms. Louvar said she returned to a store a few weeks ago for the first time in two years and bought several new pieces. "The prices felt more reasonable," she said. "It was more like the J.Crew I remember."

When an underwriter "turns off his or her brain, we're done," said Madhu Tadikonda, chief underwriter for AIG's commercial unit. "The models by themselves are not perfect" for many of the risks posed by policyholders.

Still, in an example of how data analysis can make a difference, AIG recently informed a hotel client that it should mop its floors at 3 a.m. to reduce slips and falls. It also has advised clients that employees with carpel tunnel syndrome are at high risk of repeat injuries, so the customary push to quickly get a person back on the job can backfire.

Underwriters such as Matthew Lebron call on business clients keeping an eye out for characteristics that distinguish them, "so I can make the judgment call to go upward or downward" from the computer-generated average price. Among questions he asks: Is a business up to snuff with industry safety standards? Is it working with AIG's loss-control program to try to minimize the risk of claims?

"There's definitely an element of human touch," said Brett Herrman, who works as a "technical underwriter" at AIG, running the model when colleagues go out in the field. "We're diving in on detail and collaborating as a team."

The need to pair with humans hasn't stopped the arms race for data and innovative technology in the industry.

In a recent survey by consulting firm Accenture, 37% of about 550 insurance executives said they plan to invest "extensively" in machine learning over the next three years, and a further 44% anticipate "moderate" investment.

More "insurers are doubling down on their efforts to combine their human intelligence with the fast, effective decision-making capabilities of machine intelligence," said John Cusano, Accenture's global head of insurance.

Progressive Corp. is among the elite few with successes in hand. Back in the 1990s, the car insurer identified correlations between credit histories and claims, testing a hypothesis that financially responsible people are more cautious drivers. Previously, insurers relied on underwriters to place applicants within broad categories such as age, gender and car type.

More recently, insurers have begun using algorithms to issue policies to small to midsize businesses online. They can draw on data such as construction features of a business's premises, proximity to fire hydrants and code violations.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has such an offering, and last year AIG joined with Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd. and an affiliate of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma Investments LP in an online venture.

Analysts and executives say algorithms work well for standardized policies, such as for homes, cars and small businesses. Data scientists can feed millions of claims into computers to find patterns, and the risks are similar enough that a premium rate spit out by the model can be trusted.

But risk is increasingly nuanced the bigger the business. Policies often are tailored, and claims infrequent, so there is less information to work with. And, mistakes can be costly.

Former AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock has been one of the industry's biggest champions of data analytics, frequently narrating how, about six years ago, researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health studied millions of AIG's old workers' compensation medical records and identified problems from overuse of opiates. Now, AIG reaches out to a patient's medical provider early to suggest nonaddictive treatment.

Mr. Hancock was succeeded last week by Brian Duperreault, formerly Hamilton's CEO and another leading proponent of data science. As part of his hiring, AIG said it would work with Two Sigma to develop an estimated $250 million "next generation insurance platform" to accelerate its use of data science.

Sitting at his desk with photographs from Apple Inc.'s 1990s' "Think Different" marketing campaign on the wall behind him, AIG underwriter Mr. Tadikonda said he prefers to see many policies priced both above and below the model-driven average price. He said there are times the modeling team will call an underwriter and say, "Hey, what's going on? You are down 25%" against what the model recommends. His favorite response from an underwriter: "You're damn right."

[Machines and their masters are the undisputed new kings of Wall Street]

American International Group Inc. uses one of the industry's leading algorithmic models to determine how much companies should pay for insurance. It just doesn't trust what the model computes on its own.

As part of an approach it started rolling out last year, the global insurance conglomerate pairs its models with human underwriters. The approach reflects the company's belief that human judgment is still needed to size up most of the midsize to large businesses it insures. AIG even has a nickname for underwriters who keep the same price as the model every time: "flat liners."

Insurers such as AIG are among the original financial quants, from tracking ships to derive marine-insurance prices to using quantitative analysis to determine the likelihood of automobiles crashing, hurricanes wiping out beach towns and juries finding doctors liable for malpractice.

Now, promising new techniques including algorithms can help carriers tap into a growing array of detail to price risk: sensors in factories, devices worn by construction workers, employee-sentiment data and satellite imagery, to name a few.

AIG's commercial-insurance unit alone pays $75 million each business day in claims. The insurer is a major seller of policies that cover such diverse things as the cost of injured workers; wrecks of corporate-owned vehicles; fire and other damage to premises; hacking; contaminated products and offshore drilling rigs.

Amateur Sleuths Thrive in Oil-Data Field

On a recent Sunday evening, Samir Madani had dinner with his family in suburban Stockholm, did the dishes and put his two children to bed.

Then he opened his laptop and started crunching U.S.oil-import data late into the night.

Mr. Madani, a technology executive who trades and researches crude as a hobby, is part of a growing group of oilsleuths who have sprung up to sate the market's voracious appetite for data and intelligence.

"So much of oil data is hidden and we're trying to make it accessible," said Mr. Madani, who runs a free oil-data website from his house. "Besides, there's so much drama in oil."

Dramatic gyrations in the price of oil in the past three years have boosted demand for such services, intensifying competition in a market that for years had been dominated by governments, oil companies and a handful of big data providers.

The new entrants include both amateurs armed with an internet connection and a Twitter account, and professional services using shoebox-size satellites and sophisticated computer models. They are crunching data on everything from Middle Eastern exports to U.S. drilling. Such statistics often move oil prices as they predict government releases on crude inventories or cover data black spots such as Chinese stockpiles and Iranian tanker movements.

With the proliferation of data sources, the oil industry is catching up to other sectors. Retail and commodity investors, for instance, have long had access to a wealth of sophisticated information on things like store traffic and crop yields. But the free fall in the price of oil -- from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to around $50 today -- created new trading opportunities for hedge funds and day traders.

When Doug King started the Merchant Commodity hedge fund at RCMA Asset Management in 2004, there were only a few outside data sources, he says. "We used to do our own data crunching by hand, it was a simpler time," said Mr. King, who now subscribes to several data services.

"The oil data industry has exploded," said Mr. King, chief investment officer at RCMA.

At least three new oil-data services companies are launching this year.

One is Kayrros, a Paris-based startup due to open for business in June. It aims to use computer algorithms to analyze satellite imagery, financial data and social news to come up with detailed estimates and forecasts for key oil numbers, says Antoine Halff, a founding partner of the firm.

"A decade or more ago, it used to be people with binoculars sitting in a hotel watching tankers move in and out of the port," said Mr. Halff, who is also a senior researcher at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.

A popular service such firms offer is tracking oiltankers. That gives, for instance, insight into how much crude members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are exporting after their deal last year to limit supply.

Another new entrant, Vortexa, promises real-time tracking of more than 94% of all oil cargoes globally. The firm wasco-founded by a former head of trading technology at oil giant BP PLC.

Paris-based Kpler has 19 data "engineers" spread across offices in France, Singapore and Houston who use sources like ship brokers and customs data and tiny nanosatellites, which can deliver more-frequent imagery than traditional satellites.

Oil upstarts like Vortexa and Kpler are moving onto the turf of more-established players. Financial data companies like Bloomberg LP, Thomson Reuters Corp. and the commodity market information provider Genscape Inc. have been offering oil data such as tanker movements and production surveys for years. Reuters and Bloomberg compete with Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, on some services.

Services like Louisville, Ky.-based Genscape cost up to several hundred thousand dollars a year, depending on the size of the customer and the data package.

Such hefty price tags have been driving independent traders like Mr. Madani to look for data themselves.

Mr. Madani turned to Twitter. A year ago, he created the #OOTT hashtag, which stands for Organization of Oil Trading Tweeters, to collate posts about oil news and publicly available data. The community quickly grew, with tweets featuring the hashtag reaching more than seven million accounts in the first two weeks of May, according to information provider Klear.

Mr. Madani then started crunching oil data from publicly available sources like free tanker-tracking websites and government statistics. Mr. Madani used a shared Google spreadsheet to publish his findings, and that later grew into TankerTrackers.com, a freeoil-data website. He says he doesn't plan to charge a subscription as his website is aimed at independent traders who often can't afford professional services.

"We're looking after the average Joe and Jane," said Mr. Madani, who routinely stays up until 2 a.m. trying to estimate OPEC members' compliance with the group's deal to cut production. "We're all news and data junkies."

Executives at some of the incumbent providers say they offer more data than the upstarts do, but that they welcome the competition. "The more eyes we have watching the market, the more transparent it gets," said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, a New York-based oil data provider.

Alexa's New Avatar: Financial Adviser

Some UBS Group AG clients can pose any economic question to a machine: "Alexa, how would a Fed rate increase impact the U.S. economy?"

A partnership with Amazon.com Inc. allows select UBS wealth-management clients in Europe to ask the virtual-assistant financial and economic questions. In response, they will hear the view of UBS's chief investment office without having to call their financial adviser or check online for a report.

But the utility ends there for now.

For security and privacy reasons, UBS clients won't be able to access their portfolios or buy and sell stocks or contact their adviser through Alexa. The firm is looking into how to make its Alexa skill "secure, compliant and trustable for clients," a UBS spokesman says.

It is early days in the co-mingling of wealth advice and sophisticated sciences: from voice recognition and quantitative analysis to artificial intelligence. But technology stands to play a bigger role in coming years in an industry that has proved ripe for digital disruption.

The first wave of change largely focused on robo advice that offered automated portfolio management of low-cost exchange-traded funds. Betterment LLC, founded in 2010, is among a handful of startups leading the rise of such automated and semi-automated investing services.

Established firms including Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp. and financial-services companies, including Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS, have also introduced or are testing automation services their clients can use.

In the not-too-distant future, wealth-management firms hope to automate the more mundane tasks of booking appointments or answering clients' basic portfolio questions. Artificial intelligence could also learn over time when a client is most likely to call their adviser and then recommend a pre-emptive phone call. The most groundbreaking science could create an army of virtual financial advisers that learn clients' habits and employ predictive analytics to tackle complicated tasks such as setting personalized goals.

Denise Valentine, a senior analyst at research firm Aite Group, says this will help advisers reduce basic tasks from their workflow and let advisers concentrate on more-valuable tasks such as clarifying long-term financial goals.

Wealth-management firms remain unsure whether clients would feel comfortable giving a bot access to so much detail about their personal finances, especially as worries about cybersecurity threats escalate.

There also is some skepticism that a client would prefer a machine to speaking with a person when they are facing a major life change, such as a divorce or a market downturn.

"People want to connect with others," said Scott Smith, director at Cerulli Associates, a research firm that specializes in asset management.

Wealthfront Inc., which has been incorporating predictive analysis and other modeling into its services, acknowledges that full automation isn't for all clients. There are still many who prefer personalized relationships.

The firm's work in machine learning is a play to connect with their mostly younger clients who grew up as "digital natives" who don't want to speak with a human adviser, says Andy Rachleff, Wealthfront chief executive.

Still, Mr. Rachleff doesn't think a personal touch is the sole reason human advisers will become irrelevant to younger generations.

"It just so happens that software can do a much better job at the tasks performed by human advisers," he says.

American International Group Inc. uses one of the industry's leading algorithmic models to determine how much companies should pay for insurance. It just doesn't trust what the model computes on its own.

As part of an approach it started rolling out last year, the global insurance conglomerate pairs its models with human underwriters. The approach reflects the company's belief that human judgment is still needed in sizing up most of the midsize to large businesses that it insures. AIG even has a nickname for underwriters who keep the same price as the model every time: "flat liners."

Insurance companies such as AIG are among the original financial quants, from tracking ships to derive marine-insurance prices to using quantitative analysis to determine the likelihood of automobiles crashing, hurricanes wiping out beach towns and juries finding doctors liable for malpractice.

AIG's commercial-insurance unit alone pays $75 million each business day in claims.

Futuristic Fintech, With a Female Focus; Women remain an underserved market in financial services. A new app thinks it has the answer, but is AI up to the task?

SCOTT SAUNDERS, CEO of the online lending company Payoff, did not set out to build a personalized financial coaching app for women. In 2014, he began assembling a team that eventually included a cognitive neuroscientist, a marketer, an advertising executive and the data scientist behind eHarmony's match algorithm. The goal: to build an app that used psychological testing to match users of both genders with artificially intelligent financial coaches. By focusing on the intersection of money and psychology, Saunders hoped to minimize financial stress and maximize the pleasure users get from spending and saving.

The app, named "https://www.findjoy.com/", launched earlier this month. Joy is free, although users are occasionally prompted to consider loans from parent company Payoff. The app's AI-enhanced coaches ultimately took the form of animated, advice-dispensing robots. According to Joy's creators, focus-group participants preferred robots to human-looking coaches because the robots seemed less judgmental.

Early testing yielded another important discovery: Women liked Joy more than men, so much so that Joy's all-male team pivoted and redesigned their product. They brought in Alison Brod, a PR firm that specializes in beauty and fashion, to help create Joy's look and feel, including its bright color scheme and balloon logo. Men are more than welcome to use Joy, Saunders says, but the app is unmistakably marketed to women, who remain an underserved market in financial services.

Although they have more earning power than ever before and are more likely to control their own finances, women are still less likely than men to use financial services. According to a 2016 survey from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/workmarket-raises-25-million-from-accenture-and-foundry-group-1493119802", 44% of women say they have talked to a financial adviser more than once in the past year, versus 58% of men, and just 61% of female investors say they have "a good understanding of their investments," compared with 75% of men.

The problem, according to Alexandra Taussig, a senior vice president at Fidelity, is that the language of financial services is male-oriented. Saunders goes a step further: "The psychology of the existing financial system is that it's incredibly male-oriented," he says. "It's transactional, power-focused, ruthlessly competitive and based on literal conversation." According to Taussig, women tend to think about their financial lives in terms of life milestones, such as marriage, divorce and taking care of children and parents. "Men look at it more as a competition. 'How am I doing? What's my performance? Am I beating the index?' "

Kendra Thompson, a managing director of global wealth management at Accenture, says women are focused on long-term outcomes. "They're much more interested in the big picture and how they can advance themselves in the big picture," Thompson says. "Most of what we provide as an industry hasn't really focused on that."

Which is not to say that no one in the industry has tried.

LearnVest was one of the first financial advisers to target women. Founded in 2009 by "http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/learnvest-alexa-von-tobel-talks-money-and-millennials/6E49E1C2-636A-4033-834D-814BA420BC37.html" after she dropped out of Harvard Business School, the company began as a newsletter and financial-education website for women and later added budgeting tools and financial planners. Northwestern Mutual acquired LearnVest for a reported $250 million in 2015, when the site had two million free users and 10,000 paying clients. By then, the company had adopted a gender-neutral approach and the tagline: "We believe financial planning (actually) is for everyone." Today, von Tobel says, most LearnVest users are married couples in their 30s.

In 2016, former Citigroup CFO "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-day-in-the-life-of-sallie-krawcheck-1474987163" launched Ellevest, a digital investment platform that determines women's investment portfolios by asking them about their goals rather than their tolerance for risk. The Ellevest model also accounts for financial challenges unique to women: longer lifespans, the pay gap and the higher likelihood of career breaks. And the platform avoids clich investing jargon and metaphors such as "beating the market" or "picking a winner."

"It isn't that women want different financial services," says Amanda Steinberg, founder of the female-focused savings and investment platform WorthFM. "It's that they want the advice delivered differently."

Joy is betting that its personalized delivery determined by a user's psychological profile and financial data will set it apart from the competition. The app asks first-time users to take a five-question quiz designed to identify the personality traits known in modern psychology as "the big five": openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Do you consider yourself tidy and prepared, the quiz asks, or disorganized and carefree? Creative or conventional? Dramatic or calm? Based on their answers, users are assigned one of 10 "financial personalities" identified by Saunders and his team. Joy's robot coaches combine those results with bank and credit account information to tailor their tone and feedback. The coaching becomes more individualized as Joy's robots gather data on income, spending and consumer satisfaction. Users are asked to rate every purchase they make according to how happy or sad it made them, allowing the robots to track patterns and make recommendations.

"Behavioral economics are really a blunt instrument," Saunders says. "The nudges and little hacks, they do work, but they work better if you treat people differently based on who they are and what really is important to them."

Some experts aren't convinced that psychological testing is the key to effective financial coaching. According to Meir Statman, the Glenn Klimek professor of finance at Santa Clara University, studies have shown some correlation between "the big five" and financial behavior; people who rate high in conscientiousness are also likely to have high lifetime earnings. But he's unconvinced that the traits on which Joy is based are strong predictors.

"I'm not suggesting it's the equivalent of a horoscope," Statman says. "I'm just not sure if it classifies people correctly." And an effective robot adviser, Statman points out, would need to be intelligent enough to account for variables such as major life events and shifts in behavior that occur over time. Joy's coaches periodically ask users about their mood and stress level, which, Statman says, may fill in some of those gaps. But whether Joy's animated robots are up to the task remains to be seen. "I think artificial intelligence still has to make strides," Statman says. "Guiding people is really a complicated process."

The Quants Now Run Wall Street --- Software-driven trading, long predicted, is becoming dominant

Alexey Poyarkov, a former gold-medal winner of the International Mathematical Olympiad for high-school students, spent most of his early career honing algorithms at technology companies such as Microsoft Corp., where he helped make the Bing search engine smarter at ferreting out pornography.

Last year, a bidding war for Mr. Poyarkov broke out among hedge-fund heavyweights Renaissance Technologies LLC, Citadel LLC and TGS Management Co. When it was over, he went to work at TGS in Irvine, Calif., and could earn as much as $700,000 in his first year, say people familiar with the contract.

The Russian-born software engineer, who declined to comment, as did the hedge funds, had almost no financial experience. What TGS wanted was his wizardry at designing algorithms, sets of rules used to power calculations and problem-solving, which in the investment world can quickly parse data and decide what to buy and sell.

Up and down Wall Street, algorithmic-driven trading and the quants who use sophisticated statistical models to find attractive trades are taking over.

On many trading floors, quants are gaining respect, clout and money as investment firms scramble to hire mathematicians and scientists. Traditional trading strategies, such as sifting through balance sheets and talking to companies' customers, are falling down the pecking order.

"A decade ago, the brightest graduates all wanted to be traders at Wall Street investment banks, but now they're climbing over each other to get into quant funds," says Anthony Lawler, who helps run quantitative investing at GAM Holding AG. The Swiss money manager last year bought British quant firm Cantab Capital Partners for at least $217 million to help it expand into computer-powered funds.

Guggenheim Partners LLC built what it calls a "supercomputing cluster" for $1 million at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California to help crunch numbers for Guggenheim's quant investment funds, says Marcos Lopez de Prado, a Guggenheim senior managing director. Electricity for the computers costs another $1 million a year.

Algorithmic trading has been around for a long time but until recently was an overlooked presence on Wall Street. An article in The Wall Street Journal in 1974 featured quant pioneer Ed Thorp. In 1988, the Journal profiled a little-known Chicago options-trading firm that had a secret computer system. Journal reporter Scott Patterson wrote a best-selling book in 2010 about the rise of quants.

Prognosticators imagined a time when data-driven traders who live by algorithms rather than instincts would become the kings of Wall Street.

That day has arrived. In one sign of their power, quantitative investment firms are responsible for 27% of all U.S. stock trades by investors, up from 14% in 2013, according to the Tabb Group, a research firm.

Quants have almost caught up to individual investors, which collectively have 29% of all stock-trading volume.

At the end of the first quarter, quant-focused hedge funds held $932 billion of investments, or more than 30% of all hedge-fund assets, estimates HFR Inc. In 2009, quant funds held $408 billion, or 25%.

Quants received $4.6 billion of net new investments in the first quarter, while the overall hedge-fund business saw withdrawals of $5.5 billion.

The computers are outperforming humans at picking investments. Over the past five years, quant-focused hedge funds gained about 5.1% a year on average. The average hedge fund rose 4.3% a year in the same period.

In the first quarter, quant funds rose about 3%, compared with 2.5% for the average hedge fund.

Quants have been helped by two transformative forces. Regulatory scrutiny has made it hard for investors to obtain an edge through methods such as prodding company executives for information or tapping expert networks that included employees of public companies.

Even more important, investors now have at their fingertips an expanding ocean of data about the global economy and financial data, such as changes in earnings estimates and accounts receivable.

The next frontier: tapping data from drones and other cutting-edge sources to help understand companies and the economy in real time.

Quants are different from high-frequency traders, who tend to focus on trades that might last just milliseconds. High-frequency traders have been under pressure as volatility dips and competition grows.

Exchange-traded funds also use algorithms but are geared more to investors who want exposure to certain industries or sectors.

Quantitative-driven trades can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few months. The biggest quant firms, including Renaissance, Two Sigma Investments LLC, D.E. Shaw Group, PDT Partners and TGS, make thousands of trades and manage tens of billions of dollars in investor assets.

Some analysts worry that firms and investors stampeding into the quant business might be disappointed. The most successful quants have been operating for years. And hiring Ph.D.s doesn't guarantee profits.

More competition could hurt returns and give a false sense of security about the market's stability. In 2007, what became known as the "quant meltdown" was caused largely by the similarity of strategies among quants, who simultaneously rushed to sell, causing losses at other firms and more selling.

Mathematician William Byers, who wrote the 2010 book "How Mathematicians Think," warns that rendering the world in numbers can give investors a deceptive belief that predictions churned out of computers are more reliable than they truly are. The more investors flock to complicated algorithmic models, the more likely it is some algorithms will be similar to one another, possibly fueling larger market disruptions, some analysts say.

So far, though, nothing has stopped the quant arms race, which is creating new jobs previously unheard of in the finance industry.

Citadel, of Chicago, has a chief scientist to run its analytics and quantitative strategies. In August, Balyasny Asset Management LP hired data scientist Gilbert Haddad, formerly of Schlumberger Ltd. and General Electric Co., to overhaul data and analytics at the New York hedge-fund firm. He studied nanoparticles at the University of Wisconsin and has a Ph.D. in engineering.

"You take tours of offices, and everyone is always pointing out some guy off in a corner, working on his own," says Alexandru Agachi, chief operating officer at Empiric Capital Ltd., a startup quant hedge fund in London. "They say with pride: 'Over there is our quant. He's building signals.' "

It's common for hedge funds to retool themselves to fit the latest popular strategy. Many funds dove into mortgages after the financial crisis ebbed. Some turned into "macro" investors in anticipation of global economic shifts.

Hedge-fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen's investment firm, Point72 Asset Management, with $12 billion in assets, is shifting about half of its portfolio managers to what it calls a "man plus machine" approach.

Teams that use old-school research are working alongside data scientists. Financial analysts are taking classes to learn data-science basics. Point72 is plowing tens of millions of dollars into a group that analyzes reams of data, including credit- card receipts and foot traffic captured by apps on smartphones. The results are passed on to traders at the Stamford, Conn., investment firm.

Point72 lost money in most of its traditional trading strategies last year, say people familiar with the results. The firm's quant investors made about $500 million.

Matthew Granade, Point72's chief market-intelligence officer, recently encouraged London School of Economics students to learn basic programming languages, like R and Python, to become more competitive when they graduate. Investors are shifting their preference from "artisan to engineer," he said.

Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones is one of the best-known investors in history. The former cotton trader anticipated the 1987 stock-market crash and made gigantic profits with quick bursts of trading, averaging annual gains of more than 17% since then. His hedge-fund firm, Tudor Investment Corp., barely made any money in 2014 and 2015, though.

By last year, Mr. Jones was feeling pressure from more successful quant traders, according to people close to the firm. In October, Mr. Jones chose Dario Villani, an Italian with a doctorate in theoretical physics who was hired in 2015, to help rejuvenate Tudor.

Hunkered down with a team of quants and other employees, Mr. Villani began developing computer programs to replicate trading positions of Tudor's portfolio managers using instruments that better allow the firm to increase risk to improve returns without endangering the hedge fund or Tudor, people familiar with the matter say.

Despite the changes, Tudor's two key funds were flat in 2016 as well as so far this year, even as markets have climbed.

Humans have long searched relentlessly for ways to gain an information edge. Legend has it that financier Baron Rothschild built a network of field agents and carrier pigeons in 1815 that may have given him a jump on the Battle of Waterloo outcome. Today's quants hope to digest -- and act on -- information faster than traditional investors.

Hedge funds with quant-focused strategies have been poring over private Chinese and Russian consumer surveys, illicit pharmaceutical sales on the dark web -- a network of websites used by hackers and others to anonymously share information -- and hotel bookings by U.S. travelers, according to Quandl Inc., a platform for such data.

In the late 1990s, an algorithm might have simply tried to ride the momentum of a stock's price rise, buying at a certain price level and selling at a predetermined moment. Today's algorithms can make continuous predictions based on analysis of past and present data while hundreds of real-time inputs bombard the computers with various signals.

Some investment firms are pushing into machine learning, which allows computers to analyze data and come up with their own algorithms. Those machines no longer rely on humans to write the formulas.

Algorithms and quants eventually could sharply reduce the need for large investment staffs. A machine-driven algorithm might help quantitative researchers discover dozens of new algorithms in the time it used to take to create one.

In the battle for talent, quant-focused firms often are reluctant to call themselves hedge funds. Quant firms would rather emphasize their similarities to companies in Silicon Valley.

Saeed Amen, a quantitative researcher in London, says his investment strategies were considered "very niche" for most of his 14-year career.

He organized social events for quants, including occasional gatherings of a group called the Thalesians after ancient Greek geometer Thales of Miletus. The beer and conversation sometimes attracted fewer than a dozen people.

Mr. Amen's phone has started ringing with calls from hedge-fund managers in the U.S. and Europe. They don't all want automated investing algorithms, but they are trying to figure out how to make better predictions, he says.

Much of that push is coming from investors such as Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif. Last year, the college placed about 10% of its $750 million portfolio in big quant funds, including those run by Man Group PLC of London and AQR Capital Management LLC, Greenwich, Conn.

Until then, Pepperdine had "essentially zero" quant investments, says Michael Nicks, its director of investments. "The narrative of fundamental investing is much more comfortable to digest," he says. "Finding a company with good prospects makes sense, since we look for undervalued things in our daily lives, but quant strategies have nothing to do with our lives."

After "years and years of self-education" and dozens of meetings with quant managers, says Mr. Nicks, Pepperdine decided it was ready to make the leap.

Tudor Investment founder backs CargoMetrics and Numerai in high-tech push

Hedge fund magnate Paul Tudor Jones has invested in a brace of artificial-intelligence powered " quantitative " hedge funds, underscoring the increasing acceptance that the industry will need to turn more towards technology and away from traditional human traders.

Mr Tudor Jones has invested in the Boston-based CargoMetrics and the West Coast fund Numerai , according to people familiar with the matter. Cargo-Metrics, backed by Google chairman Eric Schmidt, crunches global shipping data and satellite images to find tradable patterns. The "crowdsourced" Numerai is backed by Renaissance Technologies co-founder Howard Morgan.

CargoMetrics, Numerai and Mr Tudor Jones's $10bn Tudor Investment Corporation all declined to comment. In 2015 the hedge fund manager told his team that "no man is better than a machine, and no machine is better than a man with a machine", according to a person familiar with the matter.

Interest in systematic, algorithmic investing has exploded in recent years, while the appetite for - and performance of - more traditional mutual and hedge funds has waned.

The potential for AI fields such as machine learning to unearth tradable signals in digital data produced around the world has generated particular interest in the past two years.

"In the future, humans won't be doing trading by themselves," Mr Schmidt told a hedge fund conference last week. "There will be two kinds of trading. One would be [where] the human asks the computer, 'here's a very interesting scenario, score it for me and if it's above a certain score we'll buy it'. Then the alternative fight will be for a nonhuman assisted trading, where there's no human asking the question."

Quantitative hedge funds notched up their eighth straight year of client inflows in 2016, doubling their assets from 2009 to $918bn, according to HFR, a data provider. Only a smaller, more sophisticated subset of these funds use AI, but it is often the area that garners the most interest from investors, according to industry executives.

Mr Tudor Jones shot to prominence after betting against the US stock market before the Black Monday crash in 1987. But despite ranking 19th in LCH Investment's list of the top 20-earning hedge fund managers so far, he has found recent years much tougher.

Disappointing performance has spurred the fund to trim staff and cut its fees last year to 1.75 per cent of assets under management and 20 per cent of profits - still above the industry average but far from the 2.75 per cent and 27 per cent it commanded at the start of 2016. Tudor's main fund, BVI Global, has averaged returns of 17.25 per cent since 1986, but this year it is flat, despite rallying markets.

Mr Tudor Jones has in recent years gone on a hiring spree for mathematicians, programmers and data scientists to turn Tudor into what some analysts term a "quantamental" firm, one that marries quantitative strategies with traditional fundamental analysis.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
BlackRock bets on Aladdin as genie of growth; THE BIG PICTURE

World's biggest asset manager plans to extend industry's use of its technology platform, writes Attracta Mooney

Aladdin, the hero of the Arabian Nights , is a complex character. Clever and wily, he also has an insatiable appetite for riches, for bigger and better things. His desire to flaunt his wealth nearly causes his downfall.

Another Aladdin, a technology system developed by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is also clever. It analyses the risks of investing in particular stocks, figures out where to sell bonds to get the best prices, and tracks those trades. And it is wily too, combing through huge data sets to find vital pieces of information for investors.

Since its inception in 1988, when it was developed as an internal risk tool for BlackRock employees, Aladdin has become bigger, better and far more influential. It is now one of the best-known pieces of technology in the fund industry and is widely used by BlackRock's rivals, including Deutsche Asset Management, the $733bn investment house, and Schroders, the UK's largest listed fund manager.

But as Aladdin - which stands for Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network - has grown, concerns have mounted about its influence on markets. There are also questions about whether Aladdin can maintain or increase its hold on the asset management industry as rival technologies emerge.

"Everyone [in asset management] is asking the question whether they should look at Aladdin and whether it is suitable for them. That is not to say Aladdin is suitable for everyone," says Greg Faragher-Thomas, director at Alpha FMC, the consultancy. "Aladdin has pros and cons."

Aladdin started out as a technology to analyse risk but has evolved into a so-called enterprise system, meaning it supports a range of business functions and processes. In a fund house, Aladdin can be used by many people, from portfolio managers right through to those working in compliance, because it combines risk analytics, portfolio management, trading and operation tools on to one system.

First used externally in the mid-1990s, Aladdin is now found at 85 asset managers and institutional investors that have about $20tn in total assets, up from an estimated $11tn just four years ago. The technology carries out 250,000 trades and billions of financial calculations every day.

But with more and more investors using Aladdin, there are concerns about its impact on markets. The argument is that if trillions of dollars are being managed by people using the same risk system, those individuals may be more likely to make the same mistakes.

One senior executive who works in financial technology, who did not want to be named, says: "Do I think there is systemic risk there [with Aladdin]? I don't know. But obviously some significant error or bug could cause problems for markets. It is a question regulators should be looking at."

Jody Kochansky, head of the Aladdin product group at BlackRock, dismisses this concern, arguing that fund houses can tailor the system to their own views. "Each Aladdin client uses the system in a way that suits their objectives. Every Aladdin client has their own risk department, which looks deeply at the model and overlays its own views."

Mr Kochansky adds that asset managers are the fastest-growing source of new business for Aladdin, in a sign that the investment community is not concerned about these potential issues. Aladdin has a 9 per cent share of the 250 largest asset managers and a 15 per cent share of the insurance market, according to Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank.

Many asset managers have recently begun the slow process of overhauling their technology systems after years of neglect. Previously, fund houses often had hundreds of different systems, but Aladdin and similar enterprise platforms allow businesses to cut out huge chunks of IT, reducing costs and jobs in the process.

At the same time, running money has become more complex and there is more regulatory scrutiny of investment decisions. This has meant that fund houses have been forced to assess how technology can help their investment processes.

"Money management is very tricky these days. Any tool that can help you with decisions is going to be highly in demand," says Denise Valentine, senior analyst at Aite Group, the consultancy. "These [enterprise systems] are so core to a money manager. They are the spine of the business."

This rising demand for better technology has helped to boost revenues at BlackRock, which last year stood at $11.2bn. In 2016, Aladdin's revenues rose 13 per cent compared with the previous year. In contrast, BlackRock's management fees in its investment business declined slightly.

Under plans by Larry Fink , BlackRock's chief executive, Aladdin will become an even more important source of cash for the fund giant. Mr Fink recently said that his goal is for Aladdin and the wider BlackRock solutions business to account for about 30 per cent of revenues in five years, compared with 7 per cent currently.

BlackRock's push to diversify its revenue sources comes at a time of turmoil for the asset management industry, where profit margins are falling and there is severe pressure to cut fees. According to Casey Quirk, the consultancy owned by Deloitte, the professional services firm, the average profit margin has fallen from 34 per cent in 2014 to 32 per cent in 2015.

Credit Suisse analysts said in March that Aladdin will play an important role in ensuring profit growth at BlackRock. "We view the solutions business, including Aladdin, as a source of stable revenues," they wrote.

But others question whether Aladdin can maintain its brisk growth. The business faces tough competition from companies such as SimCorp, Bloomberg and Charles River.

The chief executive of a large fund house in Europe, which is reviewing its technology systems, said his business had considered rolling out Aladdin but decided against it. "Aladdin is very expensive and it is not the best out there," he said.

Several other European asset managers, such as Aegon Asset Management, Generali and Unigestion, have also recently chosen SimCorp's Dimension platform instead of Aladdin.

One of the oft-mentioned criticisms of Aladdin is that investors are forced to take on the whole system, rather than just parts of it, something rival systems allow. There are also complaints that while Aladdin is strong in areas such as risk analytics, other parts of the system, such as accounting functions, are disappointing.

Mr Kochansky disagrees, saying it is possible to take parts of the system. "When you compare to the other platforms, Aladdin is known in the marketplace as being much more comprehensive," he said.

Even if there is a stumble in demand, BlackRock is already eyeing up other avenues for Aladdin.

In the past two years, it began promoting Aladdin, which comprises 25m lines of code, in the retail investment space, targeting wealth managers and brokers.

Last week, UBS Wealth Management Americas became the first wealth manager to say it will use Aladdin for risk management and portfolio construction.

Mr Fink has bigger and better ambitions for Aladdin. During an earnings call this year, he was clear about his belief in the system.

"Technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock. It is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry," he said.

The competition

SimCorp's Dimension gains on Aladdin

Just before Christmas last year, SimCorp, a rival to BlackRock, announced a coup. Generali Investments , the Italian fund house with  450bn in assets under management, had decided to use SimCorp's Dimension platform over BlackRock's Aladdin and other options.

At the time, Klaus Holse, chief executive of SimCorp, described the Generali deal as an "important client win".

SimCorp started off as a business offering accountancy software but built this out to create technology that covers a large array of functions for investment houses.

Generali is just the latest of several big European asset managers that have begun using SimCorp in recent years. Others include Aegon Asset Management, which rolled out the SimCorp system in 2014; Unigestion, which went live with Dimension in 2015; Axa Investment Managers, which announced a deal with the technology company in 2015; and UBS Global Asset Management , which SimCorp officially announced as a client in 2015.

Stephen Butcher, managing director of SimCorp for the UK, Ireland and the Middle East, says about $20tn of assets are run on its Dimension system now, not far behind Aladdin's assets. "In Europe in the past two years, we have added $2tn in assets under management on to our front-office platform alone," he adds.

Online Lenders Regain Footing

The initial appeal of upstart online lenders was that they would disrupt traditional loan markets. But after big setbacks last year, the firms are adjusting to be a little more Wall Street and a little less Silicon Valley.

Changes include holding on to the risk of some loans they make, securitizing their loans -- or selling them in packages -- themselves rather than through third parties, and naming veterans of banks and investment firms to executive roles.

Investors in bonds backed by the loans these online platforms helped broker welcomed the moves. Last year, as skepticism mounted about their offerings, these investors pulled back from purchasing their loans. But since the start of April, more than $2 billion in securities backed by loans made by LendingClub Corp., Prosper Marketplace Inc. and their peers have either been sold or are being prepared for an imminent sale, according to credit-rating firms and people familiar with the matter. That is already more than was issued in the entire second quarter of 2016, according to data tracker PeerIQ.

Deals are also getting done at more favorable prices: The extra yield, or spread, investors demanded on recent deals from Social Finance Inc. and Avant Inc., above that of safe government debt, was much lower than on similar deals each lender brought last year.

The most recent activity comes on top of $3 billion in bonds backed by online loans that were issued in the first quarter of 2017, double the amount from the same period a year earlier, according to PeerIQ.

Early last year, confidence in these lenders was rocked by an upsurge in defaults, warnings from bond-rating firms and a scandal that forced out the CEO of industry leader LendingClub. Money managers responded by slowing their purchases of debt issued by these lenders and asked for higher yields.

Since then, online lenders have scrambled to make their credits more attractive to investors. They overhauled their lending criteria, cut off weaker consumers, shortened loan terms and started charging customers more to borrow in an attempt to boost yields.

"It was really important to see there was some kind of a consumer lending background. . .as opposed to just an algorithm," said Joe Astorina, head of asset-backed securities research at AllianceBernstein Holding LP.

Investors are embracing online lenders' debt offerings for their relative value compared with other debt, the better quality of underlying loans and moves they made to more closely resemble established finance firms rather than technology-driven startups.

One factor working in lenders' favor: falling yields in other categories of debt, notably high-yield bonds. While yields on U.S. government debt rose following last November's election in anticipation of stronger economic growth, rates on high-yield debt fell due to expectations companies would fare better under the new administration. That made the lenders' loan packages more attractive on a comparative basis.

The spread demanded by money managers to hold bonds issued by risky companies above that of safe government debt was 3.84 percentage points on Wednesday, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That is down from 6.40 on the same day in 2016 and down from a high of nearly 10 percentage points in February that year.

"We've gone through one messy incident and rebounded from that," said Perry Rahbar, CEO of dv01, which provides analytics on online loans to bond investors.

Information from a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report on an April securitization from Avant Inc. involving 46,896 loans shows how lending standards have changed in the past year. The average loan backing the deal had a balance of $5,359 and a term of 37 months, down from $7,572 and 47 months on an Avant deal from February 2016. Between those transactions, Avant hired Grant Miles, a former senior executive in the U.S. lending business of HSBC Holdings PLC, to be its chief risk officer.

Those changes helped drive Kroll's base case for losses down to a range of 16.3% to 18.3% of the balance of loans in the pool, from between 19% and 21% on the earlier deal. That means investors buying securities backing the loans could hope they carry less risk.

The spread on the least risky slice of Avant's most recent bond deal was 1 percentage point below what it was on a transaction the company completed in the summer of 2016, according to PeerIQ.

To be sure, bonds backed by online loans account for a fraction of the securitization market. In 2016, a total of $7.8 billion of bonds backed by online loans were issued, according to PeerIQ. That compared with $191 billion in total issuance of asset-backed securities, according to S&P Global Ratings.

And while investors have grown more enamored of offerings from online lenders, some bondholders are still smarting from past deals where loss estimates have been revised higher.

The next test of investor appetite for online offerings will be in coming weeks when LendingClub starts to market a roughly $400 million deal of bonds backed by loans it made to less creditworthy consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. Last week, a $450.5 million deal backed by 39,334 Prosper personal loans was oversubscribed, according to a person familiar with the matter. It was the first transaction under Prosper's new Chief Executive David Kimball and new Chief Financial Officer Usama Ashraf, each of whom held senior roles in the finance department of USAA.

Japan's SoftBank Group and Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund on Saturday launched the world's largest technology fund, a nearly $100 billion vehicle that will steer capital to cutting-edge technologies in U.S. startups and other global firms.

In a statement, SoftBank said the fund secured $93 billion of committed capital. The SoftBank Vision Fund is targeting a total of $100 billion within six months. The fund's creation coincides with U.S. President Donald Trump's two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, where he attempted to cement ties with a key counterterrorism ally and drum up business for American firms.

SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has previously promised Mr. Trump that he would invest $50 billion of the fund in U.S. startups and create 50,000 jobs. Mr. Trump cited this as evidence of his presidency bringing jobs back home.

SoftBank said it would invest $28 billion in the fund, including $8.2 billion worth of its stake in chip architecture firm ARM Holdings Inc. SoftBank's announcement didn't specify the investment of its main partner, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Earlier the PIF said it would invest as much as $45 billion in the fund.

"We can make a lot of new initiatives and make entrepreneurs take off a lot quicker, much bigger," Mr. Son said Saturday on the sidelines of a business forum in Riyadh.

Mr. Son is rushing to invest in key technologies ahead of what he predicts will be a robotic revolution and a rush of investment into areas such as deep learning and robotics. The fund enables SoftBank to invest in emerging technologies as artificial intelligence surpasses human capabilities.

The fund is looking to acquire minority and majority interests in private and public companies, according to a statement. It would consider not only emerging technology businesses but also more established, multibillion-dollar companies requiring substantial funding, it said.

SoftBank has negotiated about a dozen deals for the fund, among them deals to invest $1.4 billion in Indian mobile-payments startup Paytm and $1.2 billion in U.S. satellite-internet startup OneWeb Ltd. SoftBank also has led a $502 million fundraising in U.K. virtual-world startup Improbable and an additional $130 million fundraising in Bay Area microbe-designing robot firm Zymergen. All investments of more than $100 million, with the exception of those in ride-hailing firms, will go to the fund, people familiar with the matter have said.

Ahead of the fund's launch on Saturday, Mr. Son said it would focus on investing in sectors including artificial intelligence, smart devices and semiconductors. "We already have lots in the pipeline," he said. "We are investing into genome sequencing. We are investing in virtual-reality simulations, the games, and so on."

The fund marks the entry of a mammoth player in a field of investment traditionally dominated by Western bankers and private-equity groups. The sheer scale of the fund could decide winners and losers in capital-intensive areas, such as in autonomous driving or in biotechnology.

It also follows months of negotiation and delay as SoftBank and Saudi Arabia's PIF wrangled over who would control investment decisions. Mr. Son announced the fund in October with a launch as early as December in mind. It took a further five months for the fund to come together.

The Quants Run Wall Street Now --- The long-imagined day when data-driven traders would dominate markets has arrived

Alexey Poyarkov, a former gold-medal winner of the International Mathematical Olympiad for high-school students, spent most of his early career honing algorithms at technology companies such as Microsoft Corp., where he helped make the Bing search engine smarter at ferreting out pornography.

Last year, a bidding war for Mr. Poyarkov broke out among hedge-fund heavyweights Renaissance Technologies LLC, Citadel LLC and TGS Management Co. When it was over, he went to work at TGS in Irvine, Calif., and could earn as much as $700,000 in his first year, say people familiar with the contract.

The Russian-born software engineer, who declined to comment, as did the hedge funds, had almost no financial experience. What TGS wanted was his wizardry at designing algorithms, sets of rules used to power calculations and problem-solving, which in the investment world can quickly parse data and decide what to buy and sell, often with little human involvement.

Up and down Wall Street, algorithmic-driven trading and the quants who use sophisticated statistical models to find attractive trades are taking over the investment world.

On many trading floors, quants are gaining respect, clout and money as investment firms scramble to hire mathematicians and scientists. Traditional trading strategies, such as sifting through balance sheets and talking to companies' customers, are falling down the pecking order.

"A decade ago, the brightest graduates all wanted to be traders at Wall Street investment banks, but now they're climbing over each other to get into quant funds," says Anthony Lawler, who helps run quantitative investing at GAM Holding AG. The Swiss money manager last year bought British quant firm Cantab Capital Partners for at least $217 million to help it expand into computer-powered funds.

Guggenheim Partners LLC built what it calls a "supercomputing cluster" for $1 million at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California to help crunch numbers for Guggenheim's quant investment funds, says Marcos Lopez de Prado, a Guggenheim senior managing director. Electricity for the computers costs another $1 million a year.

Algorithmic trading has been around for a long time but was tiny. An article in The Wall Street Journal in 1974 featured quant pioneer Ed Thorp. In 1988, the Journal profiled a little-known Chicago options-trading firm that had a secret computer system. Journal reporter Scott Patterson wrote a best-selling book in 2010 about the rise of quants.

Prognosticators imagined a time when data-driven traders who live by algorithms rather than instincts would become the kings of Wall Street.

That day has arrived. In just one sign of their power, quantitative hedge funds are now responsible for 27% of all U.S. stock trades by investors, up from 14% in 2013, according to the Tabb Group, a research and consulting firm in New York.

Quants have almost caught up to individual investors, which outnumber quants and collectively have 29% of all stock-trading volume.

At the end of the first quarter, quant-focused hedge funds held $932 billion of investments, or more than 30% of all hedge-fund assets, estimates HFR Inc. In 2009, quant funds held $408 billion, or 25% of all hedge-fund assets.

Quants got $4.6 billion of net new investments in the first quarter, while the overall hedge-fund business saw withdrawals of $5.5 billion.

The computers are outperforming humans at picking investments. In the past five years, quant-focused hedge funds gained about 5.1% a year on average. The average hedge fund rose 4.3% a year in the same period.

In the first quarter, quant funds rose about 3%, compared with 2.5% for the average hedge fund.

Quants have been helped by two transformative forces. Regulatory scrutiny has made it hard for investors to obtain an edge through methods such as prodding company executives for information or tapping expert networks that included employees of public companies.

Even more important, investors now have at their fingertips an expanding ocean of data about the global economy and financial data, such as changes in earnings estimates and accounts receivable.

The next frontier: tapping data from drones and other cutting-edge sources to help understand companies and the economy in real time.

Quants are different from high-frequency traders, who tend to focus on very short-term trades that might last just milliseconds. High-frequency traders have been under pressure as market volatility dips and competition grows.

Exchange-traded funds also use algorithms but are geared more to investors who want exposure to certain industries or sectors.

Quantitative-driven trades can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few months. The biggest quant firms, including Renaissance, Two Sigma Investments LLC, D.E. Shaw Group, PDT Partners and TGS, make thousands of trades and manage tens of billions of dollars in investor assets.

Some analysts worry that firms and investors stampeding into the quant business might be disappointed. The most successful quants have been operating for years. And hiring Ph.D.s doesn't guarantee profits.

More competition could hurt returns and give a false sense of security about the market's stability. In 2007, what became known as the "quant meltdown" was caused largely by the similarity of strategies among quants, who simultaneously rushed to sell, causing losses at other firms and more selling.

Mathematician William Byers, who wrote the 2010 book "How Mathematicians Think," warns that rendering the world in numbers can give investors a deceptive belief that predictions churned out of computers are more reliable than they truly are. The more investors flock to complicated algorithmic models, the more likely it is some algorithms will be similar to one another, possibly fueling larger market disruptions, some analysts say.

So far, though, nothing has stopped the quant arms race, which is creating new jobs previously unheard of in the finance industry.

Citadel, of Chicago, has a chief scientist to run its analytics and quantitative strategies. Balyasny Asset Management LP hired in August data scientist Gilbert Haddad, formerly of Schlumberger Ltd. and General Electric Co., to overhaul data and analytics at the New York hedge-fund firm. He studied nanoparticles at the University of Wisconsin and has a Ph.D. in engineering.

"You take tours of offices, and everyone is always pointing out some guy off in a corner, working on his own," says Alexandru Agachi, chief operating officer at Empiric Capital Ltd., a startup quant hedge fund in London. "They say with pride: 'Over there is our quant. He's building signals.' "

It's common for hedge funds to retool themselves to fit the latest popular strategy. Many funds dove into mortgages after the financial crisis ebbed. Some turned into "macro" investors in anticipation of global economic shifts.

Hedge-fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen's investment firm, Point72 Asset Management, with $12 billion in assets, is shifting about half of its portfolio managers to what it calls a "man plus machine" approach.

Teams that use old-school research methods are working alongside data scientists. Financial analysts are taking evening classes to learn data-science basics. Point72 is plowing tens of millions of dollars into a group that analyzes reams of data, including credit- card receipts and foot traffic captured by apps on smartphones. The results are passed on to traders at the Stamford, Conn., investment firm.

Point72 lost money in most of its traditional trading strategies last year, say people familiar with the results. The firm's quant investors made about $500 million.

Matthew Granade, Point72's chief market-intelligence officer, recently encouraged London School of Economics students to learn basic programming languages, like R and Python, to become more competitive when they graduate. Investors are shifting their preference from "artisan to engineer," he said.

Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones is one of the best-known investors in history. The former cotton trader anticipated the 1987 stock-market crash and made gigantic profits with quick bursts of trading, averaging annual gains of more than 17% since then. His hedge-fund firm, Tudor Investment Corp., barely made any money in 2014 and 2015, though.

By last year, Mr. Jones was feeling pressure from more successful quant traders, according to people close to the firm. In October, Mr. Jones chose Dario Villani, an Italian with a doctorate in theoretical physics who was hired in 2015, to help rejuvenate Tudor.

Hunkered down with a team of quants and other Tudor employees in a small house on an estate in Greenwich, Conn., Mr. Villani began developing computer programs to replicate trading positions of Tudor's portfolio managers using instruments that better allow the firm to increase risk to improve returns without endangering the hedge fund or Tudor, people familiar with the matter say.

Despite the changes, Tudor's two key funds were flat in 2016 as well as so far this year, even as markets have climbed.

Humans have long searched relentlessly for ways to gain an information edge. Legend has it that financier Baron Rothschild built a network of field agents and carrier pigeons in 1815 to get a jump on the Battle of Waterloo outcome. Today's quants hope to digest -- and act on -- economic and corporate information faster than traditional investors.

Hedge funds with quant-focused strategies have been poring over private Chinese and Russian consumer surveys, illicit pharmaceutical sales on the dark web -- a network of websites used by hackers and others to anonymously share information -- and hotel bookings by U.S. travelers, according to Quandl Inc., a platform for such data.

In the late 1990s, an algorithm might have simply tried to ride the momentum of a stock's price rise, buying at a certain price level and selling at a predetermined moment. Today's algorithms can make continuous predictions based on analysis of past and present data while hundreds of real-time inputs bombard the computers with various signals.

Some investment firms are pushing into machine learning, which allows computers to analyze data and come up with their own predictive algorithms. Those machines no longer rely on humans to write the formulas.

Algorithms and quants eventually could sharply reduce the need for large investment staffs. A machine-driven algorithm might help quantitative researchers discover dozens of new algorithms in the time it used to take to create one.

In the battle for talent, quant-focused firms often are reluctant to call themselves hedge funds or even investment firms. Quant firms would rather emphasize their similarities to cutting-edge tech companies in Silicon Valley.

Two Sigma, based in New York, has in-house hacker labs, robotics competitions and game rooms. Empiric calls itself a "technology company operating in financial markets."

Saeed Amen, a quantitative researcher in London, says his investment strategies were considered "very niche" for most of his 14-year career.

He organized social events for quants, including occasional gatherings of a group called the Thalesians after ancient Greek geometer Thales of Miletus. The beer and conversation sometimes attracted fewer than a dozen people.

Mr. Amen's phone has started ringing with calls from hedge-fund managers in the U.S. and Europe. They don't all want automated investing algorithms, but they are trying to figure out how to make better predictions, he says.

Much of that push is coming from investors such as Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif. Last year, the college placed about 10% of its $750 million portfolio in big quant funds, including those run by Man Group PLC of London and AQR Capital Management LLC, Greenwich, Conn.

Until then, Pepperdine had "essentially zero" quant investments, says Michael Nicks, its director of investments. "The narrative of fundamental investing is much more comfortable to digest," he says. "Finding a company with good prospects makes sense, since we look for undervalued things in our daily lives, but quant strategies have nothing to do with our lives."

After "years and years of self-education" and dozens of meetings with quant managers, says Mr. Nicks, Pepperdine decided it was ready to make the leap.

Investors Return To Online Lenders

The initial appeal of upstart online lenders was that they would disrupt traditional loan markets. But after big setbacks last year, the firms are adjusting to be a little more Wall Street and a little less Silicon Valley.

Changes include holding on to the risk of some loans they make, securitizing their loans -- or selling them in packages -- themselves rather than through third parties, and naming veterans of banks and investment firms to executive roles.

Investors in bonds backed by the loans these online platforms helped broker welcomed the moves. Last year, as skepticism mounted about their offerings, these investors pulled back from purchasing their loans. But since the start of April, more than $2 billion in securities backed by loans made by LendingClub Corp., Prosper Marketplace Inc. and their peers have either been sold or are being prepared for an imminent sale, according to credit-rating firms and people familiar with the matter. That is already more than was issued in the entire second quarter of 2016, according to data tracker PeerIQ.

Deals are also getting done at more favorable prices: The extra yield, or spread, investors demanded on recent deals from Social Finance Inc. and Avant Inc., above that of safe government debt, was much lower than on similar deals each lender brought last year.

The most recent activity comes in addition to $3 billion in bonds backed by online loans that were issued in the first quarter of 2017, double the amount from the same period a year earlier, according to PeerIQ.

Early last year, confidence in these lenders was rocked by an upsurge in defaults, warnings from bond-rating firms and a scandal that forced out the CEO of industry leader LendingClub. Money managers responded by slowing their purchases of debt issued by these lenders and asked for higher yields.

Since then, online lenders have scrambled to make their credits more attractive to investors. They overhauled their lending criteria, cut off weaker consumers, shortened loan terms and started charging customers more to borrow in an attempt to boost yields.

"It was really important to see there was some kind of a consumer lending background. . .as opposed to just an algorithm," said Joe Astorina, head of asset-backed securities research at AllianceBernstein Holding LP.

Investors are embracing online lenders' debt offerings for their relative value compared with other debt, the better quality of underlying loans and moves they made to more closely resemble established finance firms rather than technology-driven startups.

One factor working in lenders' favor: falling yields in other categories of debt, notably high-yield bonds. While yields on U.S. government debt rose following last November's election in anticipation of stronger economic growth, rates on high-yield debt fell due to expectations companies would fare better under the new administration. That made the lenders' loan packages more attractive on a comparative basis.

The spread demanded by money managers to hold bonds issued by risky companies above that of safe government debt was 3.84 percentage points on Wednesday, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That is down from 6.40 on the same day in 2016 and down from a high of nearly 10 percentage points in February that year.

"We've gone through one messy incident and rebounded from that," said Perry Rahbar, CEO of dv01, which provides analytics on online loans to bond investors.

Information from a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report on an April securitization from Avant Inc. involving 46,896 loans shows how lending standards have changed in the past year. The average loan backing the deal had a balance of $5,359 and a term of 37 months, down from $7,572 and 47 months on an Avant deal from February 2016. Between those transactions, Avant hired Grant Miles, a former senior executive in the U.S. lending business of HSBC Holdings PLC, to be its chief risk officer.

Those changes helped drive Kroll's base case for losses down to a range of 16.3% to 18.3% of the balance of loans in the pool, from between 19% and 21% on the earlier deal. That means investors buying securities backing the loans could hope they carry less risk.

The spread on the least risky slice of Avant's most recent bond deal was 1 percentage point below what it was on a transaction the company completed in the summer of 2016, according to PeerIQ.

To be sure, bonds backed by online loans account for a fraction of the securitization market. In 2016, a total of $7.8 billion of bonds backed by online loans were issued, according to PeerIQ. That compared with $191 billion in total issuance of asset-backed securities, according to S&P Global Ratings.

And while investors have grown more enamored of offerings from online lenders, some bondholders are still smarting from past deals where loss estimates have been revised higher.

The next test of investor appetite for online offerings will be in coming weeks when LendingClub starts to market a roughly $400 million deal of bonds backed by loans it made to less creditworthy consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. Last week, a $450.5 million deal backed by 39,334 Prosper personal loans was oversubscribed, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Bond Buyers Forgive and Forget, Flock Back to Online Lenders' Debt; Online lenders have scrambled to make their credits more attractive to investors by overhauling their lending criteria and shortening loan terms

The initial appeal of upstart, online lenders was that they would disrupt traditional loan markets. But after big setbacks last year, the firms are adjusting to be a little more Wall Street and a little less Silicon Valley.

Changes include holding on to the risk of some loans they make, securitizing their loans or selling them in packages themselves rather than through third parties, and naming veterans of banks and investment firms to executive roles.

Investors in bonds backed by the loans these online platforms helped broker welcomed the moves. Last year, as skepticism mounted about their offerings, these investors pulled back from purchasing their loans. But since the start of April, more than $2 billion in securities backed by loans made by LendingClub Corp., Prosper Marketplace Inc. and their peers have either been sold or are being prepared for an imminent sale, according to credit-rating firms and people familiar with the matter. That is already more than was issued in the entire second quarter of 2016, according to data tracker PeerIQ.

Deals are also getting done at more favorable prices: The extra yield, or spread, investors demanded on recent deals from Social Finance Inc. and Avant Inc., above that of safe government debt, was much lower than on similar deals each lender brought last year.

The most recent activity comes on top of $3 billion in bonds backed by online loans that were issued in the first quarter of 2017, double the amount from the same period a year earlier, according to PeerIQ.

Early last year, confidence in these lenders was rocked by an upsurge in defaults, warnings from bond-rating firms and a scandal that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lendingclub-ceo-resigns-over-sales-review-1462795070" of industry leader LendingClub. Money managers responded by "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-offering-tied-to-prosper-marketplace-loans-gets-chilly-reception-1458934559"issued by these lenders and asked for higher yields.

Since then, online lenders have scrambled to make their credits more attractive to investors. They overhauled their lending criteria, cut off weaker consumers, shortened loan terms and started charging customers more to borrow in an attempt to boost yields.

"It was really important to see there was some kind of a consumer lending background &as opposed to just an algorithm," said Joe Astorina, head of asset-backed securities research at AllianceBernstein Holding LP.

Investors are embracing online lenders' debt offerings for their relative value compared with other debt, the better quality of underlying loans and moves they made to more closely resemble established finance firms rather than technology-driven startups.

One factor working in lenders' favor: falling yields in other categories of debt, notably high-yield bonds. While yields on U.S. government debt rose following last November's election in anticipation of stronger economic growth, rates on high-yield debt fell due to expectations companies would fare better under the new administration. That made the lenders' loan packages more attractive on a comparative basis.

The spread demanded by money managers to hold bonds issued by risky companies above that of safe government debt was 3.84 percentage points on Wednesday, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That is down from 6.40 on the same day in 2016 and down from a high of nearly 10 percentage points in February that year.

"We've gone through one messy incident and rebounded from that," said Perry Rahbar, CEO of dv01, which provides analytics on online loans to bond investors.

Information from a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report on an April securitization from Avant Inc. involving 46,896 loans shows how lending standards have changed in the past year. The average loan backing the deal had a balance of $5,359 and a term of 37 months, down from $7,572 and 47 months on an Avant deal from February 2016. Between those transactions, Avant hired Grant Miles, a former senior executive in the U.S. lending business of HSBC Holdings PLC, to be its chief risk officer.

Those changes helped drive Kroll's base case for losses down to a range of 16.3% to 18.3% of the balance of loans in the pool, from between 19% and 21% on the earlier deal. That means investors buying securities backing the loans could hope they carry less risk.

The spread on the least risky slice of Avant's most recent bond deal was 1 percentage point below what it was on a transaction the company completed in the summer of 2016, according to PeerIQ.

To be sure, bonds backed by online loans account for a fraction of the securitization market. In 2016, a total of $7.8 billion of bonds backed by online loans were issued, according to PeerIQ. That compared with $191 billion in total issuance of asset-backed securities, according to S&P Global Ratings.

And while investors have grown more enamored of offerings from online lenders, some bondholders are still smarting from past deals where loss estimates have been revised higher.

The next test of investor appetite for online offerings will be in coming weeks when LendingClub starts to market a roughly $400 million deal of bonds backed by loans it made to less creditworthy consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. Last week, a $450.5 million deal backed by 39,334 Prosper personal loans was oversubscribed, according to a person familiar with the matter. It was the first transaction under Prosper's new Chief Executive David Kimball and new Chief Financial Officer Usama Ashraf, each of whom held senior roles in the finance department of USAA.

Who's in Charge of Outer Space? All extraterrestrial activity today is governed by a 50-year-old, Cold War-era treaty. Will governments agree on an update before the final frontier becomes the Wild West?

In space, no one can hear you scheme. But here on Earth, plans to go where few have gone before are getting louder by the minute.

In February, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo passed its third glide-flight test, putting it on pace to offer suborbital space tourism by the end of 2018. In March, Goldman Sachs announced to investors that a single asteroid containing $25 billion to $50 billion of platinum could be mined by a spacecraft costing only $2.6 billion less than a third of what has been invested in Uber.

"While the psychological barrier to mining asteroids is high," the Goldman report concludes, "the actual financial and technological barriers are far lower." In April, NASA selected Trans Astronautica Corp., an aerospace company based in Lake View Terrace, Calif., for $3.25 million in technology study grants. Among TransAstra's NASA-approved projects: an asteroid-hunting telescope whose stated mission is "to start a gold rush in space."

The final frontier is starting to look a lot like the Wild West. As more companies announce ambitious plans to do business beyond Earth, serious questions are emerging about the legality of off-planet activity.

Everything that happens in space falls under the purview of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies. This international agreement, also known as the Outer Space Treaty, turned 50 years old in January. More than 100 countries, including the U.S., Russia and China, are parties to the treaty. "It's the Constitution and the Magna Carta of space law," says Sagi Kfir, general counsel for Deep Space Industries, an asteroid-mining company based in Mountain View, Calif. "It's so fundamental that its principles have become customary international law even for those countries that aren't signatories."

The treaty's principal drafters, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., were primarily concerned with nuclear weapons when they met in 1967 at the United Nations; Article IV of the treaty prohibits military installations and weapons of mass destruction from being placed in orbit or on other worlds. Further stipulations guarantee freedom of access to all nations, ban territorial claims and promote scientific cooperation. Above all, the treaty was designed to ensure that space exploration occur peacefully and for the benefit of all mankind. "I think you can compress the main principles down to two," says Henry Hertzfeld, a professor of space policy and international affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. "One is the Golden Rule, and the other is don't do anything stupid; more specifically, don't do anything that will cause harm or get in the way of others in space."

But the Golden Rule isn't a governing principle for competitive companies, who are certain to get in each other's way if space exploration proves as profitable as Goldman Sachs suggests. Drafted at a time when only governments had the resources to mount space missions, the Outer Space Treaty mentions "nongovernmental entities" in only one of its 17 articles. It makes no provisions for asteroid mining or suborbital tourism or the colonization of Mars, which leaves many of today's space-faring companies in something of a legal gray area.

One of the biggest modern-day sticking points stems from Article VI, which states that nongovernmental entities i.e. private businesses must receive "authorization and continuing supervision" from their country of origin. Article VI was originally a compromise between the communist Soviets, who wanted to ban off-planet commercial activity, and the Americans, who insisted that space be open for business. "The Soviets said, 'If you Americans are so crazy that you want those private-sector activities to be permitted, go ahead,' " says Frans von der Dunk, a professor of space law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. " 'But you're responsible for their doings, and if they cause damage, you have to pay as a government.' "

All space-faring nations have set up their own administrative regimes to manage commercial players, but their jurisdictions are hazy. In the U.S., no company can launch a rocket into orbit without express permission from the Federal Aviation Administration, whose regulatory framework was developed mostly to license rockets that launch satellites. The FAA has never had to grapple with ventures such as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-ceos-rocket-company-to-compete-aggressively-for-commercial-launches-1488975249" to enable humans to live and work in space. And the agency's rulings on less ambitious plans have already raised eyebrows. In 2015, Bigelow Aerospace asked the FAA whether its inflatable lunar commercial bases would make it through the agency's approval process. The FAA responded that it wouldn't stand in the way of business development and wouldn't permit a launch that could deploy a payload within the vicinity of a Bigelow's proposed commercial bases. But in its letter to Bigelow, the FAA acknowledged a concern from the U.S. State Department that "the national regulatory framework, in its present form, is ill-equipped to enable the U.S. government to fulfill its obligations" under the Outer Space Treaty. Whether the FAA will be able to regulate anything beyond launch, re-entry and launch/re-entry sites remains to be seen.

The push for clearer regulations is a rare point of bipartisan consensus among U.S. lawmakers. In March, the House of Representatives held a hearing to discuss how new business will comply with Article VI of the treaty. Rep. James Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, spoke in favor of giving the FAA authority to regulate all activity not currently covered under existing laws. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas went further at a Senate hearing in April, calling for a review and update of the original Outer Space Treaty. "Congress needs to continue to work to ensure that investment in innovation within the commercial space sector isn't chilled by obsolete regulations or overly burdensome requirements that may not naturally apply to new business models," he said. A series of hearings to discuss updating the document is scheduled for later this month.

Private space companies have generally supported new space regulations, citing a need for clarity. The private sector cheered in 2015 when President Barack Obama signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which stated that commercial entities could extract resources from an asteroid and sell them for a profit. But the decision has also proved controversial. Several countries have expressed concern that asteroid or moon mining will be open to only a few wealthy nations and corporations, leaving many on Earth behind. "The widening gap of poverty is a weapon of mass destruction," said Jos Monserrat Filho of the Brazilian Association of Air and Space Law. Filho echoed the language of the Outer Space Treaty when he voiced his concerns at the March meeting of the U.N.'s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. "More than ever our planet needs for outer space activities to be carried out for the benefit of all mankind," he said. Delegates from Russia and several European countries voiced similar concerns at the meeting and requested an international regulatory regime to govern space resource extraction. Article II expressly forbids any national appropriation or claim of sovereignty. The question the world now faces is whether you can mine an asteroid without owning it.

The treaty declares the moon and other celestial bodies to be res communis, meaning they exist for the common good and belong to no one. Michael J. Listner, an East Rochester, N.H., lawyer with a specialty in space policy, says the res communis designation means resources found in outer space aren't for the taking. "Everybody can use the resource of a local park," Listner says, "but they can't just chop down a tree and walk away with it to build their house."

Not everyone agrees. "It's like on the high seas," another res communis area, says von der Dunk. "Everyone is allowed to fish as long as they follow the international rules."

The U.S. has adopted the latter interpretation of the treaty, along with Luxembourg, which hopes to become a hub of space commerce, and the United Arab Emirates, which is currently completing its own domestic space laws to allow asteroid mining. If enough countries take a similar stance, this reading could become customary international law. All eyes are now on China, which took a more equivocal stance during the U.N. meeting in March, saying that space-faring nations "should strike a balance between the freedom of utilization and the equitable sharing of benefits." At the conclusion of the meeting, the U.N. committee elected to hold off on any decisions and revisit the issue in 2018.

There are more urgent questions to answer before the era of commercial space travel and settlement can commence, questions that the Outer Space Treaty's drafters couldn't have anticipated. How will a population on another planet be governed? Under the current treaty, individuals are subject to the laws of their country of origin, though what that might look like in a large and diverse settlement remains to be seen. And what if a private company owns the infrastructure necessary for humans to survive? "We will have to find a way to apply civil rights in an environment that is hostile to life-forms," says Joanne Gabrynowicz, a director of the International Institute of Space Law. "Is there a right to breathing, or do you have the responsibility to buy your own air?"

Elon Musk, CEO and founder of Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, has spoken frequently and publicly about his "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spacex-chief-elon-musk-sets-out-benefits-challenges-of-reusing-rockets-1490931516". At last year's International Astronautical Congress in Mexico, he unveiled a rocket transport system that he likened to the 19th-century transcontinental railroad. "Our goal is just to make sure you can get there," Musk said during a question-and-answer session after the unveiling. SpaceX declined to comment further. How potential settlers will live and breathe on Mars is anybody's guess.

The limitless expanse around us has been a peaceful arena for the past 50 years, but the complex relationships between major space-faring powers like Russia, China and the U.S. are unlikely to remain Earthbound. A lunar land grab could make the dispute over man-made islands in the South China Sea look simple. "Nobody's going to behave better in outer space than they do here," says Laura Montgomery, a former FAA attorney who now has her own private practice in space law and policy. "But it's easier to have lawyers argue about it than to have a shootout at the O.K. Corral."

Banking & Finance: Breakup of Big Banks Not in Cards

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration took the idea of breaking up big banks off the table Thursday, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin telling a congressional panel that isn't what officials have in mind in reviewing the line between commercial- and investment-banking activities.

"We do not support a separation of banks from investment banks," Mr. Mnuchin said before the Senate Banking Committee. He said doing so would create problems for the "financial markets, on the economy, and liquidity."

The statement was a strong indication the Trump administration's review of U.S. banking regulations will be less onerous than Wall Street's worst fears. Officials say their priority is overhauling regulations with the aim of boosting lending and economic growth.

President Donald Trump's economic team has said it is considering a modern version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act -- a partially repealed law that would force the largest U.S. banks to break themselves apart if it were still in effect. The issue has created confusion and angst among bankers and analysts every time an official mentions the topic.

One reason for the tension: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a member of the banking committee, has introduced a bill she also calls the "21st Century Glass-Steagall Act."

Her bill, which has yet to receive support from any other committee members, mandates that a financial company can't own a traditional bank -- one that takes deposits, makes loans and processes payments -- alongside other business, such as underwriting and marketing stocks and bonds. The 1933 version of Glass-Steagall included similar prohibitions before it was partly repealed in 1999.

Those who support a revival of Glass-Steagall argue, among other things, that combining securities and banking activities allows financial firms to become too large and politically powerful, which in turn allows them to take excessive risks, exploit clients and rely on taxpayer bailouts if they get in trouble.

Behemoths such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., and Bank of America Corp. would have to split apart under Ms. Warren's proposal. For other Wall Street titans, the impact might be less severe. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on May 9 that although he doesn't believe reinstating Glass-Steagall makes sense today, "our adaptation to that would be relatively easy," because the firm's bank is "very minor" compared with its other businesses.

Ms. Warren on Thursday said it was "just bizarre" that the Trump administration could claim to support Glass-Steagall without supporting bank breakups.

More details about how the Trump administration wants to tailor rules should come in June, when the Treasury Department is scheduled to report to Mr. Trump about a broad review of financial regulations.

National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn in April said, "If we come up with a 21st-century, modern Glass-Steagall, we may be able to tailor regulation for different aspects of the financial markets and different aspects of financial institutions."

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika -- the only bank regulator the Trump administration has installed so far -- is skeptical of returning to Glass-Steagall. In an interview last week, he said banks are safer if they rely on several different businesses for revenue.

Mr. Noreika also said Glass-Steagall would have limited the government's options during the 2008 financial crisis. J.P. Morgan couldn't have purchased the teetering Bear Stearns investment bank, Bank of America couldn't have bought struggling Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley couldn't have converted to bank holding companies to stabilize themselves.

"It may sound like great politics to say we are going to bring back all the sections of Glass-Steagall," Mr. Noreika said, "but do you want another Bear Stearns?"

Analysts say the administration could use existing regulatory authority to restrict interactions at subsidiaries of large financial firms, while cutting back regulations that apply to each type of business.

"Mr. Trump can have his Glass-Steagall cake and still eat regulatory relief because the rules for banks could get a lot less binding even as [bank holding companies] are severed into component parts," Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics Inc., said in an April note to clients.

A key question, according Ms. Petrou, is how the separate businesses will be regulated.

Under one proposal from Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig, big firms' banking and securities businesses would have to fund themselves mostly separately and with a higher share of investor equity than they do today.

BlackRock bets on Aladdin as genie of growth

Aladdin, the hero of the Arabian Nights, is a complex character. Clever and wily, he also has an insatiable appetite for riches, for bigger and better things. His desire to flaunt his wealth nearly causes his downfall.

Another Aladdin, a technology system developed by BlackRock, the world s largest asset manager, is also clever. It analyses the risks of investing in particular stocks, figures out where to sell bonds to get the best prices, and tracks those trades. And it is wily too, combing through huge data sets to find vital pieces of information for investors.

Since its inception in 1988, when it was developed as an internal risk tool for BlackRock employees, Aladdin has become bigger, better and far more influential. It is now one of the best-known pieces of technology in the fund industry and is widely used by BlackRock s rivals, including Deutsche Asset Management, the $733bn investment house, and Schroders, the UK s largest listed fund manager.

But as Aladdin   which stands for Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network   has grown, concerns have mounted about its influence on markets. There are also questions about whether Aladdin can maintain or increase its hold on the asset management industry as rival technologies emerge.

 Everyone [in asset management] is asking the question whether they should look at Aladdin and whether it is suitable for them. That is not to say Aladdin is suitable for everyone,  says Greg Faragher-Thomas, director at Alpha FMC, the consultancy.  Aladdin has pros and cons. 

Aladdin started out as a technology to analyse risk but has evolved into a so-called enterprise system, meaning it supports a range of business functions and processes. In a fund house, Aladdin can be used by many people, from portfolio managers right through to those working in compliance, because it combines risk analytics, portfolio management, trading and operation tools on to one system.

First used externally in the mid-1990s, Aladdin is now found at 85 asset managers and institutional investors that have about $20tn in total assets, up from an estimated $11tn just four years ago. The technology carries out 250,000 trades and billions of financial calculations every day.

But with more and more investors using Aladdin, there are concerns about its impact on markets. The argument is that if trillions of dollars are being managed by people using the same risk system, those individuals may be more likely to make the same mistakes.

One senior executive who works in financial technology, who did not want to be named, says:  Do I think there is systemic risk there [with Aladdin]? I don t know. But obviously some significant error or bug could cause problems for markets. It is a question regulators should be looking at. 

Jody Kochansky, head of the Aladdin product group at BlackRock, dismisses this concern, arguing that fund houses can tailor the system to their own views.  Each Aladdin client uses the system in a way that suits their objectives. Every Aladdin client has their own risk department, which looks deeply at the model and overlays its own views. 

Mr Kochansky adds that asset managers are the fastest-growing source of new business for Aladdin, in a sign that the investment community is not concerned about these potential issues. Aladdin has a 9 per cent share of the 250 largest asset managers and a 15 per cent share of the insurance market, according to Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank.

Many asset managers have recently begun the slow process of overhauling their technology systems after years of neglect. Previously, fund houses often had hundreds of different systems, but Aladdin and similar enterprise platforms allow businesses to cut out huge chunks of IT, reducing costs and jobs in the process.

At the same time, running money has become more complex and there is more regulatory scrutiny of investment decisions. This has meant that fund houses have been forced to assess how technology can help their investment processes.

 Money management is very tricky these days. Any tool that can help you with decisions is going to be highly in demand,  says Denise Valentine, senior analyst at Aite Group, the consultancy.  These [enterprise systems] are so core to a money manager. They are the spine of the business. 

This rising demand for better technology has helped to boost revenues at BlackRock, which last year stood at $11.2bn. In 2016, Aladdin s revenues rose 13 per cent compared with the previous year. In contrast, BlackRock s management fees in its investment business declined slightly.

Under plans by "https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Larry_Fink", BlackRock s chief executive, Aladdin will become an even more important source of cash for the fund giant. Mr Fink recently said that his goal is for Aladdin and the wider BlackRock solutions business to account for about 30 per cent of revenues in five years, compared with 7 per cent currently.

BlackRock s push to diversify its revenue sources comes at a time of turmoil for the asset management industry, where profit margins are falling and there is severe pressure to cut fees. According to Casey Quirk, the consultancy owned by Deloitte, the professional services firm, the average profit margin has fallen from 34 per cent in 2014 to 32 per cent in 2015.

Credit Suisse analysts said in March that Aladdin will play an important role in ensuring profit growth at BlackRock.  We view the solutions business, including Aladdin, as a source of stable revenues,  they wrote.

But others question whether Aladdin can maintain its brisk growth. The business faces tough competition from companies such as SimCorp, Bloomberg and Charles River.

The chief executive of a large fund house in Europe, which is reviewing its technology systems, said his business had considered rolling out Aladdin but decided against it.  Aladdin is very expensive and it is not the best out there,  he said.

Several other European asset managers, such as Aegon Asset Management, Generali and Unigestion, have also recently chosen SimCorp s Dimension platform instead of Aladdin.

One of the oft-mentioned criticisms of Aladdin is that investors are forced to take on the whole system, rather than just parts of it, something rival systems allow. There are also complaints that while Aladdin is strong in areas such as risk analytics, other parts of the system, such as accounting functions, are disappointing.

Mr Kochansky disagrees, saying it is possible to take parts of the system.  When you compare to the other platforms, Aladdin is known in the marketplace as being much more comprehensive,  he said.

Even if there is a stumble in demand, BlackRock is already eyeing up other avenues for Aladdin.

In the past two years, it began promoting Aladdin, which comprises 25m lines of code, in the retail investment space, targeting wealth managers and brokers.

Last week, UBS Wealth Management Americas became the first wealth manager to say it will use Aladdin for risk management and portfolio construction.

Mr Fink has bigger and better ambitions for Aladdin. During an earnings call this year, he was clear about his belief in the system.

 Technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock. It is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry,  he said.

When should the greying founder of a private equity firm hand over the reins to the next generation?

It s an evergreen question in the PEcommunity. Consider that billionaire foundersincludingApollo s Leon Black,65,KKR sHenry Kravis,73,Blackstone s SteveSchwarzman,70andCarlyle s David Rubenstein,67,show no signs of slowing down.

Alan Patricof, the octogenarian former boss atApax, has a novel answer: now (but with a majorcaveat).

Patricof believes old-school founders should step back but stay in close contactwith their successors. That wouldentail giving up day-to-day decision making and working part-time,saythree days a week for only a few hours a day. The idea is anathema tomost private equity titans, even in cases where questions of health raise uncertainties inside the firm.

So is 60 a good age to let go? No way, Patricof (below) saysin an FT interviewhere.  I was 70 when I stepped back. But I would come up with some concept about succession that didn t relate to age. I would keep founders in a chairman-type role,  he says.

Top-tier money managers are anxious to know who will replace the lions of the industry. Many in New York, interviewed by DD over the past week, went off-the-record to concede that it remains a major concern.

But in the words of one senior executive at a large US buyout group:  Do you want to be the guy who asks Leon Black when he s retiring?

Elliott s  prosecutorial  approach

WhenJon Pollock(below) says that  patience and persistence  are hallmarks atElliott Management, the co-chief executive of the activist investor isn t kidding. Over the past 40years, the New York-based hedge fund has turned its willingness to engage inprotracted legal fights into itsmodus operandi.

Whether it s spending 15 years in court battling Argentinaover its defaulted debt or fighting a multi-pronged legal clash in Italy to help one of its companies buy a rail signalling equipment group, Pollock and founderPaul Singerhave shown they re in it for the long haul.

The FT s Lindsay Fortado sat down with Pollock for arare interview. Here are a couple of key extracts:

*

Elliott s belligerent legal strategies and bellicose public language mask a patient strategising that reflectsSinger s early career as a lawyer. Mr Singer has called it  using every tool in the tool chest .

*

In its 40-year history, Elliott has had only 12 losing quarters, and only two down years. In two years   2007 and 2009   the fund returned more than 30 per cent.

What s the other side of the story?Jeff Ubben,chief executive ofValueAct, an activist fund that unlike Elliott keeps its pressure behind the scenes, had this to say about his rival:

 It s prosecutorial in nature . . . You hear the Elliott side, but you don t ever hear the management or board side because they re the defence, and the defence doesn t talk 	. 	. 	. 	And then when you do strike back, you re fired.

Corporate America rides the Trump train abroad

Corporate America is getting ready to show its support for the Trump administration. When Donald Trump travels to Saudi Arabia this weekend, he will befollowedby some of the top chief executives in the US (and trailed by a deepening crisis thatthreatens his presidency). The goal? Announce a slew of contracts and investmentcommitments (old and new)that show he s making good on campaign promises (while also, perhaps, distracting from that crisis).

The FT has obtained some of the names of those who will be in Riyadh at the same time as Trump:Jamie DimonofJPMorgan,Michael CorbatofCitigroup,James GormanofMorgan Stanley,Andrew LiverisofDow Chemical,Steve SchwarzmanofBlackstoneandJohn Rice, vice-chairman ofGeneral Electric.

We don t have the full list of names. But the ones the FT has managed to find out about are all white men. We have plenty of ideas for how to address the lack of diversity, Mr President.If you need more names, just "mailto:Due.Diligence@ft.com".

One other business leader who will be in town at the weekend isSoftBank s Masayoshi Son. He will be there to sign the first close of the largest private equity investment vehicle created, a $90bn-plus fund for technology, which will include up to $45bn in funding from Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund.

Microsoft Extends Cloud-Computing Arms Race to Africa; Software giant to open data centers in Johannesburg and Cape Town

Microsoft Corp. plans to extend the cloud-computing arms race among technology giants into Africa by opening two big data centers there next year.

The data centers, which will serve customers of the software giant's Azure cloud-computing business, will be the first of their size built in Africa by one of the three major cloud-infrastructure providers Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, according to global maps the companies posts online." Microsoft plans to open the centers in Johannesburg and Cape Town.

Microsoft believes the African tech market is "a pretty ripe opportunity," said corporate vice president Julia White. Microsoft's cloud computing customers in the market include Standard Bank of South Africa and the South African State Information Technology Agency, she said.

Research firm International Data Corp. estimates that total cloud revenue in South Africa last year was just $243 million, but expects it to grow nearly 20% a year through 2021.

Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have been racing to open data centers around the globe. They have been willing to shoulder the costs for such centers, which can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, to keep pace with one another and create a barrier for would-be rivals to catch up. After the openings, Microsoft will have 40 major data centers globally.

Combined, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet "https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-high-stakes-arms-race-costly-data-centers-1491557408" in capital expenditures and capital leases, up 22% from 2015, according to company filings. Not every dollar of that is spent on data centers that deliver infrastructure as a service, but each company describes the cloud as a major investment area.

The new data centers should help Microsoft win over South African business customers who've wanted to move their computing operations to the cloud, but have been unwilling to have that service provided by data centers in Europe, said IDC analyst Jon Tullett. Cloud services can run more slowly when data has to travel such distances. Moreover, recent South African regulations require businesses to keep some customer data on servers in the country.

With the new data centers, Microsoft has taken those issues "off the table completely," said Mr. Tullett, who was briefed by Microsoft on the news. He expects cloud adoption in the country to climb as a result.

Norwest Venture Partners has named Scott Beechuk, a former Salesforce.com senior vice president, as a partner to invest in enterprise technology startups. 

Mr. Beechuk was SVP of product management for Salesforce's Service Cloud, where he had worked since 2011. 

Previously, Mr. Beechuk founded or worked in startups in areas such as e-commerce, security middleware and consumer-search technology. The common thread between these different businesses was a software-as-a-service model. 

Mr. Beechuk is particularly interested in how cloud, artificial intelligence and big data technologies are enabling a new set of startups to quickly build companies. 

"We're on the cusp of the next wave of innovation," Mr. Beechuk said. "That (technology) was once only available to the largest platform companies." 

Last year, Norwest raised $1.2 billion for its latest multi-stage fund to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160120ec1kamm0x"in consumer, enterprise and health care technology. The firm's investments include Opendoor, Jet, Casper, Skybox Imaging, LendingClub and MobileIron. 

Mr. Beechuk cited Norwest's ability to invest across different stages and sectors as a factor drawing him to the firm. "That formation stage is something that's very exciting to me and something I've been through in my career on multiple occasions." 

Mr. Beechuk also has an extensive music background and has composed and produced music for Oliver Stone, Disney and Interscope and toured internationally in Mexico, Russia and elsewhere. "It's a creative outlet that if you enable it really stimulates the other side of the brain in interesting ways," he said.

OPEC Tries To Beat 'Shorts'

OPEC is trying harder than ever to win over big investors, but the group is finding that falling oil prices are making that a tough sell.

Dozens of hedge-fund managers and oil traders attended a series of closed-door meetings in recent months with OPEC leaders -- the first of their kind, according to Ed Morse, Citigroup Inc.'s global head of commodities research, who helped organize some of the events.

Group officials made the case for how supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce the global glut. Instead, stockpiles have remained stubbornly high, oil prices are down close to 10% from their February peak, and some hedge-fund traders are reeling.

Pierre Andurand, a French hedge-fund manager with a history of double-digit-percentage returns, met with a Saudi official from OPEC just before the Nov. 30 decision to cut production, said people familiar with the meeting. On the heels of a series of bullish bets, his main fund at Andurand Capital is down about 16% this year through May 5, according to a person who had seen the performance numbers.

The oil group is now intentionally countering "shorts," funds that bet on falling oil prices, an OPEC official said. The official pointed to an announcement earlier this week that Russian and Saudi Arabian energy ministers would support another nine months of production cuts. It was a response to the recent fall in prices and designed to show how serious big producers are about cutting output.

"We are hitting back at the shorts," the official said. Oil rose 2.1% on Monday after the announcement.

Prices gave up some of those gains on Tuesday but turned higher Wednesday, rising 0.84% to $49.07 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that stockpiles continued to fall last week.

But many traders see any extension as OPEC's acknowledgment that the first round of cuts wasn't effective and further evidence that the group's influence on the market has become severely limited.

"In my view, it's the wrong response," Doug King, chief investment officer at RCMA Asset Management and manager of that firm's $200 million Merchant Commodity hedge fund, said of extending the current cuts. "We're not seeing what we needed to see," he said. "They need to cut harder, right now."

Mr. Morse of Citigroup said he arranged introductions between OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo and the more than 100 hedge-fund managers and other oil buyers who have met with Mr. Barkindo in Washington, D.C., New York and London since October.

The coordinated outreach was a new effort by the group to build bridges between its members and Wall Street, aiming to persuade investors that producers were serious about reining in supply, Mr. Barkindo said. After asking what OPEC planned to do to boost prices, fund managers came away impressed, Mr. Morse said, adding that some still text with the OPEC leader.

OPEC's cuts started in January. Oil prices jumped 8.7% in December as traders anticipated an easing supply glut. Bullish bets by money managers hit a record for the 10 years of data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission early this year.

Many analysts aligned with the upbeat mood, forecasting that crude prices would reach $60 a barrel or higher by the end of 2017.

U.S. oil inventories have declined since OPEC's output cuts, but they remain near historic highs. That is in part because U.S. production has increased by about 200,000 barrels a day during the past two months. If output continues to rise at that pace, U.S. producers could end the year producing 800,000 barrels a day more than at the end of last year. That would replace much of what OPEC has taken off the market, analysts say.

In recent weeks, hedge funds have cut their bullish position on oil prices to the lowest level since November as a gasoline glut raised worries that demand could falter.

Mr. Andurand told investors in an April 24 letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that oil prices "will reach new highs." But three weeks later, he had abandoned most of his bullish bets, said a person familiar with the matter.

Veteran oil trader Andrew Hall also bet heavily that OPEC's strategy would work. A fund managed by his Astenbeck Capital Management LLC, a Southport, Conn., hedge-fund firm, lost 17% this year through April, said a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Hall recently wrote to investors predicting that inventory excesses would be eliminated, said the person. Astenbeck and Mr. Hall didn't respond to a request for comment.

Oil has regained some momentum, rebounding from recent five-month lows on evidence that the amount of oil in U.S. storage tanks is falling.

"It's one thing to talk about cuts. It's another thing to see them," said Gary Ross, head of global oil at PIRA Energy, a forecasting and analytics unit of S&P Global Platts. He dismissed bearish traders doubting OPEC's influence. "Their idea is that OPEC is irrelevant, and that doesn't make sense," he said.

But funds betting against OPEC have done well. Switzerland-based GZC Investment Management, which oversees just under $200 million, is up nearly 10% this year, in part due to a bet on falling oil prices.

"Basically, their mistake is to think they can fix prices -- they cannot anymore," Vincent Elbhar, GZC's managing partner, said of OPEC.

Robots learn the risk business; FT BIG READ: DISRUPTION

Artificial intelligence could revolutionise the insurance industry, giving companies low-cost tools to analyse data. But it could also allow clients to calculate if they need protection in the first place. By Oliver Ralph

One of the most complex professions in the world is at risk of being replaced. By a selfie . Selling life insurance has traditionally involved an in-depth assessment of the customer by a qualified underwriter using a well-worn set of actuarial models. Not any longer.

Lapetus , a US start-up, believes a selfie can replace much of that. Customers email their finest self-portraits and the computers do the rest, scanning the picture and analysing thousands of different regions of the face.

They are looking not just for basic information such as gender but for clues about how quickly the person is ageing, their body mass index and whether they smoke. Armed with this and other information from customers , the computers come up with what Lapetus says is a far more accurate prediction of life expectancy than traditional methods can provide. And the whole process takes only a few minutes.

No wonder the insurance industry is worried about the advance of technology and the potential for artificial intelligence to revolutionise the way it works. Last week about 150 young insurance professionals attended a presentation in London entitled, "Our Industrial Revolution: What does it mean for us?".

They are not the only ones fretting about the future. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual get-together in Nebraska this month, Warren Buffett warned about the risk of disruption to insurance from AI, in the shape of driverless cars.

"We've been going backwards and forwards on AI for 15 to 20 years, but I believe we're at a tipping point because of the advancement of algorithms, storage in the cloud and computing power," says Nick Daffan, chief information officer at Verisk Analytics, a data analysis firm.

This provides opportunities for the industry to improve the way it works, but there are also dangers - and not just that industry specialists will be replaced by machines as algorithms become more powerful. In the long run, the bigger challenge is that machines could undermine the industry by giving customers better tools to decide whether insurance is even necessary.

Data analysis is nothing new in insurance, an industry built on the use of statistics to assess risk. But AI expands the amount of data that can be analysed and the way it can be used.

Tech-savvy insurance start-ups are already circling. They see an old-fashioned industry, bloated on fat profits made in the past and complacent about the scale of change required. Some are aiming to work with insurance companies to develop new techniques, but others want to disrupt the industry and grab a slice of the market.

At a recent ceremony in London's O2 arena, 11 insurance start-ups backed by an organisation called Startupbootcamp pitched their plans to potential investors and customers. Nine of them were basing their business plans on some form of AI or machine learning. They included Aerobotics , which is applying AI to aerial photos of farms to help provide crop insurance, and Emerge , which uses machine learning to help insurers improve efficiency.

"The start-ups are showing what is possible and what can be done," says Henrik Naujoks, a partner at Bain & Co, a management consultancy. "A lot of incumbent executives are looking at it - they don't really understand it but they want to get involved."

Investors are keen for a piece of the action. According to Accenture, AI was one of the most popular themes in insurance tech investment in 2016, capturing more than $500m of funds.

"The view that AI can have a near-term impact is starting to pick up," says John Cusano, global head of Accenture's insurance practice. "Insurance is still a very manual experience."

Starting with the basics

For now, the impact of AI in insurance has been minimal. "It is definitely a disruptive force, but you could count on the fingers of one hand the number of insurers who have implemented it at scale," says Nigel Walsh, a partner at Deloitte.

Insurers say that, at the moment, AI is a tool that helps them rather than a disruptive threat. Those using AI are focusing on upgrading their data-processing capabilities, or improving the way that they communicate with customers by using chatbots.

UK insurer Aviva is experimenting with AI. "At its most basic, we absolutely use robots and AI," says Andrew Brem, Aviva's chief digital officer. "In our administration teams, there are lots of repetitive tasks which until now were done by humans. Algorithms are typically 15 times more productive."

Claims handling is another area attracting interest. Insurers say that AI can improve claims processing and help to spot fraud. Japanese insurer Fukoku Mutual Life has started to use an AI system developed by IBM in its claims department, while McKinsey forecasts that between 2015 and 2025 some western European insurers will cut up to a quarter of their staff as automation takes hold.

Mr Brem at Aviva admits that the real excitement lies elsewhere.

"The interesting area is using data to predict risks better, for example using data to better predict medical risks. We look for relationships that traditional techniques would not necessarily pick up," he says.

This is where AI and big data are expected to shake insurance up: not in processing and customer service, but in core skills such as underwriting, where the insurers assess - and price - each customer's risk.

"Where we see machine learning changing the industry is in how the world models and understands risk," says Henry Burton, who runs Artelligen , a start-up aiming to bring AI into commercial insurance.

Computers, so the argument goes, will be much better than human underwriters at analysing the vast amount of new data created each day. "Without question, machine learning will replace statistical models. The amount of data we create is astonishing. Driverless cars create four terabytes a day of data. Statistical models cannot handle that amount of data," Mr Burton says.

Last year Admiral, a UK-based car insurer, experimented with using the language in Facebook posts to make predictions about driving behaviour. Excessive use of exclamation marks, for example, could suggest overconfidence.

Facebook got cold feet at the last minute and the project was pulled , but Admiral will not be the last insurer to look for predictive patterns in new and unexpected places. Armed with this vast array of data, experts say computers will be able to assess in far more detail how risky each customer is, and how much they should be charged.

"The promise of AI is quite exciting," says Deloitte's Mr Walsh. "In underwriting, you get to a situation where you could create unique policies for each person. It is a different business model if you assess risk person by person."

The trends are enough to make human underwriters nervous. Oxford university has published a study of which professions are most susceptible to automation. It examined 702 jobs, asking machine learning and robotics experts to analyse the tasks involved in each one. Insurance underwriting was very near the top of the list, with only four professions seen as more at risk (telemarketers took the top slot).

Underwriters may turn out to be more resilient than that study suggests. Christos Mitas, vice-president of model development at data analytics group RMS, says: "We have not reached the point where it is totally automated. We have not reached an unsupervised state where the algorithm works for itself - it still needs supervision."

"The human element will need to be there for the foreseeable future," he adds. "You need to train the algorithm - what data do you give it? What constraints do you give it? Transparency is important and we need to know why the algorithm behaves the way it does."

Brian Modesitt, a managing director at Two Sigma, the computer-driven investment manager, says: "In some markets insurance is more bespoke so artificial intelligence will be more of an enabler. Machines won't replace people everywhere. Some things are too complicated."

Regulation will also be a factor - insurers have to be able to explain the pricing of policies to their customers. "The computer says so" is not an acceptable answer, the regulators insist.

Bypassing the industry

That might provide comfort to worried insurers. At last week's young professionals event in London, there was a consensus that their jobs would change, rather than disappear entirely.

More concerning for them is the risk that customers take matters into their own hands. The question of whether machines or humans do the underwriting is irrelevant if the clients decide that they do not need their product at all.

And AI could lead to just that as companies develop their own tools to analyse risk.

"Where this will have an impact is on the amount of insurance that people buy and the type they buy," Mr Burton says. "We see this as an opportunity not just to enable insurance companies to build predictive and preventive risk models but to allow businesses to have them as well. If they can model the risk in that way, they can decide what to retain on their own balance sheets and what to transfer [to insurers]."

This is not science fiction. Driverless cars are one example of how the trend could make a huge difference to the industry. Carmakers, software providers and insurers will collect data from autonomous cars and use it to assess how risky those vehicles are and how much insurance will be needed. The important question is which organisation has the data and the ability to analyse it, and that will not necessarily be the insurers.

"All of a sudden I can have data about risk exposure for a set of cars which is more than any single insurer would have," says Mr Daffan at Verisk.

Autonomous, a stockbroker, predicts that driverless vehicles will be so successful at reducing accidents that motor insurance premiums in the UK will drop 63 per cent between 2015 and 2060 .

Autonomous cars are not the only example of where this could make a big difference to insurance buying. The internet of things, where everyday objects are connected to the web, means everybody will have access to more data about the sort of risks they face.

These range from householders monitoring the chance of a leaky pipe to companies analysing their IT networks. If they can better predict problems and fix them before they occur, they can reduce the amount of insurance they need.

Mr Mitas is sceptical about how far that will stretch. "I don't think we'll have algorithms sold to insurance buyers," he says. "You need people who understand the data and the algorithms. You need experts in model building. It's not just about having the data, it is also about knowing how to use it."

In any case, say industry participants, AI will not make risks disappear entirely and people will always want to protect themselves against the unexpected. The recent global WannaCry cyber attack , for example, could boost demand for cyber insurance.

"The bespoke risks in society will never go away as there is always innovation in the economy," says Trevor Maynard, head of innovation at Lloyd's. "Providing underwriters embrace the new technology they have a very strong future."

Using the data

AI set to generate ethical issues

The growing use of artificial intelligence does not just create technological challenges for insurers, it also creates moral questions.

Traditionally, insurance has been built on the concept of pooling: insurers put large groups of similar people together in a pool. In any given year, some will need a payout while others will not. As long as there is enough money in the pool, the system works.

AI and big data break that down though. "Insurance is like a bicycle," says Duncan Minty, a consultant on ethical issues in insurance. "Big data puts a rocket on that bicycle, and the risk is that it gets wobbly. The difficult thing is the extent to which there are unintended consequences."

By giving insurers more information about each person and their individual risks, AI and big data allow far more accurate pricing. Risky people pay higher premiums; safer people pay less. The need to pool broad groups of similar people disappears.

The problems arise where risks are not preventable or easily avoided, such as floods. Insurers have become much better at predicting which houses are likely to be flooded, and so charge the owners of those properties huge premiums. As home insurance became unaffordable for some people, the UK government created Flood Re , which forces homeowners across the country to subsidise insurance for people in flood-prone areas. Industry experts say the use of AI could change other types of cover in the same way as flood insurance.

More serious is the question of the use of genetic data in life and health insurance. Advanced analytics could allow insurers to price products based on each customer's genetic make-up. The result, say critics, is that some people will be priced out of the market because of their genes. For that reason, use of genetic data by insurers is banned in most countries.

However, those curbs might not last. "If customers can use their own genetic data then eventually insurers will have to be allowed to use it too," says Paul Sharma of consultants Alvarez & Marsal. "Otherwise they will be at a disadvantage."

Speed read

Pricing in change Core skills such as underwriting, where a customer's risk is assessed, are under threat

Evolving role Insurers will still need staff to explain how automated systems have priced their policies

Gear change Carmakers and software providers will also assess how much cover will be needed for driverless cars

Hedge Funds Turn Against OPEC After Oil Gains Slip Away; Traders tally up losses as cartel falls short in its effort to boost prices and reduce global glut

OPEC is trying harder than ever to win over big investors, but the group is finding that falling oil prices are making that a tough sell.

Dozens of hedge-fund managers and oil traders attended a series of closed-door meetings in recent months with OPEC leaders the first of their kind, according to Ed Morse, Citigroup Inc.'s global head of commodities research, who helped organize some of the events.

Group officials made the case for how supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce the global glut. Instead, stockpiles have remained stubbornly high, oil prices are down close to 10% from their February peak, and some prominent hedge-fund traders are reeling.

Pierre Andurand, a French hedge-fund manager with a history of double-digit-percentage returns, met with a Saudi official from OPEC just before the Nov. 30 decision to cut production, said people familiar with the meeting. On the heels of a series of bullish bets, his main fund at Andurand Capital is down about 16% this year through May 5, according to a person who had seen the performance numbers.

The oil group is now intentionally countering "shorts," funds that bet on falling oil prices, an OPEC official said. The official pointed to an announcement earlier this week that Russian and Saudi Arabian energy ministers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-russia-want-nine-month-extension-to-deal-on-oil-output-cuts-1494831099". It was a response to the recent fall in prices and designed to show how serious big producers are about cutting output.

"We are hitting back at the shorts," the official said. Oil rose 2.1% on Monday after the announcement.

Prices gave up some of those gains on Tuesday but edged higher again Wednesday, rising 0.84% to $49.07 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that stockpiles continued to fall last week.

But many traders see any extension as OPEC's acknowledgment that the first round of cuts wasn't "https://www.wsj.com/articles/extending-production-cuts-may-not-reduce-global-oil-stocks-says-iea-1494921603" and further evidence that the group's influence on the market has become severely limited.

"In my view, it's the wrong response," Doug King, chief investment officer at RCMA Asset Management and manager of that firm's $200 million Merchant Commodity hedge fund, said of extending the current cuts. "We're not seeing what we needed to see," he said. "They need to cut harder, right now."

Mr. Morse of Citigroup said he arranged introductions between OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo and the more than 100 hedge-fund managers and other oil buyers who have met with Mr. Barkindo in Washington, D.C., New York and London since October.

The coordinated outreach was a new effort by the group "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-warns-members-to-comply-with-oil-production-cuts-1490526133" and Wall Street, aiming to persuade investors that producers were serious about reining in supply, Mr. Barkindo said. After asking what OPEC planned to do to boost prices, fund managers came away impressed, Mr. Morse said, adding that some still text with the OPEC leader.

OPEC's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-russia-upbeat-about-securing-oil-output-deal-as-meeting-begins-1481362580". Oil prices jumped 8.7% in December as traders anticipated an easing supply glut. Bullish bets by money managers "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/10/10/bullish-investors-bet-opec-deal-will-raise-oil-prices/" of data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission early this year.

Many analysts aligned with the upbeat mood, forecasting that crude prices would reach $60 a barrel or higher by the end of 2017.

U.S. oil inventories have declined since OPEC's output cuts, but they remain near historic highs. That is in part because "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-oil-output-falls-further-in-april-1494500402" by about 200,000 barrels a day during the past two months. If output continues to rise at that pace, U.S. producers could end the year producing 800,000 barrels a day more than at the end of last year. That would replace much of what OPEC has taken off the market, analysts say.

In recent weeks, hedge funds have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-investors-cut-their-bets-on-higher-oil-prices-1494244233" to the lowest level since November as a gasoline glut raised worries that demand could falter.

Mr. Andurand informed investors in an April 24 letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that oil prices "will reach new highs." But three weeks later, he had abandoned most of his bullish bets, said a person familiar with the matter.

Veteran oil trader Andrew Hall also bet heavily that OPEC's strategy would work. A fund managed by his Astenbeck Capital Management LLC, a Southport, Conn., hedge-fund firm, lost 17% this year through April, said a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Hall is one of a few still preaching patience. He recently wrote to investors predicting that inventory excesses would be eliminated, said the person familiar with the matter.

Astenbeck and Mr. Hall didn't respond to a request for comment. It isn't clear if he or anyone at his fund attended meetings with OPEC.

Oil has regained some momentum, rebounding from recent five-month lows on evidence that the amount of oil in U.S. storage tanks is falling. Oil prices gained more than 3% after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported the biggest stockpile decline of the year last week.

"It's one thing to talk about cuts. It's another thing to see them," said Gary Ross, head of global oil at PIRA Energy, a forecasting and analytics unit of S&P Global Platts. He dismissed bearish traders doubting OPEC's influence. "Their idea is that OPEC is irrelevant, and that doesn't make sense," he said.

But funds betting against OPEC have done well. Switzerland-based GZC Investment Management, which oversees just under $200 million, is up nearly 10% this year, in part due to a bet on falling oil prices.

"Basically, their mistake is to think they can fix prices they cannot anymore," Vincent Elbhar, GZC's managing partner, said of OPEC.

Wells Fargo's Post-Scandal Marketing Playbook; CMO Jamie Moldafsky on how the bank is using data to change its advertising message following the sales-practices scandal

When Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Marketing Officer Jamie Moldafsky launched a recent new ad campaign for the bank following its sales-practices scandal, it was a mix of art and science.

Wells Fargo was already investing in how to better understand its customers and potential customers, but it stepped up the work in September, after the San Francisco bank paid a $185 million settlement for opening up as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. It has since faced two congressional grillings, a slew of management changes, large clawbacks of executive compensation, and a spate of investigations.

The bank intensified its efforts to use polls and focus groups to gauge sentiment about the brand among consumers, information it has used to help guide its marketing.

Ms. Moldafsky recently spoke with The Wall Street Journal about what the bank has been doing to repair its brand, dive deep into data to get a better sense of what its customers want and experiment with new marketing channels.

Here are edited excerpts of that conversation.

A better overview

WSJ: Last September was a busy month, not just with the sales-practices scandal but also with backlash from an earlier advertisement promoting the bank's "teen financial education day" program suggesting teens should choose careers in science over artistic fields. A number of well-known artists voiced objections over Twitter.

MS. MOLDAFSKY: The world of social media has fundamentally changed the way all of us do our jobs.

We do exhaustive research, more than we've ever done literally daily, weekly, monthly around understanding our customers, our prospects and the environment and how people feel about us, and which messages are resonating. But that can change in a minute if somebody tweets something with a different perspective or point of view that nobody had contemplated. That world is accelerating. It isn't a lack of control; the control has shifted to the marketplace.

Our first lesson learned on that was that things are going to happen in the market that can take off in a way that is unexpected or bad. You have to get much better at reading into all the different possibilities.

We did centralize marketing; that was completed in October. That's enabled us to have a much more holistic view of all our messaging, all our communications, and of our customers.

WSJ: After the settlement, the bank began its "Commitment" campaign in digital, print and television in efforts to explain actions it had taken following the sales scandal and to repair its brand.

MS. MOLDAFSKY: Clearly people were getting the message that we made mistakes and had done things wrong, but they hadn't heard the message that we felt badly about it. We're apologizing. We are committed to making it right.

WSJ: The bank halted its usual ad campaigns to focus on its apology and what it was changing. How does that impact customer relationships or new account openings?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: We knew there really isn't business as usual when you're in this sort of position. There's definitely data and insight behind that, but it's also intuition. You want to be careful not to hurt the brand. The right thing to do here may be to understand that we might have slightly lower results for a little bit but that we are actually building the brand back for longer-term viability and strength.

Focus on analytics

WSJ: How are you making use of data?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: Starting with September onward, we do daily polling. You see trends both on an immediate basis but also over time. And we've used that to understand things like favorability and people's perceptions of Wells Fargo as well as to actually test new creative content and new messages. We can actually get pretty discrete on different segmentations [of the population to see how] different segments sometimes view things very differently.

WSJ: Where are you getting your data from?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: Qualitative [research]. Polling is often online panels that we commission. And then we have focus-group research that we do. We do very specific advertising testing and messaging testing.

This campaign, for example, we went through multiple rounds of different concept testing to see which messages resonate, which messages are different, which messages make people feel positive, which messages make people feel negative. It provided a lot of direction for us.

WSJ: How are you using data and analytics?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: Best examples, if you're looking for a house on Zillow, Wells Fargo serving you a checking account may not be relevant, but serving you a preapproved mortgage may be.

WSJ: How else are you using artificial intelligence?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: Most people who close their bank accounts, as an example, don't really just close their bank accounts. They just over time use them less, they open one somewhere else. We're using artificial intelligence to look at all those underlying dynamics, how the behavior people have indicates that they may be someone who wants to deepen their relationship with Wells Fargo or is potentially someone who wants to lessen their relationship. You can then communicate differently. It's a way to use that data on more of a predictive basis.

New platforms

WSJ: How do you think about a new marketing platform?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: One of the tenets, especially with social media, is to test and learn. When you're an established brand that's been there for 165 years, that comes with a lot of really strong positives, but it also comes with guardrails of what you can or cannot do.

WSJ: Like what?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: Virtual reality is a great example. Our agency and some third parties came to us. We thought about the best first use around sponsorships like Major League Soccer. We actually had, set in the old West, a stagecoach virtual-reality [station set up at soccer games] that was relevant to the brand and appropriate to the brand and didn't seem like some strange stretch.

WSJ: What else are you working on?

MS. MOLDAFSKY: The area of financial health, how you serve that up to make it appetizing. And certainly the connected home. For example, today what [the Nest smart thermostat] will tell you is you can save money if you lower your temperature. But if you could automatically have the savings that were generated from turning your thermostat down 5 degrees a day generated into your children's college fund, wouldn't that be cool?

China Approves

Bond-Connect Plan

China's central bank approved a so-called bond-connect program between the mainland and Hong Kong, according to a statement on its website.

The program would first open a northbound channel for foreign investors to buy Chinese debt, the People's Bank of China said. There will be no limit on northbound investment, it said.

The central bank said it would go ahead with the southbound channel, which will allow onshore investors to tap bond markets in Hong Kong, at an appropriate time.

The PBOC didn't provide a date for the launch of the program.

Asset Manager Will

Sell Debt Software

AllianceBernstein Holding LP agreed to sell its bond-trading software platform to trading technology firm Algomi Ltd., the companies said Monday.

Financial terms weren't disclosed, though AllianceBernstein will receive a minority stake and a seat on the board at Algomi, which is privately held.

The platform -- Automated Liquidity Filtering & Analytics, or ALFA -- monitors electronic trading venues and alerts users when there is activity on the bonds they are looking to buy or sell. AllianceBernstein's top credit-trading executives, Jim Switzer and Tim Morbelli, developed the system with a goal of making the money manager a more efficient bond trader. AllianceBernstein executives said they figured other asset managers would pay to use the platform, but likely only if it weren't owned by a competitor.

PRIVATE EQUITY

KKR Weighs Sale

Of Stake in Visma

KKR & Co. is eyeing the sale of its 31% equity holding in Visma Group, a Norwegian software company, in a deal that could fetch about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), according to people familiar with the matter.

Visma offers web-based services that allow businesses and governments to manage their payrolls, accounting, invoicing and other administrative needs. In 2016, the company increased earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a commonly used profit measure, by 27% to 1.91 billion Norwegian kroner ($225.1 million) on revenue growth of 21%. That strength resulted from acquisitions and the increasing use of cloud-based software by businesses to cut costs.

KKR owns Visma together with private-equity firms HgCapital and Cinven, each of which owns 31%. Management controls the rest.

REGULATION

Court Backs ECB

As Bank Supervisor

A European Union court rejected a German bank's attempt to escape direct supervision by the European Central Bank, a decision that further cements the central bank's role as bank overseer in the currency bloc.

German development bank Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg filed a lawsuit challenging ECB supervision in March 2015.

According to a news release, the General Court of the European Union said Tuesday that supervision by the ECB could be avoided only "if there are specific factual circumstances entailing that direct prudential supervision by the national authorities is better able to attain the objectives and safeguard the principles of the relevant rules."

L-Bank's chief executive officer, Axel Nawrath, said in a statement that the bank was surprised by the verdict. The ECB had no comment.

Artificial intelligence could revolutionise the industry but may also allow clients to calculate if they need protection

One of the most complex professions in the world is at risk of being replaced. By a selfie.

Selling life insurance has traditionally involved an in-depth assessment of the customer by a qualified underwriter using a well-worn set of actuarial models. Not any longer. Lapetus, a US-based start-up, believes a selfie can replace much of that. Customers email their finest self-portraits and the computers do the rest, scanning the picture and analysing thousands of different regions of the face.

They are looking not just for basic information such as gender but for clues about how quickly the person is ageing, their body mass index and whether they smoke. Armed with this and other information from customers, the computers come up with what Lapetus says is a far more accurate prediction of life expectancy than traditional methods can provide. And the whole process takes only a few minutes.

No wonder the insurance industry is worried about the advance of technology and the potential for artificial intelligence to revolutionise the way it works. Last week about 150 young insurance professionals attended a presentation in London entitled,  Our Industrial Revolution: What does it mean for us? .

They are not the only ones fretting about the future. At Berkshire Hathaway s annual get-together in Nebraska this month, Warren Buffett warned about the risk of disruption to insurance from AI, in the shape of driverless cars.

 We ve been going backwards and forwards on AI for 15 to 20 years, but I believe we re at a tipping point because of the advancement of algorithms, storage in the cloud and computing power,  says Nick Daffan, chief information officer at Verisk Analytics, a data analysis firm.

This provides opportunities for the industry to improve the way it works, but there are also dangers   and not just that industry specialists will be replaced by machines as algorithms become more powerful. In the long run, the bigger challenge is that machines could undermine the industry by giving customers better tools to decide whether insurance is even necessary.

Data analysis is nothing new in insurance, an industry built on the use of statistics to assess risk. But AI expands the amount of data that can be analysed and the way it can be used.

Tech-savvy insurance start-ups are already circling. They see an old-fashioned industry, bloated on fat profits made in the past and complacent about the scale of change required. Some are aiming to work with insurance companies to develop new techniques, but others want to disrupt the industry and grab a slice of the market.

At a recent ceremony in London s O2 arena, 11 insurance start-ups backed by an organisation called Startupbootcamp pitched their plans to potential investors and customers. Nine of them were basing their business plans on some form of AI or machine learning. They included Aerobotics, which is applying AI to aerial photos of farms to help provide crop insurance, and Emerge, which uses machine learning to help insurers improve efficiency.

       

Four areas AI could change:

1. Life insurance

Lapetus promises to use facial recognition technology to discover how healthy you are using a selfie. Another potential avenue for the industry is using social media profiles to predict lifestyle habits and risks. But there is controversy over whether genetic data will eventually be used in pricing life and health insurance.

       

 The start-ups are showing what is possible and what can be done,  says Henrik Naujoks, a partner at Bain & Co, a management consultancy.  A lot of incumbent executives are looking at it   they don t really understand it but they want to get involved. 

Investors are keen for a piece of the action. According to Accenture, AI was one of the most popular themes in insurance tech investment in 2016, capturing more than $500m of funds.

 The view that AI can have a near-term impact is starting to pick up,  says John Cusano, global head of Accenture s insurance practice.  Insurance is still a very manual experience. 

***

For now, the impact of AI in insurance has been minimal.  It is definitely a disruptive force, but you could count on the fingers of one hand the number of insurers who have implemented it at scale,  says Nigel Walsh, a partner at Deloitte.

Insurers say that, at the moment, AI is a tool that helps them rather than a disruptive threat. Those using AI are focusing on upgrading their data-processing capabilities, or improving the way that they communicate with customers by using chatbots.

UK insurer Aviva is experimenting with AI.  At its most basic, we absolutely use robots and AI,  says Andrew Brem, Aviva s chief digital officer.  In our administration teams, there are lots of repetitive tasks which until now were done by humans. Algorithms are typically 15 times more productive. 

Claims handling is another area attracting interest. Insurers say that AI can improve claims processing and help to spot fraud. Japanese insurer Fukoku Mutual Life has started to use an AI system developed by IBM in its claims department, while McKinsey forecasts that between 2015 and 2025 some western European insurers will cut up to a quarter of their staff as automation takes hold.

       

2. Agricultural insurance

Use of drone technology is revolutionising crop insurance. The start-up Aerobotics says it can map terrain in 3D and check plant health from the air. Use of big data in combination with mapping technologies can also be used to look at issues such as flood risk.

       

Mr Brem at Aviva admits that the real excitement lies elsewhere.  The interesting area is using data to predict risks better, for example using data to better predict medical risks. We look for relationships that traditional techniques would not necessarily pick up,  he says.

This is where AI and big data are expected to shake insurance up: not

in processing and customer service, but in core skills such as underwriting, where the insurers assess   and price   each customer s risk.

 Where we see machine learning changing the industry is in how the world models and understands risk,  says Henry Burton, who runs Artelligen, a start-up aiming to bring AI into commercial insurance.

Computers, so the argument goes, will be much better than human underwriters at analysing the vast amount of new data created each day.  Without question, machine learning will replace statistical models. The amount of data we create is astonishing. Driverless cars create four terabytes a day of data. Statistical models cannot handle that amount of data,  Mr Burton says.

Last year Admiral, a UK-based car insurer, experimented with using the language in Facebook posts to make predictions about driving behaviour. Excessive use of exclamation marks, for example, could suggest overconfidence.

Facebook got cold feet at the last minute and the project was pulled, but Admiral will not be the last insurer to look for predictive patterns in new and unexpected places. Armed with this vast array of data, experts say computers will be able to assess in far more detail how risky each customer is, and how much they should be charged.

The trends are enough to make human underwriters nervous. Oxford university has published a study of which professions are most susceptible to automation. It examined 702 jobs, asking machine learning and robotics experts to analyse the tasks involved in each one. Insurance underwriting was very near the top of the list, with only four professions seen as more at risk (telemarketers took the top slot).

Underwriters may turn out to be more resilient than that study suggests. Christos Mitas, vice-president of model development at data analytics group RMS, says:  We have not reached the point where it is totally automated. We have not reached an unsupervised state where the algorithm works for itself   it still needs supervision. 

       

3. Motor insurance

Driverless cars could revolutionise the sector by removing human error and thus cutting accidents. Meanwhile big data and telematics are helping to spot fraudulent claims. Plans to analyse social media to work out who is more prone to risky behaviour have been rejected so far

       

 The human element will need to be there for the foreseeable future,  he adds.  You need to train the algorithm   what data do you give it? What constraints do you give it? Transparency is important and we need to know why the algorithm behaves the way it does. 

Brian Modesitt, a managing director at Two Sigma, the computer-driven investment manager, says:  In some markets insurance is more bespoke so artificial intelligence will be more of an enabler. Machines won t replace people everywhere. Some things are too complicated. 

Regulation will also be a factor   insurers have to be able to explain the pricing of policies to their customers.  The computer says so  is not an acceptable answer, the regulators insist.

***

That might provide comfort to worried insurers. At last week s young professionals event in London, there was a consensus that their jobs would change, rather than disappear entirely.

More concerning for them is the risk that customers take matters into their own hands. The question of whether machines or humans do the underwriting is irrelevant if the clients decide that they do not need their product at all.

And AI could lead to just that as companies develop their own tools to analyse risk.  Where this will have an impact is on the amount of insurance that people buy and the type they buy,  Mr Burton says.  We see this as an opportunity not just to enable insurance companies to build predictive and preventive risk models but to allow businesses to have them as well. If they can model the risk in that way, they can decide what to retain on their own balance sheets and what to transfer [to insurers]. 

       

4: The overall industry

The use of algorithms and big data sets is cutting the number of people the insurance industry needs to employ. Chatbots are being used to take customers through applications. Data analysis and AI can spot fraud patterns quickly

       

 The promise of AI is quite exciting,  says Deloitte s Mr Walsh.  In underwriting, you get to a situation where you could create unique policies for each person. It is a different business model if you assess risk person by person. 

This is not science fiction. Driverless cars are one example of how the trend could make a huge difference to the industry. Carmakers, software providers and insurers will collect data from autonomous cars and use it to assess how risky those vehicles are and how much insurance will be needed. The important question is which organisation has the data and the ability to analyse it, and that will not necessarily be the insurers.

 All of a sudden I can have data about risk exposure for a set of cars which is more than any single insurer would have,  says Mr Daffan at Verisk.

Autonomous, a stockbroker, predicts that driverless vehicles will be so successful at reducing accidents that motor insurance premiums in the UK will drop 63 per cent between 2015 and 2060.

Autonomous cars are not the only example of where this could make a big difference to insurance buying. The internet of things, where everyday objects are connected to the web, means everybody will have access to more data about the sort of risks they face. These range from householders monitoring the chance of a leaky pipe to companies analysing their IT networks. If they can better predict problems and fix them before they occur, they can reduce the amount of insurance they need.

Mr Mitas is sceptical about how far that will stretch.  I don t think we ll have algorithms sold to insurance buyers,  he says.  You need people who understand the data and the algorithms. You need experts in model building. It s not just about having the data, it is also about knowing how to use it. 

In any case, say industry participants, AI will not make risks disappear entirely and people will always want to protect themselves against the unexpected. The recent global WannaCry cyber attack, for example, could boost demand for cyber insurance.

 The bespoke risks in society will never go away as there is always innovation in the economy,  says Trevor Maynard, head of innovation at Lloyd s.  Providing underwriters embrace the new technology they have a very strong future.

Moody's Corp, the US credit rating agency, has agreed its largest ever acquisition with a  3bn deal to buy Bureau van Dijk, a Dutch provider of business information, from Swedish private equity firm EQT.

Moody's aims to expand Bureau van Dijk's data platform into Asia and the US. Bureau van Dijk is best known for providing data for investment research, tax risk, transfer pricing and third-party due diligence of financial institutions, corporations, professional services groups and government authorities.

For Moody's, which provides analytical services mainly to the financial services industry, the acquisition will also bolster efforts to diversify. More than two-thirds of Bureau van Dijk customers operate in non-financial sectors.

The US ratings group will fund the transaction by using cash held outside the US, as well as new debt financing. Moody's expects to close the deal in the third quarter of 2017. EQT acquired Bureau van Dijk from Charterhouse Capital Partners in 2014.

"This acquisition provides significant opportunities for Moody's Analytics to offer complementary products, create new risk solutions and extend its reach to new and evolving market segments," said Raymond McDaniel , chief executive of Moody's.

Bureau van Dijk will continue to operate from its Amsterdam headquarters. The senior management of Bureau van Dijk, which last year generated revenue of $281m, will run the company as a division of Moody's.

The group has built one of the world's largest business databases, which includes information on more than 220m private companies. It uses this database to aggregate, standardise and distribute corporate information to clients across the world.

Moody's, which generated annual revenue of $3.6bn in 2016, said it expected the acquisition to add to its earnings per share from 2019. Cost savings from synergies are expected to reach $45m by 2019 and $80m by 2021.

FT REPORT - REINVENTING BRAZIL
Technology start-ups lure capital back after recession

Funding Investors are focusing on fintech and are keen to back innovators, says Vinod Sreeharsha

despite the recession and political turbulence, Brazil's technology start-up scene is still attracting attention from investors. Yet there was a marked slowdown in overall new amounts pledged in 2016.

Nonetheless, Brazil's technology-savvy citizens have an obvious appeal to start-ups and their backers. Brazil ranks third globally in the number of Facebook users , behind the US and India. It is fourth in number of internet users and is one of Google's most important markets for products such as Android.

Research from the Latin American Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (Lavca) shows a 37 per cent decline year on year in the overall amount invested by venture capital firms, from $442m invested in 2015 to $279m in 2016. The number of deals also declined, from 101 in 2015 to 64 in 2016.

The reluctance among some VC backers is understandable. Investors bet heavily on consumer-focused internet companies during Brazil's most recent economic boom from 2010 to 2013, pouring money into companies that were often replicating business models from the US and Europe.

However, observers say many of those companies failed, with few ever reaching profitability and, to date, exits that would provide VC firms with returns have been virtually non-existent. "The first vintage [of investment] was poorly invested, mostly in ecommerce, and you're seeing the result of that now," says Edson Rigonatti, a founding partner at Astella Investimentos, a VC investment firm.

Since that period though, investors have made adjustments and there has been a new crop of start-ups. Fintech is growing in importance and bucked the recent downward trend in overall VC investment, according to Lavca.

In 2016 the fintech sector attracted $113m in venture capital in 14 deals, more than 10 per cent higher than the $102m pledged in 2015 in nine deals.

"I was not sure if we'd ever see it, but we're beginning to see companies export their business model to Europe, the US, and Latin America for the first time," says Kevin Efrusy, a partner with Accel, the US venture capital company, who has been investing in Brazil for over seven years.

Neoway, the Florianopolis-based big data start-up, is among the businesses drawing the interest of global financial companies as potential customers. It is even looking to make acquisitions this year, possibly in the US, its founders have said.

The new crop of investors will also be hoping to find the next Nubank, a digital credit card company, or GuiaBolso, a personal finance platform. Both are based in So Paulo and were founded before the recession.

Both are growing fast and have been successful in attracting new rounds of investment. Nubank's early investors included Sequoia Capital, the US VC firm. GuiaBolso backers included Brazilian VC company e. Bricks Digital.

Meanwhile, more money looks to be on its way for local start-ups. VC providers that primarily back early stage internet companies are currently raising new funds.

They include So Paulo-based Redpoint eventures and DGF Investimentos. DGF is raising an early stage fund for technology companies. Kaszek Ventures, which has offices in Buenos Aires and So Paulo, is also securing commitments for its third fund.

"Some [venture capital firms] have pulled back but we've seen a number of new firms that are starting to look at Brazil opportunistically because they feel the worst is over," says Andy Tsao, a managing director at Silicon Valley Bank, who specialises in emerging market innovation companies.

Pierre Schurmann, co-founder of Bossa Nova, an early stage investor, also sees signs of a recovery. In March, Bossa Nova raised a R$100m ($31m) fund to make pre-seed investments in Brazilian internet start-ups. It has invested in 146 companies to date, he says.

"The quality of the entrepreneurs is improving a lot, compared to five to six years ago," says Eric Acher, a founding partner of Monashees, a So Paulo-based VC company.

Accel's Mr Efrusy says it is the slightly more mature companies that had received funding in the past that impressed him most on a recent visit to Brazil: "I felt like there were seven or eight companies that could be public companies almost anywhere, in the US, on Nasdaq, within three years."

Goldman flexes its lending muscles

Banks with large balance sheets and a penchant for lending cash to companies chasing deals have a new competitor in town: Goldman Sachs.

The USinvestment bank   led byLloyd Blankfein (above) andbest known for its advisory work on M&A and equity deals  is making a big push into risky-loan sales (as well as investment grade lending) as it seeks to diversify its revenuestream.

Goldman is now the fifth-largest leverage lender in America, according to Dealogic. Back in 2009, it ranked 14th. So far this year, the group has lent nearly $40bn to 168 companies  that s $3bn more than all of 2015. In investment grade lending rankings, Goldman has also jumped into fifth place from 10th last year.

The latest example of Goldman s newlending muscle came on Monday as it agreed to commit $5.2bn in debt financing to help Thermo Fisherpurchase Dutch drugmaker Patheon NVat an enterprise value of$7.2bn. The "http://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-and-events/news-releases/news-release-details/2017/Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-to-Acquire-Patheon-a-Leading-Contract-Development-and-Manufacturing-Organization-CDMO/default.aspx"noted debt financing would comefrom Goldman Sachs Bank USAandGoldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC.

The bankalso provided M&A advice to Thermo Fisher.

Historically, Goldman has preferred its status as"the sellside" adviser of choiceon M&A deals, creating a loyal base of clients after helping themfend off unwanted bidders or negotiating hefty premiums.

The shift for Goldman comes as revenues in the advisory business have been growing at a slower pace and as boutique investment banks continue to take an ever bigger bite out of the deal advisory pie.

Just last week, the bank announcedthat it was promoting Marc Nachmann,head of itsglobal financing group, who will become one of its three investment banking co-heads. Nachmann, a German national, is relocating from New York to London   perhaps a sign that the bank is looking to be more aggressive in lending on deals in Europe.

Abertis/Atlantia: toll task ahead?

It wasthe worst-kept secret in continental European M&A for the past month. But finally on Monday, we learnt the details of a planned  16.3bn takeover of Spanish toll road operator Abertis by its larger Italian rival Atlantia.

Crucially, the all-cash offer includes a partial share alternative designed to attract Criteria, the Barcelona-based holding of the powerful Caixa foundation, which owns a 22.3 per cent stake.

This structure, which can account for up to 23.2 per cent of the Atlantia bid,has many similarities to the one offered by brewer AB InBev to win over major minority shareholders in rival SABMiller two years ago.

As we wrote in our coverage:

Anyone taking up the share-swap offer would not be able to sell their stake until February 2019   a condition that may only appeal to a long-term strategic investor like Criteria   and would have the right to appoint up to three directors to Atlantia s board, which will be enlarged by the same amount to 18.

Criteria was coy in response to the bid, saying it would take its time in evaluatingthe friendly offer   but sources tell DDthere is no reason to think the foundation willnotsupport a deal that has been months in the making.

That said, a jump in Atlantia s share price means that the share alternative is worth close to 1 more than the cash offer. Recall how that caused trouble for AB InBev as it was in the late stages of finalising its SABMiller takeover last year.

Lex, meanwhile,says Abertis investors of all stripes should hold out for more.

Aussie Rules diplomacy?

Chinese investors are trying to win over Australia with football.

Gui Guojie, a Chinese property mogul who has invested heavily in Australia, sponsored the first-everAustralian Football League matchplayed outside of Australiaor New Zealand,on Sunday in Shanghai.

The event was a not so subtle soft-power play meant to ease negative sentiment on Chinese investment in Australia, and has been likened to so-called ping pong diplomacy. Li Ka-shing s Cheung Kong Infrastructure (CKI) gained Australian regulatory approval last month to buy power company Duet for $5.6bn. But that deal comes just months after CKI and Chinese power utility State Grid Corp were blocked from buying a 50.4 per cent stake in Ausgrid for $7.6bn.

 We are aware there is a reticence to Chinese investment right now,  says Andrew Hunter, Port Adelaide Football Club general manager for China.  We think that is something that will come and go. Sport is a great way of overcoming suspicion. 

Gui s investments in the Antipodesincludea partnership with mining magnate Gina Rinehart on a A$365m investment into the country s largest private landholding.Outbound Chinese investment in 2017 has slowed dramatically compared withlast year. However, investments into Australia have remained strong. Chinese companies have announced deals worth $3.48bn in Australia so far this year, compared with$3.53bn for the whole of 2016.

Finance & Markets: AIG Picks A Veteran Of Firm To Lead It

American International Group Inc. on Monday named Brian Duperreault -- a onetime lieutenant to former CEO Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg -- as the firm's new chief executive.

Mr. Duperreault, 70 years old, is the founder and chief executive officer of Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd. Mr. Duperreault spent just over two decades at AIG before leaving to run three other companies. His resume includes a widely praised turnaround of consulting and insurance-brokerage firm Marsh & McLennan Cos.

News of Mr. Duperreault's planned hiring was first reported Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.

Separately, AIG said Monday that it had agreed to acquire Hamilton's U.S. platform for an estimated price of $110 million, a move seen as deepening AIG's push into big data and analytics. AIG and Hamilton also announced a reinsurance partnership, and AIG agreed to pay Hamilton $20 million for the firm releasing Mr. Duperreault from covenants that could have restricted his hiring.

The past six months have been particularly tumultuous for AIG. Just a few weeks after the firm posted disappointing fourth-quarter results, CEO Peter Hancock in March said he would resign after less than three years at the helm. Many board members were unhappy about setbacks in the company's plan for boosting profitability, while several also feared a potential fight with AIG shareholder and activist investor Carl Icahn.

Mr. Hancock agreed to stay until a successor was found.

AIG executives are carrying out a two-year strategic plan unveiled in January 2016 -- in response to pressure from Mr. Icahn. Many goals are on track to be achieved, such as cutting costs and returning $25 billion to investors through dividends and share buybacks, analysts have said.

AIG board members don't expect their new leader to change the strategic direction at the insurer, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Duperreault left AIG in 1994 to run ACE Ltd., a then-Bermuda-based specialty insurer with large corporate clients.

Mr. Duperreault expanded the niche company into a diversified insurer with the 1999 acquisition of Cigna Corp.'s U.S. and international property-casualty operations. The company since has acquired Chubb and is known as Chubb Ltd.

Mr. Duperreault retired from ACE in 2004 but then was recruited in 2008 to become CEO of Marsh & McLennan.

He left Marsh in 2012, and in 2013, back in Bermuda, he established Hamilton with principals of the hedge fund Two Sigma Investments. Last year, Hamilton teamed up with AIG and Two Sigma on a joint venture to sell insurance online to small businesses, using advanced data analytics. Monday, the three firms announced an expansion of that partnership.

AIG also unveiled a plan to negotiate a contract with Two Sigma for "a next generation insurance platform for AIG's use," with the ultimate cost estimated to be about $250 million over five years. AIG already is using algorithms to issue policies to midsize and some large policyholders. That move will deepen the role in the insurance industry of Two Sigma, one of the more successful hedge funds using computers to trawl data in the investment process.

Mr. Bookman, a former law clerk who has served as an anticorruption adviser in Afghanistan, has built startup OpenGov Inc. around that mission.

Silicon Valley-based OpenGov is part of a movement of "govtech" companies like Socrata Inc., Viderum and GovDelivery aiming to empower bureaucracies to unlock vast sets of data and share analytics with the public. Improve transparency, these groups say, and you can improve government effectiveness and civic innovation at the same time.

Thanks in no small part to a new surge in citizen activism over the past year, startups in this so-called open data movement have ridden a wave of interest in government transparency and renewed civic engagement.

In the latest sign of investor interest, OpenGov said Tuesday it has raised $30 million in venture funding led by the Emerson Collective, the social impact fund founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of the late Steve Jobs.

The Series C round marks the first time OpenGov, co-founded by 8VC partner Joe Lonsdale, has gone outside traditional venture capital to back its mission.

"They're obviously iconic names in Silicon Valley, and there's a lot of mission alignment about our potential to create opportunity in our country and to do that through improving the effectiveness and accountability of all the nation's governments," Mr. Bookman said.

Emerson Collective supports tech initiatives in media, education and social-justice meant to strengthen the foundations of democratic society.

Ms. Jobs said OpenGov is "empowering citizens to drive positive impact in communities across the country."

Mr. Bookman says more than 1,500 government and other public-sector customers across the U.S. are using OpenGov's web-based software to tap into outdated data repositories for budget planning, financial analytics and sharing their data sets with the general public.

With the latest funding, OpenGov has raised more than $75 million to date from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, 8VC, and Thrive Capital since its founding in 2012. Its chief rival, Seattle-based Socrata, has raised more than $55 million from investors like OpenView Venture Partners.

OpenGov, based in Redwood City, Calif., declined to put a figure on its revenue growth, but Mr. Bookman says it had a record first quarter, not normally known as a hot season for new contracts.

He called this a "Trump bump" that reflects public officials "trust building" in response to increased public demand to see government to function more openly and effectively.

"When a community can increase its level of trust, that's when you can execute," he said. "That's when you can get things done."

Recent new customers include West Virginia, the state of Ohio, San Antonio, and Boston, which used the software to launch a public-facing portal that shares data on everything from fire-hydrant maintenance to mapping rooftops for possible solar energy projects.

Mr. Bookman said governments report they're able to cut costs by 20% because citizens can ask and answer their own questions using the platform. Using outdated technology, bureaucrats would spend hours, sometimes days, responding to public requests for information. Now, according to Mr. Bookman, that can be done "in five clicks" of a button.

"It's becoming a standard," he said. "You can't run a government in 2017 without a strategy, without really making investments to build trust in your community."

Correction: OpenGov Inc. has raised $30 million in the Series C round. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was $25 million. (May 16, 2017)

Finance & Markets: Goldman Sachs Shifts Investment-Bank Unit

The common knock on investment bankers is that they will ardently pitch a CEO on a merger one year only to return the next to say the company should break itself into pieces.

So it might amuse some corporate executives who have been taken through that cycle byGoldman Sachs Groupto learn the bank is doing the same thing in a corner of its own business.

Goldman is splitting its investment bankers who focus on health care and consumer and retail companies into two groups with separate leaders, according to an internal memo sent to employees last week. The two areas were loosely united within the investment bank in the early 2000s, later separated, then recombined in 2014.

The latest split reflects something that is true for both investment bankers and companies they advise: Different markets call for different footprints.

In the early 2010s, for example, Goldman saw opportunity with drug companies that also had big consumer and household-products businesses, such asJohnson & JohnsonandPfizer.

When Goldman Sachs merged its health-care and consumer groups in 2014, executives said the move would allow its bankers to "be deployed more widely across a broader client base" amid a "growing convergence between subsectors."

Today, though, regulation and big data are reshaping health care. And a new crop of tech-savvy, disruptive consumer companies such as food-delivery service Blue Apron and Peloton, the maker of web-connected spin bikes, look less like hulking pharmaceutical companies.

So Goldman will cover them separately.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. andBank of AmericaCorp. already do so.

Bankers who advise drugmakers and medical-device companies will report to Marshall Smith, who led the health-care group solo before the 2014 combination, according to the memo, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Those who focus on consumer-facing companies will report to Rob Sweeney, a banker to food, apparel and lifestyle firms.

The move was largely lost in the shuffle ofa broader reorganization of Goldman's investment-banking division last week.

But as traditionally defined sectors become less cohesive and recognizable, many expect more changes to how Wall Street sells its services to companies.

AIG s new CEO Brian Duperreault has committed to keeping the insurance conglomerate intact and signalled he would seek to expand the group after years of shrinkage in the wake of its government rescue during the financial crisis.

Speaking shortly after AIG confirmed his appointment on Monday, the70 year-old said he would focus on technology and data analysis as part of an effort to revive the insurer.  I didn t come here to break the company up,  he said.  I came here to grow it. 

The industry veteran won early support from AIG shareholder "https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Carl_Icahn", even thought the activist has previously called for the group to separate its property & casualty business from its life insurance operation. Mr Icahn said on Twitter he was  very pleased .

To convince Mr Duperreault to become its seventh CEO in 12 years, the insurer pledged $52m in payouts to him and Hamilton, the insurance company he set up. AIG also agreed to buy Hamilton s US platform for about $110m.

The new CEO will receive a one-off $12m cash payment, an annual base salary of $1.6m, a short-term annual incentive target award of $3.2m and an annual long-term incentives of $11.2m. He is also receiving options to buy 1.5m of AIG common stock.

Hamilton will receive $40m to secure Mr Duperreault s release.

Mr Duperreault said it was great to be back  at the company, where he worked for two decades. A protg of Hank Greenberg, who led AIG for nearly 40 years ending in 2005, Mr Duperreault went on to run industry stalwarts Ace and Marsh.

He replaces "https://www.ft.com/stream/peopleId/NjBiMjUwZGItY2YwMy00NmQyLWEwYzEtZmIwNDZjZmIwZWY2-UE4=", who struggled to restore AIG s fortunes after its near-collapse during the financial crisis and tussled with Mr Icahn over its direction.

Mr Hancock resisted Mr Icahn s call for an outright break-up, but led a retreat from such areas as mortgage insurance and made extensive cost cuts in an effort to improve returns. He also committed to returning $25bn in capital to shareholders.

Signalling a shift in emphasis, Mr Duperreault said on Monday thatcapital would  also be deployed to grow  AIG and said the insurer would consider making acquisitions. Meyer Shields, analyst at KBW, said the comments pointed to a possible slowdown in AIG s share buy-back plans.

Setting out plans to  put AIG at the forefront of the industry  with technology-led initiatives, Mr Duperreault said innovations such as data analytics were  transforming  insurance.

AIG also announced on Monday a wide-ranging tie up with Two Sigma, an investment managerthat specialises in data analysis and backed Hamilton. At a cost of about $250m, the partnership is to develop what AIG described as a  next-generation insurance platform .

AIG shares were up 0.9 per cent to $61.56 at lunchtime in New York.

Brazil s technology start-ups lure capital back after recession

Despite the recession and political turbulence, Brazil s technology start-up scene is still attracting attention from investors. Yet there was a marked slowdown in overall new amounts pledged in 2016.

Nonetheless, Brazil s technology-savvy citizens have an obvious appeal to start-ups and their backers. Brazil ranks third globally in the number of "https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/", behind the US and India. It is fourth in number of "http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm" and is one of Google s most important markets for products such as Android.

Research from the Latin American Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (Lavca) shows a 37 per cent decline year on year in the overall amount invested by venture capital firms, from $442m invested in 2015 to $279m in 2016. The number of deals also declined, from 101 in 2015 to 64 in 2016.

The reluctance among some VC backers is understandable. Investors bet heavily on consumer-focused internet companies during Brazil s most recent economic boom from 2010 to 2013, pouring money into companies that were often replicating business models from the US and Europe.

However, observers say many of those companies failed, with few ever reaching profitability and, to date, exits that would provide VC firms with returns have been virtually non-existent.  The first vintage [of investment] was poorly invested, mostly in ecommerce, and you re seeing the result of that now,  says Edson Rigonatti, a founding partner at Astella Investimentos, a VC investment firm.

Since that period though, investors have made adjustments and there has been a new crop of start-ups. Fintech is growing in importance and bucked the recent downward trend in overall VC investment, according to Lavca.

In 2016 the fintech sector attracted $113m in venture capital in 14 deals, more than 10 per cent higher than the $102m pledged in 2015 in nine deals.

 I was not sure if we d ever see it, but we re beginning to see companies export their business model to Europe, the US, and Latin America for the first time,  says Kevin Efrusy, a partner with Accel, the US venture capital company, who has been investing in Brazil for over seven years.

Neoway, the Florianopolis-based big data start-up, is among the businesses drawing the interest of global financial companies as potential customers. It is even looking to make acquisitions this year, possibly in the US, its founders have said.

The new crop of investors will also be hoping to find the next Nubank, a digital credit card company, or GuiaBolso, a personal finance platform. Both are based in So Paulo and were founded before the recession.

Both are growing fast and have been successful in attracting new rounds of investment. "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nubank#/entity" included Sequoia Capital, the US VC firm. "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/guiabolso#/entity" included Brazilian VC company e.Bricks Digital.

Meanwhile, more money looks to be on its way for local start-ups. VC providers that primarily back early stage internet companies are currently raising new funds.

They include So Paulo-based Redpoint eventures and DGF Investimentos. DGF is raising an early stage fund for technology companies. Kaszek Ventures, which has offices in Buenos Aires and So Paulo, is also securing commitments for its third fund.

 Some [venture capital firms] have pulled back but we ve seen a number of new firms that are starting to look at Brazil opportunistically because they feel the worst is over,  says Andy Tsao, a managing director at Silicon Valley Bank, who specialises in emerging market innovation companies.

Pierre Schurmann, co-founder of Bossa Nova, an early stage investor, also sees signs of a recovery. In March, Bossa Nova raised a R$100m ($31m) fund to make pre-seed investments in Brazilian internet start-ups. It has invested in 146 companies to date, he says.

 The quality of the entrepreneurs is improving a lot, compared to five to six years ago,  says Eric Acher, a founding partner of Monashees, a So Paulo-based VC company.

Accel s Mr Efrusy says it is the slightly more mature companies that had received funding in the past that impressed him most on a recent visit to Brazil:  I felt like there were seven or eight companies that could be public companies almost anywhere, in the US, on Nasdaq, within three years.

Moody s Corp, the US credit rating agency, has agreed its largest ever acquisition with a  3bn deal to buy Bureau van Dijk, a Dutch provider of business information, from Swedish private equity firm EQT.

Moody s will expand Amsterdam-based Bureau van Dijk s data platform in Asia and the US to drive revenues using its existing operations.

For the credit rating agency, which provides analytical services predominantly to clients in the financial services industry, the acquisition will bolster efforts to diversify its business, as 70 per cent of Bureau van Dijk customers are non-financial entities.

Moody s will fund the transaction by using some off-shore cash and new debt financing expects to close the deal in the third quarter of 2017.

 This acquisition provides significant opportunities for Moody s Analytics to offer complementary products, create new risk solutions and extend its reach to new and evolving market segments,  said Raymond McDaniel, president and chief executive of Moody s.

EQT bought Bureau van Dijk in 2014 from Charterhouse Capital Partners in a deal that was rumoured to value the business at around  1bn.

Bureau van Dijk will continue to be operate from its Amsterdam headquarters. The company has built one of the world s largest business databases that includes information on more than 220m private companies.

Evernote founder launches AI 'studio' to back entrepreneurs; Technology

A new "studio" approach to backing entrepreneurs working in artificial intelligence has been launched in San Francisco, in the latest attempt to tap engineers targeting one of the hottest new areas of technology.

The venture, run by Phil Libin , co-founder and former chief executive officer of mobile app Evernote, is also aiming to set up operations in Tokyo and Paris before the end of the year.

The idea is based on how Hollywood studios work, providing support and distribution to entrepreneurs in AI so that they only have to focus on creating a product rather than starting a new company for each project.

Mr Libin described the venture, called All Turtles, as a way to break out of the narrow, overheated bubble that has built up in San Francisco and nearby Silicon Valley during the latest technology boom. Local venture capitalists who pump money into tech start-ups typically aim to "scale" them rapidly to capture big new markets. That approach is geared towards creating a handful of big winners and misses many other valuable ideas, said Mr Libin.

"You're not allowed to work on something unless it could be a $10bn company," he said of the current way of working. "It's really stupid. Obviously there are a lot of products that could be worth a couple of hundred million."

The launch of All Turtles faces fierce competition from established tech accelerators and incubators that also try to catch promising business ideas at the earliest stage.

The studio will also have to find a new way to inspire budding entrepreneurs, many of whom look to earlier tech role models who have built valuable companies - including Mr Libin, a Russian-born programmer who helped to make Evernote one of the first start-ups of the mobile era to become a "unicorn" - a private company worth at least $1bn.

The focus on AI reflected a belief the technology had moved beyond the research stage and was ready to reshape the way people interact with computers, said Mr Libin. All Turtles is starting with 10 AI projects in San Francisco, some of which have already been in development long enough to become companies themselves. They include Replika, whose AI "companion" has caught on in particular with teenagers and young women, and Growbot, which works to boost appreciation for workers' efforts.

All Turtles' San Francisco outpost has been backed by General Catalyst, a venture capital firm where Mr Libin has until recently been an investor.

AllianceBernstein Is Selling Bond-Trading Software; Terms of deal with Algomi Ltd. not disclosed but AllianceBernstein will get minority stake in private trading tech firm

AllianceBernstein Holding LP agreed to sell its bond-trading software platform to trading technology firm Algomi Ltd., the companies said Monday.

Financial terms weren't disclosed, though AllianceBernstein will receive a minority stake in privately held Algomi and a seat on its board.

An AllianceBernstein spokesman said the agreement had nothing to do with the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-kraus-ousted-as-alliancebernsteins-ceo-1493641780" of Peter Kraus, the firm's chief executive, and eight other directors. France's AXA SA, which engineered the shake-up, owns a majority of the U.S. investment firm.

The platform Automated Liquidity Filtering & Analytics, or ALFA monitors electronic trading venues and alerts users when there is activity on the bonds they're looking to buy or sell. AllianceBernstein's top credit-trading executives, Jim Switzer and Tim Morbelli, developed the system with a goal of making the money manager a more efficient bond trader.

AllianceBernstein started using ALFA in 2015, and executives have said it helped lower trading costs. It tracks venues that trade government and corporate bonds, as well as mortgage- and asset-backed securities.

AllianceBernstein executives said they figured other asset managers would pay to use the platform but likely only if it weren't owned by a competitor. Last year, the firm began to look for an outside partner.

The firm's discussions with Algomi began last fall, according to Stu Taylor, Algomi's chief executive.

T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Brown Brothers Harriman and BlueBay Asset Management agreed to use the ALFA platform following its sale to Algomi, the companies said.

Algomi was founded in 2012 and has more than 250 clients. Algomi's trading tools include Honeycomb, which helps money managers find buyers or sellers of bonds through a web of information aggregated from banks and other dealers.

Puerto Rico Debt Dings Fund Titans

The losses from soured investments in Puerto Rico bonds are coming into focus for some of the world's biggest mutual funds, and it is a brutal reckoning.

The total red ink for mutual funds that invested in debt issued by the troubled island commonwealth is as much as $5.4 billion over the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of mutual-fund holdings and municipal-bond trades.

Those losses, which are both actual and on paper, were tucked inside a wide range of funds managed by Franklin Resources Inc., OppenheimerFunds Inc., Vanguard Group, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Western Asset Management Co., Lord, Abbett & Co., AllianceBernstein Holding LP and Dreyfus Corp., which is part of BNY Mellon Investment Management.

The damage done to mutual-fund bets is one reason why a court-supervised restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt that starts this week with a hearing in San Juan is expected to become such a lengthy battle. A diverse group of creditors will be competing for a limited pot of money, and allocating Puerto Rico's resources will be complex because of the competing interests at stake.

Many mutual-fund firms have greater incentive to agitate for maximum recovery -- and have greater potential for losses -- because they purchased debt closer to par values. Mutual funds as a group still hold about $14.6 billion of Puerto Rico's $73 billion in outstanding bonds after selling off more than $9 billion over the past five years,according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

Franklin and Oppenheimer hold most of the mutual-fund debt, according to Morningstar. Oppenheimer's paper and actual losses are as much as $2.1 billion, and Franklin's are as much as $1.6 billion, according to the Journal's analysis. Franklin has $741 billion in assets under management, while Oppenheimer has $230 billion.

"We are considering all appropriate legal remedies to protect and preserve the rights of our fund shareholders," said Oppenheimer spokeswoman Kimberly Weinrick in a recent statement.

Another six fund families -- -- managed by Vanguard, Goldman, Western Asset, Lord Abbett, AllianceBernstein Holding and Dreyfus -- sustained actual and paper losses of up to between $100 million and $200 million on their Puerto Rico holdings, according to the Journal's analysis.

The losses are relatively small for those firms, all of which have at least $100 billion apiece in municipal-bond assets under management. "It's a tiny portion of the muni assets that we hold and has little impact on our returns," said Freddy Martino, a spokesman for Vanguard.

"We have lost money but the portfolio is very well diversified so overall shareholders have had very attractive returns over that time," said Dan Solender, director of tax-free fixed income for Lord Abbett.

Guy Davidson, director of municipal investments at AllianceBernstein Holding, said he is relieved the firm sold off most of its Puerto Rico debt in 2014. "No matter how you cut it, Puerto Rico's been a bad investment for most investors," he said.

For mutual funds, Puerto Rico's debt has long had a special appeal because the bonds are tax-exempt nationwide. Most municipal bonds are exempt from state taxes only in the state they are issued. The commonwealth's ballooning debt load appealed to state-specific mutual funds in places where local government bonds were scarce or expensive.

About 45% of the Puerto Rico debt mutual funds currently hold is in funds designated by Morningstar as single-state funds.

When Puerto Rico last tapped the bond market in March 2014, offering 8% interest, underwriters were flooded with orders from hedge funds and mutual funds for the junk-rated debt. Twenty mutual-fund families bought a combined $263 million that quarter, according to Morningstar data.

Most funds that stocked up on the island's debt before prices began to slide have fallen behind their benchmarks, according to the Journal's analysis. That includes 13 of 15 funds that had at least 15% of their assets in uninsured Puerto Rico bonds in the first quarter of 2013. Most of these are single-state funds spanning the U.S., from New York to Arizona. Two of those lagging funds closed in 2013 and 2016.

How much mutual funds and other creditors in Puerto Rico get back will depend in large part on which securities they own. For example, general-obligation bonds carry some of the commonwealth's strongest legal pledges, and holders of those bonds may fare better than many other investors.

Detroit paid an average of 81 cents on the dollar on its bonds in bankruptcy, while Stockton, Calif., and San Bernardino, Calif., paid an average of 60 cents, according to research firm Municipal Market Analytics. Many Puerto Rico bondholders are likely to suffer steeper losses, said Matt Fabian, a partner at the firm.

Bondholder recoveries are expected to be significantly lower than the total dollar value of the bonds' current market pricesunless the federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico allocates more than it has so far, according to analysts, mutual-fund managers and the commonwealth's former adviser.

In March, the board approved spending $800 million a year to pay debt over the next decade, about one-quarter of what is owed.

"The math is pretty straightforward," said Jim Millstein, adviser to the commonwealth for three years until the new governor took office in January.

---

How the Journal

Added Up Damage

The losses for mutual funds that invested in debt issued by Puerto Rico are as much as $5.4 billion over the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of mutual-fund holdings and municipal-bond trades.

The Journal's total estimate is an aggregate of realized and unrealized mutual-fund losses over the past five years. That includes any drop in the market value of bonds held during the period, which the Journal calculated using the market values funds reported to Morningstar Inc. each quarter.

To calculate gains or losses when funds sold or bought bonds during the period, the Journal used Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board trading data to determine the lowest price at which bonds could have been bought and the highest price at which they could have been sold.

The Journal limited its analysis to bonds that don't carry insurance and bonds backed by insurer Financial Guaranty Insurance Co., whose ability to pay claims is limited by a state-mandated rehabilitation plan.

The analysis also excluded capital appreciation bonds, which rise in value naturally over time, making comparisons difficult.

Mutual Funds Lose Big on Puerto Rico

The losses for Puerto Rico's bondholders are coming into view. It is a brutal accounting.

The total red ink for mutual funds that invested in debt issued by the troubled island commonwealth is as much as $5.4 billion over the last five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of mutual-fund holdings and municipal-bond trades.

Those losses, which are both actual and unrealized, accumulated largely because the weighted average price of mutual funds' uninsured Puerto Rico holdings has dropped to 59 cents, compared with 105 cents on the dollar in early 2012, the Journal found.

The damage done to mutual-fund bets is one reason why a court-supervised restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt that starts this week with a hearing in San Juan is expected to become such a lengthy battle. A diverse group of creditors will be competing for a limited pot of money, and allocating Puerto Rico's resources will be complex because of the competing interests at stake.

Mutual funds as a group still hold about $14.6 billion of Puerto Rico's $73 billion in outstanding bonds after selling more than $9 billion over the past five years, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

Two companies, Franklin Resources Inc. and Oppenheimer Funds Inc., hold most of the mutual-fund debt, according to Morningstar. Oppenheimer's paper and actual lossesare as much as $2.1 billion and Franklin's are as much as $1.6 billion, according to the Journal's analysis. Franklin has $741 billion in assets under management, while Oppenheimer has $230 billion.

"We are considering all appropriate legal remedies to protect and preserve the rights of our fund shareholders," said Oppenheimer spokeswoman Kimberly Weinrick in a recent statement to the media.

Many funds that had less than 15% of their assets invested in Puerto Rico debt in early 2013 also unperformed their benchmarks during the same period.

How much mutual funds and other creditors in Puerto Rico get back will depend in large part on which securities they own. For example, general obligation bonds carry some of the commonwealth's strongest legal pledges and holders of those bonds may fare better than many other investors.

Detroit paid an average of 81 cents on the dollar on its bonds in bankruptcy while Stockton, Calif., and San Bernardino, Calif., paid an average of 60 cents, according to research firm Municipal Market Analytics. Many Puerto Rico bondholders are likely to suffer steeper losses, said Matt Fabian, a partner at the firm.

Bondholder recoveries are expected to be significantly lower than the total dollar value of the bonds' current market pricesunless the federal control board overseeing Puerto Rico allocates more than it has so far, according to analysts, mutual-fund managers and the commonwealth's former adviser.

In March, the board approved spending $800 million a year to pay debt over the next decade, about a fourth of what is owed.

"The math is pretty straightforward," said Jim Millstein, adviser to the commonwealth for three years until the new governor took office in January.

Crypto currency offerings spur speculation frenzy

Most organisations have their share of IT workers who slip under the radar. But what is that quiet tech guy really up to when he should be fixing the server?

He might be pursuing a new career, speculating in crypto currencies. In virtual terms at least, he could soon be earning 20 times his annual salary as he joins the latest online investing craze that has shades of dotcom exuberance.

Using digital money loaned on an online exchange, IT staff at mainly financial services companies are betting on  alt-coins  during working hours.

An investment of just a few thousand dollars a month ago in a newly fashionable currency called Muse is now worth close to $500,000. Last week alone the price rose 278 per cent. At the current trajectory, the IT guy will be a dollar-millionaire by Thursday.

Except these are not real-world dollars. This is virtual money, one of the many variants on bitcoin   the original crypto currency that has been around for more than eight years. But there is a speculative frenzy for a new line of investment in the crypto market through initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Aping the real-world process of floating a company on a stock market, this crypto version involves a group publishing a business plan   commonly known as a white paper   and then promoting the sale to speculators through internet forums. The ICOs raise money in existing crypto currencies, mostly bitcoin and another popular token called Ether.

Many of the more than 830 so-called alt-coins now on the market are bitcoin copies in their own right, others are simply contracts that sit embedded in other cryptocurrency protocols such as Ethereum   a platform that mimics bitcoin s blockchain technology but adds a smart contract feature.

The bitcoin copies are mineable   which means the number of coins in circulation expands   whereas the contracts tend to be non-mineable, with a capped number of coins in circulation.

 The ICO appeals to people who have a lot less competence to evaluate what they re investing in,  said Jorge Stolfi, a computer science professor at the State University of Campinas in Brazil, who made a prominent case to the Securities Exchange Commission about the dangers of bitcoin last year.

The first example of this was the Ethereum platform itself, which launched in 2014 with Ether tokens. It initially raised $18m at $0.40 per token: the tokens are now valued at $92 apiece.

While close to $400m was raised through ICOs last year   and $1.2bn in total   in recent weeks there has been an explosion of new issues. These include Zrcoin, which claims to base its value on cubic zirconia, and Voise, a  decentralised music platform .

The total market capitalisation of all alt-coins burst through $50bn last week. Bitcoin itself has almost doubled in price since March, but some alt-coins have jumped four or fivefold in the past week alone.

 The applicable crowd psychology textbook here is Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,  said David Gerard, author of an upcoming analysis of the industry called Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain.

Whether the faceless IT guy cited above will ever manage to turn his Muse into real-world cash is now a burning question.

In recent weeks crypto traders have been hit by a sudden inability to withdraw dollars after a crackdown by numerous banks previously used to access the real-world payments system. Technical limitations associated with the bitcoin platform have also slowed trade settlements, making the crypto currency unusable for day-to-day transactions.

 It s a real concern, and we ve started to use Ether to move money around a lot more now as it will actually be there when you need it,  said one specialist OTC crypto-currency trader.

The delays have had the most impact on bitcoin s primary use   servicing the dark markets often used by drug dealers. One of them, AlphaBay, recently announced it was accepting Ether.

Locked in the market and stuck with no immediate use for their alt-coins and tokens, many speculators have been happy to chase the ICO fad. This month TokenCard, a company claiming to have a blockchain development called New Alchemy, was able to boast of raising $16m in three minutes.

The prospect of regulatory intervention is not concerning all investors. Many insist they are dealing in a utility, not buying an interest in a company, and so should remain out of regulatory reach.

 It s very hard to say if they should be regulated or not. It really depends on the nature of the rights and features of the particular token or coin. Or the grants to the holder,  said David Shearer, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright. While some token sales grant rights similar to holding equity in a company, others offer less rights.

An ICO for an artificial-intelligence-powered investment fund called Beth promises holders the right to receive 60 per cent of the venture s quarterly profits while reinvesting a further 25 per cent in its portfolio.

The phenomenon is reminiscent of the early days of the still-unregulated eurobond markets, which mushroomed in size in the 1960s and 1970s and became an important source of alternative dollar funding for corporations frozen out because of stricter money controls.

In the style of penny stocks, for every successful token issued there are many more that fail. With ICOs, uncertainty over exactly what it is you are buying adds to the risk.

 People are willing to spend on something, but they own nothing. It s a promise from a development team which may or may not be useful to people in the market  said Arthur Hayes, a trader for crypto-currency derivative exchange BitMex.  I think it s interesting that people can raise $10m in minutes based on a dream.

COMPANIES - WEEK IN REVIEW
Insurance veteran who retired twice prepares for AIG hot seat; Corporate person in the news: Brian Duperreault, Prospective AIG chief

For somebody who has already retired twice, Brian Duperreault is showing no sign of a taste for the easy life. The insurance veteran is next week likely to be appointed chief executive of AIG, one of the toughest jobs in the industry.

To succeed, he will need to draw on every one of his 40-plus years of experience to help a struggling company that has still not fully recovered from the financial crisis after being bailed out by the US government, say industry insiders.

The company was also involved in a protracted tussle with activist investors before the departure of Peter Hancock , who had been chief executive since 2014 and announced he was stepping down in March.

The writing had been on the wall for Mr Hancock after Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, called for him to go and welcomed his exit on Twitter six minutes after the company disclosed his planned departure.

In to this tricky environment steps Mr Duperreault, who is no stranger to AIG and no stranger to turnrounds.

"He's a really good guy - exactly the right person for the job," says Mike McGavick, chief executive of XL Catlin, who has known Mr Duperreault for decades. "The whole of the first stage of his career was building AIG, so it would be a good capstone for him to turn it round at the end." He started his career at AIG, spending 20 years working his way up the ranks under Hank Greenberg , the company's driving force. "Not everyone could handle his style," he said of Mr Greenberg in an interview with the Financial Times last year, "but for those who could, it was a tremendous experience."

His next posting was at ACE, where he made a name for himself by turning a small catastrophe insurance specialist into a major global insurer via acquisitions. With that done he retired for the first time (in 2004), handing over to Hank Greenberg's son, Evan , another former AIG-er.

Then came the turnround experience. Insurance broker Marsh was in trouble in 2008 when Mr Duperreault arrived, still recovering from a scandal involving commission payments. He pulled in new people, returned it to growth, and retired again in 2012. Sort of. Since 2013 he has been running Hamilton, a Bermuda-based insurer he founded. The emphasis has been on advanced data analytics, and Hamilton has teamed up with Two Sigma, an investment manager, and AIG to develop small business insurance. But that does not appear to have been enough to keep Mr Duperreault, now 70, occupied.

Mr Duperreault, a devout catholic, faces challenges at AIG. Top of the list, say people who know the company, is pulling in some new faces after an exodus of mid-level staff. He also needs to improve morale. Succession planning will also be on the agenda.

More importantly, say people in the industry, he needs to work out exactly what AIG will do next. Will it try to regain its status as the world's number one property and casualty insurance company, or will it become more specialist, focusing only on those areas where it can make money?

Either way, he will need all of his charm to convince staff, investors and customers that the company is on the right track. "He's incredibly personable, and capable of adjusting to people," says Nicolas Aubert of broker Willis Towers Watson. Others who know him say that, beneath the charm, he can be ruthless. "He is tougher than people give him credit for," says one.

The return to AIG will pull him away from his Bermuda home, where he has become a major figure in the business world. But the call of the turnround challenge, and of AIG, has been too strong for him to resist. "He loves insurance, and he's a risk taker," says Mr McGavick. Oliver Ralph

$5 Billion for Didi

SoftBank Group Corp. is pledging to invest $5 billion in Didi Chuxing, China's leading ride-hailing firm.

The investment would come during the Japanese company's current business year, according to an earnings filing.

SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son hopes to launch a $100 billion technology fund soon, is considering investments in such areas as autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and biotechnology. The fund's investors include Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Development Co., Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.

SoftBank on Friday also said it would lead a $502 million funding round for London-based startup Improbable, whose virtual-reality technology allows it to simulate real-world conditions, such as traffic flow.

ODEBRECHT

Construction Group

Names New CEO

Troubled Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA named company veteran Luciano Guidolin as its new chief executive officer.

He succeeds Newton de Souza, who had been at the helm since 2015, when the company was rocked by Brazil's biggest-ever corruption scandal.

The appointment of Mr. Guidolin, who has been vice president of investments at Odebrecht, is "another step in Odebrecht's transformation process," the company said Friday.

Mr. de Souza, who will become the vice chairman of Odebrecht, stepped in following the arrest of former CEO Marcelo Odebrecht in 2015. Mr. Odebrecht was convicted and sentenced to 19 years in prison for his role in the corruption scheme at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras.

ELI LILLY

Migraine Drug

Shows Promise

Eli Lilly & Co. said it would seek regulatory approval of a migraine drug this year after seeing positive results from late-stage studies, raising hopes for a new class of treatments for the debilitating headaches.

The drug, galcanezumab, met its primary endpoint in three Phase 3 studies, showing significant reductions in the number of monthly migraine headache days compared with placebo at both studied doses, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker said Friday.

Lilly plans to submit a biologics license application to the Food and Drug Administration in the latter half of this year.

Lilly is one of several companies testing a new class of drugs that target a chemical known by its initials, CGRP. Researchers have found that CGRP, which stands for calcitonin gene-related peptide, is involved in the brain's pain-signaling during migraines.

FORD MOTOR

CEO Makes His Case

To Wall Street

Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields, under pressure from the board to sharpen the company's strategy, met Friday with Wall Street analysts who have expressed increasing frustration with its stock-price performance.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said he left a meeting believing the company is aiming to improve its communication with investors to demonstrate resilience in its core automotive business and outline the payoffs for investments in future technology.

"We believe positive messaging developments lie ahead," Mr. Spak said in a note to investors.

The Wall Street meetings were confirmed by a Ford spokesman. The auto maker held its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.

Mr. Fields told investors on an earnings call in April that Ford needed to do a better job quantifying the revenue and growth potential of the new technologies it is investing in as part of a broader plan to diversify beyond its core auto business.

Mr. Spak said one option would be breaking out those investments separately from Ford's other automotive businesses, a move that will help the market better "grade" their progress and performance.

He said this could reflect a strategy employed by Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company.

Farmers need insurance that is fit for purpose

Would an antiques dealer ship a precious item around the world without insurance against damage or loss? And would a construction firm lay the foundations for a house without a proper flood analysis?

Assessing and safeguarding investment against risk is part of business, and farming is no different. As climate-related losses mount, the world s farmers deserve insurance products that meet their needs.

So far, this has proven elusive and the insurance sector has yet to find a profitable way to open up this highly variable and fragmented market.

There have been promising developments linking insurance to weather-related triggers such as rainfall, making it easier and simpler to assess when environmental factors have undermined agricultural production.

But while agricultural insurance "http://www.theactuary.com/features/2015/03/new-frontiers-in-agriculture/"since 2005 with an estimated global premium of $31bn in 2014, uptake of index-based insurance can be "https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-lessons/agriculture/protecting-farmers-weather-based-risk".

And yet, with two billion smallholders bearing the brunt of the "http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6486e.pdf" of climate-related disasters between 2004-2014, it is a market ripe for picking.

Farmers need affordable, reliable insurance that accurately assesses the losses they endure because of rising temperatures, excessive or insufficient rainfall, or extreme weather.

The insurance industry can develop products that are more precise, cost-effective and therefore viable by working with big data companies, which specialise in satellite imagery to give the most transparent picture of climatic conditions. By doing so, insurers can reduce basis risk and offer tailor-made services.

By using the most accurate indices to assess climate-related loss, insurers can offer the most comprehensive and competitive coverage, and farmers can be assured of their guaranteed levels of protection. A successful product will then foster trust and generate growth in the market.

It is also possible to reduce the cost of the premiums to make it more attractive to smallholder farmers and thus increase uptake. By bundling insurance together with other critical services that farmers are in a position to pay for, insurers can streamline costs. They may also offer insurance against weather risks to other institutions, such as banks and government agencies, which are also more resilient than individual farmers. This further reduces the basis risk as well as opening up new lines of credit.

Finally, like any potential audience, farmers must be won over. Low uptake levels can often be traced back to low awareness levels, and so with proper marketing, training and education by insurers in partnership with farmers  organisations and the development sector, smallholders can be convinced of the benefits of protecting their livelihoods. In addition, insurance has to be affordable, and there is a good case for investing public resources towards this cause, rather than having to deal with disasters at a very high cost.

The Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU) is actively promoting the uptake of weather-based insurance by farmers, and views insurance not only as a cost, but also as a necessary investment that ideally all farmers should be making. For example, SACAU is currently working with an insurance company to help it expand its innovative weather-based insurance solution which it successfully piloted in Zimbabwe into the rest of the southern African region. A regional approach is the way to go in order to spread and thus reduce premiums, making them more affordable to farmers. Furthermore, delivery of insurance via cell phones enables targeted and timely service on a very wide scale, reducing delivery costs and ultimately premiums.

This is no easy task and the rewards will not be immediate. A smallholder farmer is a private investor in his or her own right, and profit matters to them, just as it does to other investors. By finding affordable ways to protect smallholders, insurance companies can add value to the agricultural supply chain, allowing producers the reassurance needed to invest properly in sustainable intensification. A vicious cycle of low income, low investment and low productivity can be broken to become a self-sustaining and successful business, which benefits the entire planet. With the anticipated greater involvement of a new generation of farmers who will be young, ICT-enabled and business oriented, a steep increase in the uptake of insurance is expected.

We look forward to hearing how farmers, the private and public sector can work together to achieve this during the climate talks in Bonn this week. And we call on the insurance industry to take up the challenge.

Ishmael Sunga is chief executive of the Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU).

TOKYO Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. is pledging to invest $5 billion in China's leading ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, seeking to position itself in a key technology growth area. 

The investment would come during the current business year, according to an earnings filing on Wednesday, and local media reports on Friday. 

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that SoftBank "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-talks-to-chinas-uber-rival-didi-about-6-billion-investment-1490689527", formally known as Xiaoju Kuaizhi Inc.

The fund whose investors include Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Development Co., Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. will likely invest in companies such as shared-office-space firm WeWork Cos. and satellite operator Intelsat SA, SoftBank says. 

Car-hailing apps are likely to continue to be early adopters of self-driving capabilities, and the investment in Didi, which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403" with Uber Technologies Inc.'s China operations last year, is part of SoftBank's concerted push into the car industry.

Taiwan Index Soars

To a 17-Year High

Taiwan's main stock index finished at a 17-year high Thursday and closed above 10000 points, as continued iPhone-related hopes bolster the trade hub's growth prospects.

The Taiex stock index ended up 0.3% at 10001.48 and has gained 8.1% this year. It has risen steadily for the past year after bottoming out just below 8000 last May. Strong global demand for consumer electronics and technology products has been fueling gains, Commerzbank said recently.

Taiwan's exports have risen for seven consecutive months from a year earlier, including April's 9.4% growth amid an 11% increase in electronics components. While the Taiex has moved above 10000 during intraday trading recently, it always fell back before the close. The last time it closed above 10000 points was in 2000, just before the U.S. tech-stock bubble burst. Tech makes up roughly half of the Taiex.

Taiwan has been a hot destination for foreign equity investors in emerging markets, partly because of its reliance on Apple Inc. Many of the company's iPhone suppliers are based on the island, and the 10th anniversary edition due out this year has been eagerly awaited. Apple shares have been reaching a series of records, and many Taiwan stocks have followed. Camera-lens-module maker Largan Precision Co. has jumped 31% this year and casing supplier Catcher Technology Co. is up 44%.

WELLS FARGO

Further $2 Billion

Added to Cost Cuts

Wells Fargo & Co. plans to cut an additional $2 billion in expenses by the end of 2019, more than analysts had expected.

The expense savings, announced at Wells Fargo's investor day, come on top of the bank's January announcement to cut $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018.

Wells Fargo, which has been under pressure since its sales-practices scandal last fall, said the cuts would bolster its bottom line. The bank said it plans to consolidate "similar operational activities" and automate more of its manual processes.

As part of its focus on costs, Wells Fargo said it plans to close about 450 branches in 2017 and 2018. The bank said the closures will be across the country, but will include "saturated markets" and "redundant locations."

SOFTBANK

Firm Invests in

Nascent Technology

Masayoshi Son, founder and chief executive of Japanese telecommunications and internet giant SoftBank Group Corp., is making another big bet -- this time on a nascent technology that might take years or decades to bloom.

Improbable, a London-based startup that makes virtual worlds for videogames and simulations of the real world, said it raised $502 million in a SoftBank-led funding round. Improbable said SoftBank would take a board seat and noncontrolling stake in the startup but didn't disclose the deal's terms. The company said that based on the funding round, investors value it at more than $1 billion.

The deal fits into Mr. Son's recent interest in artificial intelligence. He has said that the promise of A.I. and the Internet of Things -- the idea that everyday items such as sneakers and refrigerators will be connected to the web -- has underpinned recent deals.

SoftBank Founder Looks to Virtual Worlds in Next Big Tech Bet; Improbable, a London-based maker of virtual worlds and real-world simulations, has raised $502 million in a funding round led by the Japanese telecommunications and internet giant

LONDON Masayoshi Son, the founder and chief executive of Japanese telecommunications and internet giant SoftBank Group Corp., is making another big bet this time on a nascent technology that might take years or decades to bloom.

Improbable, a London-based startup that makes virtual worlds for videogames and simulations of the real world, said Thursday that it raised $502 million in a SoftBank-led funding round. Improbable said SoftBank would take a board seat and non-controlling stake in the startup, but didn't disclose the deal's terms.

The company said that based on the funding round, investors now value it at more than $1 billion, though didn't give further details.

The deal fits broadly into "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supersmart-robots-will-outnumber-humans-within-30-years-says-softbank-ceo-1488193423". He has said that the promise of A.I. and the Internet of Things   the idea that everyday items such as sneakers and refrigerators will be connected to the web   has underpinned some of the big and surprising deals that SoftBank has pulled off in the past year.

SoftBank is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-group-launches-investment-fund-1476398189" with a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund. Last year, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-bets-on-internet-of-things-with-arm-deal-1468946389" for $32 billion.

The Improbable investment is being made by SoftBank, not the new fund, which hasn't launched yet.

The deal is an unusually large, single investment for a startup in the U.K., which has tried to position itself as a destination for tech talent and financing. The country boasts a global research hub that includes Cambridge and Oxford, which each host world-class universities that have put new focus on innovation in tech and biotech. London, meanwhile, is home to big offices for tech giants like Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.

But access to investment capital has restricted start-ups here, as it has in other aspiring tech "hubs" outside Silicon Valley. Mr. Son is bringing new heft to U.K.'s global tech bona fides. His $100 billion tech fund is based in London. His bet on Improbable is another vote of confidence.

The U.K. has already raised its profile in the field of artificial intelligence research after Google in 2014 snapped up DeepMind, an A.I. startup founded by Cambridge alumni.

In a statement, SoftBank Managing Director Deep Nishar said Improbable's real-world simulations "will help us explore disease, improve cities, understand economies and solve complex problems." A SoftBank spokesman declined to make Mr. Son available for an interview.

Founded by University of Cambridge graduates in 2012, Improbable currently focuses on videogames. It created a platform that lets developers of multiplayer online games create virtual worlds that adhere to real-world constraints such as population growth, traffic flow and the spread of diseases. The company then generates revenue from clients for its work.

Improbable co-founder and Chief Executive Herman Narula pointed out a recent mini-crisis at a videogame using his platform as an example. "At one point, the beetles didn't mate at a certain rate and it collapsed part of their world's ecology," said Mr. Narula, the 29-year-old son of an Indian construction magnate.

Mr. Narula said Improbable would continue to focus on gaming, but was branching out into real-world applications. He believes that government agencies and utility companies would be interested in Improbable's technology, because it can show how small changes in a city can affect traffic, telecommunications and infrastructure. He said Improbable's product could help in disaster preparation, simulating how millions of people would move, make phone calls and use electricity during a tsunami or terrorist attack, for example.

Improbable provides only the platform for such simulations. Its clients would feed information to create the simulations.

Mr. Narula said he met with SoftBank representatives before flying to Japan to meet Mr. Son, who quizzed him on the technical details of Improbable's product. He said the two had similar visions of the future, for the most part. "Masa has a 300-year plan," Mr. Narula said. "I'm not that ambitious. I have a 50-year plan."

Improbable said existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture firm, and Horizons Ventures, the fund of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, made follow-up investments alongside SoftBank's contribution.

Improbable plans to use the investment to speed up its growth and hire more people in its London and San Francisco offices.

TOKYO -- SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said Wednesday he is preparing to shift his focus from turning around U.S. wireless unit Sprint Corp. to running a $100 billion technology-investment fund.

Cost cuts have helped reduce losses at Sprint, the No. 4 mobile carrier in the U.S. With its operating profit rising, more of the day-to-day operations will be entrusted to Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, Mr. Son said, though he added that he wanted to get involved personally in planned talks with T-Mobile US Inc. on industry consolidation.

SoftBank, whose empire spans full or partial stakes in hundreds of companies including British chip architect ARM Holdings PLC, Yahoo JapanCorp. and China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., is roiling the global investment community with a plan to bet billions of dollars on tech companies.

"I haven't accomplished anything I can be proud of in my 60 years on Earth," the 59-year-old Mr. Son told reporters and investors. "This is my chance."

The investment fund is nearly ready for its official launch, he said.

Mr. Son is tracking what he says will be a "gold rush" into technologies for an age when artificial intelligence exceeds human capabilities. He says ownership of ARM, whose chip architecture is used in almost all of the world's smartphones, will help him predict which technologies will win.

That argument drew a pledge to invest $45 billion from Saudi Arabia's deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as well as investments from Abu Dhabi investor Mubadala Development Co., Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Foxconn Technology Group and Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison, according to people familiar with the matter. SoftBank has said it would contribute $25 billion.

By taking on the role of a fund manager, Mr. Son could invest in key technology companies without raising SoftBank's already-high debt levels. Total interest-bearing debt minus cash positions at SoftBank stood at 11.2 trillion yen ($98 billion) at the end of March, up from 9.2 trillion yen a year earlier.

SoftBank and investment teams in London and San Francisco have lined up deals for the fund. The list includes satellite operators Intelsat SA and OneWeb Ltd., New York-based shared-office-space company WeWork Cos., Indian mobile-payment company Paytm, and a 25% stake in ARM that would be purchased from SoftBank, said people familiar with the matter.

A deal related to automotive technology also is in the pipeline, Mr. Son said.

While Mr. Son said he planned to devote much of his time to the fund, leaving SoftBank's core businesses to deputies, he said would take charge of U.S. negotiations seeking ways to combine resources at Sprint with those of other carriers to meet rising network costs.

A meeting between Mr. Son and U.S. President Donald Trump in December raised speculation that Mr. Son could revive plans to merge Sprint and T-Mobile US, which he abandoned after opposition from antitrust regulators under the Obama administration.

"T-Mobile is the most likely partner, but we will keep an open mind," Mr. Son said.

INSIGHT
Filtering out noise from news is crucial in age of data overload

Anyone who pays attention to financial media and research is bombarded with a multitude of opinions on a variety of subjects every day. Strategists offer up their thoughts on why the market is too high or too low. Economists explain what recent data mean for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and analysts argue whether the quarterly earnings of a particular company are good or bad for its stock price. This week we will hear views on what the French presidential election result means for investors.

We listen to these numerous opinions because the underlying assumption is that in investment, as in life, greater levels of information and analysis of this information allows for better decision making.

James Montier of GMO, a fund manager, observes there is a near-universally accepted idea in finance that more information is always more desirable than less. This belief, he argues, is in part driven by a broader faith in the efficient market hypothesis. If markets have already priced in all known information, to then beat the market the investor has to search out new information that has not yet been discovered by everyone else to gain an edge.

But is having more information, more analysis and more opinion as helpful as we might think? Mr Montier argued in 2005 that investors were prone to obsess over "a bewildering informational fusion of news and noise" to the extent that it ended up damaging their performance. In the subsequent decade and a bit, the level of "news and noise" he referred to then has shot up significantly. Not only is more information available, there are more market participants that claim they are harnessing this data through computer power in ways that will provide them with a durable advantage over others.

Hedge funds are investing vast sums of money into "big data" technology, some of which comb social media to try and predict things such as the popularity of a restaurant chain or the momentum a candidate has in an election race. Some comb over weather formations or credit card spending patterns. It is not only quant funds that are doing this - traditional stock pickers are hiring data scientists to help them compete. The central belief that drives this activity is that more high-quality and correctly analysed data will provide an additional layer of salience with which to make investment decisions. There is now a growing side industry of data vendors who harvest things like location tracking from mobile phones to package and sell to clients in the financial sector.

Mr Montier provides some interesting counter arguments to this "more is more" approach to information and data in investment. He cites a research study by the psychologist Paul Slovic which involved showing eight bookmakers a list of variables linked to the past performance of racing horses. They were asked to rank the variables by importance. They were then given data for past races based on 40 variables with the task of using it to guess which horse had won. The bookmakers were given access to the data in order of those they thought were most important for predicting the winners, and were then asked to rank their horse picks by degrees of confidence.

The experiment found that as the information sets available to the bookmakers grew, they tend ed to become more confident with their predictions. However, even though their confidence was higher, their levels of accuracy remained largely the same whether they had access to five of the data sets or 40. They thought that having more data would help them more accurately pick winners.

Why is this important for investment? We are in an age where rapid advances in computing power mean that we are almost certain to see individual fund managers have access to single data sets about one day of consumer spending that are larger than all previous data sets available on Wall Street charting an entire decade. Will this necessarily make them better or more successful investors? The answer is far from clear. As Mr Montier notes: "We should devote time to working out what we should really be looking at. What are the five most important things we should know about any stock we are about to invest in?"

Picking those will remain tricky as ever, no matter now many trillions of data points we have at our fingertips.

Hearst Entertainment has led a $75m funding round for London-based music publishing company Kobalt that will fuel its expansion into online video.

Kobalt , which has been backed by Google Ventures and Michael Dell 's MSD in previous rounds, will be valued at $775m as a result of the injection.

Balderton Capital and MSD have also participated.

Hearst is the first non-financial investor in Kobalt, which has 25,000 songwriters, 600 publishing companies and 20,000 independent artists on its books.

It counts the likes of Nick Cave, Sir Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl and Miles Davis on its roster and commands a large share of the royalties that flow through the charts, partly as a result of its deal with Max Martin, the Swedish songwriter who has more US number one hits than anyone apart from John Lennon and Sir Paul.

Kobalt has built its reputation by improving transparency in the collection of royalties for songwriters and musicians in the age of streaming.

Willard Ahdritz , who founded the group in 2000, built transactional databases to track digital royalties on the basis that songs being streamed should be treated in the same way mobile phone companies charge for calls.

He said: "Transparency drives liquidity which drives volume. One hit song today has 4bn micro transactions. That will be 10bn in 18 months. To manage that, you need technology and you need big data."

The company provides its artists and publishing customers with immediate and exact information about royalties being generated on Spotify, Apple Music and other services.

It will use the funds to apply the same techniques to online video, with Mr Ahdritz expecting to launch a dedicated product within a year.

Mr Ahdritz called it a "natural expansion" of its technology. "Are we interested in video? Yes. YouTube, Vevo, Facebook even Spotify is looking at video content."

Tubi TV Raises $20 Million for Ad-Supported Streaming Service; Streaming service lures cord-cutters and advertisers with a library of free, premium movies and shows that carry commercials

Corrections & Amplifications

Tubi's latest round of funding was Series C. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the round was Series B.

Tubi TV has more than doubled its total funding with a fresh round of capital as investors bet more viewers will sit through commercials in exchange for access to a vast library of free, premium movies and TV shows.

The advertiser-supported streaming service, which launched in 2014, has raised $20 million in new funding from four venture-capital firms, led by Jump Capital. The round brings its total financing to date to $34 million.

Since its debut, the San Francisco-based company has amassed more than 50,000 television and movie titles, and users are now in the "many millions," Farhad Massoudi, Tubi TV's founder and chief executive, said during an interview. There's no fee, but the service requires registration and users are fed four to five minutes of commercials for every 30 minutes of content, including during movies.

Unlike many subscription-based streaming platforms that focus on a few shiny titles, Tubi TV has licensed an extensive amount of content available across all major devices from the Xbox to the iPhone, said Mr. Massoudi. Its broad collection ranges from Oscar-winning films like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Gladiator" to campy classics and anime. There's even a category of titles called "Not on Netflix."

The company counts Lionsgate, MGM, "https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/03/12/tubi-tv-strikes-content-deal-with-paramount-pictures/"and Starz among its 200 content partners and says its library is second in size only to Netflix. In 2016, the company grew its monthly active user base to nine times what it was the year before, though it declined to disclose exact figures.

Tubi TV will funnel the new funds into marketing which it has done almost none of so far as well as its "secret sauce" in-house TV analytics platform, which Mr. Massoudi says "helps us dig into what people want, and when and where they want it."

Tubi TV is making a play for viewers and TV advertising dollars as cord-cutting accelerates. According to estimates from MoffettNathanson, about 762,000 subscribers abandoned their cable subscriptions in the first quarter, resulting in the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-investors-fret-about-advertising-outlook-1493921148?tesla=y".

"What we're offering is basically identical to the traditional TV commercial experience and reaching that demographic that's watching less and less traditional TV," said Mr. Massoudi.

Tubi TV is going after cord-cutters among an ever-expanding sea of online streaming services, from Netflix and Amazon Prime to CBS All Access, YouTube TV and Hulu. The company is trying to set itself apart by making its library free and exclusively advertising supported, at a time when many other offerings are focusing on monthly subscription fees and original shows or live TV feeds.

Mr. Massoudi said he remains skeptical of the slew of major networks launching individual subscription packages.

"I think the market is delusional if they think consumers are willing to pay and subscribe to all these apps," he said. "In the next year or so these apps are going to disappear, or they'll see there's no clear path to significant scale."

Yelena Shkolnik, a senior associate at Jump Capital, said there is a massive group of consumers migrating their viewing to mobile and over-the-top but "finding themselves underserved by the live TV bundles and the universe of competing paid services they find there."

The Series C funding round also included new investor Danhua Capital along with previous investors Cota Capital and Foundation Capital. MGM and Lionsgate were among earlier investors.

Remix Helps Transit Agencies Create New Routes; Startup has raised $10 million to help public planners quickly create or change routes

Private companies have been transformed by ever-changing technology. Now government-owned services are getting in on the action.

A new startup, Remix, provides transportation agencies with data and visual tools to plan new transit routes, move existing routes, and create public-facing maps to share detailed plans with consumers.

Remix has raised $10 million in Series A financing led by Sequoia Capital. The San Francisco startup previously raised $2 million in seed financing from Sequoia, Y Combinator and SV Angel in 2015.

The company is the brainchild of co-founders Sam Hashemi, Ms. Chu, Dan Getelman and Danny Whalen, who came up with the idea during the Code for America program. The prototype website drew interest from around the world, after which they decided to start the company.

Remix, with 40 people, plans to increase its international expansion with the new funding.

Used by 200 cities and agencies, Remix software enables transit planners to quickly plan new routes by dragging and dropping a route on a map. The software can quickly show the cost of the routes, along with demographic analytics about the people being served.

This type of planning in the past would be done using a variety of methods and take more time and money, said Erik Landfried, transit service planning supervisor at GoTriangle/GoDurham, a transit agency in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina that has used Remix.

"Previously, planners would only have time for making one or two options," said Tiffany Chu, co-founder and chief operating officer of Remix. "Now they can have 15 options, which considerably increases the chances of getting to a successful outcome."

Agencies also can upload their own data, such as ridership at different stops, population and employment forecasts, bikeways, and school locations.

A startup selling to local government isn't a typical venture investment but this one was different, said Aaref Hilaly, a Sequoia partner who has joined Remix's board.

"Every great company defies conventional wisdom in some way or other," he said. "I see Remix as one of a new generation of vertical SaaS companies growing really quickly because their service is targeted to a group of customers."

Transit agencies also use Remix to explain routes to the public. Remix's tool called "Jane" enables planners to drop a pin on a map and show how far a transit rider could travel within, say, 30 minutes under different scenarios.

King County Metro used Remix to collaborate with many jurisdictions in the Seattle area on new regional transit plans. "It allowed us to be more nimble, more responsive and more collaborative," said Christina O'Claire, assistant general manager at King County Metro.

Options Traders Pull Back --- Declining volumes and higher costs are crimping the market; acute feedback loop

Falling volumes and spiraling costs are pushing trading firms out of U.S. options, raising concerns about fragility in a market that investors rely on to protect portfolios.

Trading has dwindled in most areas of the market, and investors and traders are grappling with increasing fragmentation.

Liquidity has deteriorated, according to interviews with market participants and data reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, making it harder to trade most options without significantly moving prices. Options on key indexes, exchange-traded funds and high-volume stocks dominate trading, but activity has diminished in the rest of the listed U.S. options world.

The stresses, which have made trading riskier and less profitable, prompted at least six prominent options market makers to exit from the business since 2012. Market makers are firms willing to both buy and sell.

Thomas Peterffy, a pioneer of electronic options trading, said in March that his firm, Interactive Brokers Group Inc., would pull the plug on options market making. KCG Holdings Inc. announced its exit from retail options market making last year, while UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have also left automated options market making. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. made similar decisions in 2014, according to people familiar with the matter.

"Most market makers congregate in the highly traded products," Mr. Peterffy said in an interview. "It's difficult for a market maker to maintain hundreds of thousands of bids and offers all the time."

It is hard to pinpoint what triggered the trader exodus, but industry observers say as firms leave, liquidity gets further drained, which spurs more market makers to retrench. The dangerous feedback loop could sap appetite for options, which investors use to manage risk in their portfolios.

"We could ill afford to lose any more market makers at this junction," said Alan Grigoletto, who previously worked at the Boston Options Exchange and now runs Grigoletto Consulting Group while trading options in his retirement account.

Data show the liquidity bifurcation. Index and exchange-traded-fund options volume rose in April by 28% and 4%, respectively, data from Options Clearing Corp. show. Meanwhile, total equity options volume shrank 10% from the prior year. While volume isn't an exact equivalent to liquidity, it is easier for the options market to absorb trades when an individual asset trades more.

Ultra-active options include those on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF, the PowerShares QQQ ETF, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. On the flip side, on an average day in March, there was zero options activity on about 1,400 individual stocks, ETFs or indexes, data from analytics firm Hanweck Associates show.

Ironically, the options industry's willingness to give users more choices is adding to the overall liquidity problem. Investors can trade options for more hours now, and exchanges have boosted the number of products, introducing wider ranges in both expirations and strikes, the prices at which options can be exercised. But this makes it more challenging for market makers who need to continuously provide quotes across an ever-increasing range.

"The existing pool of liquidity has been stretched thinner and thinner across expirations and strike prices and exchanges," said John Kinahan, chief executive of Group One Trading, an options market maker. "We still post markets on a lot of different exchanges, just not as aggressively as we used to."

One barometer of liquidity is the difference between the price buyers would like to purchase an option for and what sellers are willing to exchange at. The measure, known as the bid-ask spread, has increased 30% in the past five years and peaked in 2014, according to data from Hanweck, which calculated a weighted average of the spread across quotes on all options.

While options market makers are closing shop, the number of options exchanges has risen to 15 from nine just five years ago.

Smaller firms sometimes can't afford fees to connect with multiple exchanges alongside the technology costs necessary to keep trading speeds in line with competitors, said Hazem Dawani, chief executive of OptionsCity Software, a trading systems and analytics provider. Some exchanges also have tiered fee structures that favor bigger firms.

"We've seen customers pulling out of equity options and trying to trade other products," Mr. Dawani said. For example, customers are shifting to futures contracts, he said. Options Clearing Corp. data show a 42% increase in futures volume during April.

Mr. Peterffy expressed optimism, saying options are still an "excellent vehicle for traders," and that exchanges will eventually consolidate.

Grammarly, With $110 Million, Brings Artificial Intelligence  to Writing; Grammarly uses machine learning  and artificial intelligence  to improve people's writing.

One of the most basic human activities, writing, is getting an assist from machines.

Startup Grammarly uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to help improve people's writing, from basic spelling, grammar and style to more advanced suggestions on tone and context-specific language.

The San Francisco company has been bootstrapped since its founding in 2009 but has now raised $110 million in its first institutional funding as it looks to expand and ramp up hiring. General Catalyst led the growth equity round with participation from Breyer Capital, IVP, SignalFire and Spark Capital.

The 110-person startup has grown rapidly since it became a free service two years ago it now has 6.9 million daily active users and has been profitable since early on, according to the company. The app has 18,000 reviews and more than 10 million downloads on the Chrome Web Store.

The app, available in Chrome browser, Microsoft Word or Windows desktop, is used in business such as sales, marketing or support, in educational institutions as well as for people writing emails, social media or even dating profiles, said Max Lytvyn, co-founder of Grammarly.

"What became obvious to us early on was the problems we're addressing here are mass market problems," said Brad Hoover, chief executive at Grammarly.

The company's funding will help it compete for hiring top talent, said Hemant Taneja, managing director at General Catalyst, who is joining Grammarly's board. "This is actually the first AI-based consumer subscription company that's got this kind of scale and is this profitable."

Grammarly was hatched in 2009 by co-founders Mr. Lytvyn and Alex Shevchenko, who previously sold a software company that detected plagiarism, MyDropBox, to Blackboard.

Grammarly started off targeting enterprise customers but in 2010 decided to switch to a consumer service to go after a larger opportunity.

The consumer product enables Grammarly to process much more data and improve the product faster. "If we went to a specific vertical only, we'd significantly restrict the system's ability to learn," Mr. Lytvyn said.

After working on the product for several years to make the product good enough for consumers, in 2015 the company switched to a freemium business model and it has seen quick growth since then.

The service is free with a premium version with more features such as genre-specific writing checks and a plagiarism detector. It also provides suggestions for different types of writing. There are more than 30 types, such as academic essays, business letters, medical writing and email.

The app is "deceptively simple" Mr. Lytvyn said. Grammarly helps in three areas: basic mechanics, such as spelling, grammar and sentence structure; secondly, clarity, readability and ambiguity. Finally, an area that the company is still developing is effectiveness, which is context-specific suggestions or flagging things like gendered or aggressive language. In the future, the app could do thinks like ask if a joke in your writing is appropriate.

Behind the scenes the service is processing loads of data in April, it suggested 14 billion improvements across its service.

The tool parses text, breaking it up into phrases and sentences. It applies various algorithms to analyze the text using technology such as natural language processing and machine learning.

The app then provides suggestions and explanations to get users' trust and to help them become better writers, Mr. Lytvyn said. It then runs another check to see if all its suggestions work together.

Grammarly learns from the vast amount of writing it ingests, and it adjusts based on usage. In a simple example, when people write "Hi John" in an email, Grammarly was suggesting people add a comma. "But nobody used that," Mr. Lytvyn said. "So we dropped it."

The app only stores users' writing if they save documents on the Grammarly website otherwise all writing is discarded after it is parsed for analysis to protect privacy, Mr. Lytvyn said.

Despite its use of artificial intelligence, the app isn't designed to replace people but to help improve writing, like a spreadsheet does for helping humans, Mr. Lytvyn said. "Grammarly is more of a power tool. It makes humans more powerful it's not for replacing humans."

Market Fuels an IPO Push But Biggest Names Hold Off

A soaring stock market, historically low volatility and a rally in technology stocks has fueled a rebound in the market for initial public offerings. But the biggest, highest-profile startups are still hanging back, reflecting broader concerns about whether they can match the rich valuations offered by private investors.

A slew of companies are preparing to go public later this year, as the volume of new listings reaches levels not seen since 2014. U.S.-listed IPOs raised more than $18 billion in the first four months of the year, more than four times as much as in the same period last year and nearly double the comparable 2015 total, according to Dealogic.

Among the companies preparing for IPOs, according to people familiar with the matter, are MongoDB Inc., which has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to lead an offering that's expected to value the data-analytics provider at more than its last valuation of $1.6 billion; Switch Ltd., an operator of data-storage facilities that recently hired Goldman and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. for a debut that's expected to carry a valuation of more than $2 billion; and Axiom Global Inc., a tech-based legal-services provider that recently held a bakeoff for potential underwriters.

Altice USA filed paperwork last month for an offering that could raise more than $1 billion and value the Cablevision owner at more than $20 billion.

"It feels like some companies are rushing to go because there's a window in the market," said Jim Callinan, portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco.

Yet the market still has a long way to go to return to full health. Conspicuously missing from the current IPO pipeline are some of the highest-profile private companies, such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., which aren't expected to come to market before 2018. Several investment bankers say there have been fewer bakeoffs than they'd expect given the favorable market conditions.

Shares of newly public companies are performing well, with this year's batch of IPOs trading 11% above their offering price on average through Friday's close, according to Dealogic. Last year's batch of IPOs have gained an average of 29%, Dealogic data shows.

The flurry of activity is a sign the new-issue market that's languished in recent years may be in the midst of a sustained rebound. Snap Inc. successfully debuted in March at a valuation of $24 billion, far above the Snapchat parent's latest private funding round. Although the shares have fallen from their highs, they still trade well above the price at which they were first offered to the public.

It's a change from much of last year and late 2015, when investors and corporate boards stepped back from the IPO market, wary that the stock market would value their companies at less than prior fundraising rounds. That fear still permeates private-company boards, bankers, investors and analysts say. And together with cheap funding that's widely available for private companies, it helps explain why many richly valued startups and others aren't rushing to go public.

"The good news is we have an IPO market," said Matthew Sperling, a managing director who runs the equity advisory business at Rothschild & Co. "But issuers and owners are looking at it with a measured level of enthusiasm."

Cloudera Inc. stoked those concerns last month when the big-data software startup debuted at a level far below its last private valuation of more than $4 billion. Meanwhile, shares of Twilio Inc., a software company that went public last June, fell 27% last week on the back of soft first-quarter results. Still, the company remains valued at more than $2 billion, well above its last private round.

So far the IPOs that have debuted "have been priced to sell, but once investors get a taste of success, the companies that come next don't have to offer quite as much of a discount," said Scott Sandell, a managing general partner at venture-capital firm New Enterprise Associates. He added that he expects a robust pipeline for IPOs in the balance of the year, but warned that some companies could still get scooped up by corporate buyers who are sitting on piles of cash and seeking new growth opportunities in a sluggish economy.

Indeed, some investors and underwriters say there's concern that the public markets are being used as a last resort. Some of the companies debuting have tried to sell themselves and failed. It's symptomatic of a decadeslong trend that's seen the total number of public companies in the U.S. decline sharply as more entrepreneurs and others choose to avoid the increased disclosure and other perceived drawbacks of broad ownership.

One of the most closely watched private companies, shared-office-space provider WeWork Cos., is soon expected to close on a new round of private funding in excess of $3 billion -- more than any U.S.-listed IPO has raised this year and last, other than Snap. The investment will likely keep WeWork from tapping the public markets for more than a year, according to people familiar with its plans.

The likely path for Spotify AB, the music-streaming service last valued at $8.5 billion, is yet another sign of the antipathy some companies have toward raising money in the public markets and the IPO process. Spotify is considering a so-called direct listing of its shares, in which -- unlike in a typical IPO -- the Swedish company wouldn't sell stock and raise capital or use underwriters, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

A soaring stock market, historically low volatility and a rally in technology shares has fueled a rebound in the U.S. market for initial public offerings. But the biggest, highest-profile startups are still hanging back, reflecting broader concerns about whether they can match the rich valuations offered by private investors.

A slew of firms are preparing to go public this year, as the volume of new listings reaches levels not seen since 2014. U.S.-listed IPOs raised more than $18 billion in the first four months of the year, four times as much as in the same period last year and nearly double the comparable 2015 total, according to Dealogic.

Among the companies preparing for IPOs, according to people familiar with the matter, are MongoDB Inc., which has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to lead an offering that is expected to value the data-analytics provider at more than its last valuation of $1.6 billion; Switch Ltd., an operator of data-storage facilities that recently hired Goldman and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. for a debut that's expected to carry a valuation of more than $2 billion; and Axiom Global Inc., a tech-based legal-services provider that recently held a bakeoff for potential underwriters.

Altice USA filed paperwork last month for an offering that could raise more than $1 billion and value the Cablevision owner at more than $20 billion.

"It feels like some companies are rushing to go because there's a window in the market," said Jim Callinan, portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco.

Yet the market still has a long way to go to return to full health. Conspicuously missing from the current IPO pipeline are some of the highest-profile private companies, such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., which aren't expected to come to market before 2018.

Tech
Companies Look to Make a Quantum Leap With New Technology; Volkswagen is among a growing number of firms experimenting with quantum computing to push their businesses forward

Quantum mechanics has fascinated, confounded and even alarmed scientists for nearly a century with the notion that particles can exist in two states at once and communicate with each other across vast distances. The underlying science that Albert Einstein famously called "spooky" could soon become one of modern computing's core tenets. 

Computers that utilize quantum mechanics are moving beyond pure scientific research and inching toward the commercial sector, with companies such as Volkswagen AG beginning to harness their unprecedented power to solve complex problems in nanoseconds. 

"This technology is not futuristic," said Martin Hofmann, Volkswagen chief information officer, who oversees information technology for the group's 12 brands including Audi, Porsche and Bentley. "It's a question of years until it's commercialized, and investing right now in the technology is a big competitive advantage." 

Companies including D-Wave Systems Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. have been pioneering quantum computing, and experts say that within five years the technology could be powerful enough to solve new classes of problems that are currently beyond the grasp of even supercomputers. 

While traditional computers use binary digits, or bits, which can either be 0s or 1s, quantum computers use quantum binary digits, or qubits, which represent and store information in both 0s and 1s simultaneously. This means the computers have the potential to sort through a vast number of possibilities within a fraction of a second to come up with a probable solution. 

Volkswagen put that speed to use for a recent traffic-optimization project. Working on a $15-million D-Wave quantum computer over the cloud, a team of five in-house data scientists took GPS data from 10,000 taxis in Beijing and simulated specific routes that would allow each car to travel from downtown Beijing to the nearest airport, about 20 miles away, in the fastest time possible without creating a traffic jam. 

After six months and several attempts, Dr. Hofmann and his team in March came up with an algorithm for the computer that optimized the routes for each taxi within a fraction of a second. A normal computer would have taken about 45 minutes to complete the same task, he said. 

Dr. Hofmann's next project is a navigation-based mobile app for drivers in Barcelona that will harness the power of quantum computing and machine learning, a part of artificial intelligence, to predict traffic jams and immediately send alternate routes. The first iteration is expected to debut by the end of the year, though Dr. Hofmann declined to go into more detail about the project. "If our project succeeds and in six to eight years the technology is where it should be, then traffic jams won't happen anymore," he said. 

IBM has also developed a cloud-based quantum computing service, which became available in March for commercial business use. A similar service for individual experiments launched last year. Executives say that in less than five years IBM's system could begin solving a range of computations for businesses related to chemistry and supply-chain optimizations. Those could include the ability to simulate significantly more molecular interactions within the human body than is now possible with traditional computers, which could accelerate new drug discoveries, said Bob Picciano, senior vice president of IBM Cognitive Systems. 

But commercializing the technology is a complex task. Qubits can't yet maintain their quantum mechanical state for more than a fraction of a second, said Dario Gil, vice president for science and solutions for IBM Research. They are delicate, easily disrupted by changes in temperature, noise or frequency. The number of qubits created by companies to date remains relatively small, meaning experiments are currently limited to a narrow swath of information. There also isn't yet a programming language for quantum computing like there is for classical computing. 

"This is phenomenally difficult from a tech perspective from every aspect," including materials, devices, theory and error correction, Dr. Gil said. 

Still, companies experimenting with quantum computing now stand to reap benefits if and when the technology becomes advanced enough to perform computations that classical computers can't, said Paul Warburton, a professor of nanoelectronics at University College London. "From the commercial point of view, it's a question of not wanting to be left behind when the real machine arrives," said Dr. Warburton.

Weekend Profile: An Unconventional High-Speed Trader --- Cifu's reputation is helped by his openness and a willingness to share expertise

High-frequency trading firms are often cast as villains. Virtu Financial Inc. Chief Executive Douglas Cifu is determined to be seen as one of the good guys.

That's increasingly important to the silver-haired, 51-year-old Long Island native as his firm moves to take over rival KCG Holdings Inc. If the deal is completed, Virtu's trading volumes in U.S. equities would more than double, and it would handle around 20% of all shares traded, on par with current leader Citadel Securities LLC.

High-frequency trading or HFT firms use computers to trade assets in fractions of a second. Low volatility, competition and increased costs have squeezed their bottom lines in recent years. Virtu's stock has lost more than 30% of its value since the firm went public in 2015.

In addition, the industry has faced heightened scrutiny after Michael Lewis's 2014 book "Flash Boys." The best-seller accused ultrafast traders of sniffing out stock orders to jump ahead of them, resulting in worse prices for financial institutions. HFT advocates reject such allegations and say high-frequency trading cut costs for investors.

Mr. Cifu, a champion debater in high school and former practicing lawyer, says even he was cowed by the firestorm sparked by "Flash Boys," which prompted Capitol Hill hearings and delayed Virtu's plans to go public.

"It's not easy when you read the paper or watch TV and people are basically accusing you of criminality," Mr. Cifu told The Wall Street Journal. "For a while I was just telling people I was a lawyer, because it was easier than trying to debate HFT with a bunch of strangers."

Mr. Cifu, one of three brothers, grew up east of New York City in Syosset. His father was an electrical engineer, his mother a nurse. As a teen, he made money landscaping for neighbors and working at the local Carvel ice-cream branch. At Columbia University, he majored in political science and was a commentator for football and basketball games.

Upon finishing Columbia Law School in 1990, he joined the white-shoe firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. He made partner in 1999 and became a rainmaker in corporate deals, heading the firm's private-equity group.

In 2005, Mr. Cifu met Vincent Viola, now the billionaire chairman of Virtu. At the time, Paul Weiss was advising private-equity firm General Atlantic on buying a stake in the owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Mr. Viola, an ex-Nymex chairman, was involved in the talks.

The two men had different styles. Mr. Viola had started his career in the rough-and-tumble of the Nymex gasoline futures pit. He nonetheless hit it off with the Ivy League-trained corporate lawyer.

In 2007, the two had a conversation that Mr. Cifu likens to a scene in "The Graduate" where an older man tells Dustin Hoffman's character that his future lies in plastics. In Mr. Cifu's memory, Mr. Viola told him: "Why don't you come form the greatest electronic market-making firm in the world with me?"

Mr. Cifu said the idea seemed "crazy" but in 2008, he quit his law job and co-founded Virtu with Mr. Viola and Graham Free, now a trader with the firm.

It was a timely move. HFT firms made billions from U.S. stocks trading amid the high volatility and heavy volumes following the financial crisis. From 2009 to 2014, Virtu lost money on just one of 1,485 trading days, according to paperwork filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the firm went public.

That revelation stirred outrage in some quarters: HFT-skeptic blog ZeroHedge called it proof that markets are a "regulator-endorsed cesspool of HFT fraud." Mr. Cifu says Virtu's winning streak was due to the law of large numbers: Even if a trade has a slim likelihood of profitability -- say, 51% -- it will lead to consistent profits if repeated millions of times a day.

Mr. Cifu has courted HFT critics. In 2015, Virtu agreed to share technology with T. Rowe Price Group, which has slammed "predatory" high-speed trading practices.

"He's not afraid to go on TV and do interviews, and he explains his business model," said Joe Saluzzi, a partner at brokerage Themis Trading LLC and vocal HFT critic. "So many of these guys in the high-frequency trading industry are secretive."

One reason for Virtu's good-guy reputation is its focus on market-making, a strategy that helps markets function smoothly. Market makers buy and sell the same assets throughout the day, earning profits by collecting a small "spread" between the buy and sell price. This ensures a steady stream of price quotes available for anyone else to trade against.

Virtu also has been a supporter of IEX Group Inc., the upstart trading venue whose founders were the heroes of "Flash Boys." Virtu was the only major electronic trader to back IEX's effort to become a full-fledged stock exchange, saying it had no objections to IEX's "speed bump," a feature that imposes a brief delay on trades and was designed to foil certain HFT strategies.

A sports fan, Mr. Cifu has used his deal-making skills to buy the Florida Panthers, a National Hockey League franchise. Mr. Viola and Mr. Cifu took control of the team in 2013 for $240 million. They sought to turbocharge the team by applying data-driven, "Moneyball"-style analytics to hiring players.

Their record has drawn mixed reviews. They stabilized the team's finances, and in the 2015-16 season, the Panthers won first place in the NHL's Atlantic division, though they were quickly knocked out of the playoffs.

But in November, the Panthers unexpectedly fired coach Gerard Gallant, a move scorned by many NHL-watchers. Hockey commentators pilloried Mr. Viola and Mr. Cifu as "computer boys," and the team ended the season with a losing record.

Mr. Cifu promises to get the Panthers back on track, but says it will be an uphill battle to win over critics.

"My second-biggest challenge in the world beyond Michael Lewis is the Canadian hockey media," he said.

Investment industry veteran warns over 'easy growth'; Analysis: Equities

More active management groups are set to join forces, argues State Street chief

For the investment industry, the post-crisis era has been both the best of times and the worst of times.

Aggressive monetary policy easing by central banks has helped lift markets to new highs, buoying assets under management. Just in the US, the industry's heft swelled to a new peak of $16.3tn in 2016.

At the same time, the era has been marked by a tectonic shift in favour of cheaper, passive products such as index-tracking mutual funds and exchange traded funds, as investors have increasingly eschewed more expensive active managers that on average have a shoddy record of beating their benchmarks.

The result has been the toughest environment for the global asset management industry in memory, according to Ron O'Hanley , chief executive of State Street Global Advisors.

"There's a lot of change under way, and more to come," he tells the FT. "We now live permanently in an environment where clients are far more attuned to fees than before. And rightly so . . . We get paid by assets under management, so the tripling of the S&P 500 has done wonders for fee revenue. But at some point that goes away."

Mr O'Hanley has a good vantage point to comment on the industry's trends. State Street's asset management arm controls $2.4tn, including the world's biggest ETF, the $229bn SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.

Before heading SSgA, he oversaw Fidelity's $2.1tn asset management business, and before that he headed BNY Mellon Asset Management. He started his career at McKinsey, where he founded the consultancy's investment management practice.

The asset management industry has evolved radically during that period, and has suffered periodic scrapes and bruises from market calamities such as the 1987 Black Monday crash, the Russian default and the blow-up of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, the dotcom bubble bursting, and more recently the global financial crisis.

But some things have largely remained constant. Rising economic growth, globalisation and a savings glut have buoyed an asset management industry that has enjoyed an unusual combination of high profit margins, low barriers to entry and consistent overcapacity.

"The industry has had an extraordinary rise," Mr O'Hanley says. But he admits: "A lot of the growth has been easy growth. The challenge is that clients weren't being well-served."

The latest scorecard from Spiva, a semi-annual review of the industry's performance by S&P, shows just how poorly investors have fared over time. About 92 per cent of US large-cap mutual funds have failed to match their benchmark over 15 years.

While bond funds have not been eviscerated by the passive shift to the same degree, fixed-income fund managers also mostly fail to beat the market, the report noted.

Many investment groups are hoping that a brighter future is dawning, with rising interest rates and falling stock market correlations making it easier for active managers to beat their benchmarks.

But many analysts argue that even an improvement in performance will only slow the passive investment trend, and they predict that the inevitable result will be more mergers and acquisitions in the splintered world of asset management.

Industry insiders have long been sceptical that widespread consolidation can happen. The industry is infamous for the cultural clashes that can result from investment groups merging, margins are on average enviable compared with many other sectors, and there are fewer back-office costs that can be stripped out in a merger. But in the new investment reality, not consolidating is a "luxury" a lot of companies cannot afford, SSgA's head notes.

There has already been a batch of big deals, most notably Janus Capital merging with Henderson, and Standard Life swooping for Aberdeen Asset Management. But there is probably more to come.

"It has historically been hard to take two active shops and merge them together. But in this stage of decline that won't hold. I suspect we'll start to see more M&A," Mr O'Hanley says.

One potential glimmer of hope lies in the impact of technology, with many industry insiders predicting that advances in artificial intelligence, coupled with the rise of "big data", can help trim costs by automating a lot of back-office functions and even enhance investing prowess. While Mr O'Hanley predicts humans will remain the bedrock of the investment industry, he says SSgA is "looking at it across the board".

"I don't think I'll be addressing a bunch of servers in our town halls. But there's more and more ability to apply technology and areas like big data and machine learning," he says. "Getting rid of humans is not the objective, but if that's the result then so be it."

Ethical Funds Are Hard To Define

State Street Corp. launched its SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Free exchange-traded fund with much fanfare in December 2015, its debut timed to coincide with the Paris climate talks and its credibility burnished by support from the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the most prominent environmental lobbying groups in the U.S.

Despite the ETF's name, it owned stakes in, for example, Transocean Ltd., the offshore-drilling company implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; Southern Co., a utility that relies on coal and natural gas for 80% of its generating capacity; and Valero Energy Corp., a major gasoline refiner.

As demand for do-gooder investing increases, particularly among women and millennials, fund managers are retooling their lineups to include funds that appeal to a wider audience. These loosely defined strategies offer a feel-good tilt while still preserving broad market exposure, which muddies the difference between responsible funds and their plain-vanilla peers.

The lack of industrywide definitions makes reliable statistics hard to come by.

The Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates that assets pegged to environmental, social and governance strategies, or ESG, ballooned to a record $22.9 trillion at the start of 2016, making up 26% of professionally managed money world-wide.

Yet many asset managers disclose few details about how they use ESG criteria, according to a report from the alliance's U.S. organization. Some analysts include solar- and wind-energy funds. Others don't. Some funds adhere to "biblical" values that critics call homophobic. Some funds, like the State Street ETF, own stock in companies that are blacklisted by competitors.

"It's a very slippery space," said Elisabeth Kashner, head of ETFs for FactSet, a data and analytics firm. "There's no consensus on what's ultimately good or bad, nor is there consensus on how to measure it."

Last August, State Street changed the name to clarify the fund's strategy of avoiding firms with coal, gas and oil reserves such as Exxon Mobil Corp. It is now called the SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF.

"There is no ironclad, crystal-clear, broadly consensual, industry definition of how to invest, or not invest, in fossil fuels," said Chris McKnett, head of ESG investments at State Street, who said the change was made for the sake of "precision and clarity."

ESG investing traces its modern roots to the antiapartheid divestiture campaign of the 1980s, which prodded companies to withdraw from South Africa to protest the country's institutionalized racial segregation. After apartheid was dismantled, ethical investing focused on boycotting heavy polluters and human-rights violators. As concerns about climate change increased, investors began looking for ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their portfolios without sacrificing diversification and performance.

ESG became an increasingly popular solution. Instead of using market value to determine how much to allocate each company, like most traditional indexes, the strategies weight their investments based on how a company performs on ESG criteria.

Some funds go a step further, using financial criteria like revenue or dividends combined with ESG scores.

Since the start of 2016, the ETF industry has launched 26 new ESG funds, according to FactSet and XTF. Firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., State Street and OppenheimerFunds, have also published research touting the performance-enhancing benefits of ESG screening. Some fund managers believe that ESG screening can weed out companies with simmering scandals, said Sharon French, head of beta solutions for OppenheimerFunds.

She cited MSCI's July 2013 ESG downgrade of Volkswagen AG due to corporate-governance problems, more than two years before the Environmental Protection Agency announced its investigation into emissions cheating.

Such strategies preserve diversification, but can make for strange bedfellows. For example, the Columbia Sustainable Global Equity Income ETF includes Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum Corp. among its top 20 investments; and, at one point, the single largest holding of Oppenheimer's Global ESG Revenue ETF was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a company excluded from other ESG strategies because of its history of labor problems, though that may change as the company improves its ESG performance. The fund liquidated its Wal-Mart stake in February after MSCI noted "significant concerns" related to labor unions and an ongoing bribery case against its Mexican subsidiary, Oppenheimer's Ms. French said.

State Street s asset management arm controls $2.4tn, including the world s biggest ETF, the $229bn SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Before heading SSgA, he oversaw Fidelity s $2.1tn asset management business, and before that he headed BNY Mellon Asset Management. He started his career at McKinsey, where he founded the consultancy s investment management practice.

The asset management industry has evolved radically over that period, and has suffered periodic scrapes and bruises from market calamities such as the 1987 Black Monday crash, the Russian default and the blow-up of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, the dotcom bubble bursting, and more recently the global financial crisis.

But some things have largely remained constant. Rising economic growth, globalisation and a savings glut have buoyed an asset management industry that has enjoyed an unusual combination of high profit margins, low barriers to entry and consistent over-capacity.

 The industry has had an extraordinary rise,  Mr O Hanley says. But he admits:  A lot of the growth has been easy growth. The challenge is that clients weren t being well-served. 

The latest scorecard from "http://us.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2016.pdf", a semi-annual review of the industry s performance by S&P, shows just how poorly investors have fared over time. About 92 per cent of US large-cap mutual funds have failed to match their benchmark over 15 years. While bond funds have not been eviscerated by the passive shift to the same degree, fixed-income fund managers also mostly fail to beat the market, the report noted.

Many investment groups hope a brighter future is dawning, with rising interest rates and falling stock market correlations making it easier for active managers to beat their benchmarks.

But many analysts say that even a performance improvement will only slow the passive investment trend, and predict that the inevitable result will be more mergers and acquisitions in the splintered asset management world.

Industry insiders have long been sceptical that widespread consolidation can happen. The industry is infamous for the cultural clashes that can result from investment groups merging, margins are on average enviable compared with many other sectors, and there are fewer back-office costs that can be stripped out in a merger. But in the new investment reality not consolidating is a  luxury  a lot of companies cannot afford, "https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/State_Street_Global_Advisors"head notes.

There has already been a batch of big deals, most notably Janus Capital merging with Henderson, and Standard Life swooping for Aberdeen Asset Management. But there is probably more to come.  It has historically been hard to take two active shops and merge them together. But in this stage of decline that won t hold. I suspect we ll start to see more M&A,  Mr O Hanley says.

One potential glimmer of hope lies in the impact of technology, with many industry insiders predicting that advances in artificial intelligence, coupled with the rise of  big data , can help trim costs by automating a lot of back-office functions and even enhance investing prowess. While Mr O Hanley predicts humans will remain the bedrock of the investment industry, he says SSgA is  looking at it across the board .

 I don t think I ll be addressing a bunch of servers in our town halls. But there s more and more ability to apply technology and areas like big data and machine learning,  he says.  Getting rid of humans is not the objective, but if that s the result then so be it.

RSA quarterly operating profits up 14% as premiums rise

RSA, the British home and motor insurer, showed it had settled into post-turnround life as it carried forward strong momentum from 2016 to report operating profits were ahead of plans in its quarterly update.

The FTSE 100 group on Thursday reported a 14 per cent rise in net written premiums for the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2016, to 1.7bn, boosted by sterling weakness. Stripping out the effect of the weak pound, premium income was up 4 per cent.

The update is the first since chief executive Stephen Hester announced he had completed RSA s three-year restructuring programme in February with a deal to offload 1bn of old business which strengthened the group s capital position.

Mr Hester said "https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/RSA_Insurance_Group_PLC" was  a bright spot in a sector that has otherwise been a bit flat .

Despite market conditions it described as  largely unchanged , the group said it increased both volumes and prices in the quarter and grew premiums in its main markets of Canada, Scandinavia and the UK. The only region where premiums fell on a constant currency basis was Ireland, which represents less than 4 per cent of premiums, where the company said it had raised prices to improve profitability.

In Thursday s short trading update the company did not disclose details of quarterly operating profits.

The growth in overall premiums marks an improvement on the 2016 full-year figures: while results came in ahead of expectations in February, total net written premiums dropped 6 per cent because of policy volume declines. RSA slimmed down its business substantially during its turnround, undertaking a series of disposals and sacrificing premium income with the hope of increasing profitability, but said that process was now complete.

The insurer also said it had avoided a hit to profits from the changes to UK rules about compensation payments to victims of road accidents, announced in late February, which are expected to result in substantially higher claims costs for insurers than anticipated. The move prompted rival Direct Line to pull a special dividend earlier this year, but RSA said a net charge of 40m, which took the total provided so far to 85m, was  more than offset  by improvements in reserves in other parts of the business.

Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the results were  good  and RSA  were doing all the right things , but added some analysts were not convinced there was much more the company could do.

 The turnround has been exemplary. It has been a case study on how to turn a business round,  he said.  Now [Stephen Hester] has to do the hard graft of improving what is fundamentally three good businesses, eking out incremental performance. 

Mr Hester said the group would now be focusing on a wider move to use technology to improve productivity and cut costs as part of its  drive for outperformance . He said RSA was using more sophisticated tools, including geospatial technology to assess which areas were most susceptible to winds and floods and machine learning to identify new correlations, to improve its underwriting, and was working to make it  less hassle  for customers to buy policies online.

Shares in RSA closed up 2.48 per cent to 619p.

How Oil, Coal and Wal-Mart Became Part of 'Socially Responsible' ETFs; 'Ethical' funds are on the rise, but how they use environmental, social and governance criteria remains murky

State Street Corp. launched its SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Free exchange-traded fund with much fanfare in December 2015, its debut timed to coincide with the Paris climate talks and its credibility burnished by support from the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the most prominent environmental lobbying groups in the U.S.

Despite the ETF's name, it owned stakes in, for example, Transocean Ltd., the offshore-drilling company implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; Southern Co., a utility that relies on coal and natural gas for 80% of its generating capacity; and Valero Energy Corp., a major gasoline refiner.

As demand for do-gooder investing increases, particularly among women and millennials, fund managers are retooling their lineups to include funds that appeal to a wider audience. These loosely defined strategies offer a feel-good tilt while still preserving broad market exposure, which muddies the difference between responsible funds and their plain-vanilla peers.

The lack of industrywide definitions makes reliable statistics hard to come by. The Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates that assets pegged to environmental, social and governance strategies, or ESG, ballooned to a record $22.9 trillion at the start of 2016, making up 26% of professionally managed money world-wide.

Yet many asset managers disclose few details about how they use ESG criteria, according to a report from the alliance's U.S. organization. Some analysts include solar- and wind-energy funds. Others don't. Some funds adhere to "biblical" values that critics call homophobic. Some funds, like the State Street ETF, own stock in companies that are blacklisted by competitors.

"It's a very slippery space," said Elisabeth Kashner, head of ETFs for FactSet, a data and analytics firm. "There's no consensus on what's ultimately good or bad, nor is there consensus on how to measure it."

Last August, State Street changed the name to clarify the fund's strategy of avoiding firms with coal, gas and oil reserves such as Exxon Mobil Corp. It is now called the SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF.

"There is no ironclad, crystal-clear, broadly consensual, industry definition of how to invest, or not invest, in fossil fuels," said Chris McKnett, head of ESG investments at State Street, who said the change was made for the sake of "precision and clarity."

ESG investing traces its modern roots to the antiapartheid divestiture campaign of the 1980s, which prodded companies to withdraw from South Africa to protest the country's institutionalized racial segregation. After apartheid was dismantled, ethical investing focused on boycotting heavy polluters and human-rights violators.

As concerns about climate change increased, investors began looking for ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their portfolios without sacrificing diversification and performance. ESG became an increasingly popular solution. Instead of using market value to determine how much to allocate each company, like most traditional indexes, the strategies weight their investments based on how a company performs on ESG criteria. Some funds go a step further, using financial criteria like revenue or dividends combined with ESG scores.

Since the start of 2016, the ETF industry has launched 26 new ESG funds, according to FactSet and XTF. Firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., State Street and OppenheimerFunds, have also published research touting the performance-enhancing benefits of ESG screening.

Some fund managers believe that ESG screening can weed out companies with simmering scandals, said Sharon French, head of beta solutions for OppenheimerFunds. She cited MSCI's July 2013 ESG downgrade of Volkswagen AG due to corporate-governance problems, more than two years before the Environmental Protection Agency announced its investigation into emissions cheating.

Such strategies preserve diversification, but can make for strange bedfellows. For example, the Columbia Sustainable Global Equity Income ETF includes Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum Corp. among its top 20 investments; and, at one point, the single largest holding of Oppenheimer's Global ESG Revenue ETF was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a company excluded from other ESG strategies because of its history of labor problems, though that may change as the company improves its ESG performance.

The fund liquidated its Wal-Mart stake in February after MSCI noted "significant concerns" related to labor unions and an ongoing bribery case against its Mexican subsidiary, Oppenheimer's Ms. French said.

"Companies are the most powerful entities in the world, and they can do harm or they can do good," said Mike Jantzi, chief executive of Sustainalytics, a company that provides ESG analysis to fund managers. "But good and bad with nothing in between wasn't useful."

UJET Wants to Shorten Customer Support Calls; The company has raised more than $20 million from investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers

Contacting customer support often means leaving a business's app and picking up a phone.

For UJET Inc., which has been quietly building software to keep customer support inside apps, that is an opportunity. The company wants to eliminate unnecessary time on the phone by providing call center agents with more information about the customers.

San Francisco-based UJET said on Thursday that it has raised more than $20 million in venture funding. Its second institutional round, led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, closed last week. Other investors include DCM Ventures, Resolute Ventures and Relay Ventures.

UJET Chief Executive Anand Janefalkar said many company's apps have so much information about a customer. He said if a customer is using an airline app and needs to rebook a flight, the agent should already know what the customer's original flight was.

"It's a disservice to lose all of that data and not send it over to the agents," he said.

The startup's technology allows customers to access simple menus within a company's app. They can select "order issues" or "billing," rather than talking to robots or repeating their issues. Then they are connected to the appropriate agent by phone, email, chat or video call. UJET also offers the option to schedule a call.

In the call center, agents are able to ask the customers to verify themselves by using TouchID on their phones. They can also request photos or videos from the customer that would help resolve the problem. Agents can also access information about a customer's account.

UJET is entering a crowded arena of venture-backed startups taking on customer support. One of the leaders is Talkdesk Inc., which has raised more than $20 million and offers a cloud-based call center. Several other companies provide analytics and workflow management to call centers.

Kleiner Perkins General Partner Ted Schlein has joined the company's board.

Silicon Valley aims to engineer a universal basic income solution

An overly simplistic, technocratic solution to a problem that may never arise? Or an instance of the tech industry acting to head off the adverse effects its innovations may have on society?

Silicon Valley has taken the concept of "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Universal_basic_income" (UBI) to heart. While the idea of using tax revenues to hand a guaranteed cash stipend to every adult   regardless of wealth or income   is not new, tech entrepreneurs and investors have become its most ardent backers.

After all, if technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence are to render many types of work obsolete, then a new universal safety net will be needed.

But even strong proponents like Sam Altman, head of start-up incubator Y Combinator and backer of an early UBI pilot programme, concede that it will strike some as strange to see wealthy start-up investors funding experiments in social engineering.

 Totally understand the criticism,  he said when challenged on the topic at an event in San Francisco in April. But he added:  I think it is strange not to be thinking about these issues. 

In some ways, it is not surprising that the tech industry has taken to UBI. The concept has a lot in common with other big ideas that have taken root in Silicon Valley. It is an imaginative answer to a perceived problem, which makes it just the thing for a group of people who often talk of how they will  change the world : there are no half-measures.

It also meets the Silicon Valley need to challenge received wisdom and turn some old assumptions on their head. And it conjures up an ideal future   a society whose ills have been resolved by a sweeping, bold response   that appeals to an engineering mindset, but which is liable to strike others as simplistic.

UBI is an idea that many tech leaders first encountered in science fiction, says Kathryn Myronuk, a former research director at Singularity University, a Silicon Valley think-tank that aims to inspire corporate executives to address humanity s challenges.  UBI has been around for decades in science fiction, and science fiction is one of the empowering forces for Silicon Valley.  Even Star Trek, she says, which inspired entrepreneurs such as Mr Altman, has something like UBI.

If some industry leaders were preconditioned to see UBI as a solution, they may also be in a better position than most to see a looming need for it. Tech entrepreneurs tend to be over-optimistic when judging how quickly new technologies will be adopted, says Ms Myronuk. But they also believe mass uptake of AI and greater automation is inevitable. Anticipating the effects now could prevent a later backlash.

Lawrence Quill, a political-science professor at San Jose State University, offers a less self-serving explanation. He puts the interest in UBI down to the stirrings of a stronger social conscience in an industry that once found it easier to distance itself from the effects of its technology.

In the current tech boom, he adds, the centre of gravity in innovation has shifted from Silicon Valley, a collection of suburbs to the south of San Francisco, to the city itself, where homelessness abounds. Engineers may feel compelled to address the social problems on their own doorsteps.  It s a less ideologically motivated stance and one that, instead, sees social and political issues as technical ones. It is a classic  technocratic  stance but from a corporate perspective,  says Mr Quill.

Even if there is no strong ideology behind the widespread interest in UBI   and the Valley s libertarianism is often overstated   the local political culture has something to do with it. The idea sits well with a worldview that reveres individual empowerment. According to this attitude,  a basic income transforms the working poor into entrepreneurs in the making,  says Mr Quill.

Entrepreneurs who support the idea are also at pains to stress that it will do nothing to limit the huge wealth that is accruing in the winner-takes-all tech world. Mr Altman, for instance, points out that UBI is designed to create a floor, not a ceiling.  The tech version of basic income will probably increase inequality,  says Mr Quill.

Silicon Valley has one other trait to contribute to the debate over UBI: the analytical methods, collection of data and rapid repetition of ideas needed to introduce such a system are the hallmarks of the local approach to innovation. And it seems that the Valley s most visible social project is already being tested by using just these metrics.

This year, Y Combinator began an experiment under Silicon Valley s nose, handing up to $2,000 a month to 100 people in a pilot scheme in neighbouring Oakland, and Mr Altman says the company plans to expand this to 1,000.

Meanwhile the private foundation of "http://uk.businessinsider.com/ebay-founder-basic-income-experiment-2017-2" earlier this year contributed to GiveDirectly, which gives cash to 26,000 Kenyans. The donations are part of an experiment to discover how such payments will benefit middle-income and developing societies at risk of being unable to provide wealth-creating manufacturing jobs because of globalisation.

 The debate has taken off quickly, with advocates and detractors posing political and philosophical arguments,  "https://www.omidyar.com/blog/why-we-invested-givedirectly" officials wrote.  However, while the discussion has generated a lot of heat, it hasn t produced very much light.

Entrepreneurs have taken universal basic income to heart. By Richard Waters

An overly simplistic, technocratic solution to a problem that may never arise? Or an instance of the tech industry acting to head off the adverse effects its innovations may have on society?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the U.S. dollar and government-bond yields edged higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates unchanged.

Major indexes pared early losses after the Fed's announcement, which some investors and analysts said signaled the central bank is looking past recent signs of tepid economic growth and holding course toward raising interest rates in June.

"This is showing the Fed is dismissing the weak data; it hasn't altered any of their plans," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. "And if the Fed is confident about the economic outlook, why shouldn't we be?"

The Dow industrials rose 8.01 points, or less than 0.1%, to 20957.90. The S&P 500 slipped 3.04 points, or 0.1%, to 2388.13, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 22.82 points, or 0.4%, to 6072.55.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.309%, from 2.296% Tuesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, rose 0.5% to 90.11.

Materials shares in the S&P 500 fell 1%, weighed down by a decline in copper prices that came as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/metals-copper-falls-as-inventories-rise-1493826434"combined with fears about slowing demand from China. Copper for May delivery fell 3.5% to $2.5330 a pound in the biggest one-day percentage decline since September 2015.

Freeport-McMoRan lost 70 cents, or 5.5%, to $12.02. DuPont fell 94 cents, or 1.2%, to 79, among the biggest percentage declines in the Dow industrials.

A decline in Apple shares also dragged on major indexes after the iPhone maker late Tuesday reported an increase in profit but "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-continues-its-comeback-campaign-but-iphone-worries-persist-1493757017"

Apple trimmed early declines Wednesday and closed down 45 cents, or 0.3%, at 147.06. Shares of the index heavyweight had soared to records in recent sessions and the tech sector has been the best performer in the S&P 500 in 2017, rising 16%.

"There's quite a lot of optimism built into tech; it was slightly less positive than people were hoping for," said John Stopford, head of multiasset income at Investec Asset Management.

Akamai Technologies fell 9.70, or 16%, to 52.80, after the cloud-services company Tuesday gave a negative outlook for the second quarter.

Mondelez International rose 1.29, or 2.9%, to 45.03, after the company said it continued to improve profitability through cost-cutting, while Delphi Automotive added 8.56, or 11%, to 87.01, after the company unveiled a plan to spin off its powertrain-systems segment.

The Fed's signals came as the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday said economic activity across the U.S. service sector "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-service-sector-activity-accelerated-in-april-1493821123" A gauge of private-sector hiring came in"https://www.wsj.com/articles/adp-reports-177-000-rise-in-private-payrolls-1493816052", according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing and Moody's Analytics, two days ahead of the monthly jobs report.

The Stoxx Europe 600 fell less than 0.1%, pulled down by a 2.5% drop in the basic-resources sector. The index's auto sector dropped 1% following downbeat U.S. auto-sales figures on Tuesday.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1% amid declines in shares of mining companies. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.3%. Markets in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.

Dollar Remains Stronger After Fed Decision; As expected, central bank keeps its benchmark interest rate unchanged

The U.S. dollar extended gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it remains on track to raise interest rates this year despite recent weak economic data.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, rose 0.5% after being up 0.2% before the Fed announcement. The dollar rose 0.6% against the Japanese yen, 0.4% against the euro and 0.3% against the Mexican peso.

The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-holds-rates-steady-sees-recent-economic-slowdown-as-temporary-1493834533" as expected at the close of its latest meeting. The central bank said in a statement that slow growth earlier this year was "likely to be transitory," while pointing to continued strength in the labor market and firmer spending from businesses.

Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Crdit Agricole, said the statement indicates the Fed remains on track to raise rates two more times this year, possibly as soon as next month.

"The statement will not stand in the way of the dollar strengthening," said Mr. Serebriakov. "The Fed had to acknowledge the weakness in data, but it was keen to offset that by saying growth slowdown is likely to be transitory."

Fed-funds futures, used by investors to bet on the U.S. interest-rate outlook, show that investors see a 71% chance that the Fed raises rates at its next meeting in June, according to CME Group data.

Higher rates typically support the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.

Data out Wednesday showed private-sector hiring slowed in April.

ADP Reports 177,000 Rise in Private Payrolls; Private U.S. employers continued to hire solidly in April but growth slowed, survey finds

Private U.S. employers continued to hire solidly in April, but the growth slowed from recent months as the economy returns to full employment.

Firms across the country added 177,000 workers to their ranks last month, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected an increase of 175,000.

"Despite a dip in job creation, the growth is more than strong enough to accommodate the growing population as the labor market nears full employment," said Ahu Yildirmaz vice president of the ADP Research Institute.

Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics said job growth slowed primarily due to a pullback in construction and retail jobs.

March's jobs gain, initially reported at 263,000, was cut slightly to 255,000. The ADP report is based on private payroll data in addition to lagged behind government data.

Banking & Finance: Trump Starts Bank-Regulation Shake-Up

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's expected move to replace the comptroller of the currency signals a change in direction at the bank regulator that could ripple through the financial markets, from private-equity buyouts to financial technology -- and even municipal securities.

Comptroller Thomas Curry, who people familiar with the matter say could be replaced as soon as this week, is a career regulator appointed by President Barack Obama. Mr. Curry used his office to tamp down on what he viewed as overly risky lending practices in the banking industry.

His expected replacement -- Joseph Otting, a former chief executive of OneWest Bank -- would be the first former banker to hold the comptroller's job since the 1990s.

Mr. Otting hasn't spoken much publicly about his regulatory views, but the Trump administration has made increasing bank lending a clear priority. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who worked with Mr. Otting at OneWest, recently told a group of bankers the administration could help them by "changing the tone" at regulatory agencies.

"The tone at the top may change in terms of [giving bankers] the benefit of the doubt in riskier sectors," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

She said she expects the next comptroller to pursue community-bank relief more aggressively. "The focus is going to be shifting to, 'What can we do to get more lending out?'"

Mr. Curry, whose five-year term expired last month, has endorsed regulatory changes to help smaller lenders. But his message has often clashed with what bankers might wish to hear.

In October 2015, he compared risky auto lending to the mortgage securities that helped cause the 2008 financial crisis.

The OCC under his leadership also wrangled with oil-patch bankers about loans to prop up struggling drilling firms.

When the Federal Reserve said it would loosen bank liquidity rules to make them less punitive toward holdings of municipal debt, Mr. Curry declined to go along.

If selected, Mr. Otting would come to the position after having worked in banking since the 1980s. At Union Bank NA in the 1990s, he was an executive in charge of lending to medium-size companies. At U.S. Bancorp., he also helped build a middle-market business in the mid-2000s and later oversaw an expansion of the lender's presence in California.

In 2010, he was hired as chief executive of OneWest., now owned by CIT Group. Mr. Mnuchin was chairman of OneWest at the time, playing a behind-the-scenes role while Mr. Otting handled public-facing jobs such as convincing regulators and community groups that the merger with CIT should go forward.

The comptroller post requires Senate confirmation, and Mr. Trump's nominee can't serve in the job while his nomination is pending. In the meantime, Mr. Trump is expected to tap Keith Noreika as acting comptroller. He is a partner at the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.

The next comptroller won't be able to reverse Mr. Curry's policies immediately. Many banking rules are adopted jointly with the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which are both still led by Obama appointees whose terms expire in early 2018 and late 2017, respectively.

But the comptroller's office is one of the most powerful banking oversight agencies because of something those agencies don't have: a huge fleet of bank examiners that are the primary supervisors of federally chartered banks. As of last year, the OCC employed more than 700 examiners in its large-bank supervision division alone, and it has more examiners on-site at large banks than other regulators.

Mr. Curry empowered those supervisors to question decisions made by bankers, leading a yearslong fight to stop banks from what the OCC perceived as overly risky "leveraged lending" to support private-equity buyouts. Such lending is governed by voluntary regulatory "guidance" documents, which aren't binding on bankers. However, regulators have discretion on how aggressively they want to enforce them.

Management -- Your Executive Career: How Millennial Bosses Can Gain Trust --- For young executives, the challenge is admitting what they don't know and seeking advice from elders

Sometimes, youth is wasted on young executives. Companies such as Ford Motor Co. are recruiting young bosses to jump-start or reinvent businesses. But those leaders often struggle to gain acceptance and trust from skeptical older colleagues.

Caterpillar Inc., American International Group Inc. and SAP SE have tapped executives in their 30s for senior spots since 2016. And in late January, Ford hired 34-year-old Musa Tariq as its first chief brand officer.

Mr. Tariq, who was most recently global marketing and communications director for Apple Inc.'s retail division, is helping the No. 2 U.S. auto maker shake up its 113-year-old business model and shift into new transportation services. Ford chose Mr. Tariq based on his reputation "for challenging convention," says Chief Executive Mark Fields. Being young "was OK, too."

Mr. Tariq is the youngest of his 44 fellow corporate officers. Ford's top ranks previously had been largely populated with lifers who worked their way up, Mr. Fields says. The CEO adds that he has tried to stem possible resentment of the young newcomer by ensuring members of top management interviewed and helped integrate Mr. Tariq.

Demand for young executives is growing, especially in areas like digital commerce and artificial intelligence, executive coaches and recruiters say. As a result, more workers find themselves reporting to younger bosses. Nearly four in 10 U.S. employees worked for someone younger in 2014, up from 31% in 2010, concluded surveys conducted for CareerBuilder, a job site.

A young star's appointment to upper management can be unsettling for older managers whose career trajectories have been less meteoric. Individuals with younger supervisors must demonstrate their relevance in the workplace.

For youthful bosses, leadership specialists say the challenge is admitting what they don't know and humbly seeking advice from their elders.

Young executives struggle to win acceptance from older associates, who expect them to be arrogant and make mistakes, says Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He co-wrote the book, "Managing the Older Worker."

Anyone with a younger boss should say, "I know a lot of stuff and I'd like to be your partner in execution," Mr. Cappelli recommends.

Jessica Bigazzi Foster, head of the executive development global practice for RHR International LLP, a leadership advisory firm, says her employer is getting more assignments to coach young executives, especially those hired from outside a firm.

"We see a lot of organ rejection," she says, and the executives who don't work out typically are less experienced in large corporate settings.

At Ford, Mr. Fields encouraged senior executives to teach Mr. Tariq how to navigate the bureaucracy. Mr. Fields says he meets with Mr. Tariq regularly for informal coaching about issues such as finding key internal allies.

Among his early tips for the new branding chief: Travel the world and "get to know [Ford] people on a personal level." Ford said Mr. Tariq was unavailable for interviews.

Matt Anderson was 35 when he joined Arrow Electronics Inc. as its first chief digital officer in 2014, charged with accelerating the electronics distributor's transformation into digital products and services.

Mr. Anderson says he worked hard to forge a strong bond with Andy King, a then 51-year-old Arrow executive whom the company's CEO respected for his successful command of its biggest unit's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Mr. Anderson proposed that he and Mr. King "work together and help each other succeed."

When Mr. Anderson became the youngest-ever partner of management consultancy Booz & Co. at age 30, older colleagues were resentful, he says. One co-worker privately griped that the new partner "impressed one or two people, but he won't be able to achieve the revenue needed," Mr. Anderson says.

Mr. King, now president of Arrow's global components business, says he has advocated on behalf of Mr. Anderson and his team because the younger man offered a fresh perspective and went out of his way to collaborate.

"Working together, we've found new ways to invest in and grow Arrow's online design and sales capabilities," Mr. King says. At Arrow, he adds, results count more than age.

Salesforce Adds Investment Fund For App Startups

Salesforce.com Inc. is pumping $100 million into its fourth investment fund, aimed at helping startups develop apps that work with its business software services.

Salesforce Ventures, the company's corporate investment arm, launched the new Salesforce Platform Fund on Tuesday to support early-stage companies, with the goal of "building an ecosystem of partners around us," said John Somorjai, executive vice president of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures.

Salesforce is among several tech companies with venture funds that invest in startups for varying reasons. The venture arms of Salesforce, Qualcomm Inc. and Microsoft Corp. tend to focus more on the strategic return to their respective companies. Others, such as Intel Capital and Alphabet Inc.'s GV, are set up like traditional venture-capital funds with the chief goal of delivering financial returns.

More generally, corporate venture capital has gained popularity in recent years as old-line companies have sought to keep up with shifts in technology. Boeing Co., Kellogg Co. and Campbell Soup Co. have all set up venture funds in the past year.

Past Salesforce investments include web-storage company Box Inc., document-sharing startup DocuSign Inc. and communications software maker Twilio Inc., all of which have services that run on Salesforce's cloud-computing platform. The company has invested in more than 200 startups since 2009.

Salesforce focuses on startups that already have customers, Mr. Somorjai said.

The company's investments, made alongside venture-capital firms, have ranged between $250,000 and $10 million. Salesforce takes ownership stakes under 10% and doesn't seek board seats.

The new fund aims to provide a boost to companies fueling Salesforce's growth.

The company recently stepped up efforts to weave artificial intelligence into its services, and that interest will carry over to its investments.

Salesforce Ventures doesn't disclose its financial returns, but a company regulatory filing noted that the fair-market value of its privately held investments as of Jan. 31 was $758.3 million, and that included $232.3 million in unrealized gains.

Finance & Markets: Step Toward Sale of Logicor

Blackstone Group LP has taken new steps to sell its European warehouse business in an initial public offering that could fetch as much as $13 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

The private-equity giant, which began accumulating European logistics properties in 2012 in a company named Logicor, has tapped Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and PJT Partners Inc. to work on the IPO.

The offering of the company, which operates more than 630 properties, could take place as soon as this summer.

Blackstone also has been talking with three different investment groups about possibly selling Logicor to them in a private transaction, people familiar with the matter said. Blackstone prefers this option, which would eliminate the need for an IPO and would allow the firm to sell its shares faster.

Blackstone created Logicor partly on the assumption that online retail would boost demand for warehouses and distribution centers.

That bet appears to be paying off. Last year, a record 12.9 billion euros ($14.1 billion) worth of logistics properties were sold, up from 12 billion euros in 2015, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Blackstone pulled off a similar strategy in the U.S., where it began building a logistics properties company named IndCor Properties in 2010. The firm in late 2014 sold IndCor to GIC, Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, for $8.1 billion.

Briana J. Mullenax was 35 when she advanced to partner from senior manager last May at LBMC PC, an accounting firm in Nashville, Tenn. A senior manager in her 50s subsequently turned chilly, refusing to offer ideas during several meetings led by Ms. Mullenax.

She says her former peer, whom she doesn't supervise, had viewed herself as superior to Ms. Mullenax because of her age and experience.

Amy Lynch, a generational researcher who knows Ms. Mullenax, blames her relative youth for ignoring a baby boomer's concerns "about formality, dignity and privacy."

Ms. Mullenax reluctantly agrees. "My generation tends to be more informal overall in work," she says. That's "sometimes harder for older generations to understand."

Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks on digital services

"https://www.ft.com/search?q=Clydesdale+and+Yorkshire+Banking+Group" is working with Amazon s Alexa as part of efforts to strengthen its technology to fend off rising competition from digitally focused rivals.

The bank is launching a new technology platform that will allow other services to be plugged into its digital app, such as discounts from a customer s favourite coffee shop or retailer.

The new system, part of a 350m two-year digital investment, powers the bank s money management app, called B, unveiled last year.

The launch put CYBG in the race against digital challenger banks that are creating apps designed to give customers more power over how they manage their finances.

Clydesdale, which this year revealed cost-cutting measures including cutting 400 jobs and closing 79 branches, will also be shifting existing customers on to the technology platform to offer them new services, such as budget management tools for small business customers.

Debbie Crosbie, chief operating officer, said:  We have a proud heritage but banks have to be future-proofed and move to this new way of thinking.

 The platform is not just for whizzy stuff at the front end; it s ready to use data for the benefit of customers. 

As part of this shift, CYBG has opened a brightly-coloured flagship branch in London s High Street Kensington that is designed to appear more like an Apple store than a traditional bank.

The branch, replete with iPads and a coffee shop, allows customers to use voice technology to ask questions such as  how much money is in my account  as part of a trial using Amazon s artificial intelligence device Alexa.

CYBG is one of the so-called "https://www.ft.com/search?q=challenger+banks" looking to carve a niche between the biggest UK lenders and the small digital start-ups, such as Atom, Starling and Monzo, which focus on providing money management tools through an app.

Virgin Money is working with Antony Jenkins, the former Barclays chief executive who founded his own fintech company, to create a money management app that will serve as its digital bank.

Challengers such as Virgin Money and Clydesdale argue they are smaller and more nimble than the large incumbents   such as HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group   so are able to launch such digital services more quickly. But they say they have scale and brand traction, giving them an advantage over lesser-known start-ups.

The digital push comes ahead of new regulation in the UK called Open Banking that will free up access to current account customers  data   with their consent   to boost banking competition.

The move to open data long-held by the largest banks in the UK means new banks and financial technology companies can use the information to tailor services to customers.

It will also impact other sectors such as retail, which will be able to use the data to offer customers discounts. Banks can plug in such services into their apps via  application programme interfaces .

Japan's Pension Fund Plows Into Real-Estate Investing; Fund seeks managers to run portfolio; move is part of expansion into alternative assets

Japan's government pension fund, the world's largest with $1.25 trillion in assets, is making its biggest push ever to expand its real-estate portfolio.

The Government Pension Investment Fund in April asked asset managers around the world to submit proposals to run portions of the fund's real-estate investment portfolio. The request was part of a broader move by the fund to expand into so-called alternative assets including infrastructure and private equity.

At the moment, the fund's real-estate holdings are limited to the stock it has purchased in real-estate investment trusts. It is able to invest as much as 5% of its total portfolio in alternative investments, a fund spokeswoman said in an email.

The goal, she said, is to diversify.

"By investing in real estate, which has less correlation with traditional asset classes such as equities and bonds, we expect to reduce the risk of our entire investment portfolio," she said.

Japan is ramping up its real-estate exposure as other big investors are ramping down. Sales volume has slowed in Europe and the U.S. this year after declining in both markets in 2016.

Fundraising by private-equity firms has been weak. In the first quarter of 2017, closed-end, real-estate funds raised $19.9 billion, compared with $26.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016 and $23.2 billion in 2015, according to data firm Preqin.

Japanese investors have had a spotty record with property purchases over the years. In the U.S., they suffered big losses following the recession of the early 1990s with investments in such high-profile assets as Rockefeller Center in New York.

The pension fund spokeswoman declined to comment on the record of earlier investors. As for the timing of the new push, she pointed out that the fund "does not have to invest in real estate unreasonably if we judge it is not the proper timing in terms of market cycle."

The impact from the Japanese fund's planned expansion won't be felt quickly, in part because Japanese law prohibits it from buying property directly, the spokeswoman said.

Initially, the Government Pension Investment fund will concentrate on investing through so-called fund of funds, vehicles that take positions in numerous portfolios.

Later, the Japanese fund plans to invest in single funds "when the regulatory environment becomes more conducive to that and when there is further expansion of our dedicated team," she said.

Government-backed pension funds and sovereign wealth funds have been playing an increasingly important role in the global capital markets, even as overall investment activity has declined. The Government Pension Fund of Norway, Qatar Investment Authority and the Australian Future Fund all have been more active in recent years.

The Japan pension fund isn't the only big player about to step onto the global stage. Many expect Saudi Arabia to get more active as it tries to become less reliant on oil. Because of its vast holdings, Saudi Arabia has the potential to surpass the impact of players like the Qatar Investment Authority and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

"We've been seeing big waves from the region," said Yahya Abdulla, the head of Middle East capital markets for Cushman & Wakefield. If Saudi Arabia ramps up its investment activity, "we'll see huge waves," he said.

Last year, in the U.S. market, foreign investors accounted for more than 14% of the buying volume in dollar terms, a post-crash record, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

Foreign investors partly are motivated by higher yield in a global market where interest rates are low or even negative, as is the case in Japan. "There's a tremendous incentive when bond yields are negative to find investments with a positive sign in front of it," said Jim Sullivan, president of Green Street Advisors' advisory group.

The decision by the Japanese fund to start out with a fund-of-funds strategy is unusual. Most new government-backed market entrants launch into real estate by buying property directly either by themselves or through special accounts set up by private-equity firms.

Still, many major real-estate investment managers are likely to be interested in working with the Japanese fund.

"A group like this will be on everybody's list to approach to see what they're focused on and whether they're a fit," said Michael Stark, co-head of the Park Hill Real Estate Group, a placement service for private-equity funds.

Corrections & Amplifications

Silver Lake Kraftwerk is among the investors in the new funding round for China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co., according to people familiar with the matter. An earlier version of this article didn't provide the full name of the U.S. firm. (May 2)

China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co. said it raised $5.5 billion in a new funding round that will help fuel its global expansion and push into artificial intelligence.

The cash infusion brings the Beijing-based ride-hailing company's valuation to more than $50 billion, making it one of Asia's largest startups, according to people familiar with the matter.

Didi, which counts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. among its investors, was valued at $36 billion in August after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403" with rival Uber Technologies Inc.'s China business following a costly battle for customers.

The new funding round includes investments from Menlo Park, Calif.-based Silver Lake Kraftwerk, Tokyo-based Japanese telecom and tech giant SoftBank Group Corp., Shenzhen-based China Merchants Bank Co. and China's Bank of Communications Co., according to people familiar with the matter.

This funding round makes Didi more valuable than Chinese consumer electronics company Xiaomi Corp., whose valuation was $46 billion after a funding round in December 2014.

As of the fall, Didi said it was handling more than 20 million rides a day. Like other technology companies including Uber and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, it is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-1-billion-didi-investment-revs-up-autonomous-car-push-1463154162" as technology disrupts traditional transportation solutions, opening a research and development lab in Silicon Valley this March.

The lab, which will focus on intelligent driving technologies and AI-based security, expects to double its team of about 50 staff by year's end.

They even had a bear in the air!

Had he but known it, C.W. McCall, in his chart-topping novelty song " Convoy ", foresaw the future of road transport: a time when vehicles would constantly share data with each other, warn of obstacles ahead, and even fly.

The only problem was, back in 1975 - when C.W.'s country classic was topping the charts and inspiring Sam Peckinpah's Oscar-denied film of the same name - the data sharing was between daftly-named citizens band radio users (the Duck), the obstacles were rather obvious closures of a highway intersection (cloverleaf), and the only road user able to fly was a traffic cop with access to a helicopter (Smokey/Bear in the air).

It has taken 42 years for these automotive technologies to develop more fully. But, last week, all were prominently in the news - suggesting data sharing and analytics are finally bringing real change to the motor industry.

In Britain, a consortium won state funding for autonomous driving trials in which a fleet of cars will gather sensor data about hazards and road conditions - and share it with each other to "learn" the safest route to a destination.

Meanwhile, in the US, electric carmaker Tesla robustly defended claims that its "Enhanced Autopilot" software - which warns of obstacles and collision risks - was not being rolled out fast enough.

And not one, but two, flying cars - a prototype from Kitty Hawk and some proto-hype from Uber - took to the air, or at least the airwaves.

But while all these developments make 1970s visions a reality, one of them presages a revolution not envisaged until recently: usage-based car insurance , with "journey level pricing".

For much of the past century, motor insurance has been priced using three main data points: driver age, vehicle type, and points on a licence.

Then affordable telematics - black boxes in cars sending speed, braking and distance data to insurers - made it possible to price risk more accurately . . . especially for younger drivers. The British Insurance Brokers Association said telematics- based motor policies in the UK reached 750,000 last year.

Now, autonomously driven cars able to share their multi-sensor data make it possible for risk to be priced according to the individual roads being used, the time of day, the weather conditions, and the surrounding traffic.

In the UK trial funded last week, Oxford university spin- out Oxbotica is working with phone operator Telefnica and insurer XL Catlin. Oxbotica's chief executive Graeme Smith says data sharing will enable an assessment of the changing risk on any route, whether in midday sunshine, or snowbound heavy traffic at midnight. Richard Jinks , who is leading the project for XL Catlin, believes creating such an "ecosystem of data" - from connected cars of all types and from external sources - will also bring advances in understanding driver behaviour and price. He calls it "the next revolution in motoring ".

Other insurers are working on similar schemes. Dan Freedman , director of motor development at Direct Line, believes GPS and "contextual data" offer a pathway to journey level pricing. For companies, though, the challenge is funding the cost of the data gathering and persuading customers of the benefit. Mr Freedman believes that if insurers let customers choose their routes by risk and price, their interests would be aligned, claims would fall, and margin improvements may be shared.

Total profits from insuring drivers, however, are set to fall. Last year, Autonomous Research calculated that autonomous driving would reduce the percentage of accident claimants from 9 per cent to 2.4 per cent by 2060, cutting global average premiums from $541 to $334.

Other insurance risk factors will also change completely. As Mr Jinks notes: "Will anyone steal a driverless car if it can drive itself back to where it should be?" Probably not. So, from the I-44 into Tulsa, to the A40 into Oxford, there ought to be one less job for a latter-day "Bear in the air".

Why Intel Paid a Premium for a Stake in Cloudera; The price Intel paid for its Cloudera investment reflects the two companies' deep partnership, Cloudera Chief Executive Tom Reilly said

When Intel Corp. agreed to buy a 17% stake in big-data software startup Cloudera Inc. three years ago, it purchased the stock for more than double the share price other investors had paid just two weeks earlier.

After Cloudera's initial public offering on Friday, Intel's $742 million investment is now underwater, valued at roughly $434 million.

It might appear that Intel stumbled badly. But people familiar with Intel's thinking say the chip giant agreed to pay Cloudera's high asking price in March 2014 in part because it would help guard against an acquisition of the startup by another company.

The resulting $4.1 billion valuation compared with $1.8 billion earlier that month when venture investors bought in was bound to scare away prospective buyers. Cloudera's software had gained popularity with companies analyzing oceans of digital information in their corporate servers. Intel believed big-data software was critical to helping it maintain its near-total dominance of the market for data-center servers.

With a board seat and close ties to the company, Intel could ensure its chips worked best with Cloudera's software. Critically, Cloudera agreed to improve the security of its software and add features to make it more appealing to the corporate market where Intel needed to fend off competitors.

Intel declined to comment. Cloudera Chief Executive Tom Reilly said in an interview after the company's IPO that the higher price Intel paid reflected the deeper partnership between the companies. Cloudera wanted to remain independent, and he disputed that Intel was trying to prevent Cloudera from being acquired.

The lofty price Intel paid underscores the pressure it faces to preserve the dominance in its core markets of processors for servers and personal computers. The investment also sheds light on the difference in motivation between investment firms, which aim purely for a financial return, and corporate investors, which often take stakes for strategic reasons.

Back in 2014, Intel wanted to make sure it had a say in the direction of big-data software, according to the people familiar with Intel's thinking. Big-data software was helping drive the use of chips, as companies needed more processing power to mine the vast troves of information flowing through their networks.

Intel deliberated privately for about six months over whether to invest in Cloudera or try to buy it, according to one of these people. Intel decided against trying to acquire the startup for reasons including that to do so might alienate some of its bigger partners such as Oracle Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which also provide data-management software. On the other hand, if Cloudera was owned by another company, it might not be as concerned about making its software work best with Intel chips, according to this person.

In March 2014, Cloudera said that T. Rowe Price, Google Ventures (which is now GV, Alphabet Inc.'s venture-capital arm) and MSD Capital would invest $160 million, paying $14.56 a share at a $1.8 billion valuation.

Intel wanted in, but only if it could take a larger stake and influence development of Cloudera's software, said a person with knowledge of the deal. Cloudera requested Intel pay more than double what those previous investors paid, saying it didn't need funding after its last round, a person with knowledge of the deal said.

Later that month, Intel agreed to buy $371 million in stock from Cloudera and another $371 million in stock from employees and investors Accel Partners and Greylock Partners. In May, when the deal closed, Intel paid $30.92 a share, more than double what the venture investors had paid in the same funding round.

The bet wasn't a big cost for Intel, representing only about 5% of its roughly $14 billion in cash and short-term investments.

But the investment could mean financial pain for Cloudera employees whose restricted stock units were priced at about $26.16 in January 2015, after Intel's investment. Stock options were also issued to employees in March, but at an exercise price of $17.85, above the $15 IPO pricing. The share price rose about 21% to $18.10 on the first day of trading, putting Cloudera's market value at roughly $2.3 billion.

Since Intel's investment, big-data software hasn't lived up to the hype, and analysts say Cloudera's revenue up 57% to $266 million last year hasn't grown as quickly as expected. But the market is still nascent and Intel could still see a financial return on its investment in a few years.

Intel's investment helped secure its influence in the data-center market, which currently accounts for nearly 30% of the chip maker's revenue. About 96% of the servers that shipped last year contained Intel chips, according to market watcher International Data Corp.

Partnerships like the one with Cloudera might also help Intel as it faces increasing competition from IBM, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and companies like Qualcomm Inc. that make server chips based on technology from ARM Holdings PLC. They are all "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-profit-rises-1493326849".

According to the IPO filing, Cloudera is designing its software to work best on Intel processors and architecture as a result of the Intel partnership which gives companies an incentive to use servers with Intel chips if they are running Cloudera's software. Cloudera anticipates making its chips work best on Intel technology in the future as well.

Rocketship.vc Takes Data Science Approach to Venture Capital; The firm's founders previously sold Kosmix to Wal-Mart and helped create Amazon's Mechanical Turk

Venture capitalists are increasingly using advances in data science and machine learning to make investments.

A new Silicon Valley firm, Rocketship.vc, with a $40 million first fund, is using data and analytics to make its early-stage bets.

The firm's founders, Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman, previously co-founded Kosmix, a social search and data startup that was acquired by Wal-Mart in "https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/04/20/wal-marts-kosmix-deal-may-inspire-other-retailers/", and became co-leaders of Wal-Mart Labs. During the dot-com era they founded search startup Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon in 1998, and they later played key roles in developing Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

The two have invested as angels, through their prior fund Cambrian Ventures, and current personal fund Milliways Ventures. They were early angel investors in Facebook, getting in at the "https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/02/01/the-untold-story-of-two-early-facebook-investors/#4e607bb155b4" Series A, and invested in Lyft's Series A, AppNexus, Snapdeal and Aster Data.

But instead of continuing in the traditional venture mold, they're using data science to invest. "We try to model the entire venture problem as a data science problem which we know very well," Mr. Harinarayan said. "We build models and screens to try to identify breakouts."

Rocketship has 15 million global companies, 1.1 million websites and 2.7 million apps in its database and uses it to surface hot companies. Signals could be from web traffic, app downloads, investors or other factors.

The firm's software tracks the top apps or sites globally and in the U.S., as well as which are trending now. They look for signals in companies' metrics, avoiding spikes in growth that are driven just by marketing.

"We look at it from the likelihood of: are they going to reach the next stage?" said Sailesh Ramakrishnan, partner at Rocketship along with fourth partner Wang Lam. "We try to predict the next round probability."

"The minute they told me about (the fund) I said, 'I want to be the first one to invest,'" said Ron Conway of SV Angel, who invested personally in Rocketship after investing in their prior fund Cambrian.

But this approach doesn't work for the industry at large, Mr. Conway said. "It's powerful only because Anand and Venky are the ones developing the tools. There are only a few people who really are qualified to be doing this."

Rocketship looks outside the U.S. for lesser-known startups that other firms don't track. It has made 70% of Series A and B investments outside the U.S.

Rocketship has invested in 25 companies across seed, A and B rounds, with 40% in Silicon Valley at the seed but just 20% in Silicon Valley at the A and B stage. Consumer startups are a focus, because tracking signals is easier, but the firm is increasingly tracking enterprise companies.

"In the consumer world, we're seeing a real dispersion of entrepreneurs. Rocketship is capitalizing on insights we may not hear of because they're not in our Bay Area-centric network," said Jeremy Liew, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, which invested in Rocketship's fund after previously investing in Kosmix. "We get to hear about companies in their portfolio that are starting to experience hypergrowth that we might not otherwise hear about."

Investments include EDpuzzle, a Barcelona company helping teachers turn YouTube videos into lessons via voice-over. In early 2015, Rocketship noticed and reached out, just as it was about to close new funding.

Others include Trocafone, a Brazil-based marketplace for used mobile phones in South America, and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qapital-helps-millennials-save-by-triggering-new-behavior-1488803403", a Stockholm-founded personal savings app for millennials.

Even if Rocketship finds hot startups, not all will respond to cold calls, the firm acknowledges. But since the firm has now invested in many geographies, it uses existing regional investments as references. "The better they're doing, the harder it is" to invest, Mr. Rajaraman says. "The point we make is we add some value for them. We're very differentiated as an investor."

Others firms taking a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-firms-deploy-big-data-to-win-deals-1493092860"include Correlation Ventures, which recently raised a $200 million second fund, and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/signalfire-with-talent-focused-data-mining-targets-300m-fund-1474630201", which launched in 2015. Unlike others, Rocketship focuses on early-stage deals. Rocketship will lead seed rounds in the U.S. For international deals, the firm prefers to invest in Series A or B, after startups have some traction.

Whole Foods Faces New Investor Pressure --- Neuberger Berman urges board to review options, including sale or joint venture

Another big investor is calling on Whole Foods Market Inc. to explore a sale.

Mutual-fund manager Neuberger Berman, which owns a 2.7% stake in the organic-grocery chain, sent a letter to the company's board this week urging it to "immediately engage advisers" to review options, including a sale or joint venture.

The letter, which Neuberger provided to The Wall Street Journal, comes a few weeks after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed a nearly 9% stake in Whole Foods and called for a similar review. Neuberger has been in talks with Whole Foods since last year but hasn't previously gone public with its suggestions for the chain, which is adopting strategies used by traditional grocers to boost flagging sales.

Though their interests align, Neuberger and Jana aren't working together to put pressure on Whole Foods, according to people familiar with the matter. They hadn't spoken about their respective ideas to revive the company before Jana disclosed its stake, the people said.

A Whole Foods spokeswoman said the company welcomed shareholder input. "We remain committed to continuing to take actions to drive shareholder value and position Whole Foods Market for the future," she said.

Whole Foods shares have dropped sharply since peaking in 2013. The Austin, Texas, company's sales have fallen over the past 18 months. Same-store sales fell 2.5% during its fiscal year that ended in September 2016.

Shares are up about 22% since Jana launched its campaign earlier this month.

Unlike Jana and other activist investors, Neuberger typically avoids public confrontations with the companies in which it invests. The New York investment adviser manages some $267 billion in client assets.

In an interview, Neuberger portfolio managers Charles Kantor and Marc Regenbaum said Whole Foods has a valuable brand and a dominant prepared-foods business that sets it apart from rivals. Yet they said the company has fallen behind rivals in adopting new retail technology that could help it increase sales and profit margins.

"The competition would give their right arms to have the demographics at Bryant Park," said Mr. Kantor, referring to Whole Foods's new store down the street from Neuberger's offices in Midtown Manhattan. "They would give their right arms for traffic and they would give their right arms to have people who sit there for an hour and have lunch."

After sales began to slow in 2015, Whole Foods executives formulated a nine-point plan to cut costs and focus on its most loyal customers. The company walked away from plans to triple the number of stores in the U.S., announced it would close underperforming locations and slash 1,500 jobs.

It also cut prices on goods, a concession that traditional supermarkets were luring away its customers with cheaper natural and organic products. Whole Foods is adopting the data analytics, centralized purchasing, shelf management and advertising programs that traditional grocery chains have used to draw in customers for years.

Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey said the company's performance should begin to improve in a year, after the longest stretch of same-store sales declines since going public in 1992. It next reports earnings May 10.

Whole Foods already has adopted some of Neuberger's suggestions, including eliminating its dual CEO structure, searching for a new finance chief, naming a new director and hiring retail experts.

In the letter, Neuberger raised concerns about Mr. Mackey remaining the company's sole CEO but didn't go into detail. Mr. Mackey, who co-founded Whole Foods nearly four decades ago, was instrumental in transforming health food from a niche market into a booming retail sector but the business has struggled to regain ground lost to conventional supermarkets in recent years.

Mr. Mackey told the Journal that he and former co-CEO Walter Robb both discussed stepping up to lead the company, but they ultimately decided Mr. Mackey would remain.

"It wasn't what my heart called me to do," Mr. Mackey said about leaving Whole Foods.

The investment manager also wants Whole Foods to add directors with experience in retail operations, technology, finance and real estate.

Jana voiced similar concerns and suggested three potential board nominees. The hedge fund also assembled a group of food and retail experts to advise it on the campaign.

LONDON France's Thales SA on Friday said it is acquiring a U.S. big-data analysis firm amid a wider push by U.S. and European aerospace and defense companies to capitalize on the vast amount of information their sophisticated systems collect.

Thales said it will pay as much as $215 million for San Mateo, Calif.-based Guavus, a 250-person business with more than $30 million in expected 2017 sales.

Boeing Co., the world's largest plane maker by deliveries, last year agreed with Microsoft Corp."https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-shifts-to-microsofts-azure-cloud-platform-1468861541"for commercial aviation. British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC signed a similar agreement with Microsoft.

Thales, which makes items such as satellites, missiles, submarines and rail signaling equipment, has undertaken a string of technology deals."https://www.wsj.com/articles/jetblue-to-sell-livetv-for-400-million-to-thales-1394708884?tesla=y" from JetBlue Airways Corp. to boost its in-flight entertainment portfolio and last year bought an optics business from Switzerland's Ruag Holding AG to augment its satellite activities.

Guavus has some of the biggest U.S. telecommunications companies as its customers, Thales said, and handles about 5,000 terabytes of data a day, roughly the data of 3 million feature films.

Philippe Keryer, Thales executive vice president for strategy, research and technology, said in an interview that the company plans to use Guavus's know-how in analyzing data in real-time across its products.

The ability to rapidly sift through huge volumes of data could help intelligence analysts find key information in spy-satellite photos. The system should also make it easier to spot cybercrime by examining computer logs in real-time, Mr. Keryer said.

Thales set out last year to expand its data analysis capability and evaluated several businesses for potential acquisition or partnerships. It opted for Guavus after running trials in real-world scenarios, Mr. Keryer said.

The acquisition, which is scheduled to close in the third quarter pending regulatory approvals, would also help broaden the French company's overseas footprint. Guavus also has operations in Canada and India.

Verizon Is Taking To Road, Investing In Self-Driving Firm

Verizon Communications Inc. has invested in an autonomous-vehicle tech startup best known for turning a vintage DeLorean into a self-driving car.

The startup, Renovo Auto, said the investment from Verizon's venture arm is part of a new $10 million funding round led by True Ventures.

Founded in 2010, Renovo gained attention five years later when the startup and Stanford University researchers demonstrated a vintage DeLorean driven in tight, smoke-filled circles.

Now the company is seeking to create ubiquitous autonomous-vehicle software similar to an operating system like Microsoft Windows or Google Android that would help car manufacturers, fleet managers and others control their software and data across a groupof shared vehicles.

Verizon, the largest U.S. telecom carrier, sees a place for itself among the oceans of wireless data that could flow from computer-driven cars.

"One of the biggest markets we see as we look at this ecosystem is the [automated mobility on demand] space," said Ed Ruth, a director forVerizonVentures, in an interview from his Palo Alto, Calif., office. "There needs to be a significant amount of orchestration that goes on with the data that's being generated by all of those vehicles."

Intel Corp., which is also exploring how to manage the data, estimates a single self-driving car will generate four terabytes of data in about 90 minutes of driving, the typical amount of time a person spends in a vehicle each day. That is the equivalent of data that 3,000 people might generate on the internet by 2020, according to Intel's forecasts. Today, cars generate little data.

Several car makers and tech companies are far along in developing computer systems -- essentially the artificial intelligence's brain -- that can handle sensing, perception and path-planning required for autonomous travel, said Chris Heiser, Renovo's chief executive.

"Figuring out how to operationalize that and bring it across a fleet of vehicles in a consistent way, that's not something we see others taking a serious look at," he said.

Developers of autonomous cars increasingly believe that robot taxis and delivery vehicles are the likely route to introducing the technology. Waymo LLC, the self-driving tech unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., is preparing to test hundreds of autonomous vans in Phoenix with passengers, and General Motors Co. is said to be preparing to add 300 self-driving cars to its test fleet.

Last year, Verizon acquired fleet-tracking software companies Fleetmatics Group PLC and Telogis Inc. as part of a broader strategy to focus on connected cars.

A Hedge Fund Puts Money on ' Big Data '

Data scientists at Coatue Management LLC spent the past few years digging into new data sets to gain an edge in investing. Now, the firm is betting on data science itself as hedge funds across Wall Street push into "big data" analysis to find trading opportunities.

The hedge fund led a $27 million funding round for a company called Domino Data Lab Inc., a San Francisco startup founded by Bridgewater Associates LP alumni, the companies announced Wed-nesday. Other investors in the round include Bloomberg Beta, Zetta Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital, all three of which invested in earlier rounds.

Coatue, which has $10.5 billion of assets under management, according to a person familiar with the company, is investing in Domino through a new fund dedicated to investments in private companies.

As more hedge funds dig into growing amounts of data available that can give indications on revenues at companies ahead of quarterly announcements and hints at economic growth before government numbers are published, they are hiring more data scientists to do more intensive analysis than hedge funds are used to doing.

For example, a firm could dip into location data collected by a mobile-phone app to find out if more people are visiting Nordstrom Inc. than in previous quarters.

The app likely only collects a small sample of overall visitors to the store, so without proper care a novice could find signals that aren't reliable for investing.

"The biggest challenge for hedge funds getting into these alternative data sets is analyzing the data," said Rado Lipu<scaron>, founder of Neudata Ltd., which helps financial firms find new data sets to drive investments. "It's taken some firms years to get right."

Domino's software allows data scientists to run experiments and analyze data in a collaborative program, which helps analysts at Coatue Management discover new trends and hand them to portfolio managers.

Coatue is betting Domino can beat competitors such as Cloudera Inc. and Ufora Inc.

"Data science and artificial intelligence are the most important trends in technology today," said Thomas Laffont, senior managing director at Coatue.

"But we realized in our own internal work that doing data science is very time consuming," he said.

Financial clients are a big and growing driver of Domino's business, as more investment firms delve into "alternative data," said Nick Elprin, the CEO and co-founder of Domino who previously spent seven years designing technology at Bridgewater -- the largest hedge fund in the world.

Everything from credit-card receipts to satellite images of corn crops are increasingly driving Wall Street investments in a major trend that is still in an early stage, industry observers say.

Board pulls through as Buffett helps defeat Wells rebels; Banks: AGM acrimony

Shareholders vent fury but feared defenestration of four directors averted

The shareholder vote against Wells Fargo directors this week was larger than anything seen at a big US bank during the financial crisis. And without Warren Buffett 's help, the rebellion would have been even bigger.

For four board members, only the support of the investor's Berkshire Hathaway prevented their being removed after the bank's bogus-accounts debacle.

Chairman Stephen Sanger , who received backing from only 56 per cent of votes cast at the fiery annual meeting , was among those saved.

Wells' biggest shareholder used its 10 per cent stake to vote in favour of all 15 directors, even though the share price drop cost the bank its status as the world's most valuable.

Mr Buffett has said Wells was "a great bank that made a terrible mistake" when staff opened hundreds of thousands of fee-generating accounts for customers without their permission, but the annual meeting showed that other shareholders are less forgiving.

"Investors have lost faith in Wells Fargo's board," Scott Stringer, New York City comptroller, said. "This vote demonstrates these directors no longer have a mandate. Investors want change."

Several individual shareholders vented their anger at directors - most of whom were sitting on the board while the illegal sales practices were going on - for failing to spot and prevent misconduct on such a scale, which went as far back as 2002.

One activist, Bruce Marks, was hauled out by security after he insisted directors explain what they knew and when.

Other than the chairman and chief executive, none of the directors spoke at the meeting on the Florida coast. The other board members did not even face the audience.

Yet board members' report on the crisis , published this month, made clear they thought the blame lay elsewhere: executives who had now left Wells, the report said, had misled directors.

Speaking after the vote, Mr Sanger said the board had no immediate plans to replace directors but pledged a longer-term "refresh". Over the next four years, six directors are due to leave as they reach retirement age.

That is far too slow for some.

"There is a serious question as to whether any of the directors who received less than 60 per cent of the vote can stay on," Howell Jackson, a Harvard Law School professor, said.

Prof Jackson described the directors' 110-page exposition as "simultaneously self-serving and silly", saying it "makes many excuses for the board not having done its job. But read with care, the report can and should be understood as a devastating critique of the board's work."

None of the board's long-serving members received more than 80 per cent of the vote. Such votes are usually a formality at US-listed companies.

The rebellion was the biggest at a big US bank since at least 2007, according to ISS Analytics, even though the accounts debacle has cost the bank less in monetary terms than several other post-crisis scandals that have engulfed rivals.

It was bigger than the backlash against JPMorgan Chase in 2013, when three directors failed to gain more than 60 per cent support amid anger at the $6bn London whale trading fiasco.

"It's a stunningly low vote [at Wells], and there's no way to avoid the conclusion that shareholders want the board to be seriously shaken up," Dennis Kelleher, of Better Markets, said.

Mr Sanger argued that shareholders had not singled out particular directors for removal.

Instead, he said, investors wanted to signal displeasure by targeting the heads of various committees.

The account scandal, which erupted in October and cost John Stumpf his job as chief executive, weighs heavily.

New customer account openings are down sharply, while executives still face questions about how the bank can replace its cross-selling model that appeared for so long - from the outside - to have been a success.

Wells' failings also hang over Mr Buffett. He said he planned to address the matter at Berkshire's annual meeting next week.

John Sculley's Marketing Software Startup Zeta Global Lands $140 Million; The former Apple and Pepsi-Cola CEO is betting machine learning  will transform marketing

Zeta Global, a marketing cloud software startup co-founded by legendary marketer John Sculley, has raised $140 million in a new round of private equity funding.

The funding included $115 million in Series F equity and $25 million in debt from GPI Capital and GSO Capital Partners, the credit division of Blackstone. The equity portion valued the company at about $1.3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The founders, former Apple and Pepsi-Cola Chief Executive Mr. Sculley and former Sterling Cellular CEO David Steinberg, initially funded the company themselves, then began raising debt and private equity capital. The company has been self-sustaining from the early days, Mr. Steinberg said. It has raised about $250 million, including the latest round, since its 2007 founding. Management still owns a majority of the company, Mr. Steinberg said.

The company provides cloud-based machine learning-powered customer relationship management software for marketers, competing with software vendors like Adobe and Oracle. Its capital raises have funded a series of acquisitions, including its purchase of eBay Enterprise's customer relationship management division in 2015 and Acxiom's enterprise marketing automation division Acxiom Impact in 2016.

"We've bought 9 companies in 9 years. I think it's highly probable we'll buy a tenth," said Mr. Steinberg, chief executive of the company.

It's shopping at a time ripe for acquisitions. Funding for customer relationship management startups boomed in 2014 and 2015, creating a wave of early-stage companies. Venture capitalists poured a whopping $1.3 billion into U.S. customer relationship management startups across 86 deals in 2015, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

But CRM funding cooled off in 2016, leaving startups looking for their exit. "The market is down, and we're able to take advantage of that and buy a bunch of undervalued assets," said Mr. Steinberg.

Zeta Global is the third company Mr. Sculley and Mr. Steinberg have founded together. They previously co-founded wireless services retailer Wirefly and InPhonic, a seller of mobile phones and services acquired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in 2014.

Mr. Sculley, who worked on early machine learning algorithms as a graduate student, was drawn to found a marketing technology company after he saw machine learning could serve a purpose in the marketing space.

"When I was involved with it (machine learning) in graduate school, we never thought this stuff was going to be practical," Mr. Sculley said. "I think we're going through the biggest change in marketing that I've seen since I left Pepsi and joined Apple."

Bill Royan, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of GPI Capital, will join Zeta's Board of Directors at the close of the deal.

Another Large Investor Calls on Whole Foods to Explore Sale; Mutual-fund manager Neuberger Berman sent a letter to the company's board urging it to review options including a sale or joint venture

Another big investor is calling on Whole Foods Market Inc. to explore a sale.

Mutual-fund manager Neuberger Berman, which owns a 2.7% stake in the organic grocery chain, sent a letter to the company's board this week urging it to "immediately engage advisors" to review options including a sale or joint venture.

The letter, which Neuberger provided to The Wall Street Journal, comes a few weeks after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed a nearly 9% stake in Whole Foods and"https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-investor-jana-partners-takes-nearly-9-stake-in-whole-foods-1491849374". Neuberger has been in talks with Whole Foods since last year but hasn't previously gone public with its suggestions for the chain, which is adopting strategies used by traditional grocer to boost flagging sales.

Though their interests align, Neuberger and Jana aren't working together to put pressure on Whole Foods, according to people familiar with the matter. They hadn't spoken about their respective ideas to revive the company before Jana disclosed its stake, the people said.

A Whole Foods spokeswoman said the company welcomes shareholder input.

"We remain committed to continuing to take actions to drive shareholder value and position Whole Foods Market for the future," she said.

Whole Foods shares have dropped sharply since peaking in 2013. The Austin, Texas, company's sales have fallen over the past 18 months. Same-store sales a key retailer metric fell 2.5% during its fiscal year that ended in September 2016.

Shares are up about 22% since Jana launched its campaign earlier this month.

Unlike Jana and other activist investors, Neuberger typically avoids public confrontations with the companies in which it invests. The New York investment adviser manages some $267 billion in client assets.

In an interview, Neuberger portfolio managers Charles Kantor and Marc Regenbaum said Whole Foods' has a valuable brand and a dominant prepared-foods business that set it apart from its rivals. Yet they said the company has fallen behind rivals in adopting new retail technology that could help it increase sales and profit margins.

"The competition would give their right arms to have the demographics at Bryant Park," said Mr. Kantor, referring to Whole Foods' new store down the street from Neuberger's offices in Midtown Manhattan. "They would give their right arms for traffic and they would give their right arms to have people who sit there for an hour and have lunch."

After sales began to slow in 2015, Whole Foods executives formulated a nine-point plan to cut costs and focus on its most loyal customers. The company walked away from plans to triple the number of stores in the U.S., announced it would close underperforming locations and slash 1,500 jobs.

It also cut prices on goods, a concession that traditional supermarkets were luring away it customers with cheaper natural and organic products. Whole Foods is now adopting the data analytics, centralized purchasing, shelf management and advertising schemes that traditional grocery chains have used to draw in customers for years.

Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey said the company's performance should begin to improve in a year, after the longest stretch of same-store sales declines since going public in 1992. It next reports earnings on May 10.

Whole Foods already has adopted some of Neuberger's suggestions, including eliminating its dual CEO structure, searching for a new finance chief, naming a new director and hiring retail experts.

In the letter, Neuberger raised concerns about Mr. Mackey remaining the company's sole CEO but didn't go into detail. Mr. Mackey, who co-founded Whole Foods nearly four decades ago, was instrumental in transforming health food from a niche market into a booming retail sector but the business has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whole-foods-wanted-to-be-more-than-a-supermarket-and-therein-lies-the-problem-1492012489" lost to conventional supermarkets in recent years.

Mr. Mackey told the Journal that he and former co-CEO Walter Robb both discussed stepping up to lead the company, but they ultimately decided Mr. Mackey would remain.

"It wasn't what my heart called me to do," Mr. Mackey said about leaving Whole Foods.

The investment manager also wants Whole Foods to add directors with experience in retail operations, technology, finance and real estate.

Jana voiced similar concerns and suggested three potential board nominees. The hedge fund also assembled a group of food and retail experts"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-bittman-adds-activist-investor-to-resume-in-whole-foods-campaign-1492112797"

Markets & Finance: Hedge Fund Bets on ' Big Data ' --- Coatue Management leads funding round for data-science startup Domino Data Lab

Data scientists at Coatue Management LLC spent the past few years digging into new data sets to gain an edge in investing. Now, the firm is betting on data science itself as hedge funds across Wall Street push into "big data" analysis to find trading opportunities.

The hedge fund led a $27 million funding round for a company called Domino Data Lab Inc., a San Francisco startup founded by Bridgewater Associates LP alumni, the companies announced Wed-nesday. Other investors in the round include Bloomberg Beta, Zetta Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital, all three of which invested in earlier rounds.

Coatue, which has $10.5 billion of assets under management, according to a person familiar with the company, is investing in Domino through a new fund dedicated to investments in private companies.

As more hedge funds dig into growing amounts of data available that can give indications on revenues at companies ahead of quarterly announcements and hints at economic growth before government numbers are published, they are hiring more data scientists to do more intensive analysis than hedge funds are used to doing.

For example, a firm could dip into location data collected by a mobile-phone app to find out if more people are visiting Nordstrom Inc. than in previous quarters.

Getting the data into the right condition and running statistical analysis on it to find significant changes requires new skills.

The app likely only collects a small sample of overall visitors to the store, so without proper care a novice could find signals that aren't reliable for investing.

"The biggest challenge for hedge funds getting into these alternative data sets is analyzing the data," said Rado Lipus, founder of Neudata Ltd., which helps financial firms find new data sets to drive investments. "It's taken some firms years to get right."

Domino's software allows data scientists to run experiments and analyze data in a collaborative program, which helps analysts at Coatue discover new trends and hand them to portfolio managers to act on.

Coatue is betting Domino can beat competitors such as Cloudera Inc. and Ufora Inc. to be for data science what Microsoft Excel is for financial analysts.

"Data science and artificial intelligence are the most important trends in technology today," said Thomas Laffont, senior managing director at Coatue. "But we realized in our own internal work that doing data science is very time consuming."

Mr. Laffont sees quantitative hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies LLC and D.E. Shaw & Co. as the first wave of using data science to drive profits by finding hidden patterns in the markets.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. followed next, using data to drive ad sales and engagement with their web offerings. The third wave, he said, is the rest of the corporate and financial world using the tool to drive their businesses.

Financial clients are a big and growing driver of Domino's business, as more investment firms delve into "alternative data," said Nick Elprin, the CEO and co-founder of Domino who previously spent seven years designing technology at Bridgewater -- the largest hedge fund in the world. Everything from credit-card receipts to satellite images of corn crops are increasingly driving Wall Street investments in a major trend that is still in an early stage, industry observers say.

"At Bridgewater, I learned that the key to faster quantitative research and data science was to iterate on ideas more quickly," Mr. Elprin said. "Technology can allow for faster experimentation and move ideas from development into production quickly."

The other co-founders of Domino are Christopher Yang, a former Bridgewater software developer, and Matthew Granade, former head of research at Bridgewater.

Wells Fargo record shareholder rebellion does not mark end of woes

The shareholder vote against Wells Fargo directors on Tuesday was larger than anything seen at a big US bank during the financial crisis   but without Warren Buffett s help the rebellion would have been even bigger.

For four board members, only the support of the billionaire investor s Berkshire Hathaway prevented them from being removed from office in the wake of the bank s bogus accounts debacle.

Chairman Stephen Sanger, who received backing from only 56 per cent of total votes cast at the bank sfiery annual meeting, was among those saved by Berkshire.

Wells s biggest shareholder used its 10 per cent stake to vote in favour of all 15 directors, even thoughthe share price drop that followed the revelations about its sales practices cost the bank its status as the world s most valuable.

Mr Buffett has said Wells was  a great bank that made a terrible mistake  when staff opened hundreds of thousands of fee-generating accounts for customers without their permission, but the annual meeting showed other shareholders are less forgiving.

 Investors have lost faith in Wells Fargo s board,  said Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller.  This vote demonstrates that these directors no longer have a mandate. Investors want change. 

Several individual shareholders on Tuesday vented their anger at directors   most of whom were sitting on the board while the illegal sales practices were going on   for failing to spot and prevent misconduct on such a scale, which went as far back as 2002.

One activist, Bruce Marks, was hauled out by security after he insisted directors explain what they knew and when.

Other than the chairman and chief executive, none of the directors spoke at the meeting on the Florida coast. To the chagrin of critics, the other board members did not even face the audience.

Yet board members  report into the crisis, published this month, made clear they think the blame lies elsewhere: executives who have now left Wells, the report said, had misled directors.

Speaking after the vote on Tuesday, Mr Sanger said the board had no immediate plans to replace directors butpledged a longer-term  refresh . Over the next four years, six directors are in any case due to leave as they reach retirement age. That is far too slow for some.

 There is a serious question as to whether any of the directors who received less than 60 per cent of the vote can stay on,  saidHowell Jackson, a professor at Harvard Law School.

He described the directors  110-page exposition of what went wrong as  simultaneously self-serving and silly . In a review of the report, he concluded that it  makes many excuses for the board not having done its job. But read with care, the report can and should be understood as a devastating critique of the board s work. 

None of the board s long-serving board members received more than 80 per cent of the vote. Such votes are usually a formality at US-listed companies and directors typically get support in the high 90s.

The rebellion at Wells was the biggest at a big US bank since at least 2007, according to ISS Analytics, even though the accounts debacle has cost the bank less   in monetary terms at least   than several other post-crisis scandals that have engulfed rivals.

It was bigger than the backlash against JPMorgan Chase in 2013, when three directors failed to gain more than 60 per cent support amid investor anger at the $6bn  London whale  trading fiasco.

 It s a stunningly low vote [at Wells] and there s no way to avoid the conclusion that shareholders want the board to be seriously shaken up,  saidDennis Kelleher of the advocacy group Better Markets.

 This board should be embarrassed that their defence to 15 years of criminal conduct [among employees] is,  We had no idea ,  he said. If they continue on the board it would be confirmation of how incredibly deficient they are. 

Mr Sanger argued that shareholders had not singled out particular directors for removal. Instead, he said, investors wanted to signal displeasure to the board by targeting the heads of its various committees.

The biggest vote was cast against the McDonald s chairman EnriqueHernandez, a Wells director since 2003. He chairs both the finance and risk committees and received only 53 per cent approval.

Federico Pea, Bill Clinton s former transport secretary who chairs the corporate responsibility committee, andCynthia Milligan, a Wells director since 1992 who heads the credit committee, also fought off big votes against them.

The results of the meeting were not all so bad. Tim Sloan, the recently appointed chief executive, received 99 per cent backing and executive pay was endorsed by a similarly high margin. Various shareholder motions got relatively limited traction.

Yet the latest developments show the sham account scandal, which erupted in October and cost former chief executive John Stumpf his job, is still weighing heavily on the bank.

More disturbing details emerged at the three-hour shareholder meeting of the pressure on staff that tempted so many to resort to fraud.  The stress from the work environment made me sick,  said Ruth Landaverde, who worked at Wells for more than a year.  I had constant headaches and even developed an eye tic. 

New customer account openings are still down heavily, partly because of the reputational fallout, while executives still face questions about how the bank can replace its cross-selling  model that appeared for so long   from the outside at least   to have been a success.

Political critics are also staying on the bank s case. Senator Elizabeth Warren this week wrote to standard setters at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to raise concerns about KPMG s role as the bank s auditor. KPMG s reappointment was ratified with 97 per cent shareholder support.

Her colleague senator Sherrod Brown, ranking member of the senate banking committee, said board members  need to bear responsibility   even if shareholders spared them the same measure of accountability as the senior managers and 5,300 front-line employees who lost their jobs .

Wells Fargo s failings meanwhile also hang over Mr Buffett.

He told the Financial Times he plans to address it at Berkshire s own annual shareholder meeting next week, when he fields questions from an audience of some 30,000 investors.

 I expect the question will come up at the meeting,  he said, declining to elaborate on his reasons for backing the board until then.  I don t want to step on my own lines.
