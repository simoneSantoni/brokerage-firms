Richard G. Ketchum, chairman and CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra), visited The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau Tuesday morning, shortly after the brokerage industry's self-regulator announced a $25 million settlement with MetLife Inc. Finra had accused the insurer's MetLife Securities Inc. unit of allegedly misleading customers about retirement-income products. MetLife neither admitted nor denied the findings. Mr. Ketchum spoke extensively about the case. Here's a transcript, edited lightly for grammar and clarity.

WSJ: Give us an overview of the important issues on your plate.

MR. KETCHUM: If I kind of look at the last seven years and what we've tried to do with respect to Finra, sort of coming on the other side of relooking at regulation after the credit crisis &

It is first and foremost trying to rethink the examination and enforcement program to be much more focused on data analytics, much quicker with this   with this strong demand of accountability. MetLife, which we can talk about later, is just one example of our focus with respect to conflicts and supervision in the securities industry, and the continued challenge with respect to the securities industry making decisions often in a very broad-based way with respect to products where there are clear incentives for them to continue to sell without effectively providing the right type of meaningful disclosure, getting it right, and without the right type of training and with respect to the registered persons who are doing it.

You know, time and time again, particularly with respect to complex products which have been a lot of our cases in the last few years, it's not that the initial disclosure doesn't reasonably describe the risks, and it may not   may do a reasonable job with respect to fees, but it's how it's handed from place to place, and what actually gets presented to the customer from the standpoint of really the training and understanding of the advisor, the quality of the supervision over it, and the understanding of the customer.

And you know, MetLife's a perfect example. I do believe it is the   having gone back and looked at this, I do believe this is the highest fine for   certainly it's the highest fine for a variable annuity case from Finra. I can't recall anything from the SEC that comes close with respect to it, outside of sort of collateralized mortgage-type things that tends to be at multiple levels. I think this is about as highest as it gets, as well as a focus on getting money back to customers as well.

WSJ: To just start with the MetLife case, you mentioned data analytics. Is that sort of where this case comes from, or did you hear customer complaints, or?

MR. KETCHUM: This case I feel really proud of but, no, this was done the old-fashioned way. A member of our enforcement team was following up on a MetLife cause exam with respect to one registered person and one customer complaint. And rather than doing what you'd classically do in that situation, which is to discipline the individual and move on   you know, we do   you know, we're barring and suspending over a thousand people a year, and cause exams are kind of one of the things that Finra does as the basic regulator of the financial managers. This person noticed the disclosure didn't seem to make sense and the numbers didn't add up.

This person basically looked at the numbers, escalated it, and that started an exam that resulted in this case, eventually.

WSJ: The numbers for one broker didn't make sense, and then  

MR. KETCHUM: This is numbers   this is the numbers for one registered person with respect to probably not one VA [variable annuity] contract, but with respect to just a variety of flips from the standpoint of variable annuity contracts with affected persons. So that's basically where the case came from.

But data analytics ought to be able to allow us to do that, and see   you know, what you want to do is be able to see early that a firm is becoming very active, whether it be in a complex structured product, a new rollout of an ETF [exchange-traded fund] that is either leveraged or more concentrated, suddenly doing a wide range of switches with respect to variable annuities, or asking the question after something blows up in Puerto Rico or Detroit. You know, who continues to sell this stuff, whether   you know, where is it concentrated with respect to which firms and where the concentrations are. So yeah, I mean, it's great when one individual sees something like this and blows it up. All we need to do is to regularize that so we're able to ask the questions easier.

WSJ: And in the MetLife case, did it   was the impression that there was this really aggressive push to sell the replacement products, or it was more just a very lax environment that didn't adequately train the representatives?

MR. KETCHUM: Well, the numbers we're talking about here, in the tens of thousands, there was clearly a significant push to sell replacement products. Large numbers of them involved what are referred to   you'll see in the release or in the order   GMIBs [guaranteed minimum income benefits], which are essentially modified guarantees. I mean, you guys know VA stuff. And, as you know, guarantees on the other side, in 2009-2010, started to become more limited and less offered with respect to VAs because some of the firms took such hits from the standpoint of the market performance in 2008 and '(0)9. So, you know, these   the replacement products were certainly regularly offered. We didn't   we didn't find anything   to be clear, as you'll see in there, we didn't find anything that suggested improper pressure from the standpoint of offering it. But clearly, a large part of the focus of MetLife in this time was providing replacement products, and a large part of the sale was particularly the guarantee, or the GMIB. And the understanding of the advisers providing those products, you know, the nuance from the standpoint of really understanding the fees and what people were giving up with respect to their existing contracts versus the ones they were passing on, and the understanding of the costs involved in the GMIB or the guarantee, just wasn't there. And the error was occurred   it occurred again and again and again.

WSJ: This is one of the largest fines you've ever levied. What do you   what do we make of that? Is this sort of an area that's just rife with misconduct, or was it just so much more widespread than other cases? Or what do we   what should we make of that?

MR. KETCHUM: I think the answer to that is yes. (Laughter.)

Look, while we've always looked at the breadth and the widespreadness of the conduct and the quality of the supervision around something from this standpoint, we took some steps to provide greater flexibility with respect to the sanction guidelines to clearly allow that to be   to be included from the standpoint of the review. And this is kind of a perfect storm.

Where's our focus right now? Our focus is in situations where there's   where there's meaningful conflicts with respect to fees and where there's   where there's a consistent failure in supervision with respect to clearly providing the information a customer needs to make her decision with respect to them.

As you know, because you're very focused in there from a consumer standpoint, VAs have   you know, I think the general sales practice around VAs and disclosure is much better after the changes we made in our suitability rules over a period of years. But this is a perfect example. The structure was there. The form was there to provide detailed information to the customers with regard to the impact, which is exactly what should occur with respect to switching, because switching is the most   the most likely moment of concern with respect to VAs for all the conflict reviews, as you know. And yet, notwithstanding the structure, notwithstanding the clear form, they again and again did not pay attention to making sure that the information was right and that the advisers truly understood the   both the new contract and the value of the old contract. And that's just not acceptable.

So, yeah, this is   this is exactly the type of case where we're going to demand higher fines here and going forward. And I'm very proud of what the Enforcement Division did.

WSJ: I think you've kind of answered this already, but just to help us put the MetLife case in context, do you see this as a problem   I mean, was this something specific to them, or a kind of problem that you expect to see more frequently if you monitor it right?

MR. KETCHUM: Well, I think   this is a problem we've consistently seen, which is switches in variable annuity contracts have shown up as an area of investor harm for a period of years. It's why we changed our suitability rule to concrete the amount of disclosure that gets provided.

No, we're not   I wouldn't say that we're seeing a significant number of other things of this type of firm-wide nature with respect to switches right now. What we are seeing is the broader question. We continue to see firms have problems managing their supervision with respect to more complex products, whether those are structured products, whether those are the more complex ETFs, or whether it's something like variable annuities.

I mean, I'll kind of look at the other   another major set of cases we brought in 2015. They involved a variety of breakpoint issues, both with respect to UITs [unit investment trusts] and mutual funds. Again, it's not that   you know, it's the type of things that firms ought to have the controls to be able to catch and they're just not consistently catching.

Keywords: This Technology Bubble Is Ready to Burst

Corrections & Amplifications

The Ernest Hemingway line about going bankrupt "gradually, then suddenly," refers to the bankruptcy of one of his characters in "The Sun Also Rises." Tuesday's Keywords column about the tech bubble incorrectly said it referred to the author's own bankruptcy.

(WSJA May 4, 2016)

(END)

When the dot-com bubble burst in early 2000, the fallout for publicly traded stocks was quick and severe. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 37% in the 10 weeks following its peak on March 10, 2000.

For startups, the immediate impact was less dramatic. In the second quarter of 2000, venture capitalists invested $25 billion in startups, down only 5% from the first-quarter peak.

"There was a lot of suspended disbelief between March and June," says Keith Rabois, then a vice president at PayPal Inc. and now a partner at Khosla Ventures.

Mr. Rabois and others think we're now in a similar period of suspension of disbelief. Startup investment has cooled. Valuations are falling.

But Mr. Rabois says many investors and entrepreneurs haven't yet grasped the new reality.

"If that suspended disbelief ends, all hell breaks loose," he says.

The parallels between the two eras aren't perfect. After a seven-month decline, the Nasdaq index has gained 12% since early February.

As of April 18, it was within 5% of its post-2000 high. Initial public offerings have all but disappeared, but venture-capital funds raised a record amount of capital in the first quarter.

Mr. Rabois says the record fundraising actually is a bearish sign. Winter is coming, he says, and venture capitalists know it.

"One of the reasons people are raising all these funds isn't because they want the money, but because they believe their own metrics are inflated at the moment, and they want to get that money before companies in their portfolios start crashing and burning," he said.

Some startups also are employing a similar strategy.

Suhail Doshi, chief executive of app-analytics company Mixpanel Inc., says his company has trimmed spending, including shedding some employees, to weather any downturn. About 90% of the $77 million that Mixpanel has raised is still in the bank, says Mr. Doshi, who says that at its current spending rate, the company wouldn't need additional funds for more than a decade.

Companies such as Mixpanel may prove to be the exception. Many startups are at risk of being stranded as funding dries up.

At least 145 private companies have won valuations exceeding $1 billion. As venture investments flowed freely in recent years, executives at many of those companies spent wildly, to outgrow rivals, bolster recruiting or for other reasons. Now, they are left with a difficult choice: cut costs drastically to become self-sustaining, or seek additional capital on ever-more-onerous terms.

Venture capitalist Bill Gurley of Benchmark described this phenomenon at length in a recent blog post, in which he alleged that "dirty term sheets" allow some companies to continue raising money at higher valuations by promising bigger payoffs to new investors at the expense of older investors. That ultimately could render worthless shares held by employees and even some founders.

As some of these companies with high burn rates run into trouble, Mr. Rabois predicts a "catastrophic shift downward," not just for one-time highfliers but across startup investing. That is because venture-capital firms are more interdependent than many people realize.

Investors who have been burned at one company will be more reluctant to support high valuations elsewhere. As word spreads through the venture community, other investors will turn cautious as well.

Venture investing is like any other market, torn between greed and fear. "Without a doubt, the fear cycle is what we're living through right now," says Yatin Mundkur, a venture capitalist at Artiman Ventures, in Palo Alto, Calif.

Cracks are emerging at some companies. Messaging app TangoMe Inc., mobile-gaming company Kabam Inc. and the parent company of wearable-device maker Jawbone, all valued at $1 billion or more, have laid off employees in the past few months. Another sign of pressure: Nine of the 88 U.S. companies valued at $1 billion or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, have changed CEOs in the past several months.

The list includes health-benefits broker Zenefits Inc., last valued at $4.5 billion, where founder and CEO Parker Conrad resigned in February after coming under fire for inadequate compliance procedures.

The biggest elephant in the room is Uber Technologies Inc., valued at $62.5 billion. The company claims it is profitable by some measures in North America, but it is spending huge amounts of money to capture markets in China and elsewhere.

If the world's most valuable startup must curtail its ambitions, it would send shock waves through the system.

Precisely when current weakness in the system forces a correction even sharper than what we've already seen is impossible to predict, because it is about mass psychology as much as it is the financial system. At that point, companies may fail the way Hemingway said he went bankrupt: "gradually, then suddenly."

Maana Raises $26M for Corporate Big-Data  Search

Google Inc. so dominates the market for search that its corporate name became a verb, with the phrase  to google" now listed in the dictionary. But finding the right data inside companies, where information tends to be scattered among islands of applications, generally behind corporate firewalls, has been harder.

Maana Inc., a four-year-old startup, has been working on this problem and raised $26 million. Surprisingly for such a young company, its investors include some of the largest corporate venture arms in the world.

Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures led the Series B round, which includes another new investor, Shell Technology Ventures, as well as several current investors--GE Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, Intel Capital and Frost Data Capital. GE and Chevron are Maana customers.

 We took something that worked so well in another world, the consumer Web [and adapted it]", said founder and Chief Executive Babur Ozden.   &Corporate data silos are like websites, [but] the data they contain is far more challenging. [It is] data from machines and databases and third parties and apps, sensor data, and to have one product be able to read that type of data without anyone telling it what type of data it's reading, we solve that."

Rather than raising money from venture capitalists, Maana has intentionally sought funding from corporate investors because  our product is being designed by solving some of the most challenging problems of the largest companies in the world," he said.

Although Maana's development was at first  haphazard," according to Mr. Ozden, who said the company first went to market in 2013 by going to Fortune 100 companies and knocking on doors, its software is now used in manufacturing, field service, cybersecurity and other areas that require massive data analytics.

Maana's other founder, Chief Technology Officer Donald Thompson, spent 15 years at Microsoft Corp. working on machine learning and search and sometimes advising large corporate customers.

Like Google's search engine, Maana gets smarter the more it is used. The startup has managed to penetrate corporations that use software from some of the world's largest tech vendors--International Business Machines Corp., Oracle Corp., Teradata Inc., SAS Institute Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc.--not by replacing them but by running alongside them so that  everything is [now] built on that structure and not randomly on different data silos. It's a new way of doing analytics at the world's largest corporations," Mr. Ozden said.

GE Ventures Managing Director Michael Dolbec said Maana  sandbagged" him.  It's been underhyped because it didn't follow the standard venture script," he said.  It's a humble company that's succeeded in an industry where hype turns off customers."

Maana has raised a little more than $40 million altogether and is about three years away from profitability, Mr. Ozden said.

As part of the new round, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures Investment Director Dhiraj Malkani and Intel Capital Director Andy Fligel join the board, with Carl Stjernfeldt, the North American Venture Manager at Shell, joining as a board observer. There are two more board seats for independents.

SoFi offers equity to tempt new partners

Online lending group SoFi is offering institutional investors slices of its equity in exchange for commitments to buy loans, as it tries to lock down secure sources of funds.

The new equity round, which could come close to the $1bn SoFi raised in the biggest ever fintech fundraising last year, should give the fast-growing student-loans specialist more firepower to expand into mortgages, personal loans and wealth management products.

But unlike the group s "https://www.sofi.com/press/leading-marketplace-lender-sofi-secures-1-billion-in-series-e-funding-led-by-softbank/" in September, which was populated by venture firms such as SoftBank, SoFi is now targeting insurers, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds in Europe and Asia, trying to tie them in to deeper, more strategic partnerships.

According to Mike Cagney, co-founder and chief executive, the advent of negative interest rates in Japan, in particular, has sparked interest in the high-yielding assets that SoFi is generating at the rate of about $1bn a month.

 We re hoping for meaningful, predictable, take-down of loans through a couple of large partners, while also raising some more equity capital,  he said.

The San Francisco-based group is the biggest and most aggressive of the non-bank financial technology companies that have sprung up in the wake of the crisis, competing with the big brick-and-mortar banks on marketing, underwriting and other areas where traditional lenders have struggled to keep up. Last year, SoFi funded more than $5bn of loans   quadruple its total for 2014.

But like many of the other 400 or so platforms across the US, SoFi is now running up against funding troubles. Online lenders lack the deposits needed to fund loans like a traditional bank, relying instead on institutions, hedge funds or individuals, to buy them. But wobbles in credit markets since the turn of the year have underlined the "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflections-lendit-sergey-vasin-cfa" of securing multiple sources of steady funds   even if it means giving up a share of profits.

 What we have to do is to find alternatives to deposits,  said Mr Cagney, adding that he hoped to close the new equity round by late summer.  It is difficult to be originating $1bn-plus a month if you don t know where those loans go. 

Mr Cagney said the fundraising is likely to place a higher valuation on the group than the last one, which was estimated to value SoFi at about $4bn. Such fundraisings   known as  up-rounds    are becoming less common in fintech, as institutions become choosier about which platforms to back.

 Because of the nature of the funding that is coming through, inherently it will add a lot of value,  he said.  If it s not an up-round, we wouldn t do it. 

More combinations like SoFi s could follow, said analysts, especially for companies such as Avant and OnDeck, which hold loans on their own balance sheets before trying to find them a home with banks and hedge funds.

 Platforms that have secure sources of funding in place will slingshot past their rivals during the next downturn,  said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of PeerIQ, a data and analytics firm.  The name of the game is who can find lowest-cost resilient capital.

Software Investments Skid 26% Lower

Venture capitalists slammed the brakes on taking stakes in software companies in the first quarter.

The software pullback came as investments fell across the broader tech landscape and valuation concerns cast a pall across Silicon Valley.

Software investments declined to $1.84 billion from $2.48 billion in the fourth quarter, a 26% drop. That's also a big slide from the third quarter's $3.4 billion, which was the highest level on record since the dot-com boom, in 2000, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource.

A bellwether of broader information technology investments, software companies make up the biggest component.

A frozen tech IPO market weighed heavily on investors. The first quarter saw not a single new tech issue go public. Shortly after the first quarter, IT company SecureWorks Corp staged an IPO. The company priced below its expected price range and "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/25/secureworks-isnt-exactly-paving-the-way-for-more-tech-ipos/"below its IPO price of $14 per share. Shares closed Friday at $13.33.

Investors and entrepreneurs say there's still too much uncertainty about IPOs, and no one wants to risk being a flop.

Other concerns loom as well, particularly in the political arena. "http://apttus.com" co-founder and Chief Executive Kirk Krappe, whose business software company was valued at $1 billion in September, said he'd expected to take his company public this year.  What we all forgot is that it's an election year," he said.

The uncertainty created by the election coupled with a drop in valuations for software-enabled services companies by as much as 50% means Apttus will likely wait it out for an IPO.

The timing of an IPO is more likely the first half of 2017, he said. Apttus is working with Morgan Stanley and was cautioned by a few bankers.  Any uncertainty is just bad," Mr. Krappe said.

Another issue is price. With the stock market correction in January, valuations of private companies also plunged, according to investment documents and venture capitalists, but entrepreneurs are still adjusting to the idea that their companies are worth less than they were before.

The database company Couchbase Inc., which in March raised a $30 million down round, "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2016/03/15/couchbase-raises-30-million-for-promise-of-nosql-databases-growth/"its valuation gains from 2015 and 2014 and is now back to 2013 levels.

Companies that are over-valued in this climate may be in for a tough slog as the year progresses if they can't raise capital, especially if their valuations top $1 billion. The Wall Street Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club on Friday had 87 U.S. companies valued at $1 billion or more.

Despite software's slide, IT investments edged slightly higher in the first quarter to $3.3 billion, up from $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Still, that was well below its peak of $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.

To be sure, some software startups are having no problem raising capital. "http://www.levyx.com", which makes big data storage and management software, and is less than three years old, raised $5.4 million in Series A funding "http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-data-startup-levyx-raises-5-4m-1461843003"a couple months. The funding closed in mid-March.

 There's still a lot of interest in big data technology like ours," said Chief Operating Officer Luis Morales.  We got an excellent group of investors."

Also, many tech startups loaded up on capital and may just conserve cash to wait it out for better times.

There are those, too, that are quietly growing and running profitably. These companies can weather tough times and will be fine, said Industry Ventures Managing Director Hans Swildens at a WSJ Pro Venture Capital event in San Francisco on April 20.

These companies just don't talk about it, said Mr. Swildens.  Why should they?"

UK COMPANIES
Clydesdale and Yorkshire to launch app that 'learns' users' habits; Banks

Rising demand for mobile banking and pressure to cut costs have prompted Clydesdale and Yorkshire to launch a digital service using artificial intelligence to help customers manage their spending and saving.

The banking group, which recently listed on the London stock market, has developed a digital service called "B" with the aim of giving customers more control over their money.

The new app, which has been designed with input from thousands of customers during the past two years, draws parallels with mobile-based Atom Bank and Tandem. It is part of a shift towards digital-only banks that proactively help customers manage their spending, saving and borrowing.

B prompts customers when they are about to enter their overdraft limits, or gives a "thumbs up" if there is plenty of cash in an account. It enables customers to view all their credit cards, accounts and loans in one place.

Using artificial intelligence , the app also "learns" the more it is used, by analysing spending patterns to tailor the service to individuals. For example, it can flag up to customers how much they have spent in a certain coffee shop during a period of time, or prompt them to top up their savings for, say, a car.

David Duffy, chief executive of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group, told the Financial Times: "Customers have gone digital in every aspect of life, and want banking to go the same way. It's not about having 'cool' technology start-ups, it's about how digital is applied to enhance the customer proposition."

He aims to expand the app for small businesses in the coming months, with a pilot phase under way.

B is being launched as an entirely separate system that is plugged into Clydesdale and Yorkshire's core banking platform, from which it will be able to draw on customer data to drive its artificial intelligence.

The banking group said that the launch reflected a significant shift in customer behaviour, especially among "millennials" seeking digital banking on the go. The new technology will enable customers to open accounts in about 10 minutes and paves the way for instant lending in the future.

Clydesdale and Yorkshire announced earlier this month that it would close 26 "unsustainable" branches across the country to meet "shifting customer needs". The banking group closed 28 branches in 2014, and invested 45m in service improvements.

Mr Duffy, who became chief executive last year, oversaw the banking group's flotation in February , as part of a demerger from parent company National Australia Bank, which was seeking to exit the UK.

Mr Duffy's focus is on steering the bank back to health by drawing a line under past misdemeanours, such as its mis-selling of payment protection insurance and poor lending practices. Part of his plan is to slash costs. According to its full-year results last year, the banking group's cost-income ratio is at 77 per cent.

Companies Pay for Supply Chain Peace of Mind; Outside firms track the potential impact of earthquakes, war and other disasters on global supply chains.

A growing number of firms are looking to help companies with global supply chains prepare for threats that range from financial problems at key suppliers to war and extreme weather.

One of the latest entrants is accounting firm KPMG, which is adding earthquakes, social unrest and other problems to a supply chain intelligence service launched last year. The software, Third Party Intelligence, tracks news sites and other data, cross referenced against the locations and financials of a company's suppliers. Analysts then assess the risk and notify clients when there may be trouble ahead.

The service is one of a growing number of solutions that hope to use external data to help manage risk, a need underscored by the disruption caused by deadly earthquakes in Japan to companies from General Motors Co. to Sony Corp.

 As supply chains are becoming a lot more distributed and more global, companies are working with much smaller suppliers" that are more difficult to track," said Noha Tohamy, vice president of research at Gartner.

Such companies  are wanting to use big data and outside data as part of their understanding of risk exposure, combining information they have of their own supplier performance with what's happening weather-wise, or with political unrest &to come up with mitigation strategies," she said.

But the market is still small, Ms. Tohamy said.  Once a natural disaster happens, you get a lot of interest but then interest fizzles a little after that," she said. Companies want to have more visibility into their supply chains, but it can be difficult to track far-flung suppliers. It is also hard to make a business case for such investments when other projects, like reducing inventory or getting transportation capacity, are competing for the same funds, she added.

Rob Cheng, head of growth at supply chain software company Elementum, said this is a problematic approach to risk management, because most losses come from more mundane risk factors.  The economic impact of day-to-day issues often exceeds the cost of headline-grabbing events like the earthquakes in Japan," he said.

Unexpected quality problems, like shortages, shipping delays or productivity issues, that slow down supply chains, are what cost companies millions of dollars, he said, adding that companies should take  a more holistic approach," and organize their supply chains for the ability to react quickly if one part of a complex, interdependent network of suppliers goes down.

Companies need to anticipate potential problems because they  can no longer afford to react, which is typically what a very good supply chain professional does," said Jorge Blanco, a managing director at KPMG Spectrum, a division of KPMG. For example, a warning signal would be triggered if a supplier experiences decreasing liquidity at the time that a port strike, nearby natural disaster, or socioeconomic tension becomes an issue.

Problems  typically do not occur for one reason typically it's three or four disconnected reasons," he said.

Moody s Results Hurt by Decline in Bond Issuance; Ratings firm slashes its guidance for the year

Moody's Corp. on Friday slashed its guidance for the year and reported profit plummeted 20% as a decline in global bond issuance dented results in the most recent quarter.

Results came in far short of Wall Street views, prompting a selloff of Moody's shares.

On a Friday earnings call, Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel said reduced global bond issuance in the first quarter weighed on Moody's financial performance despite strong results in its analytics division.

Moody's, the world's second-largest ratings firm, is a beneficiary of busy credit markets, because companies and banks pay the firm for its bond grades. But when debt issuance slows, Moody's profit is affected.

 There is still quite a bit of uncertainty for the remainder of this year," Mr. McDaniel said.  We do expect more momentum in the second half of the year than we've had in the first half."

In the first quarter of 2016, the global debt markets slowed to a trickle as oil prices collapsed and fears persisted on the direction of the Chinese economy. Moody's said first-quarter corporate debt issuance fell 20% versus the prior year, with high-yield bonds tumbling 60%. Leveraged loan issuance and complex mortgage deals also saw double-digit drops.

 It was worse than we thought," Moody's Chief Financial Officer Linda Huber said.

Moody's shares slid 4.9% to $94.26 in early Friday afternoon trading.

Investors rely on the bond grades issued by Moody's, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings. Collectively, they issue about 95% of ratings globally, a total virtually unchanged from before the financial crisis.

S&P earlier this week said first-quarter ratings revenue had declined 9%.

For 2016, Moody's now anticipates revenue growth in the low-single-digit percent range, compared with its previous forecast for percentage growth in the mid-single digits. The company expects earnings of $4.55 to $4.65 a share, down from previous guidance for $4.75 to $4.85 a share.

In the most recent quarter, revenue at the Moody's Investors Service unit, the biggest revenue driver, dropped 13% to $525.1 million, hurt 1% by currency.

Meanwhile, in the analytics division, which provides financial data and other types of market intelligence to investors and banks, revenue grew by 11% to $291 million.

In all, the company reported a profit of $184.4 million, or 93 cents a share, down from $230.1 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.

Revenue fell 5.7% to $816.1 million. The company said currency translation shaved 2% off the top line.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters projected earnings of $1.06 a share on revenue of $852 million.

U.S. revenue fell 4% to $480 million, while foreign revenue declined 8% to $336.1 million. Revenue generated outside the U.S. fell to 41% of total revenue, compared with 42% in the quarter last year.

 The weakness in issuance was probably broader and a little more severe than people expected," said Timothy McHugh, an analyst for William Blair, in a note to investors.

World
Thailand Economy Shaky as Exports Contract, Drought Persists; Exports fell 5.6% in the first quarter compared with a year ago

BANGKOK Thailand's economy remains on shaky ground, data from the country's central bank released Friday suggested, with exports continuing to contract in the first quarter of the year while a persistent drought subdued consumer spending. 

The Bank of Thailand said exports, which usually account for around two-thirds of the country's gross domestic product, fell 5.6% in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year. Two other key indexes, private consumption and investment, went up only slightly in the same window, rising 2.0% and 1.6% respectively. 

 Overall spending remained at a low level," the central bank said in a statement.  Meanwhile, spending on non-durable goods slowed down as households grew more cautious, particularly in the case of farming households, whose purchasing power has been adversely affected by the drought." 

And, despite a 1.83% year-over-year increase in the Manufacturing Production Index in March, the index still fell 1.1% in the first quarter. 

The snapshot presents a worrying picture for Thailand's ruling junta, which seized power nearly two years ago. Since it took control, confidence has waned and foreign investment has plummeted, falling 78% in 2015. The El Nio weather pattern, meanwhile, has brought about the worst drought the country has seen in more than 60 years, parching agricultural land and depressing rural spending. 

Some economists also said the impact of stimulus measures introduced late last year, including tax deductions for shopping or travel and incentives for property purchases, has begun to fade. 

 The positive effects from the junta government's stimulus measures at the end of 2015 have dissipated," Moody's Analytics said.  Consumer confidence remains weak because of the uncertainty stemming from the upcoming constitutional referendum." 

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's government is pushing for a new charter which, among other things, would guarantee seats for soldiers in the country's Senate and allow the legislature to select a nonmember, such as an army officer, to serve as prime minister. It will be put to a national referendum on Aug. 7, and authorities recently passed a law that critics say is designed to stifle opposition to the junta's draft. 

The drought is another source of concern. Moody's said Thailand's food production is also expected to  take a particularly large hit in the coming months because of severe drought affecting rice farmers."

Global Investors Steer Clear of U.K. Property Ahead of  Brexit  Vote; Uncertain outcome of vote spurs decline in foreign investor interest

"http://graphics.wsj.com/brexit/"

Global investors are steering clear of U.K. commercial real estate ahead of Britain's referendum over its European Union membership.

U.K. commercial property transaction volumes hit 10.9 billion ($15.9 billion) in the first quarter, down 43% from the corresponding period in 2015, according to data-provider Real Capital Analytics. London deal volumes were down 47% to 5 billion.

In a survey of U.K. property brokers, only 5% reported increased interest from overseas buyers in the last three months, down from 36% in the second quarter of 2015, according to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.

 Some of the slowdown is because investors are pushing the pause button," said Andrew Hawkins, director at broker JLL, while speaking at the London headquarters of RICS on Wednesday.  And why wouldn't you? Nobody wants to get sacked because they made the wrong decision."

The U.K. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/david-cameron-to-announce-eu-referendum-date-after-cabinet-meeting-1455964352". Earlier this month, credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's Corp. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/s-p-warns-over-commercial-property-values-if-u-k-leaves-eu-1460035564" votes to leave the trading bloc in a so-called Brexit.

 If Britain votes to leave the EU, there will inevitably be impact on the U.K. commercial property market, particularly for London offices," said Robert Noel, chief executive of Land Securities PLC, the biggest listed real-estate firm in the U.K.

Mr. Noel said that should businesses stall decision-making during a period of uncertainty, demand for office space would fall, leading to an oversupply and falling rental values.

Uncertainty over the referendum has sparked a decline in foreign investor interest since the referendum became a certainty last May, said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS.

Weakening demand follows"http://www.wsj.com/articles/surge-in-commercial-real-estate-prices-stirs-bubble-worries-1439415930"after the 2008 financial crisis. Low interest rates have made property returns appear attractive compared with other asset classes like bonds.

The U.K., and London in particular, became a focus for foreign investors. Property values, from high-end homes in central London to financial-district office buildings, surged.

Earlier this month, U.K. landlord Grosvenor Group"http://www.wsj.com/articles/global-real-estate-boom-is-coming-to-an-end-u-k-s-grosvenor-warns-1461071783". Volatile stock markets, weak oil prices and political uncertainty around the world have all contributed to weaker demand.

 Uncertainty over the Brexit vote is certainly contributing to the drop in the U.K. market," said Tom Leahy, director of market analysis at RCA.  But it needs to be seen in the broader context of the slowdown across Europe."

European transaction volumes in commercial property fell 40% in the first quarter to  ¬46.7 billion, RCA data show. Sharp falls were recorded in the U.K., Germany and France, the three biggest European markets. France saw the biggest drop, with deal volumes down 59% to  ¬3.5 billion.

It is not just a European phenomenon. Investment volumes in the U.S. were down 20% in the first quarter, while activity also weakened in Australia, Canada, China and Japan, RCA said.

The U.K. hasn't been immune to the global demand downturn, property chiefs said.

 I think the market peaked 18 months ago," said Chris Taylor, chief executive at the property arm of Hermes Investment Management. In addition to a potential Brexit, broader worries about global financial markets have created a  perfect storm," said Mr. Taylor at a U.K. property industry event in London Thursday.

After the June referendum,  I think there will be a realization that the market had gotten a bit ahead of itself," he said.

Some investors are still willing to scoop-up property ahead of the vote.

 I'm not sure it's a buying opportunity, but if there are sellers due to a potential Brexit &we would be looking to acquire assets under those circumstances," said Bill Hughes, head of real assets at the property arm of U.K. asset manager Legal & General, during the Thursday industry event.

In the past week, Mr. Hughes said he had met separately with a Japanese investor and Chinese investor willing to close deals ahead of the referendum.

Still, the looming uncertainty surrounding a potential Brexit have weighed particularly hard on the U.K. market, brokers and analysts said. Brexit concerns were a primary reason behind Chicago-based JLL's first-quarter adjusted operating loss in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, the company said on Wednesday.

The broker reported an adjusted operating loss of $10 million in the region for the first three months of the year, compared with a loss of $3 million in the corresponding period of 2015. Globally, JLL's adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $45 million.

Of barriers preventing investment in U.K. property,  the biggest is the threat of a Brexit," said David Sleath, chief executive at property investment firm SEGRO PLC, at the Thursday event.

With transactions down considerably, the market  won't recover before the referendum," Mr. Sleath said.

 Big-Data  Startup Levyx Raises $5.4M

"http://www.levyx.com" raised $5.4 million for high-powered storage and management software that the company said cuts infrastructure costs for big-data applications.

The Series A round was led by OCA Ventures out of Chicago. Amino Capital (formerly zPark Venture), Sumavision USA Corp. and unnamed tech executives also participated in the round.

Levyx co-founder and Chief Executive Reza Sadri said the startup is bridging the gap between high-performance big-data software and the commodity hardware used in data centers, letting users fully exploit both.

By taking advantage of parallelism in processors, solid state drives and other new technologies, he said,  you can have hundreds of CPU cores in our system. Our software can scale across all of them in a single system, so you can achieve things you'd usually achieve using tens or hundreds of servers."

Levyx also has a data-indexing technology that plugs into Apache Spark, a popular open-source project, although it is not limited to Spark.  What Linux was to the operating system, Spark is becoming to big data," Mr. Sadri said.  It's the universal platform that everyone is moving applications to."

Levyx started in 2013 and has been working with a customer to perfect its technology, which is useful for cybersecurity, financial applications, Internet of Things, data center management and other areas that need to process large amounts of data very quickly, Mr. Sadri said.

He compared big-data processing with the  mainframes of 50 years ago, which were expensive and difficult to manage and accessible to a handful of large companies. Processing large data sets is exactly like that right now."

Although Series A rounds are getting harder to raise, Levyx raised its funding in a little over a quarter because investors are interested in big-data technology, according to Chief Operating Officer Luis Morales.

The funding closed in March and takes total funding in Levyx to $6.4 million. Levyx is based in Palo Alto, Calif., and Irvine, Calif.

Corrections & Amplifications: Luis Morales is chief operating officer of Levyx. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated he is chief marketing officer. (April 28, 2016)

Business Software Maker Anaplan s CEO Steps Down;  It s the right time to bring in a new set of talent to take us to a much higher level,  CFO James Budge says

Pressure is building for the chief executives of Silicon Valley's richly valued technology startups to show profitability or step out of the way.

This week, business software maker Anaplan Inc. became the latest tech startup to make a change at the top, saying the company needed to execute more quickly toward reaching a profit.

Anaplan, which only three months ago "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2016/01/14/anaplan-achieves-1-09-billion-valuation-with-new-round/", said CEO Frederic Laluyaux has left the company after more than three years at the helm. Anaplan, which hasn't named a replacement, said the decision was mutual. Mr. Laluyaux couldn't be reached for comment.

 The board and Fred believe it's the right time to bring in a new set of talent to take us to a much higher level and become a much bigger company," said Chief Financial Officer James Budge.

The move reflects a profound shift in Silicon Valley, where until last fall venture capital flowed freely and startups spent lavishly to grow at any cost and meet steep valuations. But a volatile stock market and concerns about a global economic slump have prompted venture investors including mutual funds, hedge funds and banks to pull back funding, leading companies to rethink their business models.

 Unbridled growth [is no longer] the most valued characteristic," said Ravi Mohan, Anaplan board member and managing director at Shasta Ventures.  Now, it's profitable sustained growth, and we're building a company that reflects that."

Mr. Mohan said Anaplan, which has raised $240 million in funding, has pushed forward its plan to reach profitability to 2017 rather than early 2018.

Valuations for enterprise software companies have fallen this year by more than 40% in some cases, according to venture capitalists and data on recent funding rounds, especially in competitive markets. Anaplan is one of nine companies that have changed CEOs in the past several months among a group of 88 U.S. companies valued at $1 billion or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Health-benefits broker Zenefits, last valued at $4.5 billion, is the highest profile of the bunch, with founder and CEO Parker Conrad resigning in February after coming under fire for inadequate compliance procedures. Zenefits also missed its own financial projections last year, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Other U.S. companies valued at $1 billion that have recently replaced their founder CEOs include business software maker AppDynamics Inc., note-taking app maker Evernote Corp., data analytics company Mu Sigma Inc., messaging startup TangoMe Inc., security company Tanium Inc. and medical-appointment site ZocDoc Inc. Software startup DocuSign Inc. is searching for a new CEO to replace its current one, who isn't a founder.

Boards often wait too long to change CEOs, says Beau Vrolyk, the chief executive of business-software company Engine Yard Inc. who replaced the previous CEO in 2014.  They'll give a CEO the benefit of the doubt and support them and do everything they can to make the person successful," he said.

Mr. Laluyaux wasn't a founder of Anaplan, but was brought in as CEO in September 2012, replacing co-founder Guy Haddleton, who remains on the board.

Anaplan, founded in 2006, has about 600 employees and 70,000 users for a software platform that lets companies pull data from finance, sales, human resources and other business operations. The company has strong competition, both from other venture-backed startups such as Adaptive Insights Inc., and from tech giants International Business Machines Corp., Oracle Corp. and SAP SE.

SnappyData Raises $3.65M for Spark Database

SnappyData Inc. on Wednesday said it raised $3.65 million in Series A funding, a move that comes after the database startup spun out of Pivotal Software Inc., where it was incubated last year.

The database is intended to let users ask questions from large volumes of data and quickly get useful answers, without compromising performance, according to founder Sudhir Menon.

SnappyData runs in-memory and is built on Apache Spark, a popular open-source project that integrates data streaming and machine learning. By combining Spark and SnappyData, users don't have to stitch software together, Mr. Menon said--they get operational analytics, streaming analytics and data modeling on a single platform, along with high availability and other features that are important to corporate customers.

 We're the first ones to build a database on Spark and first to build out the approximate query processing piece to ask questions of a sample," he said.

SnappyData has no customers in production yet but several are trying the software, he said. Popular uses so far include the industrial Internet, a category in which companies such as GE are trying to get data from sensors spread over large distances.

Except for the query processing part, which SnappyData is building with prospective customers, the database is an open-source project and the company is working to build a community of developers around it.  We understand how the game works," Mr. Menon said.

The funding comes from GE Digital, GTD Capital and Pivotal Software, which spun out of EMC Corp. and VMware Inc.

Mr. Menon and his co-founders, Richard Lamb and Jags Ramnayaran, have worked together for 13 years, Mr. Menon said. They developed GemFire, an in-memory data grid that made its way to VMware through the acquisition of Gemstone Systems in 2010.

Citigroup Gets a Rebuke on Pay --- One-third of voting shareholders reject compensation plan; stock down 9% in 2016

About one-third of voting Citigroup Inc. shareholders cast their ballots against the bank's pay plan for top executives Tuesday, a rebuke for a bank that has been focusing on improving relationships with investors.

About 64% of shareholders voted in favor of the bank's pay package, Citigroup said at its annual meeting Tuesday. That was down from last year's vote, when about 84% voted in favor. The average shareholder support of executive pay packages at companies in the S&P 500 was 93% last year, according to ISS Voting Analytics.

Meanwhile, a proposal asking the bank to consider breaking itself apart got just 3.5% support, according to preliminary results. Last year, a similar proposal at Bank of America Corp. gained about 4% of the votes, showing that shareholders of big banks aren't as enthusiastic about breaking them into smaller firms as some politicians and analysts are.

On Citigroup executive pay, two influential firms that advise big shareholders on how to vote, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co., had recommended that shareholders vote no in the "say on pay" proposal, saying the bank needs to more closely link the executives' pay to the bank's performance. Citigroup's stock price is down about 9% this year, compared with a 4% drop in the KBWNasdaq index of bank stocks.

Citigroup has defended its pay packages, including 2015 compensation of $16.5 million for CEO Michael Corbat. At Tuesday's meeting, Chairman Michael O'Neill noted other accomplishments, including passing the Federal Reserve's annual "stress test" last year and boosting earnings to their highest level in nearly a decade.

Mr. O'Neill acknowledged that the share price was "a fly in the ointment" and not where the bank wanted it to be, and said the board would be considering other ways to tweak the pay packages for next year.

Chris Spahr, an analyst at CLSA, said he wasn't satisfied. "It looks like there was some grade inflation" when the bank decided how to pay executives, Mr. Spahr said at the meeting.

Mr. Corbat, the CEO for about 3 1/2 years, has worked on shrinking a bloated company and improving relationships with regulators. A middling stock price this year has continued to be a drag on the bank, though the shares are up 26% since Mr. Corbat took over.

Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said Tuesday's say-on-pay vote is "a real problem."

"They have to ask themselves what is creating this discontent," Mr. Elson said. Citigroup's stock price, he added, is the "glaring issue."

Messrs. Corbat and O'Neill throughout the meeting echoed a familiar theme: that the bank has gotten simpler and smaller. This month, it was the only bank to pass regulators' "living wills" test, which examines whether banks could break themselves apart without requiring taxpayer assistance.

The breakup proposal was submitted by Bartlett Naylor, a financial-policy advocate at the liberal lobbying group Public Citizen. At the meeting, Mr. Naylor questioned whether shareholders were telling the bank how they really felt, and said that Citigroup shareholders still were "clobbered" from the financial crisis.

Mr. O'Neill said the board had considered other alternatives and still believed that the bank's current business model was the best way to boost results in the long term. "It's not that we didn't study it," Mr. O'Neill said. "We studied it very hard."

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. shareholders will vote on a similar proposal next month.

MONEY LAUNDERING

Key U.S. Regulator

Is Leaving Her Role

Jennifer Shasky Calvery is stepping down as director of the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the regulator said.

Ms. Calvery will leave her role at the end of May after more than three years in the job. Over that period, anti-money laundering concerns gained new importance and reshaped the way banks do business, in part because regulators imposed record fines for lapses in controls.

FinCEN has enforcement powers and also serves as the financial intelligence unit of the U.S., collecting millions of secret reports filed by financial institutions on their customers, including reports known as suspicious activity reports, or SARs.

More than 17 million SARS have gone to the government since bank-surveillance laws were expanded shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The latest job moves in the trading industry and coverage of people making the news in the world s financial capitals

LCH promotes Maguire to global rates role

LCH Group, the world s largest swaps clearing house, has promoted Daniel Maguire to an expanded role as global head of its rates and foreign exchange derivatives business.

Mr Maguire will be responsible for the development of listed and OTC rates and FX derivatives at LCH. He has been head of SwapClear, its over-the-counter (OTC) swaps and listed rates business for the last two years, and begins on May 1.

At the same time LCH also appointed Paddy Boyle, a former Goldman Sachs trader, as head of FX product. Mr Boyle was previously global head of G10 FX options at Goldman Sachs and was a member of the Bank of England joint standing committee on FX. He will report to Mr Maguire.

Euronext s CFO Dauge to join fintech start-up

Amaury Dauge is to end his 15-year career at Euronext, the European exchanges operator, after announcing he will step down to join a financial technology company in New York.

He will be replaced by Giorgio Modica, a former banker at BNP Paribas, as Euronext s new chief executive Stphane Boujnah reorganises the company s finance team.

Mr Dauge became chief financial officer in 2014 and oversaw Euronext s demerger from former US parent Intercontinental Exchange, and its flotation on four bourses in Europe. He will leave on June 1st.

Mr Modica was previously a senior corporate financier focusing on the stock exchange sector globally, as well as for the Italian and Spanish markets. He advised NYSE Euronext during its ill-fated attempt to merge with Deutsche Brse, as well as the subsequent IPO once NYSE Euronext was acquired by ICE. He has also worked at HSBC in Milan and MCC/Capitalia in Rome.

The appointments come amid heightened speculation that Euronext may join in potential exchange consolidation and reshuffle of assets. Deutsche Brse is planning to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group but it may face a bid from ICE. The US group has already indicated it would be willing to sell the LSE s Borsa Italiana, according to two people familiar with the talks.

At the same time Mr Boujnah also appointed Camille Beudin, a former mergers and acquisitions banker as Euronext s new head of M&A. She previously worked at Deutsche Bank, RBS and ABN Amro.

 Giorgio has been so close to Euronext for so many years that he was the natural person to lead the finance team at Euronext,  said Mr Boujnah. (Philip Stafford, April 19)

LSE names Ross as chief executive of CurveGlobal

The London Stock Exchange Group has filled the chief executive gap at CurveGlobal, its upcoming new interest rate derivatives joint venture, by naming Andrew Ross of Morgan Stanley to the position.

The position has been unfilled since the LSE said in October it would lead a 30m bank-backed futures trading venue that to compete in European markets dominated by Deutsche Brse and Intercontinental Exchange. Two years in preparation, CurveGlobal represents the biggest push by the LSE into interest rate futures since it was beaten to the 550m sale of Liffe, the London derivatives market, by Euronext in 2002.

At Morgan Stanley, Mr Ross was responsible for agency-listed derivative electronic trading and was also European head of clearing. In his 10-year career at the bank, Mr Ross also been head of CVA trading in London.

 CurveGlobal s success will be built on its ability to bring together a broad swath of exchange-traded derivatives and OTC market participants including the buy and sell sides, prop trading firms and market makers,  said Michael Davie, chairman of CurveGlobal.  It s therefore vital that our chief executive has the depth of experience and relationship with each of these communities, which is why I m delighted that Andrew will be taking on the role. 

The LSE added that France s BNP Paribas had become the seventh shareholder of CurveGlobal on January 29. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citi, JPMorgan and Socit Gnrale are also backing the project, as is the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US exchange that owns the Vix volatility indices. The LSE will contribute 9.5m, and the banks and CBOE a further 20.5m. (Philip Stafford, February 5)

Intercontinental Exchange appoints Jackson as CCO

Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, has reshuffled several senior executive positions following two recent major purchases.

The Atlanta-headquartered group on Tuesday said it had promoted Ben Jackson, president and chief operating officer of ICE Futures US, to the newly-created role of chief commercial officer. He will be responsible for integration planning and execution of ICE s acquisitions and joint ventures.

Last month ICE bought Interactive Data, the OTC markets data business in December for $5.2bn, and Trayport, a European energy trading business, from BGC Partners for $650m in shares.

Lynn Martin, president and chief operating officer of ICE Data Services, has been given responsibility for Interactive Data, the OTC markets data business ICE acquired in December for $5.2bn. The unit she heads includes ICE derivatives and New York Stock Exchange market data, analytics and connectivity services.

Trabue Bland, ICE vice-president of regulation, will replace Mr Jackson as president of ICE Futures US. Mr Bland joined ICE in 2007 from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission where he was counsel to then CFTC chairman Walt Lukken.

The appointments are effective from February 1. All three will report to Jeff Sprecher, ICE group chief executive.  These promotions reflect our commitment to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. And they reflect the contributions of these leaders in serving our customers in an evolving landscape, while establishing the next phase of our company s growth,  said Mr Sprecher. (Philip Stafford, January 26)

Wall retires from chief executive role at Marex Spectron

John Wall is to retire as chief executive of Marex Spectron after more than three years at the helm amid a wide-ranging board reshuffle at the UK commodities broker.

As part of the changes Jeremy Isaacs, the group s non-executive chairman and a key figure in the creation of the Marex business, will also step back from his role.

The duo have played a key role in short life of the company, whose modern incarnation was created when Marex bought by JRJ Group, a private equity firm founded by Mr Isaacs, former head of Lehman s European operations. In the intervening six years it has grown rapidly by hiring staff and purchasing smaller brokers, such as the 94.5m deal for Spectron, in 2011. Mr Wall, who had been at UBS for more than 25 years until his appointment at Marex, was appointed in part to integrate the Marex and Spectron companies.

Mr Wall will be replaced by Ian Lowitt, the group s chief financial officer, who will also move from New York to London to take over. Rob Watts, the group s financial controller, will become Marex s new CFO.

Both appointments take effect from Friday eighth January and remain subject to regulatory approval.

 With the firm in excellent shape, I feel that now is the right time for me to step back. It has been a privilege to lead this great company and I have no doubt that Ian is the right person to take charge of the next stage of its development,  said Mr Wall.

Mr Isaacs will be succeeded by Simon Heale, a non-executive director and former chief executive of the London Metal Exchange. Mr Isaacs will remain on the board. (Philip Stafford, January 6)

Euronext appoints former Tullet executive to lead FICC push

Euronext has appointed Paul Humphrey, a former executive at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon, to help the European exchanges operator develop a strategy to exploit rapidly-changing fixed income, rates and foreign exchange markets.

Mr Humphrey, who had been working at Thomson Reuters as a consultant, will join the group on January 4 with the title of head of fixed income, rates and FX (FICC) strategy. He was previously chief executive of Tullett s electronic broking and information business until the summer of 2014. He has also worked at ABN Amro, Van der Moolen, SLK/Goldman Sachs and ICAP.

His appointment comes as exchanges are increasingly eyeing markets that have long been dominated by banks, which continue to make billions of dollars in profits from it each year. Exchanges have generally been unable to establish a presence in fixed income and forex markets. However a combination of unlawful activity by banks, deep structural change and the emergence of cheap and reliable technology that has allowed alternative ways of trading to emerge. Euronext operates stock, commodity and derivatives markets around the region but has little OTC business.

Mr Humphrey will report to Lee Hodgkinson, head of markets and global sales, who said:  His appointment further strengthens our senior leadership team and his vast experience and strong vision will help us fulfil our growth ambitions in an important sector of the business.  (Philip Stafford, December 2)

Preuss to step away from Eurex role in Deutsche Brse reorganisation

Deutsche Brse, Europe s largest exchanges operator by market capitalisation, has unveiled a wide-ranging internal reorganisation that will see Andreas Preuss step away from his role as head of the Eurex derivatives exchange.

The internal reshaping comes five months after Carsten Kengeter, a former UBS banker, became chief executive with a plan to  put client focus at the heart of its structure.  In a statement on Wednesday, Deutsche Brse said it would create a new  Clients, Products and Core Markets  unit that will encompass its derivatives trading, clearing and settlement business. It will be headed by Jeffrey Tessler, chief executive of its Clearstream settlement business.

Mr Preuss, deputy chief executive and for many years Deutsche Brse s most senior representative at industry events, will become chief executive of a new division, called  IT & Operations, Data & New Asset Classes . It will combine Deutsche Brse  market data unit, the European Energy Exchange and 360T, the foreign exchange trading network the company bought for  ¬725m over the summer.

The group s cash equities business, which includes the well-known Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra, will be separated from the Eurex derivatives business and given its own divisional status  given its high political as well as macroeconomic importance , the company said. The enlarged division, named  Cash Market, Pre-IPO & Growth Financing , will include certificates and warrant businesses and the creation of an  innovative pre-IPO market . It will be led by Hauke Stars, who was previously responsible for Deutsche Brse s market data division and the renewal of its IT infrastructure.

Mr Kengeter will be directly responsible for group strategy, mergers and acquisitions as well as government relations. (Philip Stafford, November 12)

London Stock Exchange Group appoints MSCI s Corrado as COO

London Stock Exchange Group has appointed Chris Corrado from MSCI as both group chief operating officer and chief information officer to replace the departing Antoine Shagoury.

The appointment is effective immediately. Mr Corrado, who has also held a series of senior technology officer roles at banks like Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch and UBS as well as companies outside financial services, including eBay and AT&T Wireless. He began his career at IBM.

Mr Shagoury is returning to his family in the US.  I d like to extend my warmest sincere thanks to Antoine for his leadership and outstanding contribution to the Group over the past five years. Antoine has identified a strong successor and developed a deep bench of talent to carry on his legacy,  said Xavier Rolet, LSE group chief executive.  I m confident the Group will benefit from Chris  deep experience as we continue to diversify our business and grow our global footprint. (Philip Stafford, November 12)

London Stock Exchange Group hires former CME lobbyist Jachym

Jonathan Jachym, the former CME Group senior lobbyist in Washington, has re-emerged in a similar role for the London Stock Exchange Group as the US becomes an increasing focus of business for the UK bourse.

Mr Jachym quit the CME at the start of September after five years in the role to  pursue another opportunity , as he described in a departing email. He was previously executive director, government relations at CME in Washington and held a similar position in Europe for three years.

Mr Jachym will become head of North America regulatory strategy and government relations for the LSE, according to two people familiar with the move.

His appointment comes as North American market assumes a greater role in the overall LSE business. Its $2.7bn purchase of Frank Russell, the index compiler, has meant that around 30 per cent of turnover comes from the US. To underscore that focus, this year the LSE has also licensed a series of Russell and FTSE indices to CME Group, the world s largest futures exchange, to develop equity index futures and options. It agreed a similar deal with another Chicago exchange, CBOE, in February. Mary Schapiro, who was chair of the Securities Exchange Commission between 2009 to 2012, also joined the LSE s board on July 1.

Before that, Mr Jachym was legal and regulatory counsel at the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, a US consumer trade group. (Philip Stafford, October 9)

London Stock Exchange Group names new head of exchange

The London Stock Exchange Group, which runs exchanges, indices and trading platforms, has promoted Nikhil Rathi to be the chief executive of its stock exchange business, the London Stock Exchange.

He will replace Alexander Justham, known through the industry as  JJ , who informed the group of his decision to leave earlier this year after three years in the role, the bourse said in a statement.

Mr Justham previously had responsibility for regulatory strategy, government and public affairs, and UK regulation, and formerly worked at the UK financial regulator, the-then Financial Services Authority.

Xavier Rolet, group chief executive of the LSE, said:

 I would like to warmly extend my personal thanks to JJ for his great contribution and wish him all the best for the future. 

Mr Rathi joined the LSE from the UK Treasury last year to be its chief of staff and director of international development. His roles at the finance department included director of the financial services group representing the UK government s interests in the EU and internationally.

 During the past year, Nikhil has played a key role driving the Group s strategy in key markets, such as China and India as well as supporting key integration projects across the group,  Mr Rolet added. (Philip Stafford, September 29)

Deutsche Brse appoints Gotsman as derivatives adviser

Ilan Gotsman, one of Europe s leading futures trading entrepreneurs, has joined Deutsche Brse as an adviser to develop its Eurex derivatives business.

The 51-year old Israeli was appointed with immediate effect, the German exchange told employees in a memo released on Tuesday.

His role will be to advise Eurex on ways to increase both volume and open interest in contracts, product development, pricing structures and improve its competitive position. He will also advise on identifying other growth opportunities, the company said.

He will report to Carsten Kengeter, the group s new chief executive, and Andreas Preuss, deputy chief executive and head of Eurex.

Mr Gotsman has maintained a low public profile but is well-known within the futures industry. In the early 1990s he helped to set up GH Financials, a London-based clearing broker.

He has also founded Butterfly Investments, which uses proprietary mathematical models to identify mispricing in the exchange-trade interest rate derivative. He also founded Matrix Capital Markets Ltd, a private trading derivative company in 2003. (Philip Stafford, September 8)

Markit names Mutnikas as co-head of Solutions business

Markit, the UK data provider, has appointed a former Bank of England risk adviser to help develop its fast-growing analytics business.

The London-based group named Yaacov Mutnikas as managing director and co-head of its Solutions business, it said in a statement. He reports to Lance Uggla, chief executive, and also joins Markit's executive team. He began last Thursday.

"I want analytics to be growing force in Markit in the future," said Mr Uggla. "When you think about the use of technology, the quantitative use of risk, in margin for collateral and the pieces of the post 2008 world, there is a lot of analysis required. It needs an analytic mind but also someone comfortable with technology and software. Yaacov has the toolbox to make a big difference."

Turnover at the unit rose 17 per cent to $82.3m in the three months to June 30, driven by new business wins and acquisitions. Excluding deals, Markit s Solutions business has recorded organic growth of 13 per cent in the first six months of the year.

Mr Mutnikas has worked as a senior adviser to the Bank of England on systemic risk. He has also worked at Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, and risk management software business Algorithmics, where he was chief technology officer. It was sold to IBM for $387m in 2011.

He is also a keen rower and was part of the team that holds the record for the fastest 8-man crossing of the Atlantic. (Philip Stafford, September 7)

Clock ticking for human stock pickers; Equities

Computers poised to 'mostly replace' people, predicts star manager

A rising fund manager star at T Rowe Price predicts that computers will become increasingly important in asset management, supplanting the industry's traditional backbone of human stock pickers, economists and analysts.

Sudhir Nanda, the head of T Rowe's new dedicated "quantitative management" arm, has for the past decade managed the $761bn asset manager's Diversified Small-Cap Growth Fund , a $2.3bn computer-powered, systematic vehicle that invests in small US companies. The fund has outperformed 93 per cent of its peers over the past five years, returning over 10 per cent annually, according to Bloomberg data.

T Rowe last week launched three new funds to complement Mr Nanda's own vehicle, underscoring the rising interest in more systematic, computer-aided investment approaches even among the big traditional asset managers.

Quantitative hedge funds , which utilise powerful computers, complex mathematical models and automated trading algorithms have been around for several decades, but Mr Nanda predicts that the traditional investment management industry will also become increasingly technology driven.

"Having a human is still important. Humans aren't going to be completely replaced, but they will be mostly replaced," he said.

Asset managers including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Schroders are pouring money into new technology, "big data" and more computer programmers to ensure they do not fall by the wayside in an increasingly ruthless investment world, where many fund managers have over time failed to beat their indices .

While Mr Nanda stressed that T Rowe's own human portfolio managers have a decent record of navigating financial markets, he said it was inevitable that many jobs would naturally be done more efficiently and cheaply by computers.

"Our humans have done pretty well compared to most humans, but we definitely see a trend where machines do more and more in markets," he said. "They're becoming more powerful, so they're going to do more."

In a speech this year Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, considered whether there was an industrial revolution brewing in the finance industry - brought on by huge strides in technology - that might see many jobs replaced by robots.

"Driven by significant advances in technological capabilities, the explosion of big data, more powerful software and low-cost, scalable cloud computing, artificial intelligence appears to finally be at a real tipping point," the Institute of International Finance, a finance industry trade body, wrote in a report last month.

"The use of AI in financial services is likely to have an outsized impact on functions and employment as the automation of advanced roles becomes feasible," the report concluded.

CITIGROUP

A Rebuke for Bank On Pay at the Top

About one-third of voting Citigroup Inc. shareholders cast their ballots against the bank's pay plan for top executives Tuesday, a setback for a bank that has sought to improve relationships with investors.

About 64% of shareholders voted in favor of the bank's pay package, Citigroup said at its annual meeting Tuesday. That was down from last year's vote, when about 84% voted in favor. The average shareholder support, meanwhile, of executive pay packages at companies in the S&P 500 stock index was 93% last year, according to ISS Voting Analytics.

Citigroup's stock price is down about 9% this year, compared with a 4% drop in the KBWNasdaq index of bank stocks.

Citigroup has defended its pay packages, including 2015 compensation of $16.5 million for Chief Executive Michael Corbat. At Tuesday's meeting, Chairman Michael O'Neill noted that the bank passed the Federal Reserve's annual stress test last year and boosted earnings to their highest level in nearly a decade.

Money Laundering

Key U.S. Regulator Is Leaving Her Role

Jennifer Shasky Calvery is stepping down from her role as director of the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the anti-money laundering regulator said.

Ms. Calvery will leave her role at the end of May after more than three years in the job, FinCEN said. Over that period, anti-money laundering concerns gained new importance and reshaped the way banks do business, in part because Fincen and other regulators imposed record fines for lapses in controls.

FinCEN, a small unit of the Treasury, has enforcement powers and also serves as the financial intelligence unit of the U.S., collecting millions of secret reports filed by financial institutions on their customers, including reports known as suspicious activity reports, or SARs.

More than 17 million SARS have gone to the government since bank-surveillance laws were expanded shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Veritas Capital Fund Management LLC, which this year sold Truven Health Analytics Inc. to International Business Machines Corp. for $2.6 billion, agreed to acquire Verisk Analytics Inc.'s health-care services business for $820 million. 

Verisk Health, of Waltham, Mass., provides data services and advanced technologies to help heath-care providers improve the quality of care delivery, contain costs, monitor revenue, and support compliance initiatives. It has more than 350 clients in the U.S. 

The sale price for the unit includes $720 million of cash consideration and a $100 million long-term subordinated promissory note with interest paid in kind, according to a news release. The transaction is expected to close by June 30. 

Verisk Analytics, of Jersey City, N.J., said it is selling the unit to focus on its key markets. The company offers risk assessment services and analysis tools for companies in property and casualty insurance, financial services, energy, government and human resources.

Insurance tech start-up investment surges

Investment in insurance tech start-ups more than tripled last year as a previously sleepy corner of the market begins to draw a surge of interest.

While areas of fintech such as payments have boomed in recent years, so-called insurtech has been slower to develop.

That all changed last year, thanks to some of the world s biggest insurers. Investments in insurtech rose from $800m in 2014 to more than $2.6bn in 2015, according to data from Accenture, the management consultancy. While much of the money has come from traditional sources such as venture capital and private equity groups, established insurance companies have also been big investors.

 We are seeing a growing focus from insurance companies on insurtech,  said John Cusano, head of Accenture s global insurance practice.  They see it as a ripe place to invest their capital and they also see it strategically as a place to invest in distribution, the internet of things, automating the back office, and data and analytics. 

Many of the world s largest insurers, including Aviva, Axa, Allianz, AIG, MetLife and XL Catlin, have established their own in-house venture capital funds and insurers have committed more than $1bn to investments in start-ups in an effort to find new ways to grow and head off potentially disruptive threats.

 There is an increasing view that insurance companies need to transform, become digital and make use of the technology, especially the big players,  said Mr Cusano.

Deals completed last year included the acquisition of LearnVest, a "http://www.ft.com/fastft/2015/09/08/us-robo-advisors-aum-could-reach-5tn-2025-chart/", by Northwestern Mutual of the US and an investment in Limelight Health, a health insurance quote platform by MassMutual Ventures and Axa Strategic Ventures.

The investment boom shows little sign of easing in 2016. According to data from CB Insights, the first quarter of the year was the second largest ever for investment in insurance technology with more than 45 deals raising $650m.

The US took the lion s share of the market in the first quarter with 60 per cent of the deals, including a $400m funding round for Oscar, a US health insurer.

However, interest is also growing quickly elsewhere. At a start-up boot-camp event this month held in a church in London s Spitalfields, 600 people turned up to see 10 insurance technology companies demonstrate their wares. They included Fitsense, which helps health insurance companies to use data from wearable devices, and SPIXII, which helps people to choose the right insurance cover.

Instech London, an initiative to link start-ups, investors and insurers, has been attracting crowds of up to 250 people to its meetings.

 We ve got an awful lot of people coming along from the insurance industry who are trying to understand what is changing,  said Paolo Cuomo, co-founder of the group.

Markets
Regulators to Call for Banks to Have Year s Worth of Liquidity; Rule to be proposed Tuesday would affect large U.S. banks and could crimp industry profits, critics say

WASHINGTON Large U.S. banks would have to prove they have enough cash to withstand severe market turmoil lasting as long as a year under a new rule set to be proposed Tuesday.

The regulation would require about 30 of the country's biggest banks to adjust their balance sheets, cutting the odds they would run into the kind of funding crunch that crippled Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in 2008. But critics say it could also crimp banks' profits by forcing them to devote more resources to low-return investments or higher-cost sources of cash, and could disrupt markets by forcing banks to curb their trading in certain types of instruments or pull back from certain types of loans.

The rule is being crafted by three agencies: the Federal Reserve , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency . The FDIC will release details of the liquidity proposal at its board meeting Tuesday, along with voting on an unrelated postcrisis rule to rein in incentive-compensation on Wall Street. That "http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-curbing-wall-street-pay-announced-1461247600" is being prepared by six regulators and was released last week by one of them, the National Credit Union Administration .

The core element of the new regulation is the  net stable funding ratio," or NSFR. This new requirement would force banks to show they have sufficient  stable funding" to help them endure a year of extreme duress. The idea is to encourage banks to rely more on sources such as core deposits and longer-term funding from small businesses, and less on short-term wholesale funding which includes instruments such as repurchase agreements that help to provide another way for large banks to get cash.

The question banks are waiting to see answered is whether the U.S. version of the NSFR will be similar to one suggested by global regulators two years ago or whether U.S. officials will follow their pattern of  gold-plating" international rules by imposing stricter requirements. Banks also fear that regulators won't just give them numerical benchmarks to meet, but issue detailed rules prescribing for them what kinds of transactions are needed to meet those benchmarks.

Critics of the coming rule say they worry that while it might make banks safer, it could undermine the smooth functioning of different parts of the financial system by forcing banks to pull back from sectors where they have traditionally played a major role essentially shifting potential liquidity problems from banks to the broader financial system.

In addition to worries within the industry,  there is significant fear among even global regulators that maybe this is a problematic result in terms of undermining market liquidity," said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner of advisory firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc .

Some industry observers also warn about a  chilling effect" on long-term lending such as aircraft, shipping and project finance, according to a memo by the law firm Shearman & Sterling assessing the possible impact of the new rule. The regulation would effectively raise banks' costs of keeping such longer-term assets on their books to offset more expensive longer-term liabilities, according to the memo.

The one-year stable-funding requirement was completed in 2014 by the Basel Committee , and is one of the remaining pieces for U.S. regulators to complete their version of that global framework. These regulations are designed to make banks less likely to face distress to avert a potential collapse. The Basel proposals aren't binding, but come in the form of recommendations for regulators to carry out in their own economies.

Many of the rules are aimed at forcing banks to maintain more capital on their books to ensure they have a buffer to protect against losses from risks they take. Those have existed for years, though they have been strengthened since the crisis.

A new layer of postcrisis protections is aimed at ensuring banks have sufficient liquidity to protect against a sudden funding crunch, a modern version of a bank run, even if their underlying balance sheets are healthy. As the financial crisis began to unfold in 2007,  Many banks despite meeting the existing capital requirements experienced difficulties because they did not manage their liquidity," according to a "http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d295.pdf", explaining the rationale behind it.

The first such regulation in place, completed by three main American bank regulators in September 2014, is called the  liquidity coverage ratio." That requirement calls on large banks to hold highly liquid assets such as central bank reserves, and government and corporate debt, which can be converted into cash quickly to cover a firm's obligations over a 30-day period.

The new regulation to be proposed Tuesday is aimed at addressing stresses that could emerge in a bank's balance sheet if a financial crisis lasts longer than a month.

The NSFR regulation will apply to roughly 30 U.S. banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets on their balance sheets, excluding client money. But, if past practice is any indication, U.S. policy makers will likely impose a more-stringent rule on the eight largest and most complex banks that hold $250 billion or more in assets, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . and Bank of America Corp ., while applying a more relaxed standard to banks that have more than $50 billion in assets but aren't internationally active.

A spokesman for J.P. Morgan couldn't immediately be reached, while a spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment.

 This process should result in a regulation that reduces the probability of banks coming under short-term funding pressures," Fed governor Daniel Tarullo said in 2014 speech previewing the liquidity rules.  Maintaining more stable funding, such as retail deposits and term funding with maturities of greater than six months, will help avoid the spiral of fire sales of illiquid assets that deplete capital and exacerbate market stress."

Ardian is nearing a final close on its latest secondary fund after raising $10 billion, said people familiar with the matter, but the firm could have raised at much as $13 billion. Ardian has stopped marketing the fund to investors and, as of press time, is wrapping up the legal documentation ahead of a final close. The close comes less than two years after Ardian amassed $9 billion for its sixth secondary program.

VENTURE CAPITAL

500 Startups, Mountain View, Calif.

500 Startups is launching three new funds: a fund focused on investments in India, another on financial-technology startups and one on Vietnam. The firm said its India fund, 500 Kulfi, will also cover Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The fund will be a $25 million fund focusing on early-stage companies, particularly in fintech, education technology, health and wellness, data analytics, content and software as a service for small and midsize businesses. 500 Startups' 500 Fintech fund will focus on what the firm calls  financial services for the rest of us"   those aimed at millennials, minorities, women and emerging markets. With a $25 million target, the fund would back about 100 early-stage companies globally. The firm also said its Vietnam-focused fund, which is targeting $10 million, will typically invest up to $100,000, but as high as $250,000, in 100 to 150 startups.

China's Old Guard Get Tech Assist

BEIJING -- China's domestic technology firms are linking arms with unlikely new partners: struggling state-owned enterprises.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. are among the Internet companies teaming up with and in some cases even taking stakes in state-controlled companies that Beijing is pressing to modernize.

Inefficient state enterprises are an increasing burden on China's slowing economy, and Beijing has encouraged them to learn from the country's technology pioneers -- pushing a new industrial strategy of boosting the country's mammoth manufacturing sector with Web-driven efficiency and other gains. In one tie-up being closely watched as a potential model for collaborations between the state and private sectors, a venture-capital unit of Alibaba is investing about 300 million yuan ($46 million) in the e-commerce arm of Minmetals Development.

The flagship unit of state-owned China Minmetals Corp. is looking to Alibaba's Taobao platform as a model for a fledgling steel-sales site.

Minmetals Development, which lost around 4 billion yuan ($618 million) last year as commodities demand plunged, called the project "an important testing ground for Minmetals to deepen state-owned enterprise reform."

For Alibaba, the deal is a way into a struggling but still hugely important part of the Chinese economy, offering new sales platforms and potential new revenue. The company said it hopes its technology "can empower a wide range of industries and businesses at home and abroad."

The market for upgrading state-owned enterprises' technology is huge, industry forecasts show. Forrester Research projects China's government and businesses could buy $147 billion in tech goods and services this year, up from $124 billion in 2014.

"As digital transformation becomes the new imperative for Chinese organizations, I think we will see more of these SOE-and-tech-company partnerships," said Frank Liu, an analyst at Forrester.

China's tech pioneers, launched in the years after China's market-oriented reforms of the 1980s, unleashed a long-suppressed entrepreneurial spirit.

Companies such as Alibaba and search-engine company Baidu are a contrast with the inherently political state-owned enterprises, guided by government priorities.

But as their profits sag, the state enterprises "need to find other ways to generate new business and new revenue," said Edward Tse, CEO of Chinese consultancy Gao Feng Advisory Co. "The old model doesn't work anymore."

Having seen online marketplaces like Alibaba's reshape how goods are sold in China, they are trying to copy the Internet giant's nimbleness in hopes of similar sales success.

China's biggest oil refiner, China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec, last week launched an e-commerce platform that it dubbed China's "Taobao of industry," after the Alibaba platform. To get the site -- which links oil-and-gas and other suppliers with manufacturers -- up and running, Sinopec enlisted Alibaba's help on cloud-computing functions including big-data analysis and storage.

"Sinopec wants to borrow Alibaba's successful experience in e-commerce," the refiner said.

The companies haven't disclosed financial terms, but Sinopec says it is eager to work more with Alibaba in fields from big-data analysis to information security.

Such partnerships let companies like Alibaba show Beijing they can help it achieve top goals. And state-owned enterprises or even government agencies can serve as labs for testing new technology -- as when the regional Guizhou Traffic Bureau in southwest China used Alibaba's cloud computing to build a transportation-data platform to monitor traffic and check drivers' safety records. "The public-cloud service is still an emerging market in China, so Alibaba Cloud needs a good case study for other potential customers," said Forrester's Mr. Liu.

In November, Baidu announced it would team up with China Citic Bank to launch a bank that could use Baidu's location and behavior data to help evaluate customers' credit profiles and fraud risk, complementing Citic's own traditional risk assessment. Under the name Baixin Bank, it will have a registered capital of 2 billion yuan, with Citic Bank as majority shareholder. A direct-banking license and application are pending. In another case, Nasdaq-listed e-commerce site JD.com took a 12.5% stake in an e-commerce unit of Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. -- controlled by the city's municipal government -- for around 150 million yuan.

According to the annual report of Shanghai Pharmaceuticals, the two are cooperating on a business-to-business platform for retail pharmacies and small and midsize medical institutions. A license approval is still in the works.

Mr. Tse of Gao Feng Advisory called technology companies forces of disruption.

"They are in many cases redesigning business models and how business ought to be done. It affects the full range of other companies, [state-owned enterprises] included."

Microsoft chief clicks into industrial internet; Convergence of the IT and manufacturing sectors sees rush of venture capital as companies vie to be in at the start

When Satya Nadella takes to the stage in Germany on Sunday for his first appearance at Hannover Messe, one of the main events in the manufacturing industry's calendar, it will signal a significant change for Microsoft.

The chief executive of the technology company admits that in past years "I wouldn't have had much to talk about - whereas now I think I have something to say".

He will not be pitching Microsoft's traditional money-earners like Office, Windows and server software, or even its newer cloud computing services. Instead, says Mr Nadella: "We are now talking about the core." This means the data being thrown off by cars, aircraft engines, elevators and other industrial products, supplying the raw material to turn dumb manufactured goods into what he calls "systems of intelligence".

Microsoft's bid to put itself at the centre of the "industrial internet of things " echoes a wider move among software companies. It suggests that the convergence of the IT and industrial worlds may finally be picking up momentum, as companies from two very different worlds fight for the upper hand.

"It's winner-takes-all," says Bill Ruh, chief digital officer at General Electric, which is also racing to stake out its position as a supplier of the foundational software to run the industrial internet . "A cloud-based platform to connect machines and build applications into it and have global scale . . . you're only going to have a few of those."

The data gathered from connected devices will create a new "digital feedback loop" that will make it possible to apply the same data science that has been developed in other fields, says Mr Nadella. This, he adds, will lead to the same "malleability and analytical power and predictive power in industrial equipment that you had in software products for the mobile web".

The result could be better controls, lower costs and new ways of generating revenue by turning hardware sales into service opportunities.

With more of the value in industrial products shifting from hardware to software, it is no surprise that many industrial companies are reconsidering their software strategies. According to GE, the industrial internet as a whole will be a $225bn market in terms of annual revenues by 2020 - dwarfing the expected $170bn for the consumer internet of things, which has attracted more public attention, and bigger even than the enterprise cloud computing market, which is predicted to hit $206bn.

Of the new industrial software market, GE estimates that $100bn will go to a small handful of companies that provide the central platforms for the industrial internet - the software that collects and aggregates data, acts as the foundation for higher-level applications and creates shop windows for developers to reach an audience in the industrial world, much like smartphone app stores.

Until now, few companies have seen the business value in the data they could collect, says Jim Tully, an analyst at the research group Gartner. But he adds that asset-intensive companies such as power utilities, miners and manufacturers are finally starting to wake up to the potential. Rolls-Royce is typical of manufacturers that believe access to different types of data are about to open up new business opportunities. The British aircraft engine maker has been collecting information about the performance of its engines for nearly two decades to help with maintenance.

Now, says Tom Palmer, senior vice-president of services, the company is pulling in other types of data about, for example, the weather. Among the goals is to help optimise flight plans for its airline customers to minimise fuel use, one of their biggest costs.

The spread of new, more flexible cloud technologies has also made it easier and faster for manufacturers to introduce new applications. GE's slow emergence as a software company highlights the problems of the old tech world. Before the cloud, building each application from scratch involved a slow and laborious process, says Mr Ruh, since GE could not call up component services it had already written for other applications.

The US industrial group has been learning from best practice in the cloud computing industry in other ways as well. It has taken to copying consumer internet companies, says Mr Ruh, emulating everything from their datacentre technologies to their sheer speed of operations. "Amazon is one we've learnt from and watched," he says.

With the industrial internet market starting to take shape, a gold rush mentality has taken hold in the software world. Venture capital investment in companies involved in the industrial internet of things jumped 76 per cent last year, to more than $1bn, according to CB Insights, the research firm.

"It's like eight years ago, when [cloud computing] hit," says Isaac Brown, an analyst at Lux Research. "Everyone said, 'Give me some cloud' - but didn't know what it meant."

One surprise has been the large number of start-ups vying to become platform companies rather than application providers - a risky bet given the tendency for platform software markets to consolidate. Entrepreneurs drawn to the market reject the idea that the giant software and manufacturing companies have any inherent advantage. "In most parts of the tech landscape, the entrepreneurial approach is a great formula," says Brad Keywell, a co-founder of deals site Groupon and a backer of Uptake, a two-year-old platform start-up. "Entrepreneurial speed is very important."

But a shake-out seems inevitable. Other new software markets created by the rise of mobile and cloud computing have already concentrated on a very small number of winners, pointing the way to what could happen in the internet of things, says Mr Ruh. He points to smartphone software, where Google and Apple rule, and cloud computing, where Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure have the strongest positions, as evidence that there are only likely to be two or three winners.

GE is hoping to follow in Amazon's footsteps , copying the ecommerce group's approach of opening up the technology developed to support its own businesses for use by other companies. "We didn't take it to market until we'd built it for ourselves," says Mr Ruh.

However, GE has yet to announce it has sold its Predix software platform to any customers that compete with its core manufacturing business, and rivals claim it will be hard for the company to establish itself as a service provider to the wider manufacturing industry. Cloud computing companies, meanwhile, have been moving steadily into the industrial internet. They may lack the deep sectoral experience of a GE, but their general-purpose systems for collecting, managing and analysing data can be adapted for the purpose, says Mr Tully. Amazon announced a push last autumn, while Mr Nadella's appearance in Hannover this weekend caps a series of steps by Microsoft.

It is shaping up to be a complex new world, where software and industrial companies are likely to find themselves allies one moment and rivals the next.

Mr Nadella rejects the suggestion that Microsoft and GE will be head-to-head competitors. But he adds, of the manufacturing companies: "Some of them maybe have broader ecosystem agendas." Even narrow applications, if successful, can provide a springboard that puts companies at the centre of a new emerging market, he says, reflecting the restless evolution of the tech world.

"One person's platform is the other's person's app," he says. "That has played out in consumer internet, and it will play out in the industrial internet."

Forging links

How machinery is being connected to the web

As with most new technologies, it is the consumer uses of the so-called internet of things that have attracted the most attention. But industrial and other business applications are likely to end up being a far bigger market.

The falling price of sensors and the rise of web connectivity have made it easy to connect machinery and other objects to the internet.

Collecting the data thrown off by all the new connected objects should make it possible to monitor them more closely, optimise their performance and foresee problems. It could also support new business ideas, like charging for hardware on a subscription basis depending on how much it is used.

The industrial internet is being assembled out of four different parts, each of which has attracted a wave of investment.

One involves the billions of products and devices that will one day be connected to the internet, with companies like Electric Imp, Particle and Arrayent creating platforms to manage this process, says Isaac Brown at Lux Research.

A second focus is connectivity. Groups such as Jasper Technologies have assembled networks for handling the machine-to-machine communications on which the industrial internet will rely.

The third area of investment is in software platforms that collate data and act as a development platform for applications.Some companies also sell higher-level services like analytics to make sense of all the data being collected.

The final element consists of software applications and services, many created for specific industries.

The Intelligent Investor: Is Your Stockbroker Great or Mediocre?

By Jason Zweig

Most people expect the food in a three-star restaurant to be tastier than one-star grub and a two-thumbs-up movie to be better than a flick that got a solitary upward-pointing thumb. Good luck, however, finding a handy way to rank stockbrokers.

That needs to change, because new research shows the most valuable information about brokers emerges only when you can compare them and their firms industrywide.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees how investments are sold, maintains BrokerCheck, a database and website that provides information on nearly 1.27 million current and former brokers. A study by Finra last fall found that BrokerCheck data could reliably predict which brokers are most likely to harm their clients.

And so could you, if you had open access to all the data Finra collects on BrokerCheck. But, contends a new report, the regulator keeps such a tight hold that the service doesn't tell investors what they need to know.

The vast majority of brokers are hardworking, honest folks who have no customer complaints on their records.

But those who have been active since before 2000, and those whose colleagues have a history of misconduct, are much more likely to generate complaints from customers, according to the new analysis.

Those insights emerge only from analyzing oceans of data on brokers and their firms -- an absurdly impractical task for ordinary investors looking up BrokerCheck records one at a time.

How much should you worry if a broker settled a complaint for $25,000? Are four arbitrations in 27 years a lot or a few? Have 13 out of 14 of the other employees in your broker's office had complaints lodged against them? There isn't a way outsiders with conventional computing power can tell. Nor can investors readily figure out which firms have the most employees with marks on their records.

And that matters -- a lot -- because taking advantage of clients seems to be contagious.

Brokers whose colleagues have spotty track records end up harming investors much more often, the new report says.

An unrelated recent study, which looked at some 150,000 brokers at nearly 1,000 firms, found that in the wake of a merger between firms, the average broker becomes more than a third more likely to incur customer complaints if his or her new brokerage colleagues have a history of misconduct.

Yet another analysis, released last month by economists at the University of Minnesota and the University of Chicago, found that brokers with a history of complaints were snapped up by other firms rather than being driven out of the industry.

So, before hiring a broker, you should know the disciplinary record of his or her colleagues. Even a report from Finra itself last fall drew a similar conclusion.

The latest study was conducted by Securities Litigation & Consulting Group, a research firm in Fairfax, Va. Part of its business is providing expert-witness testimony in arbitration proceedings against brokers and their firms. Still, "my incentives don't change the arithmetic," says SLCG founder Craig McCann, a former economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The study bases its analysis on Finra's own standards for judging whether investors were harmed; it replicates several of the regulator's findings from last fall almost exactly. Finra's chief economist, Jonathan Sokobin, says the SLCG report "essentially validated our results."

SLCG pinged the SEC's website about 10 million times to determine identification numbers, then downloaded data from BrokerCheck on 1.2 million brokers, including nearly 450,000 registered before the year 2000 -- who weren't included in Finra's analysis last year.

Such longer-serving brokers are up to nine times more likely to trigger complaints from investors, SLCG found. That isn't just because somebody is bound to get annoyed at them over the course of a long career. In 2014, for instance, these veterans were only 39% of all brokers but generated 72% of the cases in which investors were harmed.

Finra long has restricted access to the raw data on BrokerCheck on grounds of privacy and the potential for misinterpretation.

But if independent firms could analyze the disclosures, as researchers like Morningstar and Lipper long have done for mutual funds, they could produce evaluations based on the risk factors that matter.

The possibility of making the data more widely available externally is "something that we're pursuing internally," says Robert Colby, Finra's chief legal officer. "We recognize that third parties could potentially provide valuable incremental information to investors, and we are carefully considering this issue."

Finra should do more than consider it. In the age of Big Data, it is time to liberate the BrokerCheck files. Only when information is set free can it turn into insight.

Why Bank Trade Group Looks to Fed for Hires; Transcript: Greg Baer, head of Clearing House Association, on agenda for capital requirements, stress tests, anti-money-laundering compliance, financial technology and other issues

WSJ Pro Financial Regulation sat down recently with Greg Baer, the new president of the Clearing House Association a New York-based trade group of large U.S. banks, including the units of some big foreign banks "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-banks-new-weapon-economists-1461348432" on capital requirements, stress tests, anti-money-laundering compliance, financial technology and other issues.

Here is a transcript of the conversation, edited for clarity:

RYAN TRACY: Thanks for having me. How long have you been in the job now, six months?

GREG BAER: Since October.

MR. TRACY: And you've made some big hires recently, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-banks-new-weapon-economists-1461348432". Tell me about what the thinking was behind bringing those people in and where you see the Clearing House going in terms of where it belongs in the policy conversation and how it's trying to influence that.

MR. BAER: Right. I mean, first, I think it's a tribute to the credibility of the organization I inherited that they were willing to come here, and that the Clearing House is seen as a place where you can do credible, meaningful research. And so, you know, it's a benefit just that they were willing to come here and lend their expertise. But, you know, I think with Bill [Nelson] and Francisco [Covas] both coming out of Fed Monetary Affairs, there's no question they are very serious economists, and very thoughtful ones, and very, I think, respected ones.

And that completely complements, I think, what we're trying to do here, which is to bring more analysis and data to the question of regulation from the industry side. There has been a sea change &postcrisis, where more and more regulation is done by economists in Washington or Basel or Brussels. They do that based on their understanding of markets and economics, and we need to have people who can talk to them about those subjects.

MR. TRACY: What are some of the specific things that you would consider were decisions made in that vein?

MR. BAER: Well, I mean, when you think about the decisions that are really moving the needle for the banks, particularly the larger banks that are our members, I think there's an excessive focus on particular parts of Dodd-Frank when really the elephant in the room is the Basel capital rules, Basel liquidity rules and CCAR [the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, also known as stress tests]. And those, you know, whether you are a regional bank, a foreign bank operating in the United States or a GSIB [globally systemically important bank] &those have major impact on your balance sheet and your profitability. And those are really subjects that I think most policy makers in Washington don't even understand certainly don't understand how they work and may not even understand that they exist.

You know, the potential impact of the "http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d352.htm" that was just completed in Basel, I think most policy makers in Washington don't even know it happened. But, you know its potential impacts on market liquidity and financial stability are significant.

MR. TRACY: What are those?

MR. BAER: Well, I mean, I think there's a growing realization although it's obviously a very complicated and controversial topic that there is a whole lot less market liquidity across a variety of asset classes. And, you know, the causes of that I think are varied. There's no question that one of those causes is capital liquidity regulation. And so as you see declining liquidity you know, you saw this week, I think, that the FSB [Financial Stability Board] now, as a result of that, wants to enhance real regulation of the buy side, asset managers. I would hope that they would have instead thought about whether sell-side regulation may have gone too far in terms of trading liquidity for the system, you know, which has two potential downsides: One, in a crisis, you want liquidity in financial markets; and, two, to the extent that you have corporations trying to issue debt, that debt will issue on better terms of you believe that there's eventually going to be a liquid market for that, and people will pay more for it.

So I think both of those consequences probably haven't gotten well, I think there's been a fair amount of study of current market liquidity and the potential for problems in stress. I think the sort of larger, you know, economic-growth implications of having illiquid capital markets probably haven't been much addressed in the U.S. I think, oddly, they've been more examined in Europe than they have in the U.S.

MR. TRACY: And so, when you one brings up this cost-benefit idea to U.S. regulators, you hear so let me try to sort of summarize their response. I mean, I think, first of all, they say the benefits of preventing another financial crisis are very difficult to measure, and so, you know, if we did a cost-benefit analysis, it wouldn't it would be biased, in a sense, because the benefits would be really hard to quantify. And if you make us do that for every rule, then maybe we don't have a lot of these rules, even though we think they are really important. So, given that you're advocating for more cost-benefit analysis, what's your response to that concern?

MR. BAER: Well, I mean, any cost-benefit analysis has to be done at the margin, so what's the marginal benefit and what's the marginal cost. For example, there's no question that, you know, short-term wholesale funding was a major problem in the crisis and brought down the large investment banks. So the question isn't, "Should we do something to reduce reliance on short-term wholesale funding?" You know, the question is, "The next step we take, is that is its marginal benefit greater than its marginal cost?"

So consider, for example, the regulators are, you know, I think supposed to put out for comment fairly soon the net stable funding ratio, or the NSFR. You know, if that were the only thing being done, well, that would be a very important rule and would have a lot of benefit. But it's coming on the heels of the liquidity coverage ratio and a lot of capital regulation and, you know, the Fed's CLAR [Comprehensive Liquidity Assessment and Review] process and CCAR. And so then you ask yourself what's the marginal benefit of this, and then what's the marginal cost. And I think you can look at that across a whole spectrum of rules. I think the net I mean, the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book is another example where, you know, the potential for that to further drain liquidity on top of Basel you know, CCAR, liquidity rules, declining repo market it's hard to see a large marginal benefit for even higher capital requirements on trading assets, but it's pretty easy to see that there's a marginal cost.

MR. TRACY: And so should the long-term benefits of these be how should those be treated, in other words? If you're by suggesting looking at marginal costs and benefits, are you saying we shouldn't think about those long-term benefits, or what 

MR. BAER: Oh, no, no. I no, no, I think you think absolutely about long term. I mean, part of the long term is and, you know, it's funny; even when I used to serve in the Treasury Department a long time ago, everyone always talked about how the United States benefited from the most liquid capital markets in the world, but you now hear people proposing blithely, you know, further measures that would significantly reduce the liquidity of those markets, which is already significantly reduced. So when people talk about extremely high leverage ratios, you can't have a liquid, you know, government securities repo market, you know, if you have high leverage ratios, because they punish, you know, riskless assets that are necessary to the functioning of those markets.

So this is absolutely about the long-term marginal costs and long-term marginal benefits. And, you know, again, some of that is on the what does the next financial crisis look like long term, and part of it is what is the impact on economic growth medium-long-term.

MR. TRACY: On market liquidity, would you let me just play devil's advocate again. Would you guys acknowledge that there are other things going on that are affecting market liquidity in addition to regulation?

MR. BAER: I would readily acknowledge there are multiple other factors, some potentially larger than regulation, that are going on. You know, clearly, coming out of the crisis, banks, absent regulation, would have much-diminished risk appetite in these areas. They've significantly expanded and fortified the models they use to measure market risks, which has resulted in a diminished risk appetite. You also have, you know, certainly a very odd macro environment, which is having impacts that I think our economists could probably explain better than I could. But I think there's no question that regulation has had a role as well.

I mean and I think the key understanding is that the only thing that regulators and policy makers can control is that regulatory impact. They can't change the banks' risk appetite. They can't, in the short term, change the macroeconomic environment and where interest rates are. So if your concern is we may have overshot a bit and there may not be as much market liquidity as we would like, the only thing you can really change is the regulation.

MR. TRACY: Tell me about the so you mentioned hiring these two gentlemen and kind of more broadly trying to talk to the regulators more with quantitative analysis and economist to economist, or however you want to put it.

MR. BAER: Right.

MR. TRACY: What, broadly, is the goal, though? I mean, so, for example, do you want a lower leverage ratio in 10 or 15 years? I mean, what's the endgame?

MR. BAER: I think there's a big-picture endgame and then there's a sort of more micro-endgame.

I mean, the big-picture endgame, I think there are really two policy imperatives, you know, before you could get smaller-scale improvements in the world. The first is people have to understand the sort of revolutionary changes in law and balance sheet that have occurred postcrisis that really mean that the large banks are now resolvable and not too big to fail. I mean, I think the market is convinced of that, if you look at spreads and even what the rating agencies are saying now, but I don't know that the body politic is convinced of that. So I think we need to continue to be to work to demonstrate how much has changed, both legally and financially, you know, in that area.

The second really is and this is what we were talking about is there needs to be a larger understanding of the costs of regulation as opposed to the benefits. And that is, as I think you noted earlier, very hard work because it's &a noisy market environment and it's a political environment where people are not really very eager to hear that. So I think, you know, we need to be really good about doing analysis that is compelling and credible and can let regulators and other policy makers understand that there are trade-offs here.

And then, to the micro side, you know, we certainly we need to have ready for the next administration and for policy makers globally, you know, some ideas about, if you wanted to enhance economic growth and make the system more stable for the next financial crisis, is there low-hanging fruit where you could have a de minimis impact on bank safety and soundness, but a true benefit for, you know, either economic growth or financial stability, or both.

MR. TRACY: And does that mean lower capital requirements?

MR. BAER: I think in some areas. But it certainly means halting the march towards ever-higher capital requirements, which is where we are now.

MR. TRACY: OK.

MR. BAER: We are in we are at a place of accelerating capital requirements. And I think when you look, you know, at the relatively objective measures of bank capital, it's hard to argue that there [is] not a lot of bank capital. And then, if you think about a TLAC [total loss-absorbing capacity] type rule or you think about loss absorbency more generally, which includes long-term debt, you know, I think the largest banks under the Fed's TLAC proposal are going to end up with $1.5 trillion of loss absorbency. That's a lot of loss absorbency. And so it's very easy to say, oh, the banks should have more capital, and we're going to produce analysis to show that well, I think the Fed actually, if you look at its CCAR scenario, it shows just how much capital that is. So we need to convince people that that's a pretty good measure for, you know, whether this is enough capital, and it is. And then we need to put the onus on those saying we want more to say why, or to answer the question why.

MR. TRACY: On CCAR, the Fed is engaged in a process right now of looking at potentially, you know, do we need to recalibrate parts of this process. This is the process where, you know, [Fed governor Daniel] Tarullo's had meetings with the industry, meetings with analysts, meetings with academics, not sort of as part of their annual process, but more broadly, and we're expecting something on that later this year. Do you have advice for that? What is what do you think your members want to see out of potential changes to CCAR?

MR. BAER: Well, I would start by first looking at what CCAR is right now in terms of the scenarios that are being mandated for the banks. It already assumes, for example, the unemployment rate goes from 5% to 10% over seven quarters, which is far worse than the financial crisis. GDP drop is more sudden and as bad or worse than the financial crisis. The blowout in spreads is worse than the financial crisis. There are there's a market shock and counterparty failure scenario for the trading banks that is akin to the financial crisis. And then, you know, most significantly, it's, after all of this happens, under CCAR, you still have to be at relatively high capital levels not just survive CCAR; you have to be at 4.5% tier 1 common equity, and then there are a series of other hurdles. And you have to do that all assuming that you're continuing to make share repurchases and pay dividends out exactly as planned, and that your balance sheet doesn't shrink in any of the problem areas. So that's an extraordinarily difficult test, and I think results in an extraordinarily high capital requirement, which is now why it has become the binding constraint for almost all, if not all the large banks.

And so, when you look at that, I think you just have to ask yourself the question, "Why isn't that enough capital?" And, you know, you can say we want to add this surcharge to that or that buffer to that, but it's all just more capital. And, you know, to the extent that it's hitting trading businesses, it's all just that much less market liquidity. And so I think it's less important to talk about the labels and the theory, and more just to ask the question, "Why isn't this enough capital?" And I think they've constructed a highly stressful, one might even say worst-case-scenario test that should give people a lot more comfort than it appears to be giving them at the moment.

MR. TRACY: We've reported that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-strips-new-york-feds-power-1425526210" much more centralized decision-making, especially for the biggest firms. Governor Tarullo has been, I would say, at the center of that. What's your relationship with him and the regulators right now? And do you feel like you get a fair hearing when you bring up things like this?

MR. BAER: (Laughs.) Let me think about this one.

MR. TRACY: Yeah. Fair enough.

(Pause.)

MR. BAER: I would say, you know, I think we absolutely get a fair hearing. I used to work at the Federal Reserve. I think it's a terrific institution. I mean, I have respect for all of the regulators, and I know they have a very difficult job to do. And, unlike when I was there, they have to do it in an increasingly politicized environment. And so I do not envy them their task.

I also don't envy them their task in that the complexity of regulation, I think, is still growing. You know, when you look at the there have been multiple issuances from Basel even in the last couple of weeks (again, which most people in the United States don't even know are occurring) around, for example, operational risk. And so I think it's just difficult for them to keep track of everything that's going on in what's become a very complex and difficult area.

So, you know, we don't think of ourselves as the opposition to them. We believe our role is to keep them as informed as we possibly can about what's going on in markets, what's going on in lending, what the results of regulation are, and to provide analysis that I think we hope will give them comfort that what they have done to date has been successful and has prevented at least, you know, certainly the type of financial crisis we saw last time, but really any financial crisis where the largest banks or the larger banks are, you know, either a cause or an accelerant.

My concern as you look to the next potential financial crisis is, have we established the largest banks as a Maginot Line, where they will, like their antecedent, you know, survive quite well and yet a whole crisis, you know, goes around them &.That wasn't very well put.

MR. TRACY: I understand the metaphor, though, yeah.

MR. BAER: And, yeah, I think that should that should be the concern at this point, is where are the risks going and how do you feel about where they are.

MR. TRACY: [The Clearing House] led the TLAC comment letter in which you asked for the Fed to do away with the stand-alone long-term-debt requirement. Why did you guys I mean, that's something that, you know, the Fed obviously was aware that the industry wanted. There has been some "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-chamber-touts-new-engagement-on-financial-regulation-1458085772". There's been sort of reaction to that of, you know, this what you're asking for is kind of going at the heart of the rule. Why did you guys decide to ask for such a significant change there?

MR. BAER: First, we don't believe at all that it's the heart of the rule.

MR. TRACY: OK.

MR. BAER: It's actually not included in the FSB term sheet to which they are purportedly adhering. We think it's actually an unnecessary sidecar to the rule.

MR. TRACY: OK.

MR. BAER: You know, the goal of TLAC is to have a set amount of loss absorbency, to allow, you know, either no failure by a large institution or its successful resolution with no cost to taxpayers. As I think most people who've ever been involved with regulation would acknowledge, at the margin you would always rather have more equity than more debt.

Here's how I'd put it. If you assume a TLAC requirement of 20% 

MR. TRACY: Right.

MR. BAER:  which isn't exactly what it is, but let's just assume if you have a bank that wants to run with 20% equity versus a bank that wants to run with 10% equity and 10% debt, you would always take the 20% equity because it's better for them not to fail at all than for them to fail and go through a resolution process. So it just seems counterintuitive to say we want debt rather than equity. And it's also counterintuitive to think that, even if you're meeting with equity, we want you to go out and leverage yourself more by issuing more debt.

MR. TRACY: Fair enough.

So, speaking of Maginot Lines, let's talk about AML and BSA, anti-money-laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act. There's been, obviously, a lot of enforcement in this area over the past few years. You experienced some of that when you were at J.P. Morgan. What's your assessment of where we are at between the extremes of not doing enough and doing too much on, you know, anti-money-laundering and terrorist finance?

MR. BAER: I think it's really two issues, although I think the problems are similar.

On the sanctions side, you're obviously seeing a lot of so-called de-risking, which is the polite term for banks getting rid of their clients or their correspondents. I think and obviously, they do that under pressure from regulators and because of fear that if they make a mistake, no matter how unintentional, the potential size of the fine is astronomical. And if you assume the potential for a hundred-million or billion-dollar fine for some group of relationships in a given country, it's very hard to figure what you price at to make that worth your while. So, instead, you go home. I think we're seeing that globally.

And I think there is now a growing number of people and not just bankers, but people involved in national security, international development, even intelligence policy who are asking, is it a good thing that U.S. banks, and actually European banks as well, are retreating from developing countries around the world because of fears of enforcement actions in the sanctions area? It's another great example of cost-benefit analysis. And I think, at least in the sanctions area, the costs are now being elevated and again, not by bankers, but by people who are sort of the ones who are truly affected by this. So I think there you're already having a useful dialogue, which I think we would try to attempt to foster or continue.

On the domestic side, you know, it's a little more tricky in the sense that less of it, I think, is public. But it really comes down to, you know, what's the threshold for filing a suspicious activity report. Is it, are you creating more hay, or are you helping them to find needles? And has the enforcement and regulatory environment been conducive to banks incentivizing banks to look hard for cases that are very worthwhile, or are they incentivized to just keep filing more and more SARs?

Again, I think I have now spoken to a wide range of people in law enforcement and intelligence and people who are expert at mining data to find bad guys, and I don't I rarely speak to somebody who doesn't use the word "broken" in describing the system, and I have not spoken to anybody who think that the system's working literally no one.

MR. TRACY: Wow. And why? Why is that the assessment?

MR. BAER: I think it fundamentally comes down to the Bank Secrecy Act. And you could even go back to why it's called the Bank Secrecy Act, which sort of is an indicator of how old it is. You know, it was written for a world decades ago, and not a world where you have big data and the ability to run algorithms. And it's one of my members put it wonderfully to me. You know, because we a lot of times we compare sort of how cyber is working versus how AML is working. And I think in cyber there's been wonderful cooperation, most of it unpublicized, between the banks and those in the intelligence and law-enforcement community. And there you don't file a SAR every time somebody pings your website; you deal with it as adults with a common goal, and you don't do defensive things solely for regulatory or enforcement purposes.

And someone very smart put it to me as the difference between AML and cyber is with cyber our goal is to solve a problem, and with AML our goal is to demonstrate compliance with a law to the regulators. And that tends to breed a very different regime.

MR. TRACY: And what's been the practical impact? I mean, banks are spending a lot of money on both. Does it look different, in practice, between how that money gets spent?

MR. BAER: I don't think there's any question that much more of the money is wasted on AML than on cyber. To the banks, it really isn't about the money. A lot of these banks are in New York and, you know, they want to help catch the bad guys. And what really frustrates them is not the money, but the fact that they are less focused on catching bad guys and working with, in a lot of cases, their former colleagues in law enforcement or national security, but rather that they are establishing audit trails. And that's probably not the best way to catch bad people.

MR. TRACY: So why is the money wasted? Or how?

MR. BAER: I think it's wasted to the extent that you are producing data that will never be used to identify a serious wrongdoer.

I think this is just an area where we think all well-intentioned people can conclude that there's a need for a serious change and not incremental change. And I think that's what we're going to hope to foster, you know, but really allowing the sort of end users of this information to lead the way because that's what's really important.

MR. TRACY: And that would have to be legislative. I mean, is that what you have in mind when you talk about change, that is that the goal?

MR. BAER: I think, you know, ideally legislative, but I think there are a lot of other things that could be done.

MR. TRACY: OK. Yeah, not the easiest hurdle to get a bill passed these days.

So, fintech [financial technology], let's talk about that. Do you think the playing field is level right now in terms of the rules that apply to some of these nonbank entities and marketplace lending or whatever it is?

How much of a priority is it for you to bring this up with regulators about, you know, what rules do and don't apply in that space right now? And if it is a priority, what specifically do you want to see?

MR. BAER: I mean, I think our members, you know, just they want consumers to have equal protections regardless of whether they're dealing with a bank or a nonbank performing banklike services. It's obviously a very competitive area, and competition's a good thing. And I don't think anyone wants to stifle competition. But I do think that, you know, getting back to your cyber issue, I mean, there's serious risks here. And the question is, who owns those risks, who manages those risks, and who ultimately bears liability in the case of those risks? And I think we have a way to go before, you know, consumers understand that, and where the management of the risk equals the is in the same place as the potential liability.

MR. TRACY: OK.

MR. BAER: What you hear most frequently from or at least what I hear most frequently from banks is concerns that they will ultimately have to make consumers whole for events that occurred outside their walls and over which they had no control and no ability to manage, and that's a very difficult position.

MR. TRACY: And can you be more specific about the concerns they have about where the rules may not be equal, or?

MR. BAER: Well, one we're looking at currently is about data aggregation.

MR. TRACY: OK.

MR. BAER: You know, where in some cases data aggregators work cooperatively with the bank, and there's an understanding of the data flows and there are protections and there's transparency to the customer. But I think there are other cases where the bank is even unaware that the data is being scraped and the customer is probably unaware of what his or her rights are in the event that there is, for example, a cyber event or something like that.

MR. TRACY: What's your assessment, broadly, of where the too-big-to-fail debate is? I mean, we've had some campaign rhetoric on both sides about that. Obviously, we know y'all think that a ton has been done to address that. But what's your assessment of where the debate is?

MR. BAER: If you think about a series of concentric circles with the core being knowledge and the outer circles being ignorance, I think the closer you get to the center, the more sanguine you are about too big to fail. I think the TLAC proposal &is a perfect example. I mean, there's no reason for the Federal Reserve to require the largest banks to hold, you know, over $1.5 trillion of total loss absorbency except to effectuate a resolution that will not require taxpayer support or create financial instability. I'd like to think they will say that when they finalize their rule. But I think you hear people debating too big to fail who don't even know that that's happening, or don't care.

So it's I mean, it's quite frustrating. But I do think, among informed regulators, there's a whole lot more comfort than there was. And then, you know, again, to the extent that you look at what's the market's view, I mean, holders of long-term debt of large banks clearly believe that they are at extraordinary risk in the event of failure, and now the rating agencies are following along. So, I mean, that they could always be wrong, but you know, markets tend to be pretty smart. And so I would hope that that's a comfort to regulators and others that, you know and it certainly means that you're not getting any, you know, unfair competitive advantage as a result of that. But I think that's pretty good evidence that there's been real change and that, you know, debtholders are at risk. Which means, of course, that at the levels of loss absorbency that the Fed is going to require, it's pretty difficult to imagine a scenario where that isn't sufficient to cover the losses.

MR. TRACY: So you feel like empirically there's the evidence is on your side at this point, in other words?

MR. BAER: I think the market perception is evidence. But you also have analysis in the sense that those who have those who say that, you know, Title I and Title II [of Dodd-Frank] somehow don't work never really seem to explain why. You have to believe that the levels of loss absorbency wouldn't be sufficient, which I think analytically is very difficult to do, or you'd have to believe that the regulators would violate the law and protect the debtholders even when they're prohibited from doing so. And nobody really explains how or why that would happen. It's very difficult to imagine it happening.

So, yeah, I think we're ready with our analysis and evidence, but the other side and maybe that's a good sign does not seem to come forward with analysis and evidence on the other side.

MR. TRACY: Let's talk more about Basel. How do you kind of broadly view what's going on? And which direction is it going? Is it going in the direction that you guys are concerned about, or is it is it neutral?

MR. BAER: I mean, I think one great debate that's going on at Basel and with, you know, U.S. regulators participating, but again, outside of U.S. view is really the question of, you know, what should be the binding constraint for bank capital and what is the relative role of what are the relative roles of bank internal models of assessing risk, regulator-created standardized models creating one governmental view of risk, and stress tests like CCAR although there really aren't any other stress tests like CCAR outside the United States.

And that's why you are seeing a series of proposals around standardized approaches to measuring various types of risks. I think there's a very vigorous debate going on around, you know, what their role is relative to internal models. I think in some corners there is a deep distrust for any bank internal model. I think that distrust is unwarranted, at least for U.S. banks, in the sense that the rigor around those models is extraordinary, and their review both internally and by the regulators is extraordinarily robust. But there are certainly countries that participate in Basel who don't believe any bank model could ever be right. Then there are on the other hand, there are people who view who believe that the cost of running those models and going through all that review is too high, and you're better off just going with some standardized model and saving yourself the trouble. And that's a really, really important debate to have because I think, ultimately, it has real implications for credit allocation and economic growth, which, again, have not really received the attention they deserve.

So, again, that's why I think we're going to try to be more engaged in that international debate, because that will eventually become a U.S. debate.

MR. TRACY: OK. What's been the impact of the you mentioned how CCAR is different from other countries. One way I understand that's very different is you have this rejection or approval of the capital plan in CCAR. What's been the impact of that just mentally on the way banks think about the regulators, I mean, and is that a good thing or a bad thing?

MR. BAER: I think certainly vis--vis investors it's a very difficult thing because it's very important to be able to tell your investors what your capital requirement's going to be. And with CCAR, with the scenarios changing every year, with perhaps the model changing every year but we don't know, and potentially with the amount of capital you have to have at the end of it changing, it's very difficult to tell investors here's how much capital we have to have. And so there's no question that that is a difficult thing for the banks, and then a difficult thing ultimately for the economy because the economy tends to do well when banks are able to do good projections and gather investors and lend money and support markets. So that's certainly a cost of a CCAR process.

On the other hand, I mean, I think we and I think most of the banks support the notion of stress testing as the best way to assess bank capital. And so, certainly in theory and that sounds like damning with faint praise, but a little more than theory the idea of using a stress test as a binding constraint does not seem to be a bad one. I think the greater frustration is, again, with, as we talked about earlier, you know, the severity and stringency of CCAR is extraordinary, and yet, no one seems to be or not no one many people seem to be either ignorant of it or understating what it means to have passed that test.

MR. TRACY: What's your reaction to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-new-bank-critic-keeps-heat-on-1459720148"? What does it say about the broader debate here?

MR. BAER: I think debate is always good. I think, you know, my frustration with "http://www.wsj.com/articles/minneapolis-feds-kashkari-says-must-consider-options-for-ending-too-big-to-fail-1459783192" is that it takes as a given or a premise something that I don't believe to be true, which is that too big to fail still exists, notwithstanding the myriad policy actions that we've been discussing, and that we now need to get about the business of breaking up the banks or imposing wildly higher capital requirements.

From what I understand, I don't think there are going to be the types of proposals that lend themselves to the data and analysis that we want to engage in, you know, debating policy issues. So I think we'd welcome the chance to debate on an analytical and data basis the whole series of questions that are not even on the table there because they've been conclusively presumed against the banking industry.

MR. TRACY: How are you enjoying this job? What are you what's your reaction, having moved and started doing this public-sector work?

MR. BAER: It's the issues that have consumed me for quite some time, and working with a great group of people, and having the resources to really, you know, explore the right answers. You know, it's a terrific place to be.

Plus we also have a payments company. And with our real-time payments initiative, that's become, you know, a very exciting endeavor. So on some level it feels like just working at a startup fintech company as well as working at a large bank, you know, association. So, you know, on both sides, it's a terrifically exciting place to be.

MR. TRACY: And what is what should our readers know about that payments company work?

MR. BAER: Well, I mean, we're developing a clearing and settlement system that will allow for real-time payments, which ultimately I think will have economic benefits, consumer-customer benefits, although it's more on a wholesale side at this point. But you've seen systems like that have been developed in the U.K., Singapore, other countries. You can argue we're overdue in the United States. But we're certainly making every effort to get this done as quickly as possible.

MR. TRACY: What's the goal for it? What's the timeline on that?

MR. BAER: OK. We're going to begin a pilot program Q1 of '17, so we'll be testing with the banks.

MR. TRACY: OK. Well, thank you so much.

Anomali Inc., formerly known as Threatstream, has raised new funding as it rebrands and looks to expand its new threat intelligence offerings.

The company grabbed $30 million in a recent Series C round led by Institutional Venture Partners. Previous investors from General Catalyst Partners, Paladin Capital Group and GV, formerly Google Ventures, also participated in the round.

The company announced its rebranding as Anomali in February at the RSA Conference, one of the security industry's largest annual events. With the new name, the company now offers a product that focuses on small businesses as well as a new enterprise product that provides breach analytics.

The company has also continued to offer its original product, ThreatStream, which is now in its sixth iteration. The tool enables businesses to share threat information with others they have identified as trusted peers.

At the RSA Conference where the company announced its rebranding and new products, many of the attendees said they were growing fatigued with threat intelligence services, a part of the cybersecurity industry that became overheated in recent years.

 It doesn't feel crowded to us because we are in a particular vertical that is more technology focused," said Anomali Chief Executive Hugh Njemanze.

Mr. Njemanze said Anomali's platform sits above most threat intelligence tools, and that the company's platform makes them usable for enterprises.

The company has raised more than $56 million in funding to date.

Investors are betting Forter Ltd. can help retailers limit fraudulent charges online.

The company has closed $32 million in Series C funding led by Scale Venture Partners, with previous investors Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates participating.

Fraud liability falls on the retailer or merchant. Forter Chief Executive Michael Reitblat said companies lose billions every year in fraudulent purchases, and even more revenue in charges they stop because their existing fraud-detection tools generate false positives.

The company takes a fully automated approach using machine learning to detect fraud in purchases. Its clients include retailers such as Delivery.com, Heels.com and Jomashop.com.

Mr. Reitblat said Forter covers any fraudulent charges that make it through its system.

He said companies that use Forter tend to see between a 5% and 10% increase in revenue. The company's primary market is U.S. retailers, and he said Forter also enables companies explore opportunities in Asia, a market some avoided because of the high instances of fraudulent purchases.

The Forter team consists of former PayPal Inc. executives and former officers from the Israeli Cyber Command. Its business operations are based in San Francisco, while research and development is in Tel Aviv.

As the company expands, it faces competition from another fraud detection platform, Signifyd Inc. That startup announced it "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160225ec2pi2wto" earlier this year. Mr. Reitblat said he is confident his fully automated solution can compete with Signifyd's, which relies on a combination of machine and human intelligence.

With the new round, Forter added Scale Venture Partners' Rory O'Driscoll to its board.

EMC Misses Expectations but Says Dell Deal Remains on Track; Company says merger to close by October, cites an excess of unfilled orders for results below views

By Robert McMillan and Lisa Beilfuss

It's been a bumpy road but Dell Inc.'s blockbuster acquisition of EMC Inc. is on track to reach its next major milestone, a vote by EMC shareholders, within the next few months.

The deal, now valued at $60 billion, $7 billion less than it originally was worth, would have Dell Inc. take over storage company EMC by October. EMC chief Joe Tucci on Wednesday reaffirmed that all systems are go.

 We expect the transaction to happen on the original terms and within the originally announced time frame," Mr. Tucci said during a conference call with analysts.  Integration planning has accelerated &, the leadership team has been established and we've received the vast majority of antitrust approvals required."

Financial analysts also believe that the deal will be approved.  Given the way stocks are going right now, there's a good chance the deal will go through," said Abhey Lamba, managing director with Mizuho Securities USA Inc.

Dell's parent company, Denali Holding Inc., is completing a proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the shareholder vote is expected six weeks after that. That pushes the vote back to June. Dell and EMC had hoped the shareholder vote would take place by early May.

A series of missteps since the deal was announced have hammered the share price of VMware, a publicly traded EMC subsidiary in which the parent owns an 81% stake. The problems lowered the payout that EMC shareholders could expect if the deal went through. In October, when the acquisition was announced, Dell's offer, partially pegged to the price of VMware stock, was worth more than $33 per share. On Wednesday, it had fallen to nearly $30 a share due to the slide in VMware's value, while EMC shares traded just above $26

Shares of VMware have dropped 25% since the deal was announced, but they were up 13% on Wednesday on news of a stock buyback, as well as quarterly results that suggested the merger plan hadn't hurt the company's financial prospects as much as some financial analysts had feared.

Dell's big bet comes at a time when incumbent technology giants are struggling. On Tuesday, Intel said it "http://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-to-cut-12-000-jobs-1461097009", about 11% of its workforce. IBM on Monday reported its 16th-straight quarterly decline in revenue.

And the former Hewlett-Packard Co. has spun off its printer and personal computer businesses in a divestiture that stands in contrast to Dell's bid to consolidate diverse IT products and services under one umbrella.

EMC's revenues have missed analyst expectations for six straight quarters as its core businesses have shrunk. Sales in 2015 of its high-end storage gear dropped 14% while its midrange business was down 18%, according to the industry research firm Gartner Inc. The two businesses accounted for $3.9 billion in revenue. The company's flash storage business offset some of those losses, growing by 122% to $1 billion.

 The spending environment continues to be challenging," said EMC Chief Financial Officer Denis Cashman,  as customers focus more on transformative IT projects while also minimizing transactional spends."

Tying up with privately held Dell will give EMC breathing room to focus on longer-term opportunities, Mr. Tucci said.

 There's an advantage to being private," said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. He pointed to Dell's rising market share and ability to operate out of the spotlight, disrupting competition without having to telegraph moves and without the quarterly scrutiny of investors and Wall Street analysts.

 What Dell has shown is they can handle the complexity where HP said they couldn't," Mr. Moorhead said. Whereas HP determined that its businesses were better off divided between two entities, the combination of EMC and Dell  makes sense," he said.

HP said there's a difference. Dell and EMC are looking to  get larger, lever up their balance sheet, and double-down on mostly legacy technology," an HP Enterprise spokeswoman said via email. HP by contrast is looking to focus on new technology, while  de-levering the balance sheet," she said.

EMC reported first-quarter profit of $268 million, or 14 cents a share, up from $252 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Excluding the expense of stock-based compensation and restructuring, among other items, earnings per share were 31 cents, flat from the year-ago period.

Revenue slipped 2.5% to $5.48 billion. Analysts projected 33 cents in adjusted per-share profit on $5.63 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters.

EMC attributed the disappointing results to an excess of unfulfilled orders at the end of the quarter. Unshipped storage-product orders totaled roughly $75 million due to the timing of bookings within the quarter, according to Mr. Cashman.

Sales in the VMware business rose a better-than-expected 5% from a year earlier, and the company backed its earlier sales guidance for the year. In EMC's Pivotal segment, which offers cloud and big data software by subscription, revenue soared 56% from last year's quarter.

Those gains were offset by a decline in the company's information infrastructure business, its biggest, where sales declined 5.9%.

Imaging Advantage Teams Up With MIT Members on Artificial Intelligence

Imaging Advantage LLC, a cloud-based imaging company backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., among others, is hoping to introduce artificial intelligence in the reading of X-rays.

The company, which also counts private-equity firms Brightwood Capital Advisors and CRG as investors, teamed up with faculty members from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School's teaching hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, to develop a machine learning initiative named Singularity Healthcare to take a first look at digital X-rays.

Naseer Hashim, founder and chief executive of Imaging Advantage, said the idea behind Singularity is that technology will examine X-rays and highlight potential problematic areas of injury and disease before sending the images to one of the 500 board-certified radiologists connected to Imaging Advantage's cloud-based network.

 The whole idea of deep learning is that the machine is becoming better looking at analogies," said Mr. Hashim.  If it detects a potential problem area in one patient, it will also have the knowledge, hopefully, of many more similar indications."

He added Singularity will continuously learn from Imaging Advantage's expanding database of 7 billion images.

 The machine will read what radiologists determine in other cases and come up with a potential response on what that is," he said.

Founded in 2007, Imaging Advantage, of Santa Monica, Calif., received Goldman capital in 2010 and again in 2012, for a total of $40 million. Goldman invested through its direct private investing operations offered through the New York firm's merchant banking division.

The capital injection allowed Imaging Advantage to provide radiology services to hospitals, and assist with practice management, day and night final teleradiology, and specialized radiology billing.

New York firm Brightwood, which targets the lower midmarket, joined Goldman as an Imaging Advantage investor in 2012. CRG, a Houston-based, health care-focused investment firm, pledged $250 million in equity and debt to the company in 2015.

There has been a push to introduce technology in health care. Although electronic medical records have become commonplace for the past couple of years, health care lags behind other industries in the deployment of analytics, often takes on an assisting role in facilitating physicians in back-office functions and hasn't played that big of a part in treatment.

The Singularity project to be launched later this quarter is still far from allowing machines to take over the diagnosis-making process, but it is the first step to let technology aid physicians and clinicians in the more commoditized part of their job.

According to the Government Accountability Office, the U.S. handled 30 million imaging services in 2010 (the latest data available), three-quarters of which were X-rays, ultrasound and other standard imaging.

In Imaging Advantage's experience, according to Mr. Hashim, 50% of all radiology tests are X-rays.

 This technology, once we establish its advocacy, I believe radiologists will gravitate toward it," Mr. Hashim said.  Radiologists don't like reading plain film. It is the lowest reimbursement modality. Given a choice, they'd rather focus on MRI and CT."

Mr. Hashim said adding artificial intelligence to the reading of X-rays will hopefully aid the faster turnaround of tests and potentially help eliminate errors or misses on X-ray reading.

 Even a small percentage improvement in the highest use modality is incredible," Mr. Hashim said.

Singularity is named after the hypothetical event in which artificial intelligence surpasses human control. However, Mr. Hashim said the technology isn't set up to take over the jobs of radiologists.

 I don't believe the market will be ready to have nonboard certified radiologists reading exams from a patient perspective," Mr. Hashim said.  I don't think insurance companies will support it. You are looking into the distant future, even if the technology is perfect, before radiologists come out of the equation."

TD AMERITRADE

Profit Rises 8.5%

TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. said its quarterly profit climbed 8.5% as revenue at the brokerage rose and client trading activity increased.

Interest-rate-sensitive assets, which include spread-based assets and money-market mutual funds, grew by 11% to a record $112 billion, with the firm pointing to organic growth and changing investor sentiment in a volatile market environment.

For the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, TD Ameritrade reported earnings of $205 million, compared with $189 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to 38 cents from 35 cents a year earlier, meeting analysts' expectations. Revenue increased to $846 million from $803 million, below analysts' projections of $856 million, according to Thomson Reuters.

TD's average daily trades rose 6.8% from a year earlier to 509,120.

The brokerage brought in $14 billion in net new client assets in the quarter, bringing total client assets to $711 billion, which the company said was a record.

The firm was also able to control expenses, which edged down 0.8% from the prior year.

Grosvenor Warns Boom Is Ending

A major U.K. landlord warned that the boom in global real estate is ending.

London-based Grosvenor Group, which manages investments on behalf of the Duke of Westminster, said in its annual report that years of rising property values could be set to reverse. While it isn't possible to predict when the market will turn,  it is only a matter of time," said Nicholas Scarles, group finance director, in the report.

Real-estate investment surged after the 2008 financial crisis, pushing values of commercial and residential property to records in cities around the world. With interest rates low, property returns looked attractive compared with other assets.

Stock-market volatility, low oil prices and political uncertainty have damped demand. High-end housing markets in cities like London and New York have softened in the past year. Commercial-property transaction volumes totaled $1.2 trillion in 2015, down 2% from 2014, according to data provider Real Capital Analytics.

Grosvenor continues to  expect and plan for a slowdown, particularly in high-end commercial and residential property," Mr. Scarles said. Other historic landlords in Britain have also been preparing for a downturn.

For Grosvenor, preparation includes selling assets and pursuing development opportunities expected to mature during the next market upturn, he said.

In addition to high property values,  there is a risk that sustained low oil prices could lead to sovereign wealth funds reducing investment in high-end commercial and residential property in London and elsewhere," he said.  All of this points to a correction in the near future."

Grosvenor manages a 6.7 billion ($8.42 billion) property portfolio spanning Hong Kong to San Francisco.

The jewel in Grosvenor's crown is a 300-acre plot of central London that has been in the family since 1677. Once a marshy pasture, it now encompasses the Mayfair and Belgravia neighborhoods, home to hedge funds and embassies.

Prices of luxury housing in these areas have fallen in the past year.  In the U.K., the top end of the residential market in London has passed its peak, due in part to the recent changes to stamp duty, along with the strength of sterling during 2015," said Mark Preston, Grosvenor's chief executive, in the report.

In 2015, the total return for Grosvenor was 9%, down from 13% in 2014. Pretax profit was 526.6 million, down 23% from 681.8 million in 2014.

 While we have seen performance above the cycle average in each of the years since the financial crisis, we anticipate the next few years will bring a more challenging environment," Mr. Scarles said.

Tracy's Take: FSOC's Asset-Management  Update'

Chinese Lender's Woes Expose Its Global Tentacles

EU 's Mogherini Pushes Closer Banking Ties With Iran

Federal Reserve Corrects Letter to Morgan Stanley on Living Will

SEC Coders Open Doors for Enforcement

FSOC's Asset-Management  Update' What to Watch

When a panel of top regulators meets at 5 p.m. Monday to lay out their views on asset managers, they won't take drastic action.

But they will, according to a public notice, issue an  update regarding ... ongoing work" on the sector that could, nonetheless, have a big impact on the regulatory environment for the $50-trillion-plus industry led by BlackRock Inc ., Vanguard Group , and others. Watch for suggestions about blocking certain types of high-risk mutual funds to retail investors, or curbing hedge fund borrowing. While not binding, the report will influence rulemaking in the coming months.

The approach to be unveiled by the Financial Stability Oversight Council  a 10-headed Hydra created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act illustrates the panel's evolution as it struggles to define its role and powers over the nonbanking portion of the financial sector that fueled the 2008 crisis.

Early on, FSOC took a heavy-handed approach, formally designating three big insurers, along with General Electric Co .'s financing arm, as  systemically important" and thus subject to extensive new oversight. That prompted a backlash, culminating in a judge last month nullifying that designation for MetLife Inc .

After mulling doing the same to asset managers, FSOC changed course. They've spent four years studying how to steer that industry, opting for a lighter touch. Today's  update" will be the culmination of that work.

The suggestions won't automatically turn into regulation. Yet they will carry the influence that comes with the signatures of Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew , the FSOC chairman, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen , an FSOC member, and eight other senior officials on the council.

Today's report will cover four areas the council laid out for its inquiry into asset managers: liquidity and redemption risk, leverage, operational risk, and resolution (regulatory parlance for failure or bankruptcy).

Officials have talked more publicly about the first two, indicating those are priorities. In the other two areas, regulators may simply call for more study.

Specifically, Treasury officials have questioned whether certain types of mutual funds ought to be available to retail investors, given their liquidity or cash needs especially those funds that offer daily withdrawals while investing in hard-to-sell assets. On Thursday, Antonio Weiss, counselor to Mr. Lew, pointed "https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0422.aspx" to the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund's decision to suspend investor redemptions in December. Don't be surprised if FSOC encourages the Securities and Exchange Commission to curb such funds.

FSOC could also call for more action on leverage, or borrowing, associated with securities lending, an activity where funds loan out securities they own. Fed governor Daniel Tarullo"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20151117a.htm" about investment funds taking on  bank-like" risks.

Regulators may also recommend more to rein in borrowing by hedge funds. Analyst "http://capalphadc.com/downloads/2016/4/hedge_funds_and_asset_managers_beware_the_spurned_fsoc.pdf" that the minutes of January's FSOC meeting were the first in at least 18 months to mention hedge funds, as part of a discussion about how some aren't subject to borrowing limits.

Monday's  update" could be much more than simply that.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Chinese Lender's Woes Expose Its Global Tentacles

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-lenders-woes-expose-its-global-tentacles-1460799002" is underlining the risks of a financing boom that has channeled Chinese household money into Hollywood movies and Wall Street deals.

Droves of teary-eyed investors from around China have descended on Shanghai Kuailu Investment Group's swanky offices over the past week to demand their money back after the firm halted redemptions on wealth-management products for the roughly 250,000 clients of the firm and three affiliates.

EU 's Mogherini Pushes Closer Banking Ties With Iran

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-mogherini-affirms-support-for-closer-banking-ties-with-iran-1460804651" pledged Saturday the bloc would do what it can to get large regional banks working with Iran in a bid to ease tensions between Tehran and Washington over the benefits of last year's nuclear agreement.

Federica Mogherini was in Tehran on Saturday at the head of the largest delegation of EU officials to visit Iran in years. The two sides announced a string of joint projects from the energy sector to migration and joint research work.

Officials now say the push for sophisticated data analytics is opening the door to enforcement cases that couldn't otherwise have been brought. It is also leading the agency into new areas like mining free-text information for potential leads.

SEC Seen as Likely to Approve New IEX Stock Exchange

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-seen-likely-to-approve-new-iex-stock-exchange-1460737494" is likely to approve a startup stock exchange proposed by IEX Group Inc . despite months of lobbying by Wall Street firms that have sought to block its launch, according to the brokerage industry's top regulator.

Richard Ketchum , chairman and chief executive officer of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, said Friday that IEX has probably satisfied most of the SEC 's concerns about how the market would operate, including its use of a  speed bump" intended to slow down the fastest traders. IEX's plan to start an exchange it says it would cater to mutual funds and other long-term investors has divided Wall Street and sparked sharp criticism from rival market operators such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc ., as well as hedge fund Citadel LLC and many high-frequency trading firms.

Why Are Financial Regulations So Complex?

Before federal regulators released their assessments of the living wills submitted by the country's largest banks, few could have predicted what they found. The reason for the uncertainty, "http://theweek.com/articles/618175/why-doddfrank-should-have-been-stupider", is that financial regulations and regulation more generally are often more opaque and complex than necessary. He argues that the root of the problem may be that lawmakers are reluctant to write statutes that will be seen as overly broad and risk the criticism of trade groups decrying the regulation for  making the many pay the price for the malfeasance of the few."

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-shareholders-argue-against-governments-profit-sweep-1460757430" argued in federal appeals court on Friday that the U.S. government has illegally seized much of those institutions' profits during the past three years, effectively bilking them out of hundreds of billions of dollars.

 Artificial intelligence -focused Numerai raises $1.5m

A hedge fund focused on artificial intelligence has raised $1.5m from a group of investors led by a founder of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world s biggest money managers, underscoring the growing interest in applying cutting-edge technology to markets.

"https://numer.ai/"was founded by South African mathematician Richard Craib last year and uses a monthly  tournament  for data scientists to develop models using AI fields such as  machine learning  to predict stock market movements, with the best predictions winning money from the company.

Unlike Quantopian, a similar embryonic  crowdfunded  hedge fund, San Francisco-based Numerai provides data scientists and computer programmers with encrypted financial data.

They then use the data to independently develop their own models scouring for patterns and submitting their results to the hedge fund, which then synthesises the best ones into stock market trades. "https://www.quantopian.com/"members submit completed trading algorithms.

 It s just a clean data challenge. We manage all the irritating things like the fund structure and the trading,  Mr Craib said.  They can build whatever model they want and simply submit their predictions. 

The Numerai investment group was led by "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_L._Morgan", a former computer science professor and one of the founders of Renaissance Technologies, the immensely lucrative but secretive science-powered hedge fund.

 Richard has a new take on how to use crowdsourced artificial intelligence in a very innovative way,  Mr Morgan said.  The homomorphically encrypted data means it s just abstract data. It could be weather data or pharma data, it just happens to be financial data. 

Some of the investors   who include Naval Ravikant, a co-founder of AngelList and a seed investor in Uber, and Playfair Capital, a London-based venture capital group specialising in artificial intelligence   also put an undisclosed sum into Numerai s hedge fund, which otherwise remains closed to outside investors.

 We have so much to do on the technology side and on the tournament design, so I want to focus on that for now,  Mr Craib said. But with typical Silicon Valley understatement he added that eventually  I want to manage all the money in the world .

Numerai has also appointed "http://diamandis.com/", the chairman of the X Prize Foundation and the Singularity Universe, to its advisory board. He will join Vitaly Shmatikov and Arvind Narayana, two machine learning experts at Cornell and Princeton Universities respectively, Kaggle board member Ash Fontana, and Norman Packard, a chaos theory physicist and founder of "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/04/26/black-box", a cutting-edge hedge fund in the 1990s.

The hedge fund, which was started in October last year, initially traded only using Mr Craib s own model, but now mostly uses the predictions produced by the contestants at its tournaments, which started running in December.

 My model was doing very well, which is why I felt confident I could start a hedge fund, but within 10 days of the first tournament I had an even better model,  he said.  We now have 80 people with better models than me, which is depressing, but it s good for the fund. 

The current leader on Numerai s tournament board is a user called  "https://numer.ai/ai/ncvsai" , who works in genomics and biostatistics, according to Mr Craib. He has earned $5,563 since starting to submit predictions earlier this year, but as the hedge fund grows Numerai intends to ramp up the rewards.

AHL hedge fund says results of 'machine learning' show promise

Man Group's computer-powered AHL hedge fund plans to ratchet up its investment in " machine learning ", a hot new area of artificial intelligence that is garnering increasing attention in the investment industry.

AHL, which manages more than $19bn, is known for investment strategies that follow trends and its two main funds have returned an average of 12-13 per cent annually since the mid-1990s.

But the success of its machine learning experiments in recent years led the company to plough more money into the field, and it is now the single biggest investment area at AHL, according to Sandy Rattray , chief executive.

"It's very powerful, and could unleash a very important period for quantitative investing," he said.

AHL has been researching machine learning - a field of artificial intelligence where dynamic algorithms pore over vast data sets for patterns - for five years, and has been using the technique in trading for the last three years. The results have been encouraging, according to executives at the hedge fund.

A machine learning strategy helped one of AHL's funds swing from a narrow loss to a narrow gain in August last year, when markets were convulsed by concerns over China, by autonomously buying and selling stock at vital junctures in the turmoil. Many traders initially stood on the sidelines, unable to quantify rapidly-changing data.

"It learnt to buy the dip . . . when we showed it a lot of data," said Nick Granger , co-head of research at AHL. "No one taught it to do this. It responds to the market environment, which makes it much more dynamic."

Machine learning is an increasingly popular niche of AI that is being used for everything from generating film recommendations for Netflix to Google's translation service.

The AI field has been around for some time, but increasingly fast computers allow fund managers to use machine learning on an accelerating data deluge.

Some experts are more sceptical over the utility of machine learning to trade financial markets, pointing out that financial data are immensely complex, chaotic and more "noisy" than other industries. The concern is that it has become a faddish concept in quantitative investment.

Mr Rattray concedes that machine learning has become a buzzword, but says AHL's results using the AI technique shows it has immense promise.

The success of AHL - its four main vehicles returned between 3.9 and 7.6 per cent in the first quarter, despite the turbulent markets - helped keep Man Group's overall funds under management relatively steady at $78.6bn, as net inflows of $1.3bn into its "quant" funds offset outflows from its more traditional hedge funds.

Summa Equity, a private-equity firm set up by former deal makers from Altor Equity Partners and Nordic Capital, is looking to raise 300 million euros for its first fund, a person familiar with the matter said.

The Scandinavia-based firm will target investments in the Nordic region in the small and lower-mid market space, the person added.

The firm's investment strategy will target companies associated with the following four thematic trends: aging demographics, energy efficiency, resource scarcity and big data.

Summa Equity was founded by three senior buyout executives from two Nordic-based private-equity firms. The founding members are Johannes Lien, a former partner at midmarket private equity house Altor Equity Partners; Reynir Indahl, also a former partner at Altor Equity Partners; and Jenny Keisu, a former director and general counsel at private-equity firm Nordic Capital.

McGraw Hill Financial Inc. agreed to sell J.D. Power, known for its ratings on auto makers and other industries, for $1.1 billion to investment firm XIO Group.

In October, McGraw Hill said it would explore alternatives for J.D. Power. At the time, people familiar with the matter said it could attract a valuation of around $1 billion.

XIO Group, whose operations include London, Hong Kong and Shanghai offices, said the deal is its first for a U.S.-based company. In October, XIO bought Nasdaq-listed Israeli medical-laser company Lumenis Ltd. for about $510 million.

The J.D. Power deal is slated to close during the third quarter.

McGraw Hill Financial's brands include Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, S&P Global Market Intelligence, S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts.

In October, McGraw Hill said,  we have increased our focus on capital and commodity markets and believe that J.D. Power could be more valuable to a company in the market research and consumer analytics space." The company said Friday it  will now be even more focused on financial intelligence businesses with a common set of attributes."

McGraw Hill Financial is preparing to change its name to S&P Global Inc., a symbolic move that underscores the firm's shift away from its publishing roots. The company's data-focused moves have included a $2.2 billion purchase of SNL Financial LC.

In recent years, McGraw Hill has sold off divisions producing textbooks, trade publications and magazines.

Hedge Funds: Inflows for Hedge Fund Man Group

Man Group, one of the world's biggest hedge-fund managers, reported higher client inflows during a choppy first quarter for investment firms, led by its computer-driven funds.

The London-based firm posted $500 million of new client money, compared with withdrawals of $1.3 billion a year earlier, although it sustained $700 million of investment losses during the period.

Man's shares rose more than 5% on Friday in London trading.

The first quarter "has been a difficult one across the industry for both flows and performance. Against this background, Man did well to see flat assets under management and [$0.5 billion] inflows, we think," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Philip Middleton.

Man -- which has been trying to turn itself around under Chief Executive Manny Roman after years of client withdrawals -- has been boosted by the revival of its computer-driven hedge fund unit AHL.

The flagship AHL Diversified fund rose nearly 34% in 2014, ranking it as one of the world's best-performing hedge funds. It lost money last year and is up 3% this year.

Funds including one that trades niche markets, such as German power or emerging-market interest-rate derivatives, and one that uses newer investment styles such as machine learning, also have made money.

That has helped lure back clients, with a net $1.3 billion flowing into AHL and other computer-driven hedge funds during the first quarter, reflecting renewed demand across the hedge-fund industry for such funds.

Man said that 71% of AHL's open-ended funds were at their so-called high-water mark -- the point at which they can start to earn lucrative performance fees.

"We believe that Man's efforts to diversify its product range and broaden its distribution network have resulted in net inflows during a volatile and uncertain [first quarter]," said Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who had forecast net outflows of $400 million during the quarter.

Investment losses and more than $1 billion of withdrawals at its discretionary unit GLG helped pushed Man's overall funds under management down to $78.6 billion from $78.7 billion at the end of last year.

"The ongoing uncertainty in the markets remains challenging and, accordingly, the risk appetite of our clients has the potential to affect flows," Mr. Roman, the chief executive, said in a statement.

In February, the firm reported that profit last year had fallen 17%, hit by lower performance fees and higher compensation costs.

New York Fed's New GDP Report Diverges From Atlanta's

By Katy Burne, Ben Eisen and Paul Vigna

The race to provide credible real-time data on U.S. economic growth is pitting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York against its sibling in Atlanta, to the puzzlement of some traders.

The New York Fed said Tuesday that on Friday it would begin issuing a report tracking U.S. gross-domestic-product growth. In doing so, the bank is indirectly facing off with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which has published its own regularly updated GDP estimate, GDPNow, since July 2014.

Adding to the intrigue, the rival measures offer vastly diverging views of how the economy is doing. An initial estimate from the New York Fed's FRBNY Staff Nowcast called for tepid first-quarter growth at 1.1%, but the Atlanta Fed measure is showing a near stall at 0.1%, according to the bank's website. Final official figures won't be released until late June.

The divergence is confounding traders, who have used the Atlanta Fed reading to gauge the health of the economy and predict whether the Fed will move rates up or down. Some said the New York Fed's announcement about its new tool caught the market by surprise.

"I have been getting a lot of questions from clients," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank AG. "They want to know which one they should look at."

The tussle underscores the rising investor demand for real-time snapshots on GDP. Growth has been uneven since the financial crisis and major market indicators such as oil prices, interest rates and inflation expectations recently have shown an unusual level of volatility, limiting their usefulness to traders and analysts seeking to divine the direction of the world's largest economy.

The limits were most visible in the market's U.S. recession scare of January and February. The Dow industrials fell as much as 10% during that episode before recovering. The index was up 2.8% for the year as of Wednesday.

While U.S. economic data are widely viewed by many investors as the most reliable in the world, the reports typically are released with a lag, reducing their value to investors who are eager to get an edge on rivals in making and hedging directional bets.

GDP trackers are rapidly becoming a preferred tool for measuring the health of the economy among everyone from bond and currency traders to global economists. The demand for speedy data has led private companies to offer their own GDP estimates, although those have had a harder time getting traction with traders since the Fed issued its own. Most Wall Street banks, and firms including Moody's Analytics, have GDP models.

Robin Anderson, a senior economist with Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa, says she often receives questions from people inside her firm about GDPNow, and she looks at it regularly as an input in her forecasts.

"It's a nice way to see what the current data releases that go into GDP are telling us about where GDP is tracking," she said.

The Atlanta Fed's tracker has expanded its following in recent months, as its first-quarter growth estimates fell from 2.3% in mid-March. Since then, search interest on Google for the term "GDPNow" has grown more than threefold.

That said, some caution not to read too much into GDP trackers because of their large swings. Since they push out an estimate before all of the inputs are finalized, the trackers warn that there is less accuracy at the beginning of the tracking period than the end.

The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker grew out of growth forecasts that were prepared for the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which meets eight times a year. Because final GDP data are released only four times a year, the Fed Board staff started preparing their own advance forecasts. In doing so, they developed a model that they say is more accurate than simple statistical models.

GDPNow takes 13 subcomponents that go into GDP and constantly recalculates the forecast as new data are supplied. The use of the subcomponents is crucial; many models don't take this "bottom-up" approach and develop estimates for those subcomponents and so can miss granular changes in the economy, researchers said.

The New York Fed's models seek to capture the most important macroeconomic data and digest it as news headlines, "mimicking the way markets work," according to the New York Fed.

Both seek to take the mix of past results, newly reported data and forecast data and through their models produce an overall rate of change, expressed as a percentage.

The Atlanta Fed's tracker is updated the same day that major new data arrive, often within hours. The New York Fed will release its new estimates every Friday, with the exception of Fridays during its blackout periods around Fed policy meetings.

New York's Nowcasting tool was in the works for more than a year and is based on a similar methodology to Atlanta's, a person familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Slok said he told clients to take an average of the two Fed numbers until both have longer track records. "Over time, we will figure out which one is better," he said.

Facebook hopes bots will send positive message; Technology: Artificial intelligence

Social network urges groups to use new platform on Messenger and help transform industries

Facebook wants businesses to use bots to communicate with customers on its Messenger service, in the hope that making its artificial intelligence tools available will transform industries.

The largest social network launched the Messenger bot platform on Tuesday, with initial partners including Bank of America, online travel service Expedia, Burger King, the fast-food chain, and news organisations such as CNN and Business Insider.

David Marcus , head of Messenger, said bots - AI-powered systems that respond to human requests - had the potential to become a "new paradigm" that would create new companies, in the same way that apps, sensors and GPS services led to the rise of ridehailing apps such as Uber.

"Traditionally in history when things become a lot easier for people, then it transformed industries," he told the Financial Times at F8, Facebook's annual developer conference in San Francisco. "Maybe what we're starting to build today will enable companies to build experiences of tomorrow that are a lot easier to use."

The move comes just weeks after Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella outlined plans to put chatbots at the centre of its future efforts, declaring "bots are the new apps". This month, Kik, a Canadian chat app, opened a "bot shop" for apps, where users can find services run by brands such as make-up retailer Sephora.

Facebook Messenger's 900m monthly users will be able to chat with automated systems to perform simple tasks such as ask for information and submit orders. They will also be able to communicate with bots run by news organisations, asking for the latest headlines on particular topics, for example.

The social network is betting that people are tiring of downloading a new app for functions they do not use every day and find surfing the mobile web clunky.

By deploying bots within Facebook Messenger, people will be able to communicate with companies without having to remember extra usernames and passwords, and with the context of their previous interactions recalled by the software.

Developers seeking to create more sophisticated bots with a wider range of functions can access Facebook's Bot Engine, the same technology it is using to develop M, its virtual personal assistant and the group's long-term bet on AI.

Mr Marcus, a former chief executive of online payments company PayPal, said about 80 per cent of time on smartphones is spent in apps, but about 80 per cent of that time is spent in just five apps. Facebook dominates the rankings, and Facebook Messenger was the fastest-growing app in the US last year.

The company is also launching a trial to allow marketers to send sponsored messages to existing customers to reengage with them.

Mr Marcus said Facebook was being "very careful" and setting rules on what advertisers are allowed to do because Messenger is mainly used for one-on-one or small group conversations and is a private space. The company says it does not want to clog it up with corporate mailshots.

"Facebook is controlling the quantity and quality because we want to ensure that what happened to email will never happen to Messenger," he said.

The new plans are the first signs of the company aiming to develop a revenue stream for Messenger, which Facebook has funded with sales from advertising in the main app's news feed. Brands will be able to pay to promote their bot in Messenger in the news feed, so people can find it and begin a conversation. Facebook will generate revenue from sponsored messages but the company says it does not intend to take a cut of any transactions made through the Messenger app.

Industries such as news and music have already been disrupted by social media, which has in many cases disintermediated their relationship with customers. If the new bots are successful, more industries including retail and online travel could become increasingly reliant on Facebook Messenger.

But Mr Marcus said companies were attracted by Messenger's huge audience.

He gave the example of an airline executive who would be pleased to reach just 10 per cent of his passengers. Messenger could enable the company to reach about 80 per cent without as much investment in its own app.

"The reach and richness of the experience is extremely appealing to businesses," Mr Marcus said.

Brian Blau, an analyst at technology research firm Gartner, said businesses were nowhere near as technologically advanced as Facebook is pushing them to be, with some just making the move from paper to digital or engaging in their first experiments with mobile.

"There are some brands on the edge that like to use the latest technology and have no problem," Mr Blau said, adding these were often action sports, drinks or travel brands.

But "99.9 per cent of the rest of the businesses on the planet are all behind".

As groups try to keep up with the pace of change in social media, they have to rely on platforms such as Facebook because they cannot build their own AI or virtual reality, Mr Blau said. "It is a risky situation for businesses to be in but then, what choice do they have?"

DigitalGenius Scores $4.1M to Enhance Customer Service

DigitalGenius Ltd. wants to use artificial intelligence to enhance the work that human customer-service agents do.

From Twitter to chatbots, the platforms that companies use to interact with their customers have ballooned in recent years.

 Artificial intelligence by itself won't take over the customer-service world," DigitalGenius Chief Strategy Officer Mikhail Naumov said.

That is why he wants to use artificial intelligence to help human customer-service representatives respond more quickly and accurately to complaints. Using old customer-service records, the company trained a deep-learning algorithm to accurately respond to emails, social media and mobile messages from customers.

The company announced it raised $4.1 million in funding from Salesforce Ventures, as well as BloombergBeta, NovelTmT, Singularity Investment and Spider Capital. Previous investors including Lerer-Hippeau Ventures, Lowercase Capital, Metamorphic Ventures and RRE also returned for the round.

He said DigitalGenius integrates with Zendesk and Salesforce to help answer questions and complaints that come to customer service agents. If it can answer the question a customer poses with a certain degree of confidence, it produces a fast answer. If it is below a certain confidence level, it gives the answer to a human representative who can approve and personalize it.

Because DigitalGenius uses a machine-learning technique called deep learning, the algorithm gets smarter as the customer-service representatives use it more.

 The artificial-intelligence trainer is the customer-service representative," Mr. Naumov said.

The company, which is based in London and New York, has worked with BMW, Unilever and Panasonic. DigitalGenius also works with an airline and telephone company.

Mr. Naumov said the service won't eliminate existing jobs because the number of customer service is increasing so dramatically. He said the  human touch" is essential to the service.

Identity Verification Company Onfido Grabs $25M

Onfido Background Checks wants to help fintech companies and on-demand startups verify identities and complete background checks.

The company has raised $25 million to expand operations in the U.S. from Crunchfund, Indivest Partners and Wellington Partners. Onfido wants to bring online the lengthy background check process that usually occurs in-person.

Onfido is currently working with companies like Handy and TaskRabbit to help them verify the identities of their workers. The company uses machine learning to carry out its verifications, so the product becomes better at spotting fraud the more checks that it does.

As it pushes into the U.S., Onfido will face competition from Checkr, a company that also conducts background screenings online. Checkr announced it raised $40 million in funding in March. The company has secured many clients in the sharing economy, including Instacart, GrubHub Holdings Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.

Investors are increasingly scrutinizing the valuations of private companies, and some are skeptical about the viability of many consumer on-demand companies.

 Changes in valuations do not take away from growth and individuals coming on to their platforms," said Onfido Chief Executive Husayn Kassai.

Mr. Kassai said the company is focusing on expanding to fintech companies as well as on-demand services and believes this diversity will allow the company to pull through any headwinds in the sharing economy.

Checkr said it was pushing farther into peer-to-peer commerce and marketplace business. It counts Warby Parker and Zenefits as clients.

Mr. Kassai said Onfido sets itself apart from traditional background checks because of its machine-learning algorithms.

 Typically with background checking companies, the more checks they do, they become worse because they use human processes," he said.  For us, the more we do the better we become."

The rise of the sharing economy has put background processes in the spotlight of regulatory decisions. Some advocates believe background checks on drivers should require an in-person check with a fingerprint, but Mr. Kassai disagrees.

 We can remotely and robustly identify individuals," Mr. Kassai said.  We're doing a lot of work to show how ours is superior."

Lightspeed Venture Partners is positioning itself to score more deals like Snapchat.

The Menlo Park-based firm, which is also adding support for its enterprise investments, is deepening its consumer bench with a few new partners.

 We were just undermanned in consumer and media," said Lightspeed partner Jeremy Liew, who led investments in Snapchat, Mic and Honest Co.  Frankly, on the consumer side, it was just me making investments, and one is not the right number."

Alex Taussig, a former partner at Highland Capital Partners, will invest in consumer companies as a Lightspeed partner. Jon Steinberg, the former president of BuzzFeed and chief executive of Daily Mail Online, joined with the title of venture partner. He will seek deals for Lightspeed, but isn't an investing partner. He will continue to perform his full-time job as chief executive of Lightspeed-backed Cheddar TV, a startup launched earlier this year producing video business news for millennials.

 If you want to be a great software investor as a firm, you have to do both [consumer and enterprise]," Mr. Taussig said. While at Highland, Mr. Taussig led investments in apparel marketplace thredUP and real estate marketplace Zillow, as well as cinematic virtual reality company JauntVR.

Messrs. Taussig and Steinberg joined Lightspeed in February, a few months after Aaron Batalion joined the firm's consumer investment team. Mr. Batalion was co-founder and chief technology officer of Lightspeed-backed social commerce startup LivingSocial Inc.

But Lightspeed isn't forgetting its roots in enterprise technology. Ajay Sudan and Sudip Chakrabarti joined Lightspeed's enterprise investing team as partners in January. Mr. Sudan was previously a product manager at Microsoft and Sense Networks and a growth executive leading health care sales at Palantir. Mr. Chakrabarti, who co-founded two software companies, has focused his work at Andreessen Horowitz on datacenter, security, analytics and cloud sectors.

The new partners will participate in Lightspeed Venture Partners XI, L.P. with $715 million of committed capital, and Lightspeed Venture Partners Select II, L.P. with $500 million of committed capital that the firm closed last month. Their additions give Lightspeed a total of 15 investment partners.

Tim Draper Puts Celebrity to Test With $190M Seed Fund

Tim Draper is putting his celebrity to work as a venture investor.

The billionaire investor, who starred in the reality TV show Startup U and tried to make Silicon Valley its own state, has raised $190 million for a seed fund. His Draper Associates fund, previously a personal investment vehicle, aims to be the first $1 million put into promising startups.

The iconic Silicon Valley venture capitalist may have stepped back from the firm whose marquee bears his name, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, yet his stature has only grown.

 I've kept a high profile and that high profile tends to generate a lot of deal flow," he said.

Draper Fisher Jurvetson has backed some of the biggest household names in tech such as Skype, Twitter and Tesla. Mr. Draper in 2014 moved back from the spotlight of investing partner from DFJ's 11th fund, but he remained on the management committee and a personal investor in that fund.

Since then, he has cultivated his persona on Startup U, the reality show set in his own real-world Draper University. The startup boot camp, which has attracted roughly 500 students and 200 companies, is a steady source of deals, he says.

Next acts and succession in venture firms, something Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers is working through as prominent investor John Doerr's role has diminished, are a delicate dance. But wholesale reinvention is an entirely different matter.

Mr. Draper is a third-generation venture capitalist. He praises his children and credits the influence his grandfather and father had on him and his children for a handed-down knack for the venture industry.

He said his daughter Jesse Draper's status as the Valley Girl in the Web-broadcasted  The Valley Girl Show" has also generated investment leads for him.

 I have backed some companies from her in my portfolio," he said.  She has got a good eye for this stuff."

Draper Associates, too, will be a family affair. Mr. Draper will continue to invest with his son Billy Draper on the roster. The Drapers will work along with Andrew Tang and Joel Yarmon as part of the investment team.

The senior Draper summed up the firm's investment thesis:  We're looking to go after industries run by oligopolies that could be run at a better cost."

Draper Associates has already made investments out of the new fund into at least three early-stage companies.

The firm has invested in AdasWorks, an artificial intelligence-based software company focused on self-driving cars. The Bulgarian startup uses neural networks to perceive what a car is seeing and uses that perception for feedback to the steering wheel, Mr. Draper sad.

In health care, the firm has invested in Verge Genomics, which runs simulations on patented drugs to see if they can be used for other treatments.

Draper Associates also has invested in Compology, a startup that puts sensors in garbage containers so that waste management companies only have to dispatch to those that need service.

Mr. Draper acknowledged that the attention of the media spotlight can attract deals. He tried to get a ballot initiative to split California into six states, giving Silicon Valley its own state, bringing him attention the past few years. He said when he talks about how the government needs to change he gets a lot of related deal flow.

He said that for all the increased media attention on DFJ-funded blood-testing startup Theranos Inc., which has come under widespread scrutiny over its technology, the venture firm is getting a lot deal flow in health care as a result.

 It kind of cracks you up," he said.

Correction: This article has been updated to correct that DFJ was not an investor in eBay. A previous version said the firm invested in eBay.

The Property Report
Italian Property IPO Set to Debut

Italy's main stock exchange is on the cusp of welcoming its first new real-estate company in a decade.

Milan-based Coima Res plans to raise 215 million euros ($245.1 million) from U.S. and European investors in an initial public offering this month. It would be the first property IPO on the FTSE MIB since 2006, according to data-provider Dealogic.

Seeking to jump-start a stagnant sector for real-estate investment trusts has been challenging, with investors fretting about volatile markets and the general lack of transparency in Italian property.

Coima reduced the target amount last week from 300 million euros in part because of such concerns. It postponed the IPO in January because of market volatility stemming from investors' worries about slowing economic growth.

Compared with January, the "general environment in the market is more volatile now, and more of a challenge," said Manfredi Catella, Coima's chief executive. "We're fully aware we're opening the market in Italy for the REIT industry."

Investor sentiment toward Italy has deteriorated significantly from a positive start to the year. In March, Italian and Swiss stocks were the least favored among European fund managers, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey. The FTSE MIB is down around 17% from the start of January in highly volatile trading.

Adding to worries, last week Italy's government cut its already cautious growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017 to 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, from 1.6% for both years.

Coima's fraught journey to the Milan bourse follows failures of other Italian real-estate firms. Two Italian property groups withdrew plans to go public last year -- one of them twice, in July and again in October, Dealogic data show. Other firms' plans for IPOs never materialized.

Meanwhile, demand for Italian commercial real estate is booming as international investors hunt for returns amid low interest rates. Commercial property transaction volumes in Italy rose 66% in 2015 from 2014, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The $9.7 billion of deals last year was just 3.4% of the European total, the data show. A lack of transparency and low deal flow are limits totransactions, analysts said.

U.S. private-equity firms like Blackstone LLP have been very active in Italy. But longer-term investors, like pension funds and sovereign-wealth funds, have largely struggled to find adequate large-scale acquisitions of properties like office buildings or shopping malls, Mr. Catella said.

Options also are slim for investors wanting to buy shares in Italian property firms, with only two major REITs listed in Milan: Beni Stabili SIIQ and Immobiliare Grande Distribuzione SIIQ.

A successful IPO from Coima is "potentially very positive for the REIT sector" both in Italy and Europe, said Peter Papadakos, managing director at real-estate firm Green Street Advisors. "It could be taken as a sign that the market for IPOs is more open than we thought," he said.

The listed real-estate sector in Europe is relatively small. According to Green Street, the market capitalization of European REITs is just 15.4% of the global total, compared with 48.4% in the U.S. and 30.8% in the Asia-Pacific region.

But markets where REITs were almost nonexistent just a few years ago -- such as Germany, Spain and Ireland -- have been growing. German REITs made up more than 19% of the European listed property market in March, compared with 3.7% at the start of 2010, Green Street data show. REITs also have sprung up in Spain and Ireland after governments eased regulations.

The Italian government softened its REIT regulation in late 2014. Analysts said Italy could be next to take off, although they cautioned that major challenges still exist.

Coima Res is being launched by Coima, a property firm set up by the Catella family in 1974. In 2007, Coima formed a business with Texas-based property investor Hines to build the 28-building Porta Nuova, one of the biggest redevelopment projects in Milan. Mr. Catella bought the majority interest from Hines's Italian fund-management business last September.

Porta Nuova was sold to sovereign-wealth fund the Qatar Investment Authority in two deals in 2013 and 2015.

The Economist explains; What bots are

As the app economy matures, a new platform emerges on smartphones

 I PROPOSE, if and when found, to take him by his beastly neck, shake him till he froths, and pull him inside out and make him swallow himself." P.G. Wodehouse thought up this treatment to punish a rival in love. But his words are also, according to Benedict Evans of Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm, a pretty good description of what is happening in the world of software for smartphones, which is constantly bundled, unbundled and rebundled. The latest product of this digital sausage-making process are  bots", or  chatbots", to be precise, which will feature prominently at Facebook's developer conference on April 12th. What are they? And will they, as some predict, be the new apps?

Bots date back to the dawn of the internet age. Early users of the network could already send short messages to computers, which would reply in a programmed way. One of the first bots was a service which suggested drinks to its users, called Bartender. AOL's Instant Messenger, a once popular messaging service, has long offered them, including SmarterChild, an early version of a virtual assistant, which was retired in 2008. Now a new generation of bots has begun to emerge. Digit, for instance, allows users to interact with their bank accounts and find ways to save money. MeeKan sets up meetings for users of Slack, a popular corporate-messaging service. Pana, an online travel agency, is an example of a bot which relies on both automation and humans to turn text messages into bookings. In June Telegram, a messaging app with Russian origins and more than 100m users, launched a bot platform and a  bot store". It now counts thousands of bots, such as news alerts from media organisations, or feeds that link to football videos or porn.

If bots are again multiplying, it is thanks to several developments. As services based on artificial intelligence improve, they need a way to talk to real people and bots are an option (which is why they are also called  conversational interfaces"). Download numbers are still growing, but the app economy is clearly maturing: a quarter of all apps are abandoned after a single use. Only instant messaging bucks the trend: more than 2.5 billion people now have at least one messaging app installed, meaning that they are used to a text-based interface. Users should also find bots smoother to use than apps: installation takes seconds; switching between bots does not involve tapping on another app icon. And both Facebook and Microsoft have an interest in pushing bots: most smartphones are powered by operating systems controlled either by Apple or Google; the bot market, by contrast, is unconquered territory.

Whether bots will become the new apps is an entirely different question, however. Much will depend on  killer bots" hugely popular services that work best in the form of bots and turn using them into a daily habit. Toby Coppel of Mosaic Ventures, a venture-capital firm, sees health care as a promising market. Bots could deal with routine ailments and send difficult ones to a doctor. Ted Livingston, the founder of Kik, a messaging app which has launched a "bot shop", expects  instant interaction" to dominate. He predicts businesses won't just have phone numbers and web pages, but bots too. Restaurants could take orders via instant message as some do already in China. Yet the most successful  killer bot" may be of another sort: a personal bot (let's call him  botler"), who automatically deals with the digital deluge generated by other bots.

U.S. Clarifies Role of Lead Auditors in Corporate Financial Reports; Public Company Accounting Oversight Board wants parties in group audits identified and supervised

Auditors who contract other accountants or accounting firms to review a company's financial reports would need to increase supervision of the work they delegate under a proposal from the government's audit-industry regulator.

The proposal, issued on Tuesday by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, clarifies the lead auditor's responsibilities for planning, supervising and evaluating the work of other auditors. The new rules also would require the lead auditor to disclose which portion of the financial statement was audited by other parties and identify those auditors.

 Investors depend on the lead auditor to provide assurance that there are no material misstatements in audited financial statements or material weaknesses in internal control, no matter where those misstatements or weaknesses may reside," PCAOB Chairman James R. Doty said.

These group audits have become more common in recent years, as companies with international operations require accounting audits that span the globe. About 80% of Fortune 500 audits performed by so-called U.S. global network firms, which have affiliates around the world, involved other auditors, according to a PCAOB analysis of data from Audit Analytics and Standard & Poor's.

PCAOB inspections show that the other contracted auditors on average reviewed financial information covering between a third and half of the total assets and revenue of the audited company.

The proposed rule aims to buttress the lead auditor's ability to detect or prevent flaws in the work of other auditors.

It will require greater communication between the lead auditor and other auditors, access to other auditors' work papers and calls for the lead auditor to supervise the areas of greatest risk.

 It just makes sense for the lead auditor to take responsibility for the areas that pose higher risks," said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, an organization of pension funds and other asset owners that focuses on corporate governance. Mr. Bertsch said his organization is still reviewing the proposal, but is broadly supportive of the PCAOB's effort.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, one of the Big Four accounting firms,  is supportive of the PCAOB in undertaking their project to strengthen the supervision of other auditors," said Mike Gallagher, managing partner audit quality at the firm.

The PCAOB move comes in response to regulator and investor concerns about material misstatements in such audits, particularly those in jurisdictions with less stringent financial reporting standards.

 These are large, complicated audits that span the globe and our oversight activities have shown that we really do need better oversight of auditors in this area," said Jeanette M. Franzel, a PCAOB member, at the board's meeting on Tuesday.

The board is accepting public comments on this proposal through July 29, including those regarding the amount of time auditors would need before it becomes effective upon approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Business
Three Stubborn Types of Mistakes Dog Financial Reporting; Errors involving debt and equity, cash flows or taxes accounted for over half last year s revisions and restatements

An internal auditor at Bank of America Corp., routinely sifting through the bank's financial reports last summer, noticed something awry with its cash-flow statement.

More checking confirmed that the bank had misclassified $3.4 billion in noncash transactions as investments, rather than funds from day-to-day activities over the previous six quarters, said a person familiar with the matter.

As a result, Bank of America joined Nike Inc. and Alphabet Inc. as one the 663 U.S. companies that filed financial revisions or restatements last year, according to research firm Audit Analytics.

While that number is down 60% from a decade ago, three types of accounting missteps remain stubbornly common,  a trend some auditors say suggests that finance chiefs are struggling with complex rules, rather than trying to mislead.

Over half of last year's corrections involved debt and equity, cash flows or taxes. The frequency of these errors has more than doubled since 2002, when the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-governance law was enacted, partly to increase managerial accountability.

 These areas are complex, and they happen late in the financial-reporting process, late in the audit process, so it actually makes sense that there are mistakes in these areas," said Trent Gazzaway, a national managing partner at Grant Thornton LLP.  I think that you were always going to see these three issues very high up."

In last year's third-quarter earnings statement, Bank of America reported that correcting its mistake had no impact on its income or balance sheet, an example of how the severity of accounting errors has declined in recent years.

Restatements which correct mistakes serious enough to make a company's previous financial reports unreliable accounted for just 24% of last year's corrections, down from 68% in 2005. By contrast, a revision involves a small correction to financial statements that passes the regulatory tests for having no material impact on the company's account of its performance.

The decline in restatements at least partly reflects tougher regulations and enforcement, which encourage more vigilance.  Better internal controls mean you will have fewer mistakes," said Don Whalen, director of research at Audit Analytics.  When they do a make a mistake, they seem to find it faster."

Errors in accounting for debt and equity often crop up because companies are increasingly dealing with complicated financial contracts and instruments. Two months before private-equity firm KKR & Co. took it public, payment- technology company First Data Corp. received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission asking questions about the company's treatment of certain debt.

First Data said that when it refinanced debt with borrowings of similar maturities, it had long classified the debt as modified, rather than extinguished. But company executives decided that approach was wrong. The reversal resulted in a $56 million loss from the debt extinguishment for 2013. And it led to a further $79 million loss in 2014. The changes were treated as immaterial, warranting only a revision, and not a restatement.

 There are many estimates made in accounting, which are vetted throughout a reasonable range of expectations," said Thomas Gibson, former chief accounting officer of Accretive Health Inc., a Chicago-based provider of support services for physicians. The company restated its 2011 figures at the end of 2014, and filed its 2012 and 2013 financials late. Mr. Gibson said he spent eight months on that effort.

Accountants have a leg-up in compiling cash-flow statements because they know from the outset a company's cash position at the start and the end of a reporting period. Still, cash-flow errors are the No. 2 source of financial revisions and restatements.

Nike said it miscategorized $312 million in foreign-currency balances held by some of its foreign subsidiaries for the six months ended Nov. 30, 2014. Nike erroneously recorded these figures as the results of swings in foreign-exchange rates, rather than cash from operations.

Nike revised its fiscal 2013 and 2014 financial statements, but said the error had no bearing on its net income.

 The company has well-established internal review procedures that identified these immaterial misclassifications and corrected them," a Nike spokesman said.

Tax errors are the third-most-common cause of financial restatements. Experts say complex tax codes are to blame.

Taxes contributed to a $711 million revision by Alphabet in 2015 the year's biggest. In last year's second quarter the tech giant found it had for years incorrectly apportioned sales to its business entities outside the U.S. That meant it booked lower taxes than it should have.

Alphabet, then known as Google, retroactively raised its income-tax expense for 2008 through the first quarter of 2015. It also reclassified certain revenues by attributing them to its U.S. business, and not its  rest of world" operations.

Despite the overall size of the revision, the mistake wasn't considered material because its impact was diluted when spread out over the period, the company said. The error didn't affect the company's consolidated revenue.

But dollar amounts aren't everything. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. has been dogged by revenue-recognition troubles that appear to center on just $58 million, a sum it erroneously booked in 2014.  Some investors and short sellers have questioned Valeant's business model and accounting practices, driving down the company's share price.  

The company recently told investors and regulators it will need to restate its financial results for 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, for which previous reports aren't reliable.

A Valeant spokesman declined to comment.

Livongo Health, which has created a digital-health platform for managing diabetes and other chronic diseases, has secured $44.5 million in a Series C financing that should enable it to turn profitable next year.

New investors included Cowen Private Investments, Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, Sapphire Ventures, Wanxiang America Corp. and Zaffre Investments. Existing investors Draper Fisher Jurvetson, General Catalyst Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and 7wire Ventures also participated. Livongo raised a $20 million Series B round last year and a $10 million Series A financing in 2014.

Livongo clients include self-insured companies that aim to lower costs tied to diabetes, which affects 29.1 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Livongo's system includes a cellular glucose meter that transmits blood sugar readings to the company's cloud. Livongo uses analytics to process the data and provide guidance to patients. It also employs certified diabetes educators who provide coaching and instruct users on what to do when their blood sugar rises too high or low.

Someone with a very high or low blood sugar reading would be contacted by a Livongo diabetes educator within 60 to 90 seconds, according to Chief Executive Glen Tullman. The company's system also connects diabetes patients to their care team, which can include medical professionals, family and friends.

Livongo, whose customers include employers like Lowe's Companies Inc. and Office Depot Inc., finished last year with 5,000 people using its system. That figure now approaches 10,000, and by year-end Livongo expects to have 40,000 users, Mr. Tullman said. The Mountain View, Calif., company expects to turn profitable in mid-2017, he said. He declined to discuss its revenue.

This financing will enable Livongo to improve its ability to provide personalized information patients and to expand its offerings. The company is looking at ways to help patients manage other chronic conditions, such as hypertension and depression, according to Mr. Tullman.

Other venture-backed companies with mobile technologies for diabetes patients include Telcare Inc., whose cellular-enabled blood glucose meter tracks glucose readings and connects with the patient's care team.

Merck Global Health Innovation Fund will gain a seat on the Livongo board. The representative joining the board has yet to be disclosed.

Former FDIC Head Sheila Bair Talks Risk With IBM s Watson; Ms. Bair banters with Watson about positives and challenges of risk in 30-second spot

To promote its Watson technology's ability to process large amounts of unstructured data, IBM has turned to public figures who symbolize the difficulty and beauty of human cognition Bob Dylan, Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings, and now, former top banking regulator Sheila Bair.

In a new TV advertisement, Ms. Bair tells Watson, a responsive computer platform, that embracing risk is a necessary part of building a business, but that it must be properly understood and managed. IBM promotes Watson as a way for companies to use  cognitive analytics [to] make sense of complex data to help people and institutions manage risk."

 I do believe that regulators need to keep up with innovation which can be a force for good or bad depending on how it is used," Ms. Bair said in an email to The Wall Street Journal.  One of the things I like about Watson is that it is designed to work with and support human intelligence and decision-making, not replace it."

She added that one of the problems in the lead-up to the financial crisis was that too many people used computer models to  do their thinking for them," without applying  common sense and judgment."

Ms. Bair, who served as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman during the financial crisis, spends the 30-second spot bantering with Watson about the positives and challenges of risk, particularly for innovation-focused businesses. In earlier ads, Watson discussed the meaning of Mr. Dylan's lyrics and reminisced about his 2011 Jeopardy! win over Mr. Jennings.

While at the FDIC, Ms. Bair sharply criticized the role played by the largest banks in the lead-up to the financial crisis and successfully pushed for powers for the FDIC to supervise and take over complex financial institutions. She frequently called out financial firms for touting mortgage-backed securities and other complex products as  innovation," while simultaneously putting the financial system at grave risk.

But while failures in risk management played a major role in the financial system's meltdown in 2008, Ms. Bair takes pains to encourage responsible risk-taking. Risk, Ms. Bair points out in the commercial, is  the only way businesses grow."

Ms. Bair was "http://www.wsj.com/articles/online-lender-avant-names-sheila-bair-to-board-1459503001" of Avant Inc., a Chicago-based online lender, as financial technology firms prepare for more attention from federal regulators. In her email, she said that there is no link between her appointment and the advertisement, saying that IBM had contacted her due to her work during the financial crisis.

Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced an effort, dubbed  supporting responsible innovation" to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/thomas-curry-calls-for-balanced-fintech-framework-1459441875" for fintech firms, an approach that was praised by many in the industry.

Mixpanel CEO s Unicorn Dreams Take a Back Seat to Cutting Costs

Eighteen months ago, Suhail Doshi vowed that Mixpanel Inc., the app analytics startup he co-founded, would be valued at $1 billion, making it what Silicon Valley calls a unicorn.

He nearly made it, securing a $65 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz that valued the company at $865 million.

But Mixpanel's efforts to fuel rapid growth cost the startup, which is now struggling to regain its stature in a highly competitive industry. Its story reflects those of other startups seduced by a period of highflying valuations in a venture industry that is now cooling as investors write down investments and slow their deal pace.

To move forward, the 27-year-old chief executive of Mixpanel said he needs to forget about growth or fundraising and instead get the company's spending under control.

Mr. Doshi and co-founder Tim Trefren dropped out of Arizona State University in 2009 and wrote software to help websites track users' visits, clicks and conversions. Amid the recession they raised $12 million in seed and Series A funding from venture-capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as an elite list of angel investors. The company spent almost nothing on marketing but caught on with developers. It reached profitability in 2012.

In the fall 2014 Mixpanel had $22 million in the bank and didn't need more money. But Mr. Doshi raised more anyway, telling The Wall Street Journal he wanted to  re-up the risk in the startup."

Andreessen Horowitz wouldn't give him the billion-dollar valuation he sought, but the near unicorn status stake came in higher than any of the half-dozen venture firms Mr. Doshi pitched. Sequoia Capital didn't participate. A person with knowledge of the matter said the firm had a conflict due to another investment.

In a recent interview, Mr. Doshi said Mixpanel  could have pushed our investors" to value it at $1 billion in 2014.  We really kind of just realized that at the end of the day, that was just ego getting in the way of things." At that time, there were 79 private companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture-capital firms world-wide, according to The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones VentureSource.

Like many unicorn hopefuls, Mixpanel sacrificed profitability for growth. During 2015 and 2016, Mixpanel planned to triple its sales staff, open offices abroad, acquire machine-learning startups and develop new analytics products for sales and finance, according to the pitch deck it used to raise the Series B.

The growth made Mr. Doshi, whose only prior professional experience was a summer internship as a software engineer at Slide, the very involved CEO of 200-plus employees. More experience joined the helm when Matt Cooley became chief revenue officer in summer 2014.

Mr. Doshi spent six months persuading Mr. Cooley to leave his position as vice president of world-wide sales at New Relic Inc., an enterprise analytics platform then valued over $1 billion and months away from an IPO. Mr. Cooley, who was well-liked by staff, took over sales hiring and added about 60 positions. In April the company opened an office of about 20 in New York's SoHo.

At Mixpanel's founding, it occupied a lucrative niche. Freemium pricing put it within reach of startups that couldn't afford legacy tools like Adobe's Omniture. But Mixpanel's position slid once competitors began offering the company's core usage metrics at steep discounts, according to former employees.

 There's kind of a basic part of analytics that's been commoditized," said Spenser Skates, chief executive of Mixpanel competitor Amplitude Analytics Inc., which, in the words of one former Mixpanel employee,  definitely tried to cut the legs out from under us." Clients such as education startup Coursera left for competitors, former employees said. Mr. Doshi declined to comment on particular customers, but said Mixpanel had also taken customers from lower-priced competitors.

Mixpanel repeatedly missed sales targets and failed to hit its 2015 revenue goal, according to former employees. Yet Mixpanel nearly met its ambitious hiring goals. It doubled its employees, reaching about 240 in early January 2016. Mr. Doshi declined to comment on the company's revenue or targets.

As mutual funds wrote down the value of their shares in highly valued startups such as Dropbox in the fall of 2015, industry experts predicted that venture capitalists would tighten their purse strings. Around the start of the year, Mr. Doshi said he spoke with a banker  to determine how much risk we could take." He declined to provide details but said the conversation persuaded him to set aside growth and reassess spending.

In January Mixpanel laid off 18 employees, primarily in sales. Mr. Doshi said the company cut its weekly catered lunch budget by $2,000 and shelved plans for acquisitions, international offices and new analytics products for sales and finance.

Mr. Cooley left Mixpanel in early March. Mr. Doshi declined to discuss the circumstances of his departure. Mr. Cooley confirmed he was no longer with Mixpanel but declined to explain why.

Mr. Doshi said he has no plans to raise funding. He declined to discuss the company's burn rate or how much it had in the bank.

At $865 million, its valuation in its 2014 financing, Mixpanel is one of the highest-valued among comparable analytics startups. Industry experts say Mixpanel may soon find itself in the same position as cloud-storage companies that won high valuations before Google and Amazon drove down prices. Dropbox, valued at $10 billion in 2014, has seen mutual funds write down their shares in the company. Box went public last year to a strong debut, then saw its market capitalization fall by about half. A similar fate may await some of the 146 private companies valued at $1 billion or more, experts say.

The cuts have hit Mixpanel's competitors as well: Localytics laid off 37 people, or 15% of its staff, in January. Optimizely laid off 40, or 10% of its staff, in March.

Still, Mr. Doshi said the company is still growing. He said most of the cuts have  had to do with how to do more with less."

Tech Firms Help Get Women On Track

As tech firms compete in an escalating battle for talent, some are targeting what they consider an undervalued source: women returning to the workforce.

Companies including International Business Machines Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., as well as smaller startups, are using internships and other programs to help women get back to work and up to speed on the latest technology they need to be competitive in the workplace.

 The war for talent is so extreme that we're seeing CEOs sitting around, saying,  Who have we not gone after? Maybe we need to find women who are at home with kids?'   says Valerie Frederickson, CEO of human-resource executive search firm Frederickson Pribula Li.

Interning helped Lisa Stephens, a former IBM engineer, land a job after taking time off to raise her two sons for 20 years. To prepare for re-entering the workforce, she enrolled in an IT management Master's program.  The whole idea of software had changed very much since I learned it in the  80s," Ms. Stephens says.

When she applied for jobs at tech companies, however, none called her back. So Ms. Stephens completed a paid internship for women returning to the workforce at email-marketing firm Return Path Inc. near Denver. After 14 weeks of coding exercises, she was hired full time as a software engineer at Return Path.

The tech industry has a shortage of qualified job candidates. The unemployment rate in Silicon Valley is less than 4%, lower than the California and national rates, according to the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies.

 Every company today is dealing with how to bring in good talent," says John Donahoe, chairman of the board of PayPal. Hiring women returning to the workforce  is a source of competitive advantage."

Companies seeking out women who have been out of the workplace for an extended time say they are easier to hire because there is less competition for them.

Amy Pressman, co-founder of customer-relationship management startup Medallia Inc., found it difficult to compete for job candidates during her company's early days five years ago. She reached out to women after learning that one of her classmates from Stanford's Graduate School of Business had a hard time finding work after taking a six-year hiatus to raise children.

 We made a conscious decision to focus on hiring people others were ignoring," Ms. Pressman says.

Many women face hurdles in returning to work after stepping away for an extended period.

Nearly 90% attempt to resume their careers, but only 40% land full-time jobs, according to the Center for Talent Innovation, a nonprofit research organization focused on minority groups in the workplace. About 25% of women who attempt to resume their careers take part-time jobs, and roughly 10% become self-employed, the Center said.

The programs that companies such as Google have piloted to help women engineers return to work is in response to the skills gap the women may face. Due to the fast-changing nature of the tech industry, the gap can be greater than in other sectors.

 You can't just take a 10-year pause, come back and be fully effective," says Diane Flynn, chief marketing officer for startup accelerator GSVlabs, a portfolio company of investment firm Global Silicon Valley.

Last year, she started the firm's Reboot Career Accelerator for Women, an eight-week program that teaches skills such as design thinking, shared calendars and personal branding. IBM provided initial funding, and Google and Facebook have invited Reboot's students to visit their corporate campuses. Employees from Apple Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. have assisted with lessons.

Tech lags behind other industries in welcoming women back. In financial services, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley formed midcareer re-entry programs years ago. Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. contacts former female employees to see whether they are interested in returning.

By targeting this population, tech companies also are trying to fix a weakness in the industry: the under-representation of women. Tech companies have among the lowest participation of women of any sector, according to data from LeanIn.Org and McKinsey.

IBM's initiative to hire women returning to work began in 2012 as it developed new businesses including artificial intelligence, cloud-computing, security and data analytics. The company was facing a shortage of candidates amid competition from a newer generation of tech companies.

 We realized we had an enormous opportunity to tap the supply of female talent," says IBM human resources Vice President Lindsay-Rae McIntyre.

IBM created an alumni network to connect on social media with former employees who had stopped working. Dozens of women from the network have now rejoined IBM. That network helped Mary Kolbenschlag, a computer program manager, return to work a year after she left IBM in 2014 to care for her husband who was severely injured in a bicycle accident.

In the summer of 2015, one of her former IBM mentors offered her a role with a division that matched her prior work experience. She didn't know his outreach was part of the initiative to win back women who had left IBM.  If my mentor hadn't called me, I don't think I would have returned to IBM," Ms. Kolbenschlag says.

Japan Tech Hunts for Restart Button; There s hope that entrepreneurs can rekindle the economy but it can be a hard place to get a startup going

TOKYO Stacks of cardboard boxes serve as makeshift partitions at Mistletoe Inc.'s new office in Tokyo's posh Aoyama district, where startups gather to work on their latest projects.

The do-it-yourself vibe a far cry from the stuffiness typical of Japanese corporate offices is something founder Taizo Son, serial entrepreneur and youngest brother of SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son, wants to see more of.

 Japan has the talent and funds but lacks the necessary ecosystem to create its own Silicon Valley, so that's what we're trying to provide," said Mr. Son, 43, who describes Mistletoe as a program to cofound new businesses.

The nation that created the Walkman and the bullet train before China even had a tech industry now lags behind as Chinese Internet startups like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. become global powerhouses. With its "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444840104577551972061864692" Japan is counting on entrepreneurs to rekindle its hobbling economy.

The government is pledging to fund startups, top universities have launched incubators and venture funds to transform their wealth of knowledge into innovation and even Japan's oldest and largest conglomerates, such as the Mitsubishi and Mitsui groups, are looking to nurture entrepreneurs.

Some startups have reached prominence in recent years. Euglena Co., a "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/07/25/is-this-the-future-of-food/" that launched in 2005 and went public in 2012, has a market capitalization of more than $1 billion. Mercari Inc., operator of a peer-to-peer shopping app launched in 2013, raised around $75 million last month, valuing it at over $1 billion.

But venture-capital investments in Japan last year totaled just $629 million, according to AVCJ Research, compared with $59.1 billion in the U.S., according to the National Venture Capital Association.

There are still relatively few people willing to risk choosing entrepreneurship over a job at a big company. Even as the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-expects-biggest-ever-yearly-loss-1454567056" and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sharp-in-talks-over-panel-business-after-hefty-loss-1446205138" show there is no security in size, there remains a deeply ingrained reverence toward large corporations.

Take Yoshiyuki Taguchi, a 22-year-old intern at Slush Asia, an offshoot of a popular "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303289904579197803449054732" While he wanted to continue with Slush after graduation, his family insisted he join a  listed, famous" company. After arguing for a month, he took a job with a major human resources firm.

Antti Sonninen, chief executive of Slush Asia, said Japan needs more entrepreneurs-turned-investors to serve as role models.

 Those guys can give the best advice on how to build the next-generation, world-changing companies," he said.

That is what Mr. Son is attempting to do through Mistletoe, which supports startup-education programs and pitch events where entrepreneurs try to sell their ideas to investors while working with ventures to find solutions to problems in areas from transportation to Japan's aging population.

Mr. Son calls himself part of the first generation of Japanese entrepreneurs that launched startups during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Fundraising then was a nightmare, he says, with significantly less money available for entrepreneurs and banks reluctant to lend to unknown businesses.

A lot has changed since then. Today's entrepreneurs can point to the success of some of those unknown businesses the likes of e-commerce company Rakuten Inc. and mobile Internet operation DeNA Corp. have become household names in Japan, if not world-wide.

The number of companies going public reached an eight-year high last year at 98, around two-thirds of which listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Mothers market for high-growth startups, according to the Japan Exchange Group.

Mr. Son's startup successes include Yahoo Japan, which he helped launch in 1996 while still a student at the University of Tokyo, and which now runs Japan's largest portal site, and Gungho Online Entertainment Inc., which produces top-grossing videogames like Puzzle & Dragons.

His mission now is to relay his decades of experience to a new generation of entrepreneurs. While his older brother has led telecommunications and Internet giant SoftBank in big, bold overseas bets including the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-profit-nearly-triples-1438842764" Corp. in 2013 and a recent "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-investment-in-india-could-exceed-10-billion-1452927757" and other parts of Asia the younger Mr. Son appears dedicated to energizing his local startup scene from the ground up.

Mistletoe's 1,300-square-meter  startup studio," as he calls it, offers participants workspace and the assistance of a staff that includes experts in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to industrial design.

 It can be hard to attract the necessary talent to launch a startup, so we work with them and provide advice," he said.

Tenants include Fove Inc., which is developing an eye-tracking virtual reality headset. Mistletoe also invests directly in about 20 startups, including Fomm Corp., which is making affordable compact electric vehicles that can move on water aimed at flood-prone markets like Thailand and Indonesia.

The next step would be a successful product release.

 There's a lot of support in Japan available for launching startups, but what's important is to establish structures for businesses to commercialize innovation," said Atsuko Nomura, senior researcher at the Japan Research Institute.  That's where large companies could come in, but we're not seeing enough of that."

With the advent of the "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/tag/internet-of-things/" a network of devices connected to the Internet Mr. Son says there is big potential for Japan, a country that has traditionally excelled in producing hardware.

 Japan's large, established companies are still home to very powerful, innovative technologies, but they are risk-averse compared with startups that have nothing to lose," he said.  The way for Japan to develop its own unique ecosystem is to have them both coexist and cooperate, and we'd like to be that bridge."

INSIDE LONDON
Let's all dress up as our favourite bitcoin characters

We had news this week that Circle Internet Financial, a US start-up, was hooking up with Barclays in the UK to allow users of its mobile app to transfer money between them. Circle will take a sterling amount from your bank account, turn it into bitcoin, send it to your nominated recipient and then turn it back into sterling.

This is the latest advance in the company's impressive mission to "change the world economy". Which begs the question: for the worse?

Logical thinkers might assume that the most efficient way to transfer sterling to someone else over the internet is to send them sterling direct using any existing service rather than faff about with a stupid crypto-currency that takes 1,000 times longer to clear through the payment system and burns holes in the ozone layer in the process.

Existing online payment transfer systems might be clunky, but do we need to co-opt a comic, energy-burning software platform promoted by techno-utopians who want to abolish central governments?

But that would be anti-bitcoin thinking - and an affront to some of the most intelligent people in the country, such as the government's chief scientific adviser. Sir Mark Walport told us this year that systems based on bitcoin's distributed public ledger, the blockchain, might well save the National Health Service and would certainly help with a host of other public service functions , from issuing passports to collecting taxes. Somehow.

A piece of bitcoin news we did not get this week was the real identity of the person known as Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous bitcoin inventor.

As Izabella Kaminska revealed on FT Alphaville , our financial blog, advisers purporting to work for Craig Wright, an Australian tech entrepreneur, who was named as the real Satoshi last year, have been trying to get London media organisations to sign up to embargoes ahead of a so-called Big Reveal in the UK, this week or next.

Mr Wright, it has been said, is about to perform a crypto-miracle, proving his credentials - which fuelled another wave of bitcoin debate online over whether or not he is the real deal.

Should we worry that all this wingnuttery is increasingly entering the mainstream? Perhaps it is just a financial version of "cosplay", a game enjoyed by many in which adults dress up as their favourite fictional characters. Cosplay apparently offers therapeutic help and a creative outlet to those working with dreams and memories.

And something similar is taking place with bitcoin. It allows financial minds to roam free in a techno-nirvana, slaying mighty beasts such as the Bank of England along the way.

Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville, Circle's founders, present themselves as the financial revolutionaries of our day, declaring: "Let's change money together!"

But cosplay enthusiasts pay their way, at least bringing their costumes to the game, whereas the machinery underlying bitcoin and the energy burnt to maintain the network seem to be paid for by an endless supply of venture capital.

Meanwhile, there is the persistent idea that anything bitcoin-related somehow avoids a cost to the end consumer. Circle's services are free. It says there are no fees for sending money, even if you are turning pounds into dollars (via bitcoin) or the other way round. Can that really be the case? Are they farming users' data? Gouging through FX rates? Burning VC capital as they gun for market share? What?

It is an established fact in the modern world that if something is offered for free, the recipient is the product.

No matter. Here is what Circle sign-ups are told: "How exactly are we doing this? Unlike existing systems that are closed and proprietary, we use open internet standards and protocols, including the blockchain (allowing us to offer this service for free). We also foster innovative approaches to risk, including our AI risk engine, which runs on cutting-edge algorithms that continuously keep your money safe."

So, an artificial intelligence risk engine, running cutting-edge algorithms. That's OK then - so long as everyone involved is just playing fantasy finance.

Banks tap into the needs of millennials; Going mobile: App generation

Lenders use selfies and thumbprints as battle for younger customers heats up

On the bus to work at 7.30am, most commuters are half asleep, but 26-year-old Henrietta Hunter is doing her banking over her mobile phone.

As messages from friends come through, she can transfer cash to them with a couple of taps on her banking app. "I do not want to waste time queueing at a branch on my weekend," says the production manager from Stockwell, south London.

She is not alone. Accenture, the consultancy, polled 3,000 consumers and found 41 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds now check their balance on their phones. "In 10 years' time banking will be unrecognisable," says Warren Mead at KPMG, another consultancy. The lines between banking and the digital world are blurring and will soon disappear altogether, he predicts. Banks are under pressure to cater for their younger customers by developing their own mobile services and face fierce competition from a range of technology companies, from nimble start-ups to giants such as PayPal.

A survey last month of 200 senior bank executives by technology company Temenos showed 57 per cent believed more money would flow via digital businesses than traditional retail banks by 2020. This week saw the launch of the UK's first digital-only lender , Atom Bank, which has no branches and boasts customers can log into their accounts by taking a "selfie".

"Look how quickly a 20-year-old takes a selfie of themselves - there is a familiarity with apps that thrive on the quick capture of information, images in particular," says Edward Twiddy, the bank's chief operations officer.

Tandem Bank, another digital start-up that has won a banking licence, promises to be mobile-based and is trying to build a community of "co-founders" who pitch ideas about how to improve banking. Ricky Knox, at Tandem, says there are "massive differences in behaviour" in the millennial generation because it has grown up with smartphones.

A survey by Tandem of 2,000 people aged between 26 and 36 showed that nearly a third would switch banks simply on the strength of a mobile app.

Payment methods are also changing. Some pub chains are now allowing customers to buy their drinks by taking a thumbprint on a mobile app powered by MasterCard. More than 3m customers are also now using Pingit, an app by Barclays that lets people "ping" money to a mobile phone number.

Maceo Frederick, a 25-year-old trainee accountant, says he rarely uses cash machines, never visits branches, and sends money through Pingit. He adds he would switch banks to whoever had the best digital service.

Banks are experimenting with voice technology and artificial intelligence.

Earlier this month Santander UK created a voice-based service , similar to iPhone's Siri, that allows customers to command their phone to tell them their payments history. The bank will soon allow people to command their phone to make a payment.

Royal Bank of Scotland is using an artificial intelligence program, called Luvo, to talk to customers with "personality" and help them with queries.

Branches still have a role to play, even though they are in decline. Research by consultancy firm CACI forecasts that the number of branch visits by current account customers is expected to fall to 268m by 2020, while mobile app usage is on track to more than double to 2.3bn.

For Rosie Shimell, 27, a political researcher from Dulwich, branches are still a vital part of banking services. "I like that my bank has high street branches, mainly because if you have a problem, it can be easier to pop in and speak to someone rather than wait to get through to a call-centre." She also puts more faith in traditional lenders.

Mr Frederick says: "I would rather stick to the high street banks than a new digital bank or technology company because I'm already comfortable with them, I have no problems and if I moved, I would not know what to ex-pect, I would be starting from scratch."

Man who sought to apply Wall Street strategy to basketball shoots and misses

A young basketball executive who tried to apply the number-crunching techniques of Wall Street to the game but fell flat on his face has delivered a rambling resignation letter of more than 7,000 words seen as one of the epic executive parting shots of all time.

Sam Hinkie, a 38-year-old product of Stanford business school, had been hired in 2013 as general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team by owners including leading private equity executives as Blackstone's David Blitzer and Apollo's Josh Harris as well as Will Smith, the Philadelphia rapper turned Hollywood actor.

Mr Blitzer and Mr Harris have fared little better in the English Premier League. After spending 100m for 36 per cent of Crystal Palace when the football club was sixth in the table last December, the club has since recorded just one win.

The Philadelphia 76ers had hoped Mr Hinkie would be another Billy Beane, the analytics-minded baseball executive immortalised in the Michael Lewis book Moneyball for unearthing undervalued players by analysing performance metrics. However, the 76ers are on track for one of the worst seasons in National Basketball Association history.

Mr Hinkie reflected on their dire 10-68 result in a resignation letter this week that runs more than five times the length of the 1776 Declaration of Independence and includes quotes from Abraham Lincoln and Warren Buffett.

His farewell has already become one of the most intensely parsed resignation letters since Greg Smith's 2012 dispatch for The New York Times titled "Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs". Modelled on the letters sent to investors by fund managers and market sages, Mr Hinkie's missive to "the equity partners of Philadelphia 76ers, LP" compared his decision to step down to that of a 38-year-old Mr Buffett to shut down his investment fund in May 1969.

"It pains me that . . . I would go at the end of a particularly down year in the standings," he wrote. "But the fact is - and a young Buffett said it much better than I ever could - 'I am not attuned to this environment, and I don't want to spoil a decent record by trying to play a game I don't understand just so I can go out a hero.' "

The blogosphere responded with derision. One scribe on the sports site Deadspin said that the letter was "a giant blinking warning sign to any future employer".

Autonomous Delivery Vehicle Company Dispatch Drives $2M in Seed Funding

Dispatch wants its autonomous vehicles to make on-demand delivery available to the masses.

The company announced on Wednesday it has grabbed $2 million in seed financing led by Andreessen Horowitz. This is the second investment Andreessen Horowitz partner Chris Dixon made this week in autonomous vehicles, following the investment in Comma.ai he announced Sunday.

 I'm really excited about autonomous vehicles in general," Mr. Dixon said.  Machine learning and deep learning is only recently at the point where you can really make a high-quality, highly autonomous, safe vehicle. It's going to open up all sorts of vehicles."

Dispatch develops a vehicle it nicknamed  Carry" to travel on sidewalks and pedestrian areas. The robot, which looks like a large cooler on wheels, can carry up to 100 pounds and travels at the same speed humans walk. It has four compartments that users unlock with their smartphones when it arrives.

Users can track Carry as it travels to them, and it is programmed to move at the speed people around it are walking. The Dispatch team says that Carry has never bumped into anyone, and even if it did, it would be negligible due to the vehicle's slow speeds.

The founders, Stav Braun, Sonia Jin and Uriah Baalke, are former computer vision researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of Pennsylvania.

The Dispatch founders said they hope the vehicles will mitigate the cost of delivery because it can save labor costs by bringing packages right to a customer's door. It does face competition in the sector from Starship Technologies, a  ground drone," which two Skype co-founders created.

Right now, Dispatch is still being tested. The company has two Carry vehicles that are making deliveries on the California State University Monterey Bay campus and the Menlo College campus.

Dispatch's funding comes as autonomous vehicles are in the spotlight. General Motors Co. purchased Cruise Automation Inc., a startup that developed a system for applying autonomous-driving software to existing vehicles. The Wall Street Journal reported the deal is valued at more than $1 billion.

Larger companies such as Alphabet Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. are heavily investing in autonomous automobiles. The Dispatch team thinks its focus on delivering items will separate it from competitors focused on transporting humans.

 I don't think the big tech companies are working on sidewalk drones," Mr. Dixon said.

Mr. Dixon thinks even as large public tech companies take a capital intensive approach to autonomous vehicles, there's room for startups. He compared startups like Dispatch to the navigation app Waze, which managed to collect better data about traffic than Google by involving regular users.

AI Startup X.ai Takes In $23M Series B for Scheduling Assistance

Virtual agents and chat bots may be the next thing in software, but getting an artificial intelligence product into the market can be an expensive and technically challenging undertaking.

After two years of development by dozens of data scientists and software engineers, New York startup X.ai Inc. says that 100% of the responses of its scheduling assistant are machine-generated. Humans are still involved in teaching the algorithms to understand what users are asking, said Dennis Mortensen, the startup's co-founder and chief executive.

The goal is to get X.ai's assistant, named Amy or Andrew, to run entirely on its own. Then the company could aim for big clients such as banks.

To get there, the pre-revenue startup has raised a $23 million Series B round, Mr. Mortensen told VentureWire. Two Sigma Ventures, the venture arm of hedge fund Two Sigma Investments, which uses data science approaches in investing, led the round.

The deal brings X.ai's funding to $34.5 million. Its post-money valuation is about $100 million.

The New York startup says its productivity tool could free up humans from the email ping pong around setting up meetings. Without any downloads, users copy X.ai's virtual assistant on an email they send to contacts with whom they'd like to meet. The AI taps the customer's calendar to find the best time and place.

X.ai's investors are making a bet that businesses with office workers would be willing to trust AI with their calendars, as well as with maintaining polite conversation on their behalf with clients, bosses and colleagues.

 This whole round was scheduled on Amy," Mr. Mortensen said, adding that the AI was sensitive to the power dynamics of a CEO fundraising from investors.

DCM Ventures and Work-Bench Ventures are new investors, joining returning backers IA Ventures, FirstMark Capital, SoftBank Capital - SBNY, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Crunchfund, and Pritzker Group Venture Capital.

 This will get us to cash-flow positive," Mr. Mortensen said, adding that X.ai plans to start charging businesses in September. Close to 30,000 people signed up for X.ai's waiting list for its beta version in February.

Text- and voice-based bots are a natural evolution in software, according to Julie Ask, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc., pointing to such products as Amazon Inc.'s Echo.

 As a consumer I don't want to hop in and out of different apps," Ms. Ask said. But bot adoption, Ms. Ask said,  is not going to happen as fast as everybody wants."

Other virtual scheduling assistants come from Clara Labs, Julie Desk and Zirtual, each using automation to various degrees. Zirtual ran out of funding and was acquired by Startup.co last year.

LSE combination spawns derivatives doubts; Analysis: Capital markets

Deutsche Brse deal will bring post-trade changes, but the outlook for fees is unclear

Deutsche Brse's $20bn combination with London Stock Exchange promises an "industry-defining combination" but there are doubts that traders and investors relying on derivatives in a post-crisis world will see the benefits.

The deal will bring together London, Europe's leading financial hub, and Frankfurt, home of the European Central Bank, into a behemoth able to trade in equities and futures, benchmarks, index and data analytics.

But it is in the world of risk management, or post-trade as it is known, where the new exchange promises the biggest changes. A combination offers clearing of futures and swaps and collateral management on a scale that no exchange operator in the world can match.

For some it is an indication of how global markets are changing rapidly, overturned by the impact of capital rules on banks and the growth of exchange traded funds and other forms of passive investing.

Anthony Perrotta, a former broker and head of research at Tabb, the US capital markets consultancy, says capital rules are the "single biggest issue" affecting over-the-counter markets.

Bourses are in an arms race "establishing true verticals - pre-trade information flow, execution, clearing, and settlement - in the market", he says.

"I think exchanges are recognising the need for expanding their roles as intermediaries by utilising scale and services to connect asset owners."

The deal is expected to improve the efficiencies of the exchanges to the tune of at least  ¬450m over three years. But how much will it benefit markets?

In an interview last week Xavier Rolet , chief executive of the LSE, said a combined group would be a model for the future as it sought to provide services for customers that trade globally, such as Fidelity, BlackRock and Pimco. The combined settlement assets would offer collateral management immediately after the market close, he added.

"Would they accept their business siloing - you know, that you have to deal with these guys here, with those guys there? There's hundreds of billions of dollars or pounds or euros of margin that is posted and a whole bunch of silos around the world - inefficiently."

Among participants in futures markets there are concerns that a deal will lead to higher trading fees in an already costly industry. It is a charge to which the LSE is sensitive.

"Our American futures friends have kept on increasing fees every year - in 2009, 2010, when everybody was on their back bleeding to death," said Mr Rolet. "Total cost of trading is too high, so it's going to change."

But clearing is a mandatory part of derivatives trading and will always require costly margin to offset risk. That has led others to question whether the exchanges can really promise more savings for traders.

"Regulatory capital isn't margin," says one executive at a high-speed trading company.

Few banks and fund managers are willing to go on the record backing the combination.

"It might make European ETF listings a bit easier, but overall, for us, it's largely a non-event," says one fund management executive.

The new exchange promises banks and investors savings of billions from the related costs of trading in OTC markets as new Basel regulations kick in. New rules force banks trading in derivatives to post large amounts of collateral and margin at central clearing houses as insurance to back their deals. The main customers, the investment banks, are also being hit with heavy capital charges on those deals.

Netting the margin that traders post to back both futures and swaps derivatives - called cross-margining - is a more efficient use of capital, the exchanges argue.

Michael Spencer , chief executive of interdealer broker ICAP, is a fan of the deal, which he says "offers the best margin-netting opportunities".

Deutsche Brse's dominant position in longer-dated bond contracts cleared on Eurex's futures markets can be matched against LCH's dominant position in euro rate clearing, he says.

JPMorgan uses online forums to hire talent; Banks

Financial groups become creative in their quest to attract the right personnel

Investment banks are turning to "talent communities" and machine learning as they become increasingly creative in their quest to attract the right personnel to an industry that has lost some of its lustre since the financial crisis.

JPMorgan, the world's biggest investment bank, is creating online talent forums of prospective employees in an attempt to attract tech workers, Jim Cochran , the bank's head of global recruiting, told the Financial Times.

Goldman Sachs is using machine learning to screen the hundreds of thousands of applications it still gets each year for those that meet the bank's basic suitability thresholds, an executive said.

Top MBA graduates are now 40 per cent less likely to pick banking as a career than they were in 2008, while banks are also struggling to lure the tech-savvy experts they need to future proof their businesses away from more attractive Silicon Valley companies.

Mr Cochran said JPMorgan is using online talent forums to show a select group of in-demand professionals "why it's just as interesting to work for a financial services firm" as it is for a tech company so that they can get people "over the hump" about making the switch between industries. The portal is similar to closed groups on networking website LinkedIn, but JPMorgan is in talks with "front-end providers" who will sell it a special interface for the communities.

The members of the talent communities include people who have previously had interviews with the bank and decided not to join, as well as other industry experts. The material on the forum includes information about the work the bank is doing, as well as personal messages from senior managers on what it is like to work there and discussions around industry topics.

"We're creating a pipeline, a community around a topic, so that recruiters can pick [from the community]," Mr Cochran said.

An engineer who spent more than a decade at a top tier bank before moving to a large technology company said it would take more than talent communities to convince people like him to move to financial services. Banks treat engineering as a "cost centre", whereas technology companies had engineering at the heart of their business, he said.

Mr Cochran insisted the issue was not a shortage of CVs coming into his bank, which gets 40-50 applications for every job it advertises. "There are a lot of rsums coming in, we want the people that are right for JPMorgan," he said.

Goldman is also dealing with an overflowing inbox, attracting 313,000 applications globally last year for 9,700 positions. Despite the financial crash, top-tier banks such as Goldman continue to attract a large number of applicants who see banking as a lucrative career.

Freelance quant fund beats S&P 500; Equities

Quantopian put $100,000 monthly kitty at disposal of winning strategies

A "crowdsourced" hedge fund that uses the trading algorithms of a handful of freelance programmers notched up a 1.93 per cent net gain in its first full quarter - more than doubling the gain of the US stock market.

The platform, which is run by Quantopian, based in Boston, allows programmers, mathematicians and data scientists to design and test stock trading algorithms.

Every month whoever comes up with the best-performing strategy is given access to a $100,000 trading kitty. The winner is allowed to keep any profit over the next six months.

Last year the number of registered "quants", or quantitative traders, swelled to nearly 60,000 when Quantopian started an internal hedge fund and seeded it with capital. The fund uses the best algorithms and gives 10 per cent of the proceeds to their authors.

Quantitative investing - the use of complex mathematical models, supercomputers and sometimes artificial intelligence to identify patterns in the swelling sea of data - has been around for several decades.

But it is increasingly popular thanks to the enviable returns achieved by heavyweights such as Renaissance Technologies, DE Shaw and Two Sigma.

Amid a shortage of talent - many computer scientists prefer to work in Silicon Valley - hedge funds have offered competitions and established alliances with universities.

Quantopian gives its members access to data and coding tools so they can trade as a sideline or from home. The returns are net of fees paid to the authors, an assumed 2 per cent management fee and the Quantopian's 10 per cent performance fee - mimicking the "two and 20" hedge fund fee structure.

The S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent during the first quarter.

John Fawcett , Quantopian's founder and chief executive, said it was important to "stay sober" regarding the early, unaudited results on trading the initial $500,000 of capital, but said the initial results were encouraging. "The number of algos and the size need to be ramped up in the coming months to achieve our objectives," he said.

The plan was to open the fund to outside investors once its record had been established, Mr Fawcett added.

Quantopian's initial foray used strategies for the US stock market designed by eight members, including a mechanical engineer in Australia and a US software developer at an internet search company. The intention is to use 20 to 30 algorithms at a time eventually.

This year it plans to increase the fund's firepower to $1m of capital and to enhance its leverage to three times capital from close to one times in its first quarter. In time it foresees leverage of six times capital.

Quantopian expects to have more than 120,000 people on its platform by the end of the year.

While enthusiasm over " DIY quants " is growing, sceptics warn that freelance algo traders will over time not do much better than day traders.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
'There are going to be lots of dead unicorns'; THE BIG PICTURE

Many fund managers have had to write down their investments in billion-dollar start-ups, says Attracta Mooney

Unicorns, as billion-dollar start-ups have been dubbed, were one of the hottest topics of 2015.

Asset managers, including Fidelity Management and Research, BlackRock and T Rowe Price, piled into private start-ups last year to take advantage of the boom in technology companies.

But one year on, most fund houses appear to have taken a vow of silence when it comes to their investments in the billion-dollar fledglings.

Few of the 25 or more asset managers and venture capitalists contacted would talk on the record about unicorns. They were even less happy to discuss the valuations of the start-ups they flocked to last year.

Many fund managers were forced to write down their investments in start-ups in the final three months of 2015, including those in Dropbox, the file storage website, Snapchat, the disappearing-photo app, and MongoDB, a database.

The writedowns have raised big questions about the soaring valuations of many young tech companies and whether asset managers rushed into an area where they had little understanding of the true value of what they were investing in.

There are also fears that a tech bubble is emerging and that large-scale failures are likely, leading to so-called unicorpses - unicorns that die.

"There are going to be lots of dead unicorns," said Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce, the cloud computing company, at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year.

Regulators are also worried. Last week, Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the US financial watchdog was concerned about the "eye-popping" valuations of some unlisted start-ups and the consequences for investors of the market overheating.

In this climate, technology start-ups are finding it much more difficult to raise cash. During the final quarter of 2015, so-called crossover investors from public markets, the likes of mutual funds and hedge funds, were involved in 168 deals worth $8.1bn, compared with 223 deals worth $13.5bn during the third quarter, according to CB Insights, a research company.

Overall, however, crossover investments in private technology companies rose 51 per cent last year, to more than $40.9bn across 800 deals, CB Insights data show.

Mutual funds had previously avoided unlisted companies, but in recent years many technology companies decided to delay an initial public offering , instead raising money through so-called late-stage financing rounds. This move is forcing asset managers that want access to the fast-growing tech sector to consider private investments.

Adley Bowden, vice-president of PitchBook, a database of venture capital and merger and acquisition deals, says: "Asset managers have historically invested in unicorns. The key difference now is that these companies would have already [had an IPO] and been publicly traded. But, without a public offering for asset managers to invest in, they have started investing more while the companies are still private."

This has helped drive up the number of unicorns from 39 to 156 globally, with a cumulative valuation of $550bn, according to CB Insights. But 58 tech start-ups suffered "down rounds" since the start of 2015, a situation in which company stock is deemed to be worth less than initially thought.

Some unicorns are suffering large valuation writedowns when they publicly list for the first time, as was the case with Square, which handles credit card payments. Private fundraising in 2014 valued Square at roughly $6bn. Its IPO last year priced it at $2.9bn.

Asset managers would not comment on whether they expected further writedowns of valuations. Instead, they said company valuations were decided by internal committees that operate independently of portfolio managers.

But many have already written down investments in tech start-ups, including BlackRock, which cut its valuation of Dropbox by more than 20 per cent last October.

T Rowe Price also wrote down its investment in Dropbox, as well as several other companies, including Cloudera, a data analytics company, and Evernote, the workplace app that announced staff cuts and office closures last autumn.

Fidelity has additionally revalued Snapchat and MongoDB. Other asset managers are taking similar approaches.

Mr Bowden played down the markdowns to private companies' valuations, suggesting it was "not as big of a deal as the press has played it up to be".

He says: "Mutual funds are used to marking their investments up and down daily with the public markets, and very much view the changes in valuation as something totally natural. It is important to note that these investments are big to the venture world but in most cases a very small drop in the fund managers' overall [assets under management]."

Some of the world's best-known technology experts and investors have urged caution when it comes to unicorns. Bill Gates , the co-founder of Microsoft, the technology company, recently warned that investors need to be more discriminating when investing in technology start-ups.

But even when asset managers try to avoid unicorns, they often end up inadvertently invested in them through the public companies they hold. In some cases, public companies have suffered because of their exposure to unicorns, as happened with PLDT, the listed Filipino telecommunications company.

It was forced to write down an investment in Rocket Internet, the German start-up incubator that invests in unicorns, at the end of 2015, leaving the business reporting its first net loss in 12 years.

Edward Lam, a partner at Somerset Capital Management, says: "The writedowns [of unicorns in public companies] are a concern. Some of these investments may end up coming good but there has been a slightly speculative element to some of them."

Most asset managers contacted for this article would give little away about whether or not they expect to increase or decrease their allocation to unicorns this year.

A spokesperson from BlackRock, which PitchBook estimates has invested in five unicorns, says the fund house invests in privately held companies from "time to time". T Rowe says it is "extremely selective when it comes to investing in these companies".

Neither investment manager provided any details of whether it saw any opportunities in start-up technology companies currently.

Andy Boyd, head of global equity capital markets at Fidelity Management and Research, says the company, which ranks as one of the largest 15 investors in unicorns globally, plans to continue to invest in private start-ups.

"We look for opportunities in all sectors and across many geographies and have been successful in finding opportunities this year, although at a slower pace than in previous years," he says.

Mr Boyd says there is a strong investment case for putting money into private companies. "We have been investing in private companies for over a decade and we feel that in order to understand the competitive position of any company, one should look at all the players in that space, both public and private," he says.

He also downplayed fears about unicorpses. "Any investment comes with risks," he says.

Mark Hawtin, investment director at GAM, the Swiss asset manager, adds: "It is very important to look at the topic of unicorns company by company. There is no black-and-white view. Some unicorns look like great investments and some do not, but it is case by case."

Mr Bowden says mutual fund managers will continue to invest in unicorns, not least because many have a mandate that requires them to invest in high-growth companies.

"We believe this shift in asset managers investing in companies while still private is here to stay, as long as these businesses continue to push out their IPOs," he says.

He adds: "Asset managers won't go away."

Soaring valuations

Year of the unicorn to year of the unicorpse

The word unicorn might be most associated with the mythical creature sporting a large spiral horn, but since 2013 the phrase has developed a different meaning.

Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, a venture capital firm, first used the word in late 2013 to describe private technology companies with a valuation of at least $1bn. Her point was that billion-dollar start-ups were extremely rare, almost mythical.

"It's really hard, and highly unlikely, to build or invest in a billion-dollar company," she wrote in a post on TechCrunch, the website. "The odds are somewhere between catching a foul ball at [a major-league baseball] game and being struck by lightning in one's lifetime."

At the time, she estimated there were just 39 unicorns, including companies such as Airbnb, the accommodation rental website, and Uber, the taxi-hailing app.

But the number of unicorns has increased significantly since then. CB Insights, the research company, estimates there are 155 unicorns globally now.

These include Pinterest, the online scrapbook site valued at $11bn; China's Lufax, an online finance marketplace; Spotify, the Swedish music-streaming service valued at $8.5bn, and HelloFresh, the German ecommerce business that delivers fresh food to consumers.

As the number of billion-dollar tech companies soared, 2015 was branded the year of the unicorn. This year, however, could be the year of the unicorpse - or dead unicorns - amid fears about valuations and the sustainability of business models.

Hedge Fund Analysts Use Deep Learning  to Diagnose Heart s Condition

Two quantitative analysts using artificial intelligence in an online data science competition showed they could diagnose heart disease about as accurately as doctors.

Qi Liu and Tencia Lee, hedge fund analysts and self-described  quants," built the winning algorithm in the competition, which could find indicators of heart disease. The online data contest challenged participants to develop machine algorithms that could measure cardiac volumes from MRIs provided by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Mr. Liu and Ms. Lee didn't know each other before they won the competition, beating out more than 1,390 algorithms. They met each other in a forum on the Kaggle site, where the competition was hosted over a three-month period.

 We decided to combine our methods," Ms. Lee said.  We decided they were different enough from each other that we could do better than either of us would alone."

Competitors worked on algorithms that could accomplish a manual and slow process that normally is carried out by cardiologists. Usually it takes doctors about 20 minutes to measure cardiac volumes and derive ejection fraction data from an MRI. The algorithms can analyze the images much more quickly.

The data scientists had a set of more than 1,000 MRIs to work with. Ms. Lee said the winning algorithm used a technique called deep learning.

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute will now test the algorithm in clinical environments. Ms. Lee said she hopes one day the algorithm can be used by health care professionals, but she said there is a long road of testing and regulatory processes before it gets there.

 I certainly wouldn't trust my doctor with what we just wrote," Ms. Lee said.

Many companies are trying to use artificial intelligence to improve medicine. Investors are increasingly backing startups in the category, and public technology companies have signaled it is a sector they're betting on. Last year International Business Machines Corp. acquired Merge Healthcare Inc. for $1 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The contest, the National Data Science Bowl, is sponsored by the data science startup Kaggle and Booz Allen Hamilton.

This is the second time Kaggle has hosted a National Science Data Bowl. The first competition challenged scientists to come up with algorithms that could measure plankton population to predict global health.

Kaggle Chief Executive Anthony Goldbloom said the winner of the first National Data Bowl now works as a research scientist at Google's DeepMind. He said Kaggle competitions, which crowd source solutions to big data problems, have become a way for data scientists to quantify their skills when applying for jobs.

Mr. Goldbloom said the company is now seeking proposals for the third competition's challenge.

Some unicorns are suffering large valuation writedowns when they publicly list for the first time, as was the case with Square, which handles credit card payments. Private fundraising in 2014 valued Square at roughly $6bn. Its IPO last year priced it at $2.9bn.

Asset managers would not comment on whether they expected further writedowns of valuations. Instead, they said company valuations were decided by internal committees that operate independently of portfolio managers.

But many have already written down investments in tech start-ups, including BlackRock, which cut its valuation of Dropbox by more than 20 per cent last October.

T Rowe Price also wrote down its investment in Dropbox, as well as several other companies, including Cloudera, a data analytics company, and Evernote, the workplace app that announced staff cuts and office closures last autumn.

Fidelity has additionally revalued Snapchat and MongoDB. Other asset managers are taking similar approaches.

Mr Bowden played down the markdowns to private companies  valuations, suggesting it was  not as big of a deal as the press has played it up to be .

He says:  Mutual funds are used to marking their investments up and down daily with the public markets, and very much view the changes in valuation as something totally natural. It is important to note that these investments are big to the venture world but in most cases a very small drop in the fund managers  overall [assets under management]. 

Some of the world s best-known technology experts and investors have urged caution when it comes to unicorns. "http://video.ft.com/4774342805001/Gates-on-unicorns/Companies", the co-founder of Microsoft, the technology company, recently warned that investors need to be more discriminating when investing in technology start-ups.

But even when asset managers try to avoid unicorns, they often end up inadvertently invested in them through the public companies they hold. In some cases, public companies have suffered because of their exposure to unicorns, as happened with PLDT, the listed Filipino telecommunications company.

It was forced to write down an investment in Rocket Internet, the German start-up incubator that invests in unicorns, at the end of 2015, leaving the business reporting its first net loss in 12 years.

Edward Lam, a partner at Somerset Capital Management, says:  The writedowns [of unicorns in public companies] are a concern. Some of these investments may end up coming good but there has been a slightly speculative element to some of them. 

Most asset managers contacted for this article would give little away about whether or not they expect to increase or decrease their allocation to unicorns this year.

A spokesperson from BlackRock, which PitchBook estimates has invested in five unicorns, says the fund house invests in privately held companies from  time to time . T Rowe says it is  extremely selective when it comes to investing in these companies .

Neither investment manager provided any details of whether it saw any opportunities in start-up technology companies currently.

Andy Boyd, head of global equity capital markets at Fidelity Management and Research, says the company, which ranks as one of the largest 15 investors in unicorns globally, plans to continue to invest in private start-ups.

 We look for opportunities in all sectors and across many geographies and have been successful in finding opportunities this year, although at a slower pace than in previous years,  he says.

Mr Boyd says there is a strong investment case for putting money into private companies.  We have been investing in private companies for over a decade and we feel that in order to understand the competitive position of any company, one should look at all the players in that space, both public and private,  he says.

He also downplayed fears about unicorpses.  Any investment comes with risks,  he says.

Mark Hawtin, investment director at GAM, the Swiss asset manager, adds:  It is very important to look at the topic of unicorns company by company. There is no black-and-white view. Some unicorns look like great investments and some do not, but it is case by case. 

Mr Bowden says mutual fund managers will continue to invest in unicorns, not least because many have a mandate that requires them to invest in high-growth companies.

 We believe this shift in asset managers investing in companies while still private is here to stay, as long as these businesses continue to push out their IPOs,  he says.

He adds:  Asset managers won t go away. 

Soaring valuations: Year of the unicorn to year of the unicorpse

The word unicorn might be most associated with the mythical creature sporting a large spiral horn, but since 2013 the phrase has developed a different meaning.

Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, a venture capital firm, first used the word in late 2013 to describe private technology companies with a valuation of at least $1bn. Her point was that billion-dollar start-ups were extremely rare, almost mythical.

 It s really hard, and highly unlikely, to build or invest in a billion-dollar company,  she wrote in a post on TechCrunch, the website.  The odds are somewhere between catching a foul ball at [a major-league baseball] game and being struck by lightning in one s lifetime. 

At the time, she estimated there were just 39 unicorns, including companies such as Airbnb, the accommodation rental website, and Uber, the taxi-hailing app.

But the number of unicorns has increased significantly since then. CB Insights, the research company, estimates there are 155 unicorns globally now.

These include Pinterest, the online scrapbook site valued at $11bn; China s Lufax, an online finance marketplace; Spotify, the Swedish music-streaming service valued at $8.5bn, and HelloFresh, the German ecommerce business that delivers fresh food to consumers.

As the number of billion-dollar tech companies soared, 2015 was branded the year of the unicorn. This year, however, could be the year of the unicorpse   or dead unicorns   amid fears about valuations and the sustainability of business models.

THE LONG VIEW
Investors find it hard to know what April Fool's data to believe

Yesterday was a Big Data day if ever there was one. Investors had to sift through the usual raft of April Fool spoofs, and supply manager surveys from around the world, but also - unusually - had the monthly game of the heavily revision-prone US employment data as well.

Data matters more than usual because the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, depends on it, and because there is heightened uncertainty. The quarter just finished featured a sharp sell-off of risk assets, fuelled by fears the US would lapse into recession, and an equally swift recovery. People do not know what to believe.

In the event, the April Fool's data gave neither the Fed nor anyone else much reason to change how they proceed from here. The US unemployment rate ticked up slightly, but only because the numbers in the labour force (and looking for work), also ticked up very slightly. The pattern remains solidly unchanged; employment is improving at the same steady pace at which it has been improving for several years, which is not yet quite fast enough either to make US citizens much happier, or to give them much negotiating power to press their wages upwards.

The fact that the "participation rate" - the proportion of the total adult workforce deemed actively seeking work - has risen for six months in a row after cratering could be seen as a sign that inflation pressures are ready to take over, but not a great one.

In line with this, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence indicator, a much-followed survey, also ticked up slightly, but remains well below the level it hit last year.

The significant change is in the ISM manufacturing survey, based on supply managers' opinions and carried out in all the leading economies. This suggests that the manufacturing sectors of China and the US, the world's two largest economies have returned to health, and are (slightly) expanding again. For many months, they had pointed to recession, a main cause for markets' alarm.

This is probably a direct offshoot of the weaker dollar, to which China's currency is tied. The dollar has weakened 4.1 per cent this year against its biggest trading partners. This may be the result of deliberate decisions by central banks, even though it is not great for the eurozone, which has seen the euro rebound 4.9 per cent this year against the dollar this year. Its manufacturing numbers have weakened a little in consequence.

The weaker dollar also relieved pressure on some emerging markets that had heavy debt denominated in dollars. Emerging markets stocks are 5.5 per cent up from the beginning of the year.

As for other market measures, most described a V-shape, and ended up where they started. US stocks have barely changed. Neither has oil. Crude oil, as measured by the West Texas Intermediate contract, is at this moment very slightly cheaper than it was at the beginning of the year.

Two other changes are significant. First, expectations for profit growth have collapsed. According to Thomson Reuters, forecasts for US profit growth in the first quarter have moved from 2.3 to minus 6.9 per cent this year, while forecasts for the full year have dropped from 7.6 to 2.0 per cent.

And one critical market indicator had a quarter for the ages. Gold, which rose more than 16 per cent in dollar terms, remarkably enjoyed its best quarter since 1986. Gold has been falling very steadily for a long time and is due for a rebound. Some of this is a reaction to the weaker dollar. But still, a move that sharp in gold when other assets moved little, and where the economic situation apparently changed little, has to be treated as an indicator of something.

But what? Taking all the evidence together, it is fair to suggest that the crisis of confidence in central banks' ability to move markets and the economy, widely discussed at the market nadir in February, remains intact. Stocks are unchanged for the year, and below their highs, even though long-term interest rates have dipped significantly, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling from 2.27 to 1.77 per cent this year.

So this is what the data tells us about the year so far and where we stand now. Central banks have succeeded in weakening the dollar, and arresting an incipient recession in manufacturing that greatly threatened the emerging world, at the cost of a fall in their credibility.

The lack of confidence shows itself in collapsing profits forecasts, and in rising gold. Meanwhile, the oil price, which has led other risk markets for almost two years now, has ticked down in the last week. A weaker dollar and the prospect of easier money would usually drive oil prices up, not down, so this is a development to watch closely.

So data-dependency will continue, but the data to watch will change. Over the next few weeks watch the price of oil and earnings numbers from US groups.

MetLife ruling shakes US post-crisis laws; Financials: Dodd-Frank challenge

Court's revocation of insurer's 'systemically important' tag deals big blow to Washington

US finance chiefs often grumble about the tough rules imposed by the Dodd-Frank reforms that followed the 2008 crisis. But most went along with the various strictures, wary of fuelling another bout of anti-Wall Street hostility.

Not Steven Kandarian , chief executive of the insurer MetLife. He argued that the Obama administration had gone too far when it identified his group as a potential threat to the financial system that needed extra supervision.

A federal judge sent ripples through Washington and New York this week by ruling that Mr Kandarian was right and revoking the insurer's designation.

The decision has shaken a pillar of post-crisis regulation, raising questions about how the US handles "too big to fail" institutions and whether other groups will follow MetLife and try to throw off the government's yoke.

GE Capital , which has chafed at its "systemically important financial institution" - or Sifi - tag, filed an official request yesterday to be struck off the government's list, having downsized drastically.

The judge's decision is putting pressure on AIG , whose near-collapse in 2008 fuelled the drive to identify and rein in systemic institutions, to say whether it will try to escape the scrutiny that goes with being on the Sifi list.

Peter Hancock , the insurer's chief executive, told CNBC yesterday: "It certainly opens that opportunity, but I think it's something we want to reserve judgment [on]."

The full impact of US District Judge Rosemary Collyer's ruling is not yet clear. The US Treasury is widely expected to appeal to the higher courts, although so far it has said only that it will "continue to defend [the] designation process vigorously".

Also the reasoning behind her ruling has not been revealed. Ironically for a case in which MetLife accused regulators of lacking transparency, the two parties asked for the details of the judgment to be confidential. MetLife and the Treasury are scheduled to decide with the judge next week how much of the ruling will be released.

"It's intolerable that a case that is so important to the financial stability of the country is almost entirely secret," said Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a group that lobbies for tougher financial regulation.

MetLife argued, and Judge Collyer appears to have agreed, that the Financial Stability Oversight Council , a group of regulators that includes representatives of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve , had mishandled the Sifi decision. The council had made unsubstantiated assumptions, failed to take into account the costs of Sifi designation on the group and reached an "arbitrary and capricious" decision, the insurer said.

"It's a profound embarrassment to the FSOC," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics , a Washington-based consultancy.

Analysts at UBS said the ruling "seems to validate management's decision to pursue this lawsuit, which we had previously questioned".

Several lawyers said they would need to see the court's full opinion before being able to assess Washington's chances of success in a higher court.

Not surprisingly some of the staunchest Republican opponents of Dodd-Frank in Congress were quick to praise the ruling. "FSOC's perfect storm of secrecy and intimidation has created a shadow regulatory system that concentrates power in Washington at the expense of hardworking Americans," said Scott Garrett.

"I'm pleased to see the judicial branch took a stand for the Constitution."

The other big insurer on the "too big to fail" list is Prudential Financial . Asked about its next move, it said: "We continuously review developments that impact our company, and we are evaluating what is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders."

Banks will be far less affected by the MetLife decision, because the Sifi rules are clearer for them. Dodd-Frank specifically states that any bank with assets of $50bn or more will be considered systemically important.

That cut-off has been hugely unpopular with some midsized institutions that were captured by the designation. Their only hope of escape is a change in the law, and enduring partisan acrimony in Congress makes that unlikely.

So far large asset managers such as Fidelity and BlackRock have got off relatively lightly in the systemic debate. They headed off an early move by regulators to designate specific companies as systemic threats.

Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has consistently highlighted the stability risks posed by non-banks. Her campaign was quick to criticise the MetLife ruling.

"When Treasury , the SEC, the Fed and other top financial regulators all agree an institution poses systemic risks to our economy, it's deeply concerning when a lower court judge unilaterally rejects their decision," a Clinton spokesman said.

Fidelity cuts valuations of its Silicon Valley start-ups; Financials

Fidelity Investments has cut the valuations on many of the start-ups in which it owns shares, underscoring the adjustment under way in Silicon Valley as investors become more sceptical.

Among Fidelity's heaviest writedowns were enterprise software companies Cloudera and Dropbox, which had the value of their shares cut by 38 per cent and 20 per cent respectively from the end of January to the end of February.

The writedowns also reflect declines in technology shares more broadly, as companies such as Twitter and LinkedIn have seen stock prices sink.

Enterprise software companies that rely on subscription sales have come under particular scrutiny because their business models often rely on heavy marketing to drive growth.

Cloudera, which sells software to manage big data, has delayed listing at a time of volatility in the public markets, even though many analysts expected it might try for an initial public offering last year. There have been no tech IPOs this year, after several went public last year at valuations lower than they earned on the private markets.

Dropbox, known for its photo sharing services, has been trying to move from consumer sales to a model that emphasises enterprise sales. However, it has struggled with several new products.

Fidelity mutual funds also wrote down the value of software companies such as Nutanix, Delphix, Cloudflare and Appirio in monthly holdings reports. The carrying value of these shares is determined by an independent team of analysts.

The value of a handful of companies increased, including Snapchat, the app known for its disappearing messages. In February, Fidelity increased its investment in the company even though Fidelity's own analysts had marked down the value of Snapchat shares last year. Fidelity declined to comment.

The cooling valuations have so far had little impact on capital flows to venture capital groups. Preliminary data from Dow Jones VentureSource show that US venture capital companies have raised more in the first quarter this year than in any quarter since the dotcom bubble.

Huge sums are still flowing to start-ups too, and as valuations come down, some investors are starting to see better opportunities to invest.

Telecom Italia Must Call Renzi

Political connections are always useful in the highly regulated telecom industry. In Italy they are essential.

The new chief executive named by Telecom Italia on Wednesday, Flavio Cattaneo, will have to show he has more traction with Matteo Renzi, Italy's prime minister, than his predecessor. He faces an uphill struggle of Alpine proportions.

Telecom Italia's relationship with the Italian authorities has become increasingly dysfunctional since Mr. Renzi assumed power in 2014. The prime minister attaches great importance to high-speed broadband, but seems to prefer working with energy company Enel, in which his finance ministry holds a 25.5% stake.

Last week, Enel announced a 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) plan to deliver fiber-optic broadband cables direct to homes in 224 Italian municipalities as part of a project to install smart electricity meters. It won't offer telecom services itself, but said it had discussed a letter of intent with mobile operators Vodafone and Wind. The result would be a competitor to Telecom Italia's fixed-line business in urban markets.

This week, meanwhile, Mr. Renzi visited a renewable-power plant run by Enel in Nevada, the first stop on his U.S. tour. It is a "great global company," he commented on Facebook, his favored medium of public communication. "We will continue to make it grow, including through the innovative broadband plans we will present onApril 7."

The government has made 3.5 billion euros of public subsidies available for rolling out high-speed broadband to otherwise unprofitable rural areas. Next week's announcement is expected to include the first of the tenders. It doesn't sound like Telecom Italia will be getting the money.

Much depends on whether the Italian authorities see Vincent Bollore, chairman of Vivendi, the leading shareholder in Telecom Italia, as investor or raider. Mr. Bollore's ties with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who in March confirmed his Mediaset pay-TV group was in talks with Vivendi over a content deal, may not be helpful.

Telecom Italia rattled investors in February with poor results anda plan to invest 12 billion euros over three years, delaying much-needed debt reductions. The shares have fallen 18% in the year to date.

Unfortunately for shareholders, the only way to appease the Italian government an unholy trinity of regulator, sponsor and competitor in the company's key home market is likely to involve more investment. Yet Mr. Cattaneo has little choice but to pick up the phone.

Can Bad News Be Good for European Steel?

Is one man's misfortune another man's gain? The decline of the U.K.'s steel industry, with news that Tata Steel plans to shed its entire business in the country, boosted shares elsewhere in the beleaguered European steel sector: notably, ThyssenKrupp's stock jumped 8% Wednesday.

This looks like the triumph of hope over experience. The bull case for ThyssenKrupp is pretty simple: Its capital goods business, which makes elevators, escalators and other engineering components, should be worth far more than the group's five times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Sell, spin off, joint venture or otherwise ditch the steel business and ThyssenKrupp's valuation should benefit.

No wonder ThyssenKrupp management has been vocal in its wish to shed steel, or otherwise participate in consolidation. But the reality has proved tough in an industry where most companies spent years waiting and wagering that a massively oversupplied market would improve, only to leave themselves in a dire enough state as to have few options when it didn't.

In that regard, Tata's decision regarding its money-losing U.K. operations offers a potential opening. India's Tata is trying to pare back its European operations to its efficient premium flat-steel-products business at Ijmuiden in the Netherlands. That business, which is thought to be profitable, may fit with ThyssenKrupp's flat steelmaking operations, argues Jefferies.

Problems abound: The chances of a quick, neat U.K. sale for Tata look remote, given limited buyers for a struggling asset in need of investment. The company hasn't said anything about its plans for Ijmuiden. It also isn't entirely clear the latter is large enough for a merger and consolidation of ThyssenKrupp's European business, which made about 500 million euros in operating profit in the most recent fiscal year.

Meanwhile, consolidation only really helps if it comes with serious cost savings and, ideally, capacity closures. Closures remain as politically fraught as ever.

But options on recovery are all that a sector living on fumes really has. Rising Chinese export prices have sent shares soaring since February. Any sniff of deal making, or more aggressive protection from policy makers, does the same. Two things are clear: The foundations for a fundamental steel recovery are flimsy at best and nothing in the interim will be easy.

China Banks

Are Fighting

Bad Loans

Chinese banks eked out small profit gains in 2015, but investors know better than to celebrate. There are just too many risks looming.

Three of China's biggest banks each beat expectations for fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Still, the results were uninspiring. For all of 2015, net profit rose just 0.7% at Bank of China, 0.5% at Industrial & Commercial Bank of China and 0.1% at China Construction Bank.

It probably isn't a coincidence that the results are strikingly similar. The banks have some control over the amount of provisions they take on expected bad loans. It has been clear for a couple of quarters that they are managing their provisioning, with a target of barely positive earnings growth.

This trick is getting hard-er as bad loans surge. At the three institutions that reported earnings Wednesday, nonperforming loans rose by an average 40% in 2015.

In China, banks are required to maintain provisions worth 150% of bad loans, a relatively high ratio by international standards. They are now bumping up against that.

The bull case for the banks hinges on government support. Many analysts expect Chinese regulators to loosen the provision ratio requirement this year, which would allow the banks to set aside less money for bad loans. But that won't halt the rise of bad loans, which is likely closer to its start than its finish.

Chinese banks look cheap, at around 0.7 to 0.8 times book value. But with risks to their loan books rising, the discount seems reasonable.

In the universe that Microsoft envisions, there is a bot for that.

That is a deviation from the app-centered world of smartphones, where one of the world's most valuable companies is just a bit player. Less than 2% of the smartphones sold last year carried the Windows Phone operating system, according to IDC. That may drop below 1% in the next four years.

Microsoft can't afford to ignore the mobile world. It has taken some significant steps, like making its applications available on iPhone and Android devices and pouring resources into its cloud business.

But it still needs to be a relevant platform for developers and it can't do that while relying on apps made for an operating system with a tiny share.

This is why Microsoft is trying to find new ways to keep developers engaged.

The HoloLens augmented-reality headset is one. The gadget is now shipping to developers.

Microsoft also announced its latest effort on Wednesday dubbed "conversations as a platform," which harnesses artificial intelligence for developers to make "bots" that can perform many of the tasks of mobile apps, often through voice control.

Both are compelling but likely will take a long time to come to fruition. So Microsoft can't turn its back on Windows.

Wall Street expects the company's personal-computing segment to drive more than 40% of annual revenue in coming years.

The latest Windows 10 release is promising with the installed base up 35% in the past three months.

For developers, that is the type of reception that still computes.

Shale Is Odd Man Out in Oil Reckoning

The world oil market is starting to resemble the old slapstick gag about the French Foreign Legion. The sergeant needs a volunteer to take a step forward for a dangerous mission. Instead, all of the assembled soldiers, except one, take a step back, volunteering him.

The sucker seems to be U.S.shale. While Russia and many membersofthe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may meet next month in Qatar to discuss the idea of an output freeze to support prices, this represents a hollow pledge.

The invited countries represent some three-quarters of global output -- certainly enough to move the needle on supply. But that needle is stuck in the red zone for all but one producer.

Iran, after years of sanctions, is determined to ramp up its output to some four million barrels a day from about 2.9 million in January.

In the face of that commitment, regional rival Saudi Arabia is reluctant to cede market share. And Russia, pumping near post-Soviet records and desperate for income, has taken a similar stance.

With OPEC and its possible partners unwilling to agree to much beyond the status quo, balancing of supply and demand is being done by Western producers with bills to pay and shareholders to please.

Economics might seem to dictate that the first cuts would come from the highest-cost fields such as Canada's oil sands, but that would be wrong. Instead it will occur where lack of investment will show up first: U.S.shale.

A report last week from the U.S. Energy Information Administration highlights why. A surprisingly high 48% of U.S. oil production from the contiguous states came from wells drilled since 2014.

Nearly all are from unconventional formations such asshale. They went from providing 500,000 barrels a day in 2009 to a peak of 4.6 million last May.

Output has been declining since as spending was cut. Based on geology alone, it should have been worse.

Production from ashalewell typically falls by half during the first year in operation and then by another quarter to one-third in the following year. The reason it hasn't is a significant rise in productivity per well -- a modest additional investment squeezed out extra barrels.

That trend is reaching its limits, though.

So are U.S. producers really such patsies? Driven by the imperative of profitability, it is true that they will cede share.

But a large number of uncompleted wells, colloquially referred to as a "fracklog," standsready to come on stream fairly quickly once prices rise by another $20 a barrel or so.

By keeping its financial powder dry, a leaner U.S. shalepatch can storm back soon after prices become more attractive and enjoy the last laugh.

In China, banks are required to maintain provisions worth 150% of bad loans, a relatively high ratio by international standards. They now are bumping up against that. At the big three, the provision coverage ratio fell to an average 154% at the end of 2015, from 206% a year earlier.

But that won't halt the rise of bad loans, which is likely closer to its start than its finish. So far, bad-loan formation has been concentrated in the private sector. It could soon spread to state-owned enterprises, especially as Beijing pledges to cut excess capacity and kill off "zombie companies."

What's in your wallet?

Americans' ability to answer that burning question isn't all that encouraging. It turns out, though, that cluelessness about money varies by geography.

The odds of getting a good answer from Americans is highest in New Hampshire: The residents of the Granite State came out tops in a survey of financial literacy by WalletHub.

The weakest states on that measure were Alaska and Nevada. Washington, D.C., was even worse. Wags might dismiss the residents of those three places as being a bit naive because they have been conditioned to think money comes from oil wells, slot machines or congressional appropriations, respectively. The answer, though, probably has nothing to do with how people make a living.

The odds of incorrect answers to basic financial questions and of financial readiness such as having certain types of accounts or an emergency fund correlated with lower income, younger age and minority status. New Hampshire, which is 94% white and both older and wealthier than most states, had the odds in its favor.

While residents of more financially literate states have earned mild bragging rights, the upshot of the survey is that America remains an unequal place not just by income but how people save and invest it.

Moat Raises $50M to Help Develop Digital Ad Currency; The Web media analytics  company Moat has raised $50 million in new funding as it looks to take on an ambitious goal.

The Web media analytics company Moat has raised $50 million in new funding as it looks to take on an ambitious goal. It plans to challenge Google , Nielsen, comScore and other digital media companies by developing a standard metric that would serve as the currency for buying and selling digital ads.

Founded in 2010, Moat is perhaps best known for being one of the leading companies that track viewability--determining whether online ads can be seen by real people. But the 125-person company, which had previously raised over $17 million, aspires to do much more. According to co-founder and Chief Executive Jonah Goodhart, Moat is working on a new measurement designed to help Web advertisers and publishers gauge whether people pay attention to digital ads and are impacted by them.

The investment round was led by Insight Venture Partners .

The ultimate goal for Moat will be to have advertisers negotiate ad deals using this new metric, rather than relying on the long-standing practice of billing advertisers based on how many ads are delivered to a Web page by  ad serving" software.

Typically, ad serving data comes from Google --the leading ad serving provider in the industry. That data is often used by media companies to track how many ads they deliver and to bill advertisers. In addition, advertisers often use tools from comScore and Nielsen to enhance ad serving data, such as tracking the demographic makeup of the audience that is exposed to an ad campaign.

But as more digital advertising moves away from standard banners on Web pages toward video and native ads on platforms like YouTube , Snapchat and Facebook , Moat sees an opportunity to displace Google and other metrics providers.

Mr. Goodhart said Moat is already well positioned to do this, since it has its own viewability tracking mechanisms plugged into Facebook ,

YouTube and Twitter . Plus, a major advertiser, Unilever , is already transacting ad deals using Moat data.

 Our ambition is to build the currency for digital advertising," he said, while emphasizing that Moat sees companies like Nielsen and Google as potential partners in this effort.

Moat has successfully pivoted before. The company first launched with the idea of building a crowdsourcing tool for online ad creative, which never took off. Over time, the Moat team built a search engine for online ads, then started selling access to advanced analytics to marketers.

In the past few years, as the online ad industry rushed to start only buying ads that are viewable, Moat was in the right place at the right time and moved aggressively to build out viewability tracking tools for both desktops and mobile Web pages.

While he declined to discuss specific figures, Mr. Goodhart said that Moat has been profitable for the past two years and that revenue tripled from 2014 to 2015.

 The first thing I wrote down when we started this company five years ago was, we need to make brand advertising more effective online," said Mr. Goodhart. He and his Moat partner Michael Walrath and previously founded Right Media, an early digital ad exchange that was heavily used by direct-response advertisers. It was sold to Yahoo in 2007.

With Moat, the plan was to cater more to the kinds of marketers who spent heavily on TV, like car, beer and toothpaste brands.  Most stuff is bought offline," he said.  We're trying to connect those dots. If you look at TV, it has a currency [with Nielsen data]. It may be flawed, but the point is, everyone is on the same page."

Surely, most every digital media company would like to see more TV ad budgets come their way. But getting everyone on the same page for a brand new currency won't be easy. Just getting viewability standards set across the industry has been challenging.

Peter Naylor , head of sales for Hulu , said he started working with Moat a few years ago when brands started pushing the viewability concept. That move led to more ad budgets coming Hulu 's way, he said.

So he's impressed with Moat's technology and approach.  They are really in touch with the needs of both sides of the business," he said.  There is an opening there. But [ad] server counting is pretty foundationally sound in the industry."

Megan Pagliuca, global chief executive at Accuen, an agency that specializes in data-driven ad buying, said she's generally on board with Moat's philosophy.  I do think the industry needs to evolve beyond the metrics we have today," she said.  Ad serving data is clearly not enough."

But Ms. Pagliuca said it may be hard for any one company to solve all of the digital ad world's needs. For example, besides tracking whether ads are viewable or command attention, advertisers are looking for help in tracking people across different devices and different media vehicles, she said.

For now, Moat is focused on building out its technology aimed at developing this potential new ad currency, as well as hiring. The plan is to double staff this year, Mr. Goodhart said.  We think we are at an interesting crossroads in the industry," he said.  Where Marketers are saying,  if I can't measure it, I can't buy it.'"

Turner Leads $15 Million Investment in Mashable; Media companies plan to collaborate on TV content creation, ad deals

Turner has led a new $15 million investment round in the digital publisher "http://mashable.com/".

As part of the new partnership, the two companies will develop content together for both digital and linear distribution. Plus, Turner will gain access to Mashable's "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/10/360i-gains-access-to-mashables-viral-prediction-technology/" an analytics tool that Mashable uses to help identify which content is likely to resonate in social media.

Besides programming, Mashable and Turner will also collaborate on advertising opportunities, including the development of video content commissioned by marketers that could be distributed both on TV and the Web, the companies said.

In addition to Turner, Time Warner Investments (a division of Turner's parent company Time Warner Inc.), Updata Partners and several other investors contributed to the funding round. Mashable's valuation wasn't disclosed.

Kevin Reilly, chief creative officer for Turner Entertainment and president of TBS and TNT, said he envisions the deal helping his company unearth new types of talent and genres that might not necessarily surface through the traditional TV pilot process.

 I think they could help us find some content," he said.  A lot of companies look to make this kind of investment because they want to buy into a business they don't really understand. But this is truly strategic."

Besides helping Turner tap into the digital video talent pool, Mr. Reilly, who will join Mashable's board of directors, said the companies will collaborate on branded entertainment deals with advertisers.

Plus, Turner will try to help Mashable figure out how to take its expertise in churning out timely, short-form video and potentially extend that ability beyond quick social media hits.

 If you look at all of these digital companies, they are asking,  Is all short-form video just disposable?'" Mr. Reilly said.  So now, as they look to scale, they are wrestling with trying to build video brands and IP." That should be where a TV company like Turner's excels, he said.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/mashable-business-insider-get-new-funding-1422507663"in a round led by Time Warner Investments. At that time, Mashable earmarked some of those funds toward ramping up the company's video operations.

However, this time around, Pete Cashmore, Mashable's founder and chief executive, said the new cash infusion is aimed at helping Mashable crack TV.

 This round is certainly a different thing," he said.  We were not looking for traditional capital. We think TV is the next big opportunity, and digital media has an opportunity to bring its data-driven approach. But we certainly don't know everything. So we said,  Why don't we start a learning process?' We think it's smart to get ahead of this."

Earlier this month, "https://www.theinformation.com/time-warner-investing-more-in-mashable". It's the latest in a series of digital investments for Turner, including plans to spend more money "http://www.wsj.com/articles/turner-plans-to-spend-100-million-expanding-bleacher-report-1458813601"and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/cnn-to-pump-20-million-into-digital-expansion-1458122401".

Correction: An original version of this article listed Mashable Chief Executive Pete Cashmore as co-founder of the site. Mr. Cashmore is the sole founder of the company.

Fidelity Investments cuts valuations on start-ups

Fidelity Investments has cut the valuations on many of the start-ups in which it owns shares, underscoring the adjustment under way in Silicon Valley as investors become more sceptical.

Among Fidelity s heaviest writedowns were enterprise software companies Cloudera and Dropbox, which had the value of their shares cut by 38 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, from the end of January to the end of February.

The writedowns also reflect declines in technology share prices more broadly, as companies such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Salesforce have seen share prices sink.

Enterprise software companies that rely on subscription sales have come under particular scrutiny because their business models often rely on heavy marketing to drive growth.

Cloudera, which sells software to help companies manage big data, has delayed listing at a time of volatility in the public markets, even though many analysts expected it might try for an initial public offering last year. There have been no tech IPOs this year, after several tech companies went public last year at valuations lower than they earned on the private markets.

Dropbox, known for its photo and document sharing services, has been trying to move from consumer sales to a model that emphasises enterprise sales. However, the company has struggled with several new products that have not performed as well as hoped.

"http://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/Fidelity_Worldwide_Investment_Ltd" mutual funds also wrote down the value of software companies such as Nutanix, Delphix, Cloudflare and Appirio in monthly holdings reports released on Wednesday. The carrying value of these shares is determined by an independent team of analysts who draw on public company share prices, recent share transactions and revenue updates.

The value of a handful of companies increased, including Snapchat, the app known for its disappearing messages.

In February Fidelity increased its investment in Snapchat as part of a follow-on round even though Fidelity s own analysts had marked down the value of Snapchat shares last year. The new investment, at about $30 per share, in effect resets Fidelity s valuation of Snapchat back to its previous levels. Fidelity declined to comment.

The cooling valuations have so far had little impact on capital flows to venture capital groups. Preliminary data from "http://www.wsj.com/articles/funds-flow-to-venture-firms-1459295426"show that US venture capital companies have raised more money in the first quarter of this year than in any quarter since the dotcom bubble.

Huge sums are still flowing to start-ups too, and as valuations come down, some investors are starting to see better opportunities to invest. Last year, venture capital groups invested $58.8bn in start-ups in the US, the second-highest level in the past 20 years, according to a report from PwC and the National Venture Capital Association.

Banks Fight Tech Inertia and Fintech Startups; Banks, under pressure to respond to fintech startups circling their markets, are working on many fronts to inject new technology into operations, including opening labs and working with new vendors. But some banks have been slow to respond to competitive threats, hampered by an instinct to preserve legacy technology and existing business models, analysts say.

Banks, under pressure to respond to fintech startups circling their markets, are working on many fronts to inject new technology into operations, including opening labs and working with new vendors. But some banks have been slow to respond to competitive threats, hampered by an instinct to preserve legacy technology and existing business models, analysts say.

Old technology can hobble innovation at some banks, said Rebecca Wettemann, vice president of research at Nucleus Research. That is because core software for processing transactions was built decades ago in some cases, and heavily customized, Ms. Wettemann said.  CIOs are in a tough spot trying to drive innovation without exposing risk to core systems," she said.

To modernize, many banks are bringing in new technology for marketing or consumer-facing situations, like mobile banking, Ms. Wettemenn said.

One reason banks have started innovation labs and embraced working with startups is because a lot of internal technology resources go to maintenance and regulatory compliance, said Rajiv Singh, chief executive of North American wholesale banking at Rabobank Group.  They're tapped out. They're busy dealing with the past," he said.

Others in financial services, including insurance and investment companies, are making bigger strides than banks, according to Boston Consulting Group. In its annual list of the 50 most innovative companies in the world last year, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was the only bank included.

Insurers, like fintech startups, are making good use of analytics, said Christophe Duthoit, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. Progressive Corp., for example, is hiring more data scientists as it ramps up experiments with real-time analytics to deliver customized policies, as CIO Journal reported in December. Progressive, Allstate Corp. and other insurance companies are pushing devices and apps to monitor customers' driving habits and tailor pricing accordingly, a new way of sizing up risk.

Banks have to change their mindset from thinking of themselves as transaction processors to exploiters of information, like Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., Mr. Duthoit said.  If you're better at collecting and exploiting vast amounts of information, then you can make some different offerings to a bunch of people" applying for loans, he said.

Analyzing data to create a complete  digital experience" for customers is difficult because typically at a big bank, information is spread across many different systems and departments, said Michael Raneri, managing director in PricewaterhouseCoopers' Strategy& financial advisory practice. Rather than significant change, Mr. Raneri said,  there's inertia that leads banks to incrementally improve what already exists."

Hedge fund  quants  win heart diagnosis challenge

Two hedge fund  quants  have come up with an algorithm that diagnoses heart disease from MRI images, beating nearly 1,000 other teams in one of the most ambitious competitions in artificial intelligence.

Tencia Lee, who recently left Los Angeles-based Crabel Capital Management to join a robotics start-up, said she and partner Qi Liu, a former employee of hedge fund Two Sigma, had not previously worked before with the winning technology, called deep learning.

Ms Lee and Mr Qi entered the contest in December and created a method that has proved, in early tests, to be as effective as a cardiologist in analysing images of the heart.

 People have been working on this for 15 years   I m amazed what kind of results came out of this competition in three months,  said Andrew Arai, chief of advanced cardiovascular imaging at the National Institutes of Health.

MRIs are used to diagnose heart disease around 1m times a year in the US, Mr Arai said, with cardiologists spending an average of 20 minutes on each image. That could make the algorithm an important addition to a growing field of automated medical imaging, though it faces stringent formal tests before it can be adopted.

The winning entry used a so-called convolutional neural network, a form of deep learning designed to emulate the way vision works in animals.

Ms Lee said that neither of the pair had worked with neural networks before and had taken software from GitHub, an online repository of open-source software, to solve the challenge. The main problem they faced had been to define the problem in a precise enough way, she added. After that, it was a question of feeding examples of heart MRIs into the neural network and letting it work out the solution.

The availability of such software meant that even complex problems were open to being solved by experts with a more general background in data science, Ms Lee said.  We are both very experienced with working with large amounts of data, and having an intuition about where to look for problems,  she said.  It took all my spare time over a period of three months. 

Recent technology advances are  allowing us to do things with images that were not possible three or four years ago , said Anthony Goldbloom, chief executive of Kaggle, which ran the National Science Data Bowl competition with consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton.

The changes include development of specialised chips suited to pattern recognition, called graphical processing units, or GPUs, and big increases in computing capacity, he added.

Open competitions have become an increasingly common way to solve difficult data science problems. Netflix ran one of the most prominent in 2009 with a $1m competition to come up with an algorithm to make film recommendations.

Kaggle, which conducts about 50 competitions a year on behalf of big companies, said the heart imaging challenge was the hardest it had run. The chance of winning instant fame in their field, even more than the prize money, accounted for the large number of people who entered such contests, Mr Goldbloom said.

Sander Dieleman, a PhD student in neural networks who headed a team from the University of Ghent that won last year s National Data Science Bowl, has since been hired by DeepMind, Google s UK-based deep-learning arm whose system recently beat the top human champion at the board game Go.

Ms Lee and Mr Qi entered the competition individually and were placed in the top 10 after an early round. They teamed up after Mr Qi posted a message on Kaggle seeking help.

This story has been updated to clarify that Qi Liu no longer works for Two Sigma

RISING STAR: Permira s Dipan Patel Shows Knack for Finding Tech s  Hidden Gems 

Dipan Patel has made a name at London-based buyout shop Permira for unlocking the potential of quirky technology businesses.

In 2011, the executive spotted the then-publicly listed Renaissance Learning Inc., and convinced the Permira team to visit the educational assessment and learning analytics company in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., a city known more for its timber industry than its technology. The visit paved the way for Permira's purchase of the company later that year for $440 million.

 Whenever I brought up Renaissance Learning, people would say,  That quirky Wisconsin business,'" Mr. Patel said.  That really intrigued me, because I could see from customer calls, school penetration and key performance indicators that it was a hidden gem."

The 33-year old Mr. Patel, who was promoted to partner in February, has built a career not only on his ability to find promising tech companies other firms may have overlooked, but by also identifying what those companies need to transform themselves and grow.

Dipan Patel

An Early Start

Mr. Patel, whose father was a serial entrepreneur, learned about investing at a young age around the family dinner table.  I grew up very comfortable with the notion of looking at lots of businesses and opportunities, understood a company's earnings, return, relative return and if our family should put money here or elsewhere," he said.

Career Path

Mr. Patel joined Permira as a London associate in 2009 and relocated to the Menlo Park, Calif., office in 2012. He was promoted to principal in 2014 and to partner in February.

Education

Mr. Patel holds a degree in economics from the University of Cambridge.

Board Positions

He serves as a non-executive director at Ancestry.com LLC, Legalzoom.com Inc. and data integration software provider Informatica Corp.

With Renaissance, for example, Mr. Patel could see the company's technological capability in assessing students' learning progress was weighed down by its quiz and hardware offerings, including its own version of a laptop called NEO.

Brian Ruder, a partner and co-head of Permira's technology team, praised Mr. Patel's foresight in spotting intense competition in hardware offerings from big technology companies, adding that Mr. Patel told his colleagues,  Newsflash, the world is going to iPads, Androids and tablets in the classroom."

Permira restructured Renaissance's business and disposed of its noncore quiz and hardware assets to focus on its core business of school improvement and student assessment software and technology. That shift helped the company grow its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by about 50% during the three years the firm owned it. When Permira sold Renaissance in 2014 to San Francisco peer Hellman & Friedman, the firm made more than four times its money.

 It was a team effort but it was Dipan who found it, developed and helped execute it both on the way in and on the way out," Mr. Ruder said.

Mr. Patel has  a unique combination of very good commercial judgment   he knows a good business when he sees it   and the ability to think about the quality of a business in a very quantitative way," said Mr. Ruder, adding that Mr. Patel's British charm works in the U.S.  like warm butter."

Among those charmed was John Suh, chief executive of Legalzoom.com Inc., who described Mr. Patel as having  an extra gear," apart from being analytical.  Too often highly analytic people get trapped in the weeds. Dipan can wallow in the data and still step back and elevate...staying focused on the two or three most difficult or important questions," he said.

Permira paid more than $200 million to take a majority stake in Legalzoom.com in 2014. At the time, the online platform that sells do-it-yourself wills and other legal documents was switching to a subscription-based model, a move that often leads to a dip in revenue during the transition period. Mr. Ruder said the young executive was the  key agent on the board to coach and cajole the management team to accelerate and focus on the transition that the business was just in the early stages of making."

Annual customer renewal rates turned out to be better than expected and became a significant business driver.

 At the time of the investment, we had launched multiple new services with no data on renewals. Management was using a conservative estimate, but there was considerable perceived risk at the time," Mr. Suh said.  Permira made an educated bet borne out of deep analysis...they took a leap of faith and were rewarded when we outperformed."

MapD Locates $10M Series A for Faster Databases; Todd Mostak couldn t have predicted that his time in Cairo as an Arabic-English translator or as a student of Middle East studies at Harvard University would eventually lead him to a startup.

Todd Mostak couldn't have predicted that his time in Cairo as an Arabic-English translator or as a student of Middle East studies at Harvard University would eventually lead him to a startup.

But as he was working on his thesis about social media in the Middle East, he realized there were no databases or visualization tools fast enough to do the kind of analysis he needed. So he decided to make his own while taking a class at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The result of his path was the GPU-powered database and analytics suite that is now known as MapD Technologies Inc. The startup, founded in 2013, recently closed $10 in Series A funding led by Vanedge Capital, which had participation from Verizon Ventures, Nvidia Corporation and GV, formerly Google Ventures.

Mr. Mostak declined to disclose the company's valuation but said it has raised $12 million to date.

Many data tools today are powered by CPUs, or central processing units. MapD is instead powered by graphics cards, known as GPUs. CPUs only consist of a few cores optimized for sequential serial processing, but GPUs have thousands of smaller, more efficient cores that can handle many tasks simultaneously.

MapD uses these chips to power SQL queries. The tool has a wide variety of applications for large sets of enterprise data. It has been used for social media analytics at companies such as Facebook Inc., business intelligence at companies the likes of Verizon and recently has even been used by government agencies.

Though the buzzword  big data" is often used to describe his startup, Mr. Mostak thinks the company falls into an emerging category. He said the company deals with tens of gigabytes to tens of terabytes of working data.

 Its allows you to be very interactive on it," Mr. Mostak said.  I would say we're  fast data.'"

On its website, MapD shows how its GPU-powered tweetmap can break down 60 million geo-coded tweets. The application shows where people sent the tweets from and what devices people use to send them.

The company offers two products, a database and a visualization platform. The products are sold separately but can be used together.

Mr. Mostak said MapD is only going to get faster, thanks to innovation from GPU manufacturers. Consumer demand for high-definition videogames has fueled development in the sector faster than in CPUs, Mr. Mostak said. Large tech companies investing in virtual reality also have interest in improved GPUs because the better the graphics card, the less likely a person is to get sick. Mr. Mostak said he can now get cards as large as 24 gigabytes but that size will double very soon.

He said such an increase could allow the company to process data up to 200 times faster.

Within the next year, Mr. Mostak said the company will move toward machine learning applications. Mr. Mostak said in the future, MapD could have applications in image classification and natural language.

MapD has about 20 employees, and it recently took its product to market. The company has seven clients, and Mr. Mostak said the recent funding will be used toward hiring and sales.

Industrial Color Brands, a photo and video production company, said it acquired the studio division of eBay Enterprise Marketing Solutions, a portfolio company of Banneker Partners and Permira.

The purchase of the division, which specializes in e-commerce photography services, includes studios in New York, King of Prussia, Pa. and Louisville, Ky., according to a news release.

EBay Inc. in November 2015 shed its eBay Enterprise division. The division was broken up into multiple businesses by investors such as Sterling Partners, Longview Asset Management, Zeta Interactive and Permira.

Permira, with Banneker Partners, at that time acquired the marketing division of eBay Enterprise, which is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and offers services such as advertising, digital marketing analytics and online search management.

Boston-based digital marketing company Ve Interactive in December 2015 said it acquired a digital advertising division of the eBay Enterprise Marketing Solutions business that was bought by Permira and Banneker.

Industrial Color Brands, of New York, offers production resources such as still and video capture, postproduction services and studio facilities for brands, agencies and other professionals in the fashion, retail, advertising media and entertainment industries.

London firm Permira invests across the consumer, financial services, health-care, industrials and technology sectors, typically backing companies for five years.

San Francisco-based Banneker Partners targets control or large noncontrol investments in companies with revenue of $5 million to $100 million in sectors such as software, Internet and technology business services.

Falfurrias Hits $100M Mark With First Closing for Fund III; Falfurrias Capital, founded by a team of former Bank of America Corp. executives, collected about $100 million for the first closing of its third lower midmarket fund, said a person with knowledge of the offering.

Falfurrias Capital, founded by a team of former Bank of America Corp. executives, collected about $100 million for the first closing of its third lower midmarket fund, said a person with knowledge of the offering.

The initial closing, which includes the firm's own commitment, takes Falfurrias Capital Partners III LP almost half way to its $225 million goal. It is also approaching the roughly $105 million raised by its predecessor and exceeds the firm's $97 million debut fund.

The Charlotte, N.C., firm expects to hold another closing for the fund in the next six to eight weeks that will take it closer to the vehicle's target, the person said.

Falfurrias targets investments in companies with $3 million to $25 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. However, the firm also has tapped into co-investment capital from its fund backers to finance larger deals, including ones with enterprise values of more than $100 million.

The firm has fully realized its first fund, which generated a 2.2-times net return on its capital, the person said. Investing from its second fund, the firm in July acquired a controlling stake in RegEd Inc., a provider of compliance software for the financial services industry.

Falfurrias has exited at least five portfolio companies from previous funds, according to its website. They include index and analytics provider Dorsey Wright & Associates Inc., which the firm backed from both its first and second funds and sold last year to Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (now Nasdaq Inc.) for $225 million.

Shannon Advisors LLC is placing Fund III, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Falfurrias was founded in 2006 by Hugh McColl Jr., the former chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, and Marc Oken, formerly the chief financial officer of the bank.

SEC Investigating SunEdison's Disclosures to Investors About Its Liquidity

Mutual-Fund Sponsors Banked on a Softer SEC

After years of enjoying lighter-touch regulation under the Securities and Exchange Commission, the asset-management industry issued an unusual plea in 2014: Please regulate us.

Mutual-fund sponsors, including Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc., appealed to their long-time regulator because they feared a crackdown from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which wields the power to subject any big financial firm to the type of enhanced oversight reserved for Wall Street banks.

As the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-funds-for-retail-class-face-regulatory-reckoning-1459137603", the industry's strategy has yet to pay the dividends it hoped for. Comment letters filed with the SEC on Monday argue the agency's proposal to restrict mutual funds' use of leverage would devastate some alternative mutual funds which make extensive use of derivatives and force them to withdraw from the retail market. No industry lobbyist could have planned for that outcome.

It's understandable that mutual funds counted on a softer approach. For decades the SEC operated as a  disclosure agency," meaning it worked to ensure that individuals and institutions got the information they need to make investment decisions. It sued companies and individuals that issued false information or otherwise strayed from its rules. But its army of lawyers and accountants didn't consider it their role to measure whether one mutual fund's troubles could infect the rest of the financial system.

That approach began to change, of course, after the financial crisis. In recent speeches, Chairman Mary Jo White has talked up the SEC's evolution into a regulator that does more than inform investors of risk and return.  More and more, the complexity of products, changes in market participant behavior, pervasive network technology, and systemic risks call for additional protections beyond those that can be achieved through disclosure alone," "https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/white-speech-beyond-disclosure-at-the-sec-in-2016-021916.html" in February.

That doesn't mean that industry will always agree. The fresh fight over the SEC's leverage cap follows a similar fracas over its plan to ensure funds don't get caught during a market backdraft holding too many illiquid investments.  There is no justification for such detailed regulatory intervention," the Investment Company Institute wrote in a comment letter in January.

Ms. White and other SEC officials want to complete many of the asset-management rules before the end of the Obama administration early next year. In theory, that means both sides have incentives to compromise. Finishing several rules would allow Ms. White and the SEC to declare victory over both emerging financial risks and the threat of other regulators intruding on their turf.

To be sure, the effort could stall. The SEC's rulemaking process is notoriously slow and its progress could be delayed by the arrival of two new commissioners, who may want to put their own stamp on the regulations. The SEC is currently operating with only three commissioners after two veteran members resigned last year.

Yet industry groups like the ICI are aware that they, too, need to strike a balance. Any hint that the SEC has gone wobbly on its plans could invite renewed scrutiny by the oversight council. That's why the latest industry comment letters continue to profess support for the SEC's effort while opposing many important details of its proposals.

Smoothing Out Quarter-End Volatility

Before the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve needed to bolster its reserves to prevent spikes in the federal-funds rate, the rate banks charge to other banks that are borrowing money, typically overnight. Since the crisis, however, the Fed faces the opposite problem, with the excess of reserves causing increased volatility. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and particularly in the years leading up to the financial crisis, the fed-funds rate experienced significant volatility around the end of each quarter, during the periods of highest demand. To offset that volatility, the Fed injected extra reserves into the system, allowing it to keep the fed-funds rate on target even during times of spiking demand, "http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/03/how-the-fed-smoothed-quarter-end-volatility-in-the-fed-funds-market.html#.Vvl3leIrJhG".

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-companies-caught-in-sanctions-gray-zone-in-myanmar-1459180983?tesla=y" its sanctions on Myanmar, those that remain are crimping the scope of American companies to do business here, even as the first democratically elected president in over half a century prepares to take office.Many U.S. companies have expressed a strong interest in investing in Myanmar, but find themselves falling behind competitors from places, including China and the European Union, that have already lifted their sanctions against the old military regime or never had any.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-invent-new-performance-benchmarks-1459210549" are changing the way they define success. As they are forced to adjust to new delivery methods or changing consumer tastes, corporate finance chiefs are reconsidering what benchmarks they should share with investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed concern about the spread of such customized benchmarks.

Big 10 banks fined $43bn over seven years for failures in customer reporting

Failures in customer reporting have cost the world's top investment banks $43bn in fines over the past seven years, making it the single most expensive compliance issue, according to new research.

The main types of failure and wrong-doing that resulted in fines worth a total of $150bn for 10 US and European banks between 2009 and 2015 have been tracked by Corlytics, an analytics firm. These compliance issues range from rigging foreign exchange rates and money laundering to product mis-selling.

The 10 banks covered by Corlytics' work are Barclays, Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS. The fines relate to both civil and criminal cases brought by regulators and other authorities with powers to levy penalties.

The seven years of fines have already taken a heavy toll on the banks, wiping out the equivalent of 14 per cent of their equity capital.

John Byrne, chief executive of Corlytics, said that client reporting failures were the source of substantial fines for banks in a wide variety of cases, including misleading customers on investments and not communicating clearly enough with borrowers.

"It can involve any aspect of client disadvantage or loss due to inaccurate or misleading reports or communication," he added. Corlytics' work shows that poor disclosure to clients was a factor in the $25bn of fines paid by US banks in a 2012 settlement for abusive foreclosure practices.

The second most expensive issue for the 10 banks was failures in how they sold residential mortgage securities, which resulted in a penalties total of $27.7bn. The banks meanwhile paid $20.2bn in fines in relation to securitisation failures. "Rate setting" fines came to $14.6bn, partly stemming from banks' manipulation of foreign exchange and interest rates.

Mr Byrne said that while many banks have "experienced serious issues with regulators, some have not".

VC Funds Stay Out of Blockchain Loop; Venture-capital firms, a go-to source of capital for tech wizards, say they are not rushing to open their checkbooks on blockchain--the technology that has captured the imagination of Wall Street.

Venture-capital firms, a go-to source of capital for tech wizards, say they are not rushing to open their checkbooks on blockchain--the technology that has captured the imagination of Wall Street.

Last year was the year that big banks, exchanges and high-profile finance professionals flocked to distributed ledgers such as blockchain, championing their potential to revolutionize capital markets--especially post-trade processes--and save the industry large amounts of time and money.

Autonomous Research has suggested blockchain could help banks eliminate $16 billion, or one-third of annual clearing and settlement costs by 2021.

Huge industry collaborations are under way and the likes of UBS, Deutsche Bank and Nasdaq have already declared successful tests in scenarios ranging from bond trading to the sale and settlement of shares.

VC firms invested $460 million in blockchain and bitcoin startups in 2015, according to a March report by KPMG and CB Insights. But while this figure was over 50% up on the previous year it was modest compared with investment in other areas of financial innovation, such as robo-advisory, alternative lending and machine learning, according to the report, which cautioned investors  to take a balanced approach" to their blockchain strategies.

While not dismissing the potential of blockchain, many venture capital investors say it is too early to pick winners in a market that will require a significant overhaul of financial infrastructures to grow.

Matt Harris, a managing director at New York-based Bain Capital Ventures, which has invested in the Digital Currency Group, said:  The issue for VCs in investing in blockchain startups is that, as yet, no one really knows what it means.

 We understand bitcoin and the associated blockchain, and can act on our views and beliefs there, but right now the more generic blockchain space is pretty muddled."

Valuations are also a concern, according to some influential investors, who believe that hype around blockchain at the big banks is skewing prices.

Mark Beeston, a managing partner at capital markets fintech fund Illuminate Financial, said:  Blockchain seems to be priced fundamentally differently to other capital markets fintech: it is getting B2C-type early-stage valuations, which would appear to be driven by the perception of billion-dollar savings."

Chain, the San Francisco-based blockchain startup, Digital Asset, which is run by former J.P. Morgan commodities chief Blythe Masters, and the Montreal-based blockchain startup Blockstream have all secured funding rounds in the tens of millions of dollars over the past year--with a lot of the money coming from big financial firms.

As potential beneficiaries and users of the technology, banks and other market participants are making investments that are strategic, and therefore different to the nature of venture-capital firms.

Allard Luchsinger, a director at Dutch venture-capital firm Velocity Capital, said:  It's smart of the banks [to invest] because for them there is a use case that is so clear. We are a VC and not a bank so we need to invest in companies that we think are really going to scale up."

Jon Korngold, managing director and global head of financial services at U.S.-based General Atlantic, went further. He said:  While the banks' investments will not ensure success for any one platform, it's probably safe to conclude that the current universe of potential winners will be limited to those with investments from the banks, with the other platforms who have yet to secure bank funding at risk of finding themselves on the outside of the winners' circle, looking in."

The current state of blockchain development is often likened to the early days of the Internet and, as such, Illuminate's Mr. Beeston said it was  far from clear" whether startups would be the biggest financial winners from its evolution, or whether finance's bigger names would come out on top.

Global interdealer broker ICAP on March 15 said it had successfully tested a new blockchain-based system, called Project Infinity, in the FX markets that it hoped to bring to market. U.S. exchange group Nasdaq has also taken an aggressive approach on blockchain and is participating in bids to provide distributed ledger services and solutions to capital markets firms.

In their March report, KPMG and CB Insights wrote that the  ability for blockchain to become a true game-changer is still in progress", noting that there were  substantial barriers that must be overcome in order to implement it successfully within banking and capital markets."

Overhauls of market infrastructures take time. As well as a need for banks to come together and agree on implementation standards and for existing technology systems to be replaced, regulators will have their say. In February, European lawmakers called for a task force to be set up to explore ways of regulating blockchain use.

Manu Gupta, a general partner at Zurich-based Lakestar, a backer of well-known fintech companies such as alternative lender SoFi, fixed income information startup Algomi and bank-backed chat service Symphony, said the firm spent time looking at blockchain but decided not to invest.

 You are changing the plumbing of banking--that is the reason why we ultimately backed away from it. We recognize that, without the endorsement of the banks, the adoption rates will take forever," he said.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Gilead Sciences has dodged one of the threats to its hepatitis C juggernaut.

True, Gilead shares fell after the company lost a legal challenge from Merck to patents surrounding its hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni last week. A federal jury ordered Gilead to pay Merck $200 million in damages.

But the outcome, which Gilead plans to appeal, could have been far worse: Merck had asked for $2 billion in damages. A separate hearing will take place to decide whether Merck is entitled to a royalty on future sales.

Investors worry the hepatitis C franchise has matured after generating cumulative sales of more than $30 billion. Those drugs accounted for 60% of Gilead's 2015 sales. As such, Gilead trades at a much lower multiple of forward earnings than peers. The jury's manageable award doesn't eliminate those fears, but Gilead can cross one problem off its list.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts made waves last week by suggesting in a research note a breakup of Citigroup, starting with the sale of international assets like Mexican unit Banamex. Not everyone was buying it. Karen Shaw Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics likened it to becoming a mermaid -- a nice idea but hardly realistic.

There must be willing buyers, and "I have not seen home-country banks in emerging economies exactly rolling in dough right now," Ms. Petrou wrote. And global banks that could be buyers, like HSBC, Standard Chartered and Barclays, have their own issues. That leaves listings of emerging-market units. But as stand-alone banks, they could suffer from lower credit ratings.

This maiden isn't likely to sprout a tail anytime soon.

'Quantitative' financiers are sceptical that new technologies will help in battle for returns

Isaac Newton may have been one of the finest minds of all time, but he turned out to be a miserable investor. "I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people," he lamented after losing a fortune in the South Sea bubble .

Increasingly, however, technology-savvy investors think they can harness mathematics and computer science to predict financial markets. Some of the most advanced asset managers are turning to artificial intelligence , with investment algorithms that can autonomously learn, adapt and scour vast data sets for tradable patterns.

But some "quantitative" financiers, or quants , are sceptical that these tools are any more than a somewhat better mousetrap, and argue that areas such as "machine learning" are overhyped and AI used as a marketing gimmick.

"Everyone wants the Holy Grail, something they can invest in and it will make 1 per cent a month forever," says Ewan Kirk, head of Cantab Capital, a quantitative hedge fund. "I don't want to be cynical, but I am sceptical."

David Harding, head of Winton Capital, one of the biggest quantitative hedge funds in the world, is also doubtful that AI represents a quantum leap for the investment industry. "I'm not a Luddite, we're always interested in new ways to make money. But I have to be very sceptical because I constantly have world-class people showing me miracle cures that don't actually work," he says.

Improvements in computing power have revolutionised the investment world, with algorithmic traders and investors increasingly influential across markets. Money is pouring into computer-driven hedge funds that have consistently managed to parse signals amid market noise. As a result money managers are scrambling to hire computer scientists, often pitting them in direct competition for talent with Silicon Valley's tech giants and hot start-ups.

AI is at the forefront of this. The field has taken several leaps forward in recent years. Most notably, Google's DeepMind AI arm has created a programme that recently thrashed a legendary player of Go, an ancient Chinese game so complex that most experts had reckoned it would take at least a decade before a computer could beat a human champion .

The potentially wider applications of techniques used by the likes of DeepMind's AlphaGo algorithm have fuelled optimism that investment management could be on the cusp of another technological revolution, possibly similar in scale to the electronification of markets in the 1970s and 1980s.

"Machine learning and artificial intelligence is going to play a very large role in quant managers, but also with traditional asset managers that are aggressively expanding in this space," says Osman Ali, a fund manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

Popular AI approaches such as machine learning can be used by computers to develop autonomously. For example, a machine learning algorithm can master a computer game such as Super Mario independently, at first playing the arcade classic randomly but quickly figuring out how the controls work.

There is therefore widespread enthusiasm for the potential of machine learning algos to find fleeting but profitable patterns in the vast sea of data.

"I think of algos as little children that can scale tremendously," says Brad Betts of BlackRock's Scientific Active Equity arm. "And you can teach them to read millions of books at the same time."

Yet scepticism, even among quants, is pervasive. They see areas such as machine learning and deep learning - the latter underpinned DeepMind's Go exploits - merely as extensions of techniques that have long been in use.

"Lots of people [have been using] techniques that could be called machine learning for decades," argues Robert Hillman, head of Neuron Capital. "There's a huge difference between image recognition and using AI in markets. Will this be a paradigm change for investing? I don't think so . . . It's not a fundamental change, it's an efficiency improvement."

Mr Kirk says that most common AI approaches are focused on pattern recognition, such as telling the difference between a cat and a dog in an image. But markets are dominated by noise and chaos; the patterns are harder to find.

"As a geek I'm super-excited about AlphaGo, but it's a big leap from beating a game with clearly defined rules and objectives [to] investing," he says.

Even quants that are cautiously optimistic on the future of AI in investing warn of pitfalls. Algorithms that may look ingenious and backrest superbly against historical data have a habit of unravelling when confronted with unforgivingly fickle financial markets.

"Playing Super Mario might not necessarily work for markets. If you hit the button you always know what will happen, but you don't in markets," says another quant at a large hedge fund. "It can take time for it to find the good trades and to optimise them. It can go through a lot of bad trades."
