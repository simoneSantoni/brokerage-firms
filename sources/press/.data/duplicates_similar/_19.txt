After a very active year for the stock market, we ask The Experts to look back and offer readers their reflections on this question: What's the biggest lesson investors should take away from 2013?

This discussion relates to the latest Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Dec. 5.

SHERYL GARRETT: If you feel better due to the returns on your investment portfolio this year enjoy it. However, the most important benchmark to focus on is your net- worth statement. Many people are once again saving intently for retirement while at the same time they're going into debt to maintain their lifestyle. The biggest lesson from 2013: Lifestyles are not entitlements. We can only control or influence certain things and the stock market isn't one of them. Be thoughtful about all of your expenditures. Eliminate all consumer debt. Reduce investing and investment management expenses as much as appropriate and count your blessings. Your good fortune in 2013 was most likely due to having an appropriate allocation for you and being invested &all boats rise when the markets are up. We are not experiencing a "New Normal." Be very, very careful. Control those costs you can and make sure your balance sheet is continually improving.

Sheryl Garrett (@SherylGarrett) is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.

LARRY ZIMPLEMAN: I think the biggest lesson for investors in 2013 is it shows (once again) that it is very difficult to predict investment returns in advance. Few, if any, would have predicted the strong performance of U.S. equity indexes (and other developed markets as well).

What that means for the average investor is that the best approach is to stay fully or nearly fully invested at all times. Trying to time markets by moving in and out based on "consensus" views rarely works. If you can't afford to weather down equity or fixed-income markets, then you should look for other investment alternatives.

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group.

RICK FERRI: The return of any market over a one-year period is unpredictable. None of the market gurus predicted that U.S. equities were going to achieve a very high return this year while emerging markets sold off.

Managing a portfolio using tactical asset-allocation strategies that rely on short-term market predictions is a costly long-term mistake. Advisers who underperformed this year because they were under-allocated to U.S. stocks will say they were being conservative. That is a smoke screen. Don't confuse being conservative with being wrong.

Rick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is RickFerri.com.

GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS: Markets will surprise us. Every year at this time, market pundits make their annual predictions. If you look back to last year, you will see that not many of them predicted the huge gains in the stock market that we've seen so far in 2013. In fact, according to calculations by CXO Advisory Group, a company that keeps track of more than 60 market "gurus," they were accurate only about 47% of the time. Your chances of winning a coin toss are better.

Nobody knows what the market will do tomorrow or next week or next month or in two years. Predicting short-term market movements is pointless. Many "gurus" have been burned waiting on the sidelines these past few years while they predicted an imminent correction or crash. I met with a prospect recently whose portfolio this year has been totally flat even though the S&P 500 index is clocking 25% returns. Yes, he is upset and looking elsewhere. Why? Because his adviser was certain a correction was imminent. Still waiting. At the end of the day, nobody has a crystal ball that works. We don't control short-term market movements. But we can control our actions and aim to have a low-cost properly diversified investment portfolio consistent with long-term goals and regularly rebalance it. At some point, there will be a market course correction; let's not kid ourselves that we can accurately predict it.

George Papadopoulos is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich., serving affluent individuals and families. You can follow him at twitter (@feeonlyplanner), connect with him at Google+ or visit his firm's website.

CHARLES ROTBLUT: This year (2013) served as a good example of not making portfolio decisions based on what you expect to happen. This is particularly the case when those decisions involve making a significant change to your portfolio's allocation.

The S&P 500's gains show why. As of Dec. 3, 2013, the large-cap index had a year-to-date total return (price appreciation and dividends) of 28.4%. Those investors who avoided stocks out of fear about what could happen missed out on substantial gains.

The simple fact is that nobody has a properly functioning crystal ball. Many strategists have theories about what may happen, but the truth is that nobody knows what will happen. The best thing one can do is to keep portfolio risk at a manageable level and go with the historical odds. What do historical odds say? Over the long term, sticking with stocks is a winning strategy.

Charles Rotblut (@charlesrotblut) is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

ELEANOR BLAYNEY: If 2013 were a wise teacher speaking to a classroom of investors, I suspect its lesson would be about portfolio rebalancing.

The year would emphasize why rebalancing is so essential to prudent portfolio management. Essentially, it is a risk-reduction tool, as opposed to a return-maximization technique. If investors need a simpler, more compelling explanation, 2013 could say that rebalancing is an efficient way to "sell high, buy low" a strategy that all investors would endorse as the surest formula for building wealth, but few implement consistently. The year could then consider why, if rebalancing is so smart, it is so hard for investors to do. The problem, as the year will demonstrate, is that few investors are inclined to pare back an asset class that is booming to reposition into an underperforming class.The year will makes its point by citing the stats from its latest four months, where investors have sold $28 billion in money-market and bond funds, and purchased $38 billion of equity and mixed-asset funds.

This lesson can't be an "I told you so" lecture. Only subsequent years will determine if rebalancing is the smartest thing for investors to do now. But 2013 can certainly say, "I am telling you so," more loudly and clearly than has been the case for any year in some while. The long-term benefits of rebalancing are hard to measure when the discrepancy in asset-class returns is relatively small. Many would argue the transaction costs outweigh the benefits. But 2013 will likely finish with a return spread between stocks and bonds at a historic high a difference of nearly 50%. If ever there was a time when rebalancing made sense to take some risk off the table, 2013 is it.

Eleanor Blayney (@EleanorBlayney) is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards.

TOM BRAKKE: The biggest lesson? That momentum is a powerful and pervasive force in the markets, with price trends attracting investor interest and money flows sustaining the moves. Of course, as history has shown, there are always stopping points in those trends, but we didn't see many stopping points this year. The most notable would be the (at least for now) bottom in interest rates, which brought money out of bonds to reinforce the trend in stocks.

We won't know how much the actions of the Federal Reserve have supported these trends until it shifts its policy in some way. When (if) it reduces its purchases of securities in the market, we will get a sense of how much its actions have driven the price movements.

If markets decline notably in response to an eventual move by the central bank, then the biggest lesson will have turned out to be that old market saw: "Don't fight the Fed."

Tom Brakke, CFA (@researchpuzzler) is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

MICHELLE PERRY HIGGINS: The lesson is that diversification does matter and to think otherwise is foolish. Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 continue to blow through historical highs, establishing and maintaining a defensive barrier (i.e., fixed income) is still critical in a well-managed portfolio.

Yes, I understand it may sometimes be tempting to put all your eggs in one basket after this year's performance in the equity markets, especially domestic. However, without a crystal ball it is impossible to guess which asset class will lead the race in 2014.

Michelle Perry Higgins (@RetirementMPH) is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

GUS SAUTER: As with any year, there are always many things to worry about.This year's list included continued weakness in the U.S. economy, the continuing debt crisis and recession in Europe, China's inability to reignite its economy, the threat of a conflict with Syria, the potential default by the U.S. Treasury and the federal debt ceiling.And that's just a sample. You could go through that exercise every year and it would seem that the environment is always too scary to invest in equities.Far too many investors make this mistake only to finally throw in the towel after the market has been climbing a wall of worry for several years after the prior bear market. These investors may catch the tail end of the bull, but they miss the most lucrative part in the beginning and middle. The best investors ignore the news they are being bombarded with and stick with a regular investment plan targeted for their needs.

George U. "Gus" Sauter is a senior consultant to Vanguard Group From 2003 through 2012, Mr. Sauter served as Vanguard's chief investment officer.

GREG MCBRIDE: Investors received a lesson in interest-rate risk this year, with many finding out the hard way that bond prices can, and do, fall. For mutual-fund investors in particular, bonds are not the safe haven many perceive them to be. Further, there is significant interest-rate risk when looking out over the next few years as the Federal Reserve dials back its bond purchases and eventually begins to boost short-term interest rates.

Greg McBride (@BankrateGreg) is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

MATT HOUGAN: The best time to invest is when it feels the worst. This year(2013) was a difficult year. From gridlock in Washington to a painfully slow economic recovery, we never really hit our stride economically. Yet the markets are surging, with the S&P 500 poised to rise 25% or more on the year.

The lesson is that you should have a disciplined investment strategy. Don't try to time the market, and don't let emotions guide you. Invest a little bit on a regular basis never wavering, no matter how bad it feels and you will be rewarded.

China Will Give Its Chip Industry a $5 Billion Boost

BEIJING -- The Chinese government is spending almost $5 billion on a new fund to support the country's microchip industry, as China moves to bolster what it has long considered a strategically important segment of its economy.

The fund, which China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced late Wednesday, will focus on investment in Beijing to increase chip production and enhance facilities for chip design and testing. It will also support mergers and acquisitions to create bigger competitors, the ministry said.

The announcement comes just a month after Ma Xianghui, vice bureau chief of MIIT's financial affairs, said China was exploring spending roughly 100 billion yuan, or about $16.5 billion, over an unspecified time period to create a national fund to support the chip industry.

The new fund is worrying some in the industry, who say a new push by the Chinese government to support chip output could lead to difficulty for foreign companies, which currently dominate the industry.

"While we haven't seen all the details, there are concerns these government funds may favor local Chinese firms, giving them a leg up in the market," said Jimmy Goodrich, director of global policy for the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocacy and policy group that represents chip companies such as Qualcomm Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

Such national industrial policies often are "unsuccessful and market-distorting," he added.

Home to a massive chunk of the world's electronics-supply chain, China has long been a net importer of semiconductor materials, which are used to create the microchips in products as diverse as tablet computers and television sets. In 2012, China consumed $101.6 billion more in semiconductor materials than it produced domestically, according to a report from research group PricewaterhouseCoopers.

This gap has led to repeated calls from Chinese officials to increase domestic semiconductor production. In September, Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai urged Chinese technology companies to make greater efforts to improve the country's microchip industry, which he said was important for Chinese economic growth and for the expansion of its national security, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.

Those calls come as some U.S. computer and software companies have reported a chill in sales in China. Cisco Systems Inc. executives have suggested Chinese customers, particularly those with government ties, might be cutting purchases of U.S. technology gear in response to U.S. restrictions on Chinese companies and revelations about surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency.

When asked on Cisco's earnings conference call last month whether the revelations around NSA surveillance are hampering China business, Chief Executive John Chambers said "it is an impact in China."

Last month Qualcomm said a Chinese government agency was investigating the chip maker under the country's antimonopoly law. The company said it wasn't aware of any activity that violates the law and would continue to cooperate. The disclosure followed statements from Qualcomm's chief executive saying U.S. restrictions on Chinese companies, as well as NSA surveillance, were affecting the company's business in the market.

Qualcomm maintained a 53% share of the global market for smartphone processors in the second quarter of 2013, according to Strategy Analytics.

Despite more than a decade of official support for China's semiconductor industry, Chinese production has lagged behind global competitors in sophistication and quantity. This is in part due to the nature of the industry, which is investment- and technology-intensive.

Semiconductor companies have also been careful not to build their most advanced production facilities, called fabs, in China. That makes it more difficult for domestic competitors to find experienced engineers and has helped the industry avoid direct technology transfers to Chinese partners. Such transfers have occurred in other sectors within China.

In the semiconductor industry, China has in some cases used acquisitions to try to narrow the technology gap. In July Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd., a state-run company, agreed to acquire Spreadtrum Communications Inc., and earlier this month it struck a deal to acquire RDA Microelectronics Inc., a wireless chipset maker.

Shares jump as India maintains rates

India's central bank took markets by surprise on Wednesday when it left key interest rates unchanged in spite of sharply higher inflation.

"The policy decision is a close one," Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in a mid-quarter policy review, insisting he had not gone "soft" on inflation.

He acknowledged there were risks in keeping rates steady and waiting for more data, "including the possibility that tapering of quantitative easing by the US Fed may disrupt external markets and that the Reserve Bank may be perceived to be soft on inflation".

The Federal Reserve's open market committee meets later on Wednesday to decide whether to start to taper the $85bn it is spending each month on buying US bonds.

Mr Rajan conceded India's current inflation is too high. "However, given the wide bands of uncertainty surrounding the short-term path of inflation from its high current levels, and given the weak state of the economy. . .there is merit in waiting for more data."

Investors had expected Mr Rajan to continue raising rates in an attempt to stifle inflation, but the bank left the policy repo rate unchanged at 7.75 per cent. Cash reserve ratios for banks were also left unchanged. The Sensex index rose more than 1 per cent immediately after the release, with bank stocks up 2 per cent.

Indian consumer price inflation, stoked by sharp rises in the price of vegetables and other foods, rose to 11.2 per cent in November, the highest among major emerging economies. The wholesale price index also increased in the same month to 7.5 per cent.

Mr Rajan said the RBI would remain vigilant and take action on rates - even on days when no policy move was scheduled - if food price inflation did not soften as expected.

"I think what we're saying is we will not react to every spike in inflation that is temporary," Mr Rajan told a news conference, adding that vegetable prices surveyed in urban areas appeared to be falling sharply while the recovery of the rupee against the US dollar had also eased inflationary pressures. "I want to emphasise we are not being soft on inflation. We are waiting for data."

Daniel Martin, Asia economist of Capital Economics, said Indian interest rates would probably now stay on hold for some time.

He said in a note after the announcement: "Given that the economic recovery is still very fragile, we think the RBI will be patient with inflation. As long as it starts to come down at the start of next year, more rate hikes are unlikely. Indeed, there should be some scope for the RBI to start easing in late 2014."

With economic growth having halved over the past two years to less than 5 per cent a year, some economists have been warning that India risks "stagflation", an uncomfortable mix of low growth and high inflation.

"India's 2013 economic performance has been disappointing and little on the horizon is likely to lift growth," Moody'sAnalytics said in a report on Tuesday.

Data Mining to Recruit Sick People; Companies Use Information From Data Brokers, Pharmacies, Social Networks

Some health-care companies are pulling back the curtain on medical privacy without ever accessing personal medical records, by probing readily available information from data brokers, pharmacies and social networks that offer indirect clues to an individual's health.

Companies specializing in patient recruitment for clinical trials use hundreds of data points from age and race to shopping habits to identify the sick and target them with telemarketing calls and direct-mail pitches to participate in research.

Blue Chip Marketing Worldwide, a drug-industry contractor, found patients for an obesity drug by targeting people with characteristics suggestive of a sedentary lifestyle, like subscribing to premium cable TV and frequent fast-food dining. Acurian Inc., one of the largest recruitment companies, says innocuous personal details a preference for jazz, owning a cat or participation in sweepstakes helped it home in on patients for an arthritis study.

"We are now at a point where, based on your credit-card history, and whether you drive an American automobile and several other lifestyle factors, we can get a very, very close bead on whether or not you have the disease state we're looking at," said Roger Smith, senior vice president of operations at Horsham, Pa.-based Acurian, a unit of Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC.

Targeted advertising has long been used in the retail industry, but its use in health care is raising new concerns. Privacy experts and bioethicists say that as data-mining methods become more sophisticated, it is becoming harder to keep medical conditions private. Targeted consumers have complained to regulators about intrusive tactics and worries that their medical records have been compromised.

"My private information, especially my medical information, I'm extremely protective of it," says Delbert Kerby, 62 years old, of Rocklin, Calif. The telecommunications consultant says he was surprised when telemarketers called him last year about a study of arthritis. The company didn't leave its name, he says, but he filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about the call. (He has arthritis but has no idea how the company targeted him.)

Federal law bars doctors, insurers and other health-care providers from sharing or selling personally identifiable information in patients' medical records without permission, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. The law doesn't, however, protect the clues that people leave about their health outside of their medical records when they make credit-card purchases or search the Internet. Law professor Nicolas P. Terry calls such information "medically inflected data."

"I think patients would be shocked to find out how little privacy protection they have outside of traditional health care," says Mr. Terry, professor and co-director at the Center for Law and Health at Indiana University's McKinney School of Law. He adds, "Big Data essentially can operate in a HIPAA-free zone."

Research firms and patient recruiters, including both Blue Chip and Acurian, say they abide by HIPAA and privacy laws.

Experian PLC, the Dublin, Ireland-based data broker and credit-reporting company, says its marketing-services unit sells data to numerous health-care marketing companies. "However, we do not share any protected health information, and therefore are not providing data that would fall into HIPAA requirements," says Gerry Tschopp, senior vice president for public affairs.

A driver of the trend is the need to speed up recruitment and completion of clinical trials. Drug makers often need thousands of patients for late-stage trials, which can take years to accomplish, lengthening the time it takes to bring a drug to market while the clock is running on the drug's patent exclusivity.

When Orexigen Therapeutics Inc., a La Jolla, Calif.-based biotechnology company, needed to enroll 9,000 patients into a study of its diet drug Contrave last year, it turned to Blue Chip. Consultants had said it would take two years to finish enrollment, a timeline that was "not acceptable," says Mark Booth, Orexigen's chief commercial officer.

Blue Chip, of Northbrook, Ill., recruited half of all study patients, helping to complete enrollment in a little over six months, Mr. Booth says. With consumer profiles purchased from data companies like Experian, Blue Chip applied a computer algorithm to flag clues about a person's weight, such as fast-food dining and a history of shopping online for clothes, a trait indicative of obesity because overweight people often can't find plus-sizes in traditional stores or are uncomfortable shopping in public, Blue Chip says.

"The types of magazines you buy, how often you buy running shorts, all of those things tell a story," says Blue Chip Executive Vice President Ken Shore.

Orexigen said last week it had submitted a new drug application for Contrave, and the FDA could make a decision in 2014.

The majority of patients are still recruited through traditional channels such as health-care providers and television ads; newer methods like data mining and social networks account for about 14% of the tactics used by drug makers and their contractors, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. Blue Chip, which also uses traditional advertising, says it charges about $2,000 for each patient it enrolls into a study.

Profiling patients based on demographics and purchasing habits, however, can be more effective in finding people who aren't online or haven't recently sought medical treatment, recruitment professionals say.

FTC Commissioner Julie Brill says she is worried that the use of nonprotected consumer data can be used to deny employment or inadvertently reveal illnesses that people want kept secret. "As Big Data algorithms become more accurate and powerful, consumers need to know a lot more about the ways in which their data is used," Ms. Brill says.

Acurian, which has worked with large drug and medical-device companies such as Eli Lilly & Co. and Medtronic Inc., has been the subject of more than 500 complaints to the FTC over the past two years, alleging violations of telemarketing laws, according to records obtained through a public records request. The FTC hasn't taken any actions against Acurian, said agency spokesman Mitchell Katz. The commission doesn't comment on current investigations as a matter of policy, he said.

Acurian, named as a defendant in a federal lawsuit related to its telemarketing practices, declined to comment on the allegations. In court documents, the company has said that calls related to medical studies aren't advertisements as defined by law.

A Medtronic spokeswoman said the company had hired Acurian for projects like contacting patients from completed studies, but not to identify new study subjects. An Eli Lilly spokeswoman said the company works with Acurian on recruitment campaigns, including through direct mail.

Larna Godsey, of Wichita, Kan., says she received a dozen phone calls about a diabetes drug study over the past year from a company that didn't identify itself. Ms. Godsey, 63, doesn't suffer from the disease, but she has researched it on the Internet and donated to diabetes-related causes. "I don't know if it's just a coincidence or if they're somehow getting my information," says Ms. Godsey, who filed a complaint with the FTC this year.

Wealth Management (A Special Report) --- How Big Data  Has the Potential To Transform Philanthropy: New and faster information could make charitable giving more effective and efficient, but it will require some hard decisions

"It is more difficult to give money away intelligently than to earn it in the first place," observed one of the great philanthropists of the 20th century, Andrew Carnegie.

Today, with almost two million nonprofits in the U.S., the challenge of knowing which to support and which to avoid is more challenging than ever. How can individuals and foundations put their money where it's most needed, and in ways that will be most effective? And how can charities themselves spend the dollars they receive in ways that best fulfill their missions?

Big data may hold some answers.

Just as the ability to access and analyze mountains of new information is transforming corporations, the era of big data has the potential to revolutionize the world of philanthropy -- for both donors and charities. More, better and faster information can help donors channel dollars to the organizations that are most effective. It can help nonprofits identify the strategies that work best at fulfilling their missions. And it can guide philanthropies to the fundraising tactics that are most successful.

Imagine, for example, if a donor could do a quick search on the criteria of his or her choosing to find organizations that have a proven record, can offer real-time reporting on how funds are being spent, and provide feedback from those they've served? Well, apps that are constantly pulling data from ongoing evaluations, common performance measures and beneficiary feedback will make this happen.

Similarly, foundations will be able to develop, assess and revise their giving strategies by pulling information from community surveys, organizational reports and an up-to-date "ticker" of other philanthropic giving. As a foundation, for instance, considers its annual giving in support of early-childhood education, it will be able to click on visualizations of the past few years' progress on reading readiness at the programs it has previously funded.

Organizations doing similar work in different parts of the world will be better connected, sharing what works and doesn't -- no doubt upending many long-held assumptions. Online data from job-training programs, for example, will be available to organizations working with similar populations, and they'll all learn from experiments with new class structures or curriculum. Effective interventions will spread quickly, and outdated or ineffective strategies will be retired. By sharing research, foundations will be able to lower the costs of administering grant programs so that more funds flow to the nonprofits.

The sharing of data will also enable nonprofits working in the same region to coordinate their work. A medical service, entrepreneurship group and educational program in a rural area, for example, may share transportation data systems, allowing them to use less fuel and fewer trucks -- permitting them to serve more people with the same level of hard-earned charitable gifts.

The impact will also extend to fundraising efforts, as nonprofit executives get better and faster data to help them hone their pitches. They can focus the timing and content of the messages to meet the precise wishes of their most committed supporters. The volume of solicitations that every nonprofit sends out will plummet, as organizations learn what marketing efforts work best.

All of this is the shadow of things that may be. But it is far from a sure thing. To get to this new world -- one in which passions meet results -- certain challenges need to be addressed.

Specifically:

-- Big data isn't democratic. Many sources of big data come from platforms built for commercial purposes. And that could be problematic. Donors looking to Twitter or Facebook streams will hear a lot from those who use Twitter or Facebook, but miss the perspectives and needs of neighbors who don't. As a result, such data will let advertisers see what customers are saying about their products, but they don't necessarily tell after-school programs what will excite kids into coming to their programs.

Funding choices informed by skewed samples could result in what MIT and Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford calls "data discrimination." For example, using social-media data as indicators of need after a tornado or hurricane will direct resources to where social-media usage is greatest and mobile-phone access is still intact, not necessarily where the need is greatest.

Foundations, therefore, should determine if the people they are trying to help are represented in the data set. If not, they need to search for more-relevant data, and invite the affected communities to reflect on and respond to the original, nonrepresentative data.

-- Digital data is forever. The data collected by nonprofits is no less vulnerable to security breaches than data collected by companies. But there is a level of trust in nonprofits that they need to protect for the long term. Just as a financial scandal in the nonprofit sector is more disappointing than one in the commercial sector, the misuse of digital data by nonprofits or foundations -- now or in the future -- will damage the sector's trust and credibility. Nonprofits must be sure to do what they promise regarding people's data, especially if that means keeping it offline or anonymous.

-- Local needs vs. outside data. Imagine that a foundation funds community revitalization efforts, mainly by building up residents' relationships with city officials and local businesses. The foundation then insists on using data collected from outsiders to argue for a certain kind of program. If the local shopkeepers and residents don't trust the data, they won't trust the foundation, either. Instead the foundation will need to help their local partners acquire the skills they need to collect, use and analyze their own supporting data, not just have data dropped on them from the outside.

-- Will big data kill anonymity -- and anonymous giving? Charitable giving is one way we use our private resources for public benefit. We give time or money as we choose, unwatched and without pressure from others. In the age of big data, our giving becomes one more type of data that others use to market or proselytize to us. Foundations need to be part of the effort to find ways to keep a sense of privacy in an increasingly transparent world.

-- Donor intent and data philanthropy. The donation of data for social good -- whether it's filling out a survey, giving a tissue sample or offering access to a digital library or photographs -- is on the rise. How will we handle "donor intent," a bedrock principle of American philanthropy, when it comes to the use of donated data?

As it is, a financial donor can spell out the specific purposes for how her funds will be used by the recipient organization. When these intentions aren't followed, lawsuits ensue. Data, on the other hand, may be collected today for one purpose and be reused over time for other purposes. We have not yet defined any similar standard of donor intent when it comes to donating digital resources. Now is the time for foundations to develop data practices that align with their long-term philanthropic missions.

Philanthropy is part of civil society -- deliberately separate from markets and elections. This is where we foster individual action and support multiple, often conflicting ideas about a robust and functioning democracy. As philanthropy steps into the world of big data, we are inventing a new digital civil society where personal independence and private interests intersect with the power and efficiency of digital data.

Wealth Management (A Special Report) --- Investors Seek Tips Via Tweets: New tools aim to follow the buzz to the next hot stock

Most investors would love it if they could see into the future.

Now, some of them are convinced they can -- by monitoring Twitter.

A growing number of individual investors believe the microblogging service -- which has already proved to be a good source for breaking news, insights from Wall Street's top minds and major corporate announcements -- holds a treasure trove of information that can lead them to the next hot stock.

The idea is that by tracking conversations around companies, industries and the overall economy, investors can predict in which direction a certain stock or the overall market is headed.

The problem is, with as many as 400 million tweets and counting sent daily -- not to mention the fake news releases, misinformation and bad ideas that are routinely published -- Twitter postings can be difficult for investors to harness. In a classic example of what can go wrong, when Twitter recently announced plans to go public via a tweet, shares of the similarly sounding Tweeter Home Entertainment soared at least 1400%, as confused investors snapped up shares of the bankrupt company.

That's where companies like MarketPsych LLC come in. The Westport, Conn., research firm and several other companies have developed sophisticated analytical tools that investors can use to filter stock-related tweets and draw conclusions based on the buzz. Here is a look at some of them:

Zeroing In on 'Influencers'

Chicago startup Social Market Analytics LLC has created an algorithm that scans tweets for words that indicate sentiment around a stock -- things like support and resistance levels or the outlook for one of the company's products. The firm then uses this data to score how the chatter around a particular stock is changing. SMA, which delivers its information via email reports, alerts and a data feed that can be integrated with Excel, tracks tweets only from people who are considered to be market "influencers" -- such as active traders with a history of making good calls. As Chief Executive Joe Gits puts it: "On social media, it isn't just what's being said, it's who's saying it."

Mr. Gits says filtering for tweets from market influencers creates a very different signal than the straight Twitter stream: While the sentiment from the overall Twitter feed for a particular stock may be bearish, an analysis of the accounts of market experts might yield a bullish signal, or vice versa.

The company's cheapest product includes a daily email report of those stocks ranking highest and lowest in sentiment, which Mr. Gits says may be useful for investors who want to uncover companies that aren't being mentioned in traditional news sources but are popping up in tweets.

The New York Stock Exchange is a distributor of the service.

Gauging Sentiment

Market Prophit LLC uses natural-language processing software to track tweets about individual stocks that include ticker symbols, such as $AAPL for Apple Computer. (Traders and investors routinely include such stock symbols, called "cashtags," in their tweets.) The firm then assigns a sentiment score to each tweet and creates a real-time graphic showing whether the tweets about the stock are overall bullish or bearish.

The firm plans to add a new feature in coming weeks to its website, which is currently in beta testing and free to consumers, that weights tweets from investors with a history of successful trading calls, Chief Executive Igor Gonta says. The company then will be able compare the sentiment of market gurus with that of the broader crowd. Gurus diverging from crowd consensus can signal a change in market direction for a certain stock.

Last August, financier Carl Icahn tweeted that he was holding a "large position" in Apple, sending the shares up 5.8%. It was the high-speed hedge-fund traders, however, who noticed his tweet and profited on the trade, not individual investors. "We want to level the playing field," Mr. Gonta says.

Identifying Macro Themes

MarketPsych's software analyzes social media and news sites in an effort to identify macro themes like fear and optimism. Managing Director Richard Peterson says investors can use the data to compare short-term and long-term sentiment and identify turning points in the market. Investors also can use the data to gauge the market's consensus around a particular stock.

Before Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C launch in September, the social-media excitement around the new products was so high, it became clear that Apple would need a truly game-changing phone to top expectations, Mr. Peterson says. He was right. The fingerprint scanners on the new phones weren't enough to wow consumers, and the stock ended the day down 2.2%.

"When news hits the market, investors need to know what kind of market it is hitting," Mr. Peterson says.

MarketPsych's website includes a dashboard with broad overviews of sentiment levels for entire asset classes, listing which sectors and assets incur the most fearful or angry investor emotion, or where earnings expectations are the highest, for example. The firm also offers a more expensive professional plan that includes charting and tools to show what has been driving particular stocks' prices.

So, do these tools actually work? So far, only to an extent. Ilya Zheludev, one of the first academics to study social media's potential as an investment tool, says that for many stocks, there just isn't enough chatter to provide investors with the information they need to reliably predict the market yet.

Still, the former investment banker and current graduate student at the University College London expects that to change as the amount of information on social media increases.

How Big Data  Will Change the Face of Philanthropy; Flood of new information has the potential to make both donors and charities more effective

"It is more difficult to give money away intelligently than to earn it in the first place," observed one of the great philanthropists of the 20th century, Andrew Carnegie.

Today, with almost two million nonprofits in the U.S., the challenge of knowing which to support and which to avoid is more challenging than ever. How can individuals and foundations put their money where it's most needed, and in ways that will be most effective? And how can charities themselves spend the dollars they receive in ways that best fulfill their missions?

Big data may hold some answers.

Just as the ability to access and analyze mountains of new information is transforming corporations, the era of big data has the potential to revolutionize the world of philanthropy for both donors and charities. More, better and faster information can help donors channel dollars to the organizations that are most effective. It can help nonprofits identify the strategies that work best at fulfilling their missions. And it can guide philanthropies to the fundraising tactics that are most successful.

Imagine, for example, if a donor could do a quick search on the criteria of his or her choosing to find organizations that have a proven record, can offer real-time reporting on how funds are being spent, and provide feedback from those they've served? Well, apps that are constantly pulling data from ongoing evaluations, common performance measures and beneficiary feedback will make this happen.

Similarly, foundations will be able to develop, assess and revise their giving strategies by pulling information from community surveys, organizational reports and an up-to-date "ticker" of other philanthropic giving. As a foundation, for instance, considers its annual giving in support of early-childhood education, it will be able to click on visualizations of the past few years' progress on reading readiness at the programs it has previously funded.

Organizations doing similar work in different parts of the world will be better connected, sharing what works and doesn't no doubt upending many long-held assumptions. Online data from job-training programs, for example, will be available to organizations working with similar populations, and they'll all learn from experiments with new class structures or curriculum. Effective interventions will spread quickly, and outdated or ineffective strategies will be retired. By sharing research, foundations will be able to lower the costs of administering grant programs so that more funds flow to the nonprofits.

The sharing of data will also enable nonprofits working in the same region to coordinate their work. A medical service, entrepreneurship group and educational program in a rural area, for example, may share transportation data systems, allowing them to use less fuel and fewer trucks permitting them to serve more people with the same level of hard-earned charitable gifts.

The impact will also extend to fundraising efforts, as nonprofit executives get better and faster data to help them hone their pitches. They can focus the timing and content of the messages to meet the precise wishes of their most committed supporters. The volume of solicitations that every nonprofit sends out will plummet, as organizations learn what marketing efforts work best.

All of this is the shadow of things that may be. But it is far from a sure thing. To get to this new world one in which passions meet results certain challenges need to be addressed.

Specifically:

Big data isn't democratic. Many sources of big data come from platforms built for commercial purposes. And that could be problematic. Donors looking to Twitter or Facebook streams will hear a lot from those who use Twitter or Facebook, but miss the perspectives and needs of neighbors who don't. As a result, such data will let advertisers see what customers are saying about their products, but they don't necessarily tell after-school programs what will excite kids into coming to their programs.

Funding choices informed by skewed samples could result in what MIT and Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford calls "data discrimination." For example, using social-media data as indicators of need after a tornado or hurricane will direct resources to where social-media usage is greatest and mobile-phone access is still intact, not necessarily where the need is greatest.

Foundations, therefore, should determine if the people they are trying to help are represented in the data set. If not, they need to search for more-relevant data, and invite the affected communities to reflect on and respond to the original, nonrepresentative data.

Digital data is forever. The data collected by nonprofits is no less vulnerable to security breaches than data collected by companies. But there is a level of trust in nonprofits that they need to protect for the long term. Just as a financial scandal in the nonprofit sector is more disappointing than one in the commercial sector, the misuse of digital data by nonprofits or foundations now or in the future will damage the sector's trust and credibility. Nonprofits must be sure to do what they promise regarding people's data, especially if that means keeping it offline or anonymous.

Local needs vs. outside data. Imagine that a foundation funds community revitalization efforts, mainly by building up residents' relationships with city officials and local businesses. The foundation then insists on using data collected from outsiders to argue for a certain kind of program. If the local shopkeepers and residents don't trust the data, they won't trust the foundation, either. Instead the foundation will need to help their local partners acquire the skills they need to collect, use and analyze their own supporting data, not just have data dropped on them from the outside.

Will big data kill anonymity and anonymous giving? Charitable giving is one way we use our private resources for public benefit. We give time or money as we choose, unwatched and without pressure from others. In the age of big data, our giving becomes one more type of data that others use to market or proselytize to us. Foundations need to be part of the effort to find ways to keep a sense of privacy in an increasingly transparent world.

Donor intent and data philanthropy. The donation of data for social good whether it's filling out a survey, giving a tissue sample or offering access to a digital library or photographs is on the rise. How will we handle "donor intent," a bedrock principle of American philanthropy, when it comes to the use of donated data?

As it is, a financial donor can spell out the specific purposes for how her funds will be used by the recipient organization. When these intentions aren't followed, lawsuits ensue. Data, on the other hand, may be collected today for one purpose and be reused over time for other purposes. We have not yet defined any similar standard of donor intent when it comes to donating digital resources. Now is the time for foundations to develop data practices that align with their long-term philanthropic missions.

Philanthropy is part of civil society deliberately separate from markets and elections. This is where we foster individual action and support multiple, often conflicting ideas about a robust and functioning democracy. As philanthropy steps into the world of big data, we are inventing a new digital civil society where personal independence and private interests intersect with the power and efficiency of digital data.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Lessons From a Hot Market --- Stocks are booming; But don't get smug; Here's what you can learn from this year's rally -- and how to use it

The stock market is teaching investors some valuable lessons in 2013. But in order to make the most of them, you should first acknowledge that this year's outsize gains don't necessarily make you a genius.

It is easy to feel smart during a broad, sustained rally. Major U.S. stock indexes are up at least 20% to 30% in 2013, on top of double-digit increases last year. Foreign markets are mixed, but Japan and Germany are among those that have risen sharply.

Relatively few U.S. companies have failing grades. Only 45 stocks in the S&P 500 have generated a negative return for investors in 2013, through Thursday, according to research firm Morningstar, and the index has risen 27%, including dividends.

"It's hard to pick a loser," says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

The downside? Investors could start to believe they have all the answers. In reality, those who expect stocks to keep performing the same way forever are likely to get a rough education from the market.

"People try to use rules of thumb" about how stocks will perform based on past experience, says Adam Parker, chief U.S. equities strategist at Morgan Stanley. "But remember, that can be perilous."

Still, investors who have done their homework this year have learned a lot about the forces that can push stock prices up and down. They have also learned where to look for potential bargains and why having a widely diversified portfolio is the wisest strategy, given that some lagging stocks have plunged.

Here are 10 lessons you can put to use both when the market is booming and if it starts to fall, in 2014 and beyond.

-- Steep rises don't last forever.

In a year when the market raced ahead, hot stocks were often popular among day traders and other fast-moving speculators.

Tesla Motors was particularly popular, and investors who owned shares in the auto maker this year enjoyed a scenic ride. Tesla's stock climbed to a peak for the year on Sept. 30, and the view was breathtaking -- the share price was up 471%.

The stock has since come down from the mountaintop, and the price is now 24% below that high.

None of that says much about where Tesla is going. But it is a timely reminder that most hot stocks aren't on a one-way journey up. Indeed, Tesla fell 75 out of 188 trading days in the first nine months of the year, according to FactSet.

Investors who can reliably anticipate which stocks will skyrocket are fortunate, and rare. But late arrivers pondering whether to pile in mid-rally should be cautious.

Here's one way to look at it: Tesla shares were up 353% for the year after the market closed on Aug. 8 and still had a clear road to their September high. But an investor who bought then would have been better off in an index fund. Tesla shares have since fallen 4%, through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has returned 5% over the same period, including dividends.

-- The world changes.

Newmont Mining, a gold producer based in Greenwood Village, Colo., is the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, down 48%, including dividends. Two other miners, Cliffs Natural Resources and Peabody Energy, rank among the six companies in the index whose share prices have fallen the most.

Many commodity producers saw their stock prices shoot up during a decadelong rally in commodities. Some observers believed raw-material prices would stay high for years.

Cooler heads noticed the world was changing.

Gold started to lose its safe-haven allure after prices peaked in 2011, as fears of economic chaos and runaway inflation ebbed. That spelled trouble for miners like Newmont. When gold fell 8% in April, the company's stock price tumbled 23%.

China's economy slowed, meanwhile, hurting firms such as Cliffs that produce iron ore, used to make steel. Rising supplies of natural gas have dinged the market for coal, which Peabody sells.

Investors might be asking: Which leading sector might suffer next year?

It can be difficult to foresee how a thriving business or industry could falter. But sooner or later, most face unforeseen challenges.

Consider Blockbuster, which dominated the landscape for rental movies before Netflix started delivering DVDs by mail. Last month, Blockbuster -- now a unit of Dish Network -- said it would close most of the remaining stores.

-- Not all IPOs take off.

Twitter's first several weeks as a public company have put wind beneath the wings of investors who think initial public offerings are likely to soar. Not only did the company's shares pop 73% from their offering price on their first day, they have continued to climb since.

Staying aloft like that is important after an IPO because buying shares at the offering price is difficult if not impossible for many ordinary investors. Typically, they pay significantly more to buy into a hot stock early.

Unfortunately, it's also not the reality for many IPOs. Many companies quickly come crashing down.

This year through Monday, share prices were higher or flat on the first day of trading for more than three-quarters of the companies that launched U.S. IPOs, according to Dealogic. But only 43% of them rose in the three months after the first-day close (or, for the most recent IPOs, as long as they have been trading).

Investors sometimes like to think of IPOs as a free lunch. Often, what they get is bird feed.

-- Branding matters.

Some Best Buy investors checked out last year, when the company's chief executive resigned amid an internal probe into his conduct with a female employee and the founder launched a plan to take the retailer private. Shares fell 47%, including dividends.

This year, the stock has rebounded in dramatic fashion, rising 247% through Thursday, including dividends. Despite its problems, which also included the risk that customers would browse in person but make purchases online -- known as "showrooming" -- Best Buy had a big advantage: Customers don't view it as outdated, says Oliver Wintermantel, an analyst at ISI Group in New York.

That is no given for a brick-and-mortar chain, as competitors could attest. Best Buy is trying to convert showrooming into sales and emphasizing small appliances with higher margins, says Mr. Wintermantel.

Customers want to examine products they may spend hundreds of dollars on in person, says Amy von Walter, a Best Buy spokeswoman. "Our stores are actually a very big asset," she says.

Investors who bailed on the stock, Mr. Wintermantel says, failed to understand that a big chunk of last year's stock-price drop had "nothing to do with performance."

-- Buybacks can pay -- or not.

Many investors view a company's decision to buy back shares as a bullish signal. The tale of two big technology giants this year highlights the risk of treating it as a green light across the board.

The theory is that a buyback, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, will increase the value of the remainder. Indeed, researchers have found that companies which announce share repurchases often go on to outperform.

Apple illustrates how buying into the theory can pay off. The consumer electronics firm's stock fell from more than $500 per share at the end of 2012 to roughly $400 in late April. But a month after Apple announced it would spend an additional $50 billion to buy back stock, the share price was up 9%. Overall, it has risen 38% since the disclosure, a period when a number of events have affected the company.

But other challenges facing a company can overwhelm any benefit. Cisco Systems announced a month ago that it would spend up to another $15 billion to buy back stock. The share price fell 11% the next day, as investors focused on a forecast decline in revenue for the computer-networking firm, and they've fallen further since.

-- Spinoffs can be bargains.

Many investors also view the universe of new companies spun off by a corporate parent as a good place to look for bargains.

As with buybacks, proponents of the strategy have support from research that shows the stocks of spun-off companies can outperform, particularly as analysts and investors get a better grip on what the new firm does.

In May, Dean Foods spun off a unit, WhiteWave Foods, which traveled a familiar path for this kind of fledgling enterprise. The price of shares in WhiteWave, which sells dairy, coffee and organic products, fell initially, dropping 9% in the first five weeks or so. But it has shot up 39% since, putting the stock up 27% since the launch, through Thursday, according to FactSet.

As with buybacks, there are also examples of spinoffs that fall flat. As in any bargain bin, there are inexpensive items -- and items that are cheap yet still overpriced.

-- Yes, content can be king.

No other company in the S&P 500 has seen its stock rise as much this year as Netflix.

Its 303% gain is particularly striking because two years ago, the company angered customers by splitting its business into DVDs by mail and streaming entertainment online, and charging subscribers more if they wanted to keep both. By year-end, the stock price was down 77% from its midyear peak.

The company began bouncing back last year, as the controversy died down. Now, Netflix's decision to produce its own shows -- including the Emmy-winning "House of Cards" -- is helping maintain subscriber growth.

It is clear the company believes in the importance of having a steady supply of whatever customers want most, whether produced in house or not. Netflix is spending "an insane amount of money on content," says Tony Wible, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets in New York -- roughly $3 billion this year.

The investment creates a potential barrier to entry for would-be rivals and could give Netflix pricing power, he says. "We are about fantastic content that is only available on Netflix," the company says on its website.

Back in 1996, when the Internet was just becoming a force, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates wrote that "the broad opportunities for most companies involve supplying information or entertainment." Netflix investors may nod in agreement.

Amazon.com may feel the same way. Last month it launched its own comedy show, "Alpha House."

But providing content is expensive and risky, and signs of slower growth in adding subscribers could hurt investor confidence. Investors evaluating Internet companies should recall another of Mr. Gates's points, that there would be "ample failure as well as success in all categories of popular content."

-- Paying too much is asking for trouble.

In early 2013, investors rattled by budgetary brinkmanship in Washington and underwhelmed by meager bond yields bid up stocks in industries that usually weather crises relatively well and pay steady dividends.

What could go wrong? After all, sectors such as utilities and telecommunications are called "defensive" for a reason.

But what made the sectors popular also made them relatively expensive, says Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ. In March, the ratio of share prices to recent operating earnings among utilities in the S&P 500 was 17.2, well above the 15-year average of 14.7, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

That didn't last. Utilities as a group recently traded at a 15.6 ratio, and the sector is the second-worst-performing part of the index this year, through Thursday, up a mere 7%.

The lesson: "Even with defensive stocks, you need to pay attention to valuations," says Mr. Stovall.

-- Heed the trend.

One striking thing about this year's rally: Thirteen of the 15 companies in the S&P 500 whose share prices are up the most also rose in 2012 -- 11 of them by double digits in percentage terms.

On the downside, many stocks are battering investors for the second year in a row. Five of the index's 10 biggest decliners in price terms dropped in 2012, too.

Narasimhan Jegadeesh of Emory University and Sheridan Titman of the University of Texas at Austin, found in a 2011 paper that U.S. stocks that perform the best over a three-to-12-month period tend to continue on the same path over the following three to 12 months. Hypothetical portfolios designed to capitalize on the phenomenon made money most of the time, according to the paper.

But the researchers also found a glaring exception. In 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, the portfolio they built would have lost 36.5%. Other researchers have found that over years, rather than months, past losers can outperform recent winners. The reversal in Tesla's stock shows how quickly trends can change.

Still, the trends contain a useful lesson: Investors are often tempted to stick with falling stocks to avoid locking in losses. The better move may be to accept that the pick was bad and move on.

"Generally, laggards don't improve until their fundamentals improve," says Morgan Stanley's Mr. Parker.

In a similar vein, don't be too quick to sell your winners.

-- Diversify -- a lot.

Applying these lessons, of course, could expose an investor to the additional risk involved in picking specific stocks. Most people would be better off buying low-cost mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold broad baskets of stocks, experts say. And "broad" means hundreds of stocks, not dozens.

Granted, there's not much fun or sport to that. But there's little fun or sport to losing money -- and picking stocks can easily lead to that outcome, even in a booming market.

Unconvinced? Imagine at the end of 2012 you had $100,000 to invest and decided to spread it evenly across the stocks of dozens of big U.S. companies in many different industries, all from the S&P 500.

You picked a brand-name retailer (Abercrombie & Fitch), a data-analytics firm that was a large gainer in 2012 (Teradata), a major Midwestern power company (FirstEnergy) and 42 other companies.

You just happened to choose wrong. You picked the only 45 firms in the index that have thrown off negative total returns for investors in 2013, even after paying dividends. Instead of $100,000, you would have had less than $88,000 through Thursday, according to Morningstar -- before deducting any trading fees.

IF YOU'RE WARY OF THE STOCK MARKET like many high-end investors are these days then you should consider the views of one of the most visible prognosticators at one of the world's biggest brokerage firms.

For 11 years now, Liz Ann Sonders has been the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co., where from her perch she takes the view that, despite sharp ups and downs, a bull market has been running since 2009 driven by a domestic manufacturing renaissance and budding housing-market recovery.

While her fellow prognosticators have had a tough time predicting the volatile markets, Sonders, 49, has made some prescient predictions over the years: She called the top and bottom of the housing market, as well as the end of the last recession. Her advice these days: Be bullish, but don't go hog wild. Sonders recently sat down with Robert Hunter, the Journal's banking editor, to discuss some of the questions that keep investors awake at night. Her edited remarks follow:

Q: The Federal Reserve has exerted incredible influence over the markets in recent years, but now it wants to get back to normal. Next year, the debate likely will shift from the end of its bond-buying program to actual interest-rate hikes. What's your sense of when that will happen?

A: The guidance they've given us is sometime in mid-2014. But we've never unwound a $4 trillion balance sheet, nor has any other central bank, so we have no history to look back on and say what the implications of this might be. We're all sort of winging it and trying to figure it out.

Q: A rising-rate environment could spell concerns for investors, since historically that has been tougher for stocks, right?

A: Not necessarily. I think you have to differentiate rising rates between the long end and the short end. You have a honeymoon phase in the early stages of tightening, assuming inflation stays in check. When you get to the point where short-term rates start to go up, the first stage of that and it varies from cycle to cycle doesn't tend to be bad for the stock market.

It's only when the rise in rates starts to bite and/or the Fed has to continue to raise rates not because of re-acceleration in the economy but because inflation is starting to take hold that tends to be more problematic for the market. That's when the market starts to discount the next recession, which is almost always preceded by monetary policy that gets too tight.

Q: There's another critical element here, which is fiscal policy. You have noted that the deficit is trending lower, and we actually ran a surplus in June. Is that a sustainable situation?

A: Maybe not every single month. But looking at longer than a month-by-month basis, the deficit has gone from more than 10 percent of GDP to under 5 percent. I don't think we're on a path to surplus in the near term. But I think that if we could continue to hold the line on spending you've got a little boost to the revenue side because of changes in tax policy, but most of the boost has come from the economy and if you continue this trajectory you can continue to chip away at this, and you get into the 2 percent to 3 percent range. That sends a message that there can continue to be a focus on cost-cutting in Washington without it crushing the economy.

Q: But the shrinking of government spending is likely to weigh on growth in the short term, right?

A: It is, but the point is there's enough growth and strength in the private sector to partly offset the drag. There are two sides of that: Some will say we could be growing even faster if we didn't have that drag from the government. That's fine if you didn't still have absurd debt levels. The fact that we know we need to do this and the fact that we have enough growth and cushion in the private sector of the economy, we should start doing it now, because the problem only gets worse down the road.

A question I get all the time is: How do you explain the disconnect between the market and the economy? But a slow-but-steady rate of economic growth in that 2 percent to 3 percent range, accompanied by very, very low inflation, we used to call that Goldilocks.

Q: So is there a case to be made for stocks over the next few years?

A: I lean toward the view that what started in March of '09 was a new secular bull market, not just a cyclical rally in a secular bear market that started in 2000 and is still ongoing. There's no textbook rule of a secular bull or bear market and its starting and end points. But generally the types of things that have been in place during the beginning of secular bulls were in place in March of '09.

Q: If a secular bull started in 2009, how long might it last?

A: Wouldn't I love to know the answer to that question? Secular markets tend to be longer than cyclical markets. The last one lasted for over 18 years. But it had an unbelievable list of powerful forces in support of it inflation coming down, interest rates coming down, an unbelievable peace dividend, the invention of the Internet, the tech bubble, etc. Most of those are probably not forces at play today. So I don't know that if we look back it necessarily represents that kind of trajectory for those kinds of returns, but it tends to be longer lasting.

That said, some of the biggest drops in history have come during secular bull markets; '87 being a perfect example of that. I try to make sure people understand that doesn't mean the market goes straight up and never looks back. You can have some brutal declines within a secular bull market. But I think we're more likely in that than just a cyclical pop here.

Q: So what is it, exactly, about the market that might make stocks appealing to investors in the next few years?

A: I think valuation is still reasonable. And from an economic-fundamental perspective we are, at least in relative terms, in the catbird seat right now. I am a believer in the industrial and manufacturing and energy renaissance that's happening right now and the implications that has for the relative growth trajectory.

Manufacturing is only 13 percent of our economy, so it's not the elixir that solves all that ails us. Consumers are still 70 percent of the economy, and I don't expect anything resembling a boom there. But we're now getting the business-investment side, continued housing recovery even in the government sector there may be less drag from state and local spending cutbacks. That gets you to an economic growth rate that's not bad, and in fact, quite not bad from a stock-market perspective, along with structural forces that'll probably keep inflation in check. That doesn't mean we won't have corrections painful ones and you could have cyclical bears that crop in. But I'm pretty optimistic about the market.

Q: You mentioned a manufacturing renaissance. How do investors play that trend when many companies headquartered in the U.S. have substantial operations overseas?

A: Smaller-cap industrial companies with a bit more of a domestic tilt and companies that export to the right places. Part of the theme is the end of the commodities super-cycle and what that means for inflation. Commodities are likely to stay low, and that should continue to feed positively into consumer discretionary-type names.

We also like technology. What's happening as we look forward from an innovation perspective? Robotics and artificial intelligence. And what are the next exciting things, like what the Internet represented in the late 1990s? Industrials, consumer discretionary and small caps are key ways to play this industrial manufacturing renaissance theme.

Q: High-net-worth investors who have sought refuge in hedge funds are finding that the boom is petering out. Why have hedge funds lagged so much in recent years, and what should people who are inclined to invest in those presumably less-volatile but speculative instruments do?

A: There are still some big players in the hedge-fund universe. We know who they are they have unbelievable track records and are extraordinarily good at what they do. But there's just a lot more funds right now, and I think that dilutes the talent, and they're not necessarily representing what they were when they first started. Even the term "hedge" doesn't necessarily apply. In many cases, these are just money managers. They're not necessarily hedging anything. And when you look at the typical fee structure associated with these things, there's just not enough return on top of that to match a traditional equity player.

Q: Investors have also been watching the housing market, which has fueled the economy's recovery but how sustainable is that?

A: I think the worst is definitely behind us. Recoveries from a burst bubble, whether it's as recently as the tech bubble or the Nikkei stock market or crude oil whatever it is they don't tend to be V-bottoms. You tend to get a very clear bottom, but then it tends to be sort of a choppy, upward slope, and that's where I think we are.

The initial percentage numbers are huge because you came off such a depressed base, and we're going to have volatility as rates go up. So far, the dislocation has not been severe. It has hit things like refinancing in a huge way when you get a full 1 percent spike in yields, "refis" kind of dry up. Purchase applications for mortgages also got hit, but nowhere near the degree that refis did. Obviously home prices have been very resilient. New-home sales have been weaker, but that's mostly because there's been no inventory there's been no building.

Q: So what should investors be looking at in this stage of the housing recovery?

A: One, make sure you look inside the details of the numbers, and not just at the headlines, because some of the weakness from a sales perspective has been almost all to do with the fact that there's no inventory. That's a good reason why sales might be weak, as opposed to demand drying up.

Two, we're back to a more normal environment. When the bubble got inflated, the tide was lifting all boats. You couldn't look at real estate monolithically. When the bubble popped, the tide went out and took all the boats with it. Now we're going back to real estate being local.

Q: What's your take on the second homes market now versus several years ago? Is it healthier? Less healthy?

A: I can give you a personal experience. My husband was dying to buy a place in Florida from as early as 2003 and through '06. People who have been at Schwab a long time know that I was as bearish as they get on housing in '06. I just kept saying absolutely not this thing is just an accident waiting to happen.

Spring of '09 came, and that's when I was getting more optimistic about the stock market and thought housing probably had hit its worse and said, OK, now we can look. So we bought a house in the summer of '09. We stole it, in relative terms; it's more than doubled now. That market is in a veritable boom right now. And it's not investor dollars coming in. It's not Blackstone's money coming in. It's people buying homes.

Q: What inning would you say the high-end housing recovering is in?

A: Depends on the region. I'd say, generally, still relatively early innings. But you're starting to hear numbers at the high end in Manhattan, where a lot of Russian money and Chinese money is coming in. It's starting to be silly season again in some areas.

Google Glass Half-Empty

For Wells Fargo Testers

A mobile banking application created by Wells Fargo & Co. for Google Inc.'s wearable Google Glass computing device isn't gaining much traction among internal testers, according to Miranda Hill, vice president and product-management manager for Wells Fargo Labs.

The app is part of the bank's efforts to focus on applications for mobile devices in all their forms. "People are receptive, but we've not seen a lot of adoption [of the app] in general."

The effort reflects the growing interest in new device types that businesses hope will connect them, if not permanently, at least persistently, with their customers.

Most large banks, having put consolidation issues behind them, are placing big technology investment bets on mobile.

For Wells Fargo, as with other banks, the challenge is to make sure its mobile banking services keep up with changes in technology.

The bank is testing Google Glass because it is likely to be popular, at least with some of its customers, but Ms. Hill said the device may not be suited to providing a good customer experience for banking.

The principal issue seems to be that the real estate for apps on Google Glass is fairly limited. "It's hard to see [financial] content in that little screen," said Ms. Hill.

A Google representative said in an email that Glass represents both a challenge and an opportunity for developers to build applications-- not "just for a device or a screen, but for people."

PG&E Aims to Bolster

Safety-Improving Tech

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will spend $300 million over the next six years upgrading the company's technology to improve safety in the wake of a deadly natural-gas-pipeline explosion in September 2010.

Last Friday, the company opened a high-tech $38 million gas-control operations center in San Ramon, Calif.

Part of the planned technology investment will go to more pipeline sensing equipment and predictive-analytics software.

By correlating different kinds of information such as pipeline pressure and maintenance records, PG&E said it will be better able to predict problems. "We're turning all this data into intelligence to tell us what may be developing on the system rather than just responding to something that has already happened," said Mel Christopher, senior director of gas operations at PG&E.

PG&E has 10,900 kilometers of transmission pipeline and 67,600 kilometers of distribution pipeline. Much of the gas infrastructure in California was installed during the post-World War II boom years, said PG&E Chief Executive Tony Earley.

The gas-control center, with a 27-meter-long video wall that shows the current status of operations, will help the company better monitor real-time information such as data from industrial control systems and emergency calls from a 911 agent.

Computer Sciences Could Face SEC Charges; Information Technology Company Says Agency May Take Action as Part of Accounting Probe

Computer Sciences Corp. said the Securities and Exchange Commission may take action against the information-technology company as part of a yearslong accounting probe.

In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, CSC said it received from the SEC's Division of Enforcement a so-called Wells notice the agency's warning to companies that they could face civil charges.

The company's outside counsel has been in discussions with SEC staff about a potential resolution of the investigation, and CSC said it plans to make a submission to the SEC in response to the Wells notice.

CSC had disclosed in October that some of its former executives in the U.S. and employees outside of the country had received Wells notices from the SEC in connection with the continuing investigation.

The probe initially focused on accounting errors in the company's former managed services sector segment, mainly accounting irregularities in the Nordic region, CSC said in previous filings.

CSC has said it initiated an investigation into out-of-period adjustments resulting from these irregularities, and was notified in January 2011 by the SEC that it had started a formal civil investigation into these matters.

The company's auditors eventually expanded the investigation to include CSC's operations in Australia, accounting practices within the company's Americas outsourcing operation, and those related to the company's contract with the U.K. National Health Service.

In addition to the investigations, CSC has struggled to overcome a series of challenges recently, including weak government spending. The company has been realigning its businesses as its aims to focus on "next-generation" technology and services including cybersecurity, big data and cloud computing.

The company in October reported fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 56% as a drop in expenses helped mask a decline in revenue.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
GLG's Lagrange caught out by 'paradox'; Fund focus

Lagrange says poor returns were caused by a mismatch between stocks and earnings, writes Bradley Gerrard

Pierre Lagrange , the "L" in GLG Partners, admits he has endured a "frustrating period" after being caught out by the recent behaviour of European stock markets.

Mr Lagrange, the Belgium-born hedge fund manager who co-founded the group in 1995 and has shot to fame in recent years amid news of multimillion pound earnings and a high-profile divorce, claims a "market paradox" has led to several of his team's strategies taking a performance hit.

The situation comes to light in an update by Mr Lagrange on the performance of his $1.3bn European Equity Alternative fund, the product the group launched in 2011 to allow mass market investors to access his skills for the first time.

European shares have been in a long-term rally since May 2012 after Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president, promised to do "whatever it takes" to secure the future of the eurozone. Those rallies stepped up a notch in June this year amid increasing signs of a global recovery becoming firmly established.

But Mr Lagrange says the rocketing European markets are at odds with the stagnation of European companies' earnings growth over the past two years.

"This has been a frustrating period for our more fundamentally driven stockpickers, and even our short-term trading strategy was wrong footed. Given our market neutrality [this] explains the fund's return for the month," he says.

In October, the European Equity Alternative fund lost 1.6 per cent but the MSCI Europe index of European equity performance gained 3.8 per cent while the S&P 500 index of major US shares gained 4.5 per cent.

The loss is contrary to the fund's aim of delivering positive returns regardless of the state of the market by adopting both 'long' bets that shares will go up and 'short' positions betting on share prices falling.

However, since it launched in October 2011 the fund's sterling share class has generated a positive return of 14.6 per cent, according to Morningstar data correct to November 25.

Mr Lagrange says the driver of the European bull market is the fact that market estimates of future earnings growth for European shares are being regularly increased.

He says the team's bets in the technology, media and telecoms sector had "an especially difficult month" and accounted for "practically all of the fund's losses", after 'long' bets in the sector proved to be misplaced.

"One significant exception was Qlik Technologies, a 'big data enterprise solution' long position, which had poor results, fell 26 per cent and was the fund's biggest loser in the month," he says.

The team has now revised its views and "adjusted positions accordingly".

Adrian Lowcock, senior investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, says it is important to remember Europe's economic recovery is lagging behind those of the US and UK meaning there will probably be "periods where share prices are not moving because of fundamentals" but rather because of a general change in outlook towards the market.

"That can drive companies that are not hitting the numbers this year," he says.

He cites the example of Argonaut Capital's Barry Norris, who he said had recently reinvested in Greek banks .

"What he is not saying is that Greek banks will hit all the numbers in terms of profits and earnings but he is buying these now in anticipation of a sustained recovery in Europe," he says.

However, Rob Burdett, co-head of the multi-manager team at F&C Asset Management, says it is starting to become more of a stockpickers' market as companies begin to move on their own rather than following market trends.

"We have seen a return of discrimination during the past 12 months," he says. "In the past year or so, companies surprising on the upside have been rewarded."

Deductibles Fuel New Worries Of Health-Law Sticker Shock

By Leslie Scism and Timothy W. Martin

As enrollment picks up on the HealthCare.gov website, many people with modest incomes are encountering a troubling element of the federal health law: deductibles so steep they may not be able to afford the portion of medical expenses that insurance doesn't cover.

The average individual deductible for what is called a bronze plan on the exchange -- the lowest-priced coverage -- is $5,081 a year, according to a new report on insurance offerings in 34 of the 36 states that rely on the federally run online marketplace.

That is 42% higher than the average deductible of $3,589 for an individually purchased plan in 2013 before much of the federal law took effect, according to HealthPocket Inc., a company that compares health-insurance plans for consumers. A deductible is the annual amount people must spend on health care before their insurer starts making payments.

The health law makes tax credits available to help cover insurance premiums for people with annual income up to four times the poverty level, or $45,960 for an individual. In addition, "cost-sharing" subsidies to help pay deductibles are available to people who earn up to 2.5 times the poverty level, or about $28,725 for an individual, in the exchange's silver policies.

But those limits will leave hundreds of thousands or more people with a difficult trade-off: They can pay significantly higher premiums for the exchange's silver, gold and platinum policies, which have lower deductibles, or gamble they won't need much health care and choose a cheaper bronze plan. Moreover, the cost-sharing subsidies for deductibles don't apply to the bronze policies.

That means some sick or injured people may avoid treatment so they don't rack up high bills their insurance won't cover, according to consumer activists, insurance brokers and public-policy analystssubverting one of the health law's goals, which is to ensure more people receive needed health care. Hospitals, meantime, are bracing for a rise in unpaid bills from bronze-plan policyholders, said industry officials and public-policy analysts.

Because all health plans now are required to provide certain minimum benefits, "consumers may be tempted to shop on premium alone, not realizing that the out-of-pocket costs can have a dramatic effect upon the annual costs of health care," said Kevin Coleman, head of research and data at HealthPocket.

Mr. Coleman said he expects the high deductibles will "produce some reduction in medical-service use" for enrollees who don't qualify for subsidies.

Of course, millions of Americans who went without insurance before the health law are in better shape today, despite the high deductibles. They are covered for much of the cost of expensive health care such as cancer treatment or major operations that could be a financial catastrophe for people lacking insurance.

And deductibles had been growing for years. It is unclear how much deductibles would have risen for individually purchased policies if the health law didn't exist. But deductibles for employer-sponsored plans, which generally are much lower than for individually purchased policies, nearly doubled over the past seven years to $1,135 in 2013, according to a Deloitte study published this year.

Meantime, hospitals likely will be treating more people who have insurance than before the law, which means they will be paid by insurers for some services that formerly ended up as bad patient debt.

Federal health officials emphasize that the exchange's pricing tiers accommodate people's different situations, and give consumers better coverage of essential services including doctor visits for preventive care that are exempt from deductibles.

"In the current individual marketplace, consumers can face unlimited out-of-pocket expenses for plans with limited benefits and high deductibles, if they can even get coverage without being denied for a pre-existing condition," said Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman Joanne Peters. "In the new marketplace, out-of-pocket expenses are capped, there are no denials based on your health and you can compare plans to find one that meets your needs."

Total out-of-pocket expenses under bronze plans are capped at an annual $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families of four; some older policies left consumers liable for significantly more. These totals include all deductibles, copayments and coinsurance charges for covered medical services from in-network health-care providers.

The issue of deductibles is coming into sharper focus as more people enroll thanks to improvements to the HealthCare.gov website since its botched Oct. 1 rollout. Many policyholders whose old plans were canceled because they don't meet the coverage standards of the health law are facing higher prices in the exchanges.

"They're seeing sticker shock" in transitioning to the more-comprehensive coverage, and "once they start to use the policy, they will see a second sticker shock" of high deductibles, said Jamie Court, president of public-interest group Consumer Watchdog in California.

For example, the patient's typical share of the cost of having a baby through normal delivery -- $6,150, according to one insurer's estimate -- would be almost entirely an out-of-pocket expense for a person holding a bronze policy with the average $5,081 deductible.

"The anger is going to grow, because people are really stretched to buy these policies, then they're going to have to reach into their pocket for another five grand before it does anything for them," Mr. Court said.

Gary Claxton, who co-directs a program for the study of health reform and private insurance at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said the bronze plans' high deductibles represent "a difficult part of the law." The amount "is certainly a lot for some," though for some early retirees with modest income but ample savings "it's probably a better choice."

Larry Harrison, an insurance agent in Las Vegas, said he constantly is reminding people to look beyond the premium when shopping for coverage. Older or sicker people who expect to be heavy medical-care users typically pick plans that cost more but have lower deductibles than bronze plans, he said.

On the other hand, many young and healthy consumers say, "'OK, it's the law. I'll have to buy a plan,' and they go straight to the premium price," he said. "If something happens to them, they just tell me they'll deal with that [deductible] another day."

For a 40-year-old adult, the average monthly premium for a bronze plan is $295.51 a month, or $3,546 a year, according to HealthPocket. A typical silver plan costs $319.42 a month, or $3,833 a year, with a $2,907 deductible.

The average insured American spent $1,241 on out-of-pocket health-care expenses in 2012, according to Truven Health Analytics Inc., which analyzed medical claims from employers.

Moody's Investors Service in October cited several exchange-related risks that it said would pressure nonprofit hospitals' revenue in 2014, including growth in unpaid bills associated with the higher deductibles.

The American Hospital Association, which represents for-profit and nonprofit hospitals and other health-care providers, concurred that the higher deductibles "will likely lead to an increase in hospital bad debt," said Ashley Thompson, its deputy director for policy.

Old Guard of Banking Sets Out to Disrupt It

[Part of a Series

After a long career in mainstream finance, Vikram Pandit is going alternative.

The former Citigroup Inc. chief executive is helping to fund an upstart in the peer-to-peer lending industry called the Orchard, whose seven employees share office space in downtown Manhattan with a company that teaches disc jockeying.

Mr. Pandit, along with Canaan Partners, Spark Capital, former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Thomas Glocer and others, is part of a group investing $2.7 million in the venture, according to documents expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday and other corporate records.

Mr. Pandit spent over 20 years at Morgan Stanley, rising to become president of its institutional-securities and investment-banking businesses. In 2006, he co-founded a hedge fund called Old Lane Partners and in a year raised about $4.5 billion before selling it to Citibank. He joined the bank in 2007 and later became CEO before resigning abruptly in October 2012.

Now he is part of a movement trying to disrupt the traditional banking model. In peer-to-peer lending, ordinary people and institutional investors make loans or parts of loans to individuals, businesses and other borrowers. The lenders are able to examine credit scores and other data before funding deals, which can be in chunks as small as $25. They receive interest and principal payments on the money.

Orchard is seeking to advise institutions investing in this area, and build a "secondary" trading platform to allow lenders to exit their investments by selling them to other people.

The investment is a bet that borrowers will continue to flock to peer-to-peer and other "shadow lenders," which have expanded rapidly since conventional banks cut back on loans during the financial crisis.

Several Wall Street veterans already have backed two peer-to-peer platforms, Lending Club Corp. and Prosper Loans Marketplace Inc. The two companies have originated more than $3 billion and $740 million, respectively, in the past five years.

Lending Club's board includes former Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack, as well as Mary Meeker, a former Morgan Stanley analyst who is a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a Lending Club backer. BlackRock Inc. was part of a group that recently invested $25 million in Prosper.

Messrs. Pandit and Glocer have teamed up on lending ventures before. The two were part of a $100 million funding earlier this year of a Brooklyn startup called CommonBond, which lends to M.B.A. students.

"We're at a really unique time where the forces of big data, as well as the Internet are coming together to disrupt lending in a similar way we've seen in other industries," said Orchard founder Matt Burton, a 29-year old Texas native who worked at a publishing-related Internet venture that was sold to Google Inc. in 2011.

Institutional investors increasingly have been seeking to participate in peer-to-peer lending. Joshua Rand of Petra Partners, a New York investment manager, says it launched a $500,000 peer-to-peer fund in November, with a goal of $300 million in 18 to 24 months. Ranger Capital Group of Dallas in November launched a fund to invest in peer-to-peer loans and now has $15 million in commitments, according to President K. Scott Canon.

In San Francisco, a firm called Insikt recently securitized about $10 million of Prosper loans, meaning they created bonds backed by these loans. Insikt then sold the securities to institutions and family offices. Eaglewood Capital, a New York hedge fund, recently did a $53 million securitization of Lending Club loans.

Members of Lending Club and Prosper can sell loans to each other on a platform operated by brokerage company Foliofn Investments Inc. that has tens of thousands of securities listed. But some investors say it is hard to sift through the offerings and match buyers and sellers.

Steven Wallman, a former SEC commissioner who founded Foliofn, said the methodology for secondary trading is largely designed by the peer-to-peer firms. "The market keeps evolving and our intent is to keep working with Lending Club and Prosper to make that better," he said.

Orchard aims to start advising institutional clients on choosing loans and navigating regulations in January, and plans to launch the secondary market later in the year. It is proposing to carry not only loans from Prosper and Lending Club, but dozens of other peer-to-peer securities, including mortgages and student loans.

"Orchard is going to revolutionize the secondary market," said Ron Suber, global head of institutional sales at Prosper.

Scott Sanborn, chief operating officer of Lending Club, said that while a secondary platform could potentially increase liquidity for investors, there are still many details to sort out, including the administrative burden of transferring ownership of thousands of slices of loans.

"There is a demand frenzy," says Dan Ciporin, a partner at Canaan who is on the board of Lending Club, which Canaan also backed. He noted there are more than 50 platforms now offering peer-to-peer loans. "This is the new way we'll see banking."

CIA-backed Palantir valued at $9bn

Palantir Technologies , a big data company which works for the US intelligence services, has been valued at about $9bn, after keen investor interest in the software maker that was first funded by the CIA.

The Silicon Valley-based company's valuation has soared more than 50 per cent since September, according to one person familiar with the matter. It is set to announce a $58m fundraising from anonymous backers, which the person said will probably increase to $100m.

Palantir's initial funding came from In-Q-Tel , the CIA's not for profit venture capital firm and it has received several rounds of funding from the Founder's Fund, a venture capital fund run by former PayPal chief executive and Facebook backer Peter Thiel . Other venture capital investors include Glenn Capital Management and Ulu Ventures.

The company raised almost $200m in a fundraising round less than three months ago, and then also would not disclose the identity of the investors. Founded by PayPal alumni and Stanford computer scientists in 2004, the company has raised almost $800m in total.

The CIA and the FBI use the Palantir platform to seek patterns in large amounts of disparate data which can be used to help guide their actions, for example, in the tracking of terror suspects, drug trafficking or cyber crime.

But Palantir's work for the private sector is the fastest growing part of the business, and now makes up more than 60 per cent. It offers companies anti-fraud services, warnings about insider trading threats and programmes which promise to help accelerate the research and development process in the pharmaceuticals industry.

Palantir has denied that its Prism product, which it licences to banks and hedge funds for quantitative research, is the same as the US government programme of the same name that was exposed in the leaks by Edward Snowden, the former CIA contractor, of sensitive material from the National Security Agency earlier this year.

The company is led by co-founder Alex Karp , who has stressed the importance of privacy, despite criticism from campaigners, and it is reported to have an internal ethics hotline to encourage its engineers to report any unethical use of programmes by clients.

The company was founded by Peter Thiel , Alex Karp , Joe Lonsdale , Stephen Cohen and Nathan Gettings , with a name that is derived from the "seeing stones" in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

Valuations have been rapidly rising in Silicon Valley. Snapchat, a messaging application, recently rejected a $3bn bid from Facebook which would have valued it at 275 per cent more than the price struck in its last fundraising round in June, and Pinterest , the online scrapbooking site, raised money at a $3.8bn valuation, or more than 50 per cent higher than a fundraising earlier this year.

Twitter data are a valuable commodity that is fast winning funding, writes Hannah Kuchler

The thoughts, desires and sarcastic comments of Twitter's more than 230m active users have become hot property, with Apple this week buying one social media analytics company and more investors piling into another.

Apple acquired Topsy Labs on Tuesday in a deal thought to be aimed at using analysis of Twitter's "fire hose" - every tweet sent - to improve its advertising services, iTunes recommendations or the iOS virtual assistant Siri. The Apple deal is thought to value Topsy at $200m, according to one person familiar with the matter.

The next day, Datasift, the Reading and San Francisco-based social data platform which provides data to 1,000 companies including Bloomberg and Dell, raised $42m in a fundraising led by Insight Venture Partners, with participation from existing investors.

Twitter data have become important to everyone from financial traders to supply chain managers - and even sitcom makers - who rely on the social messaging site to tell them what is happening, fast.

Twitter , which went public last month, made $47m of its total $422m revenue from sales of its data over the past nine months, an increase of 36 per cent from the same period the year before.

But as it focuses on boosting advertising revenue and starting to sell adverts abroad, the company has left the data analysis to selected partners.

It has restricted access to the fire hose to a handful of data analytics companies, which are feeding off the more than 500m tweets posted on the messaging platform a day, slicing and dicing the information to make it relevant for everyone from traders to supermarket stockists.

These companies are hoping the messaging platform will grow into a data source that few industries can live without - and that these customers will rely on them to sort the market-moving news from the Justin Bieber celebrity tweets.

Founded in 2007, a year after Twitter, San Francisco-based Topsy Labs created a search engine to track trends on Twitter, selling analysis on keywords, users and sentiment.

It also issues real-time alerts and reports on how specific companies are viewed on social media.

The company was started by Vipul Ved Prakash and Gary Iwatani, entrepreneurs who worked on messaging security company Cloudmark together, alongside Rishab Aiyer Ghosh, an open source software advocate, and Justin Foutts.

Topsy has been run by Duncan Greatwood, chief executive, since he arrived from Cisco in 2011.

Nick Halstead, founder of Datasift, said watching Twitter would give companies a lot of "noise" without sentiment or context. His company, which will use the funds to expand into more countries and develop work with customers' internal data sets, does "very, very heavy data mining", he said, not simply brand monitoring.

Datasift uses not only Twitter but data from other networks including Facebook and blogging platforms such as Tumblr and WordPress.

It has worked to create lists of users with specific interests who it can use as focus groups, for example, chief marketing officers in pharmaceuticals or fans of a particular book.

Companies can then watch users who have been found to be better at predictive signals or engage with fans to get them to promote a new product.

The company, which plans to go public in the next three or four years, has analysed tweets to show programme makers what target viewers think of different plot lines and help US football teams decide how many shirts to make with each player's name by monitoring who is most popular in each region.

Traders were among the first to embrace Twitter data , hoping to hear of market-moving news before their competitors.

Dataminr is a service used by the financial sector and the US government that helps them keep track of every tweet and determine what could be important.

Dataminr detected an explosion at a Venezuelan refinery that later pushed up gasoline futures and an explosion at a chemical plant in Louisiana that caused shares in the company to fall, alerting its customers before they became major news stories.

But tweets can also be wrong and cost traders money, as was shown when the Associated Press Twitter account was hacked, messaging the world with the claim there had been a terrorist attack on the White House.

US markets suffered a brief but sharp sell-off, showing how Twitter influences investor sentiment but also the risks associated with relying on the platform.

Susan Etlinger, a social media analyst at Altimeter Group, said businesses needed to use the data in context of all their other information, and standards needed to be set so customers knew exactly how much of the entire Twitter fire hose of data are being used for analysis.

"We're at the very beginning of our use of social data for business and large organisations," she said. "Social data are very tricky."

WORLD NEWS
Employment figures set to put Fed's plans in spotlight

A run of strong economic data is raising expectations for US jobs numbers due tomorrow that will have a crucial influence on when the Federal Reserve chooses to slow its asset purchases from $85bn a month.

Companies created 215,000 new jobs last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, following an upwardly revised 184,000 rise in October, according to data from ADP, the private payrolls processor , yesterday.

Analysts expect the official November data to show 180,000 new jobs, pointing to acceleration in the labour market, and close to levels that might persuade the Fed decide to start slowing its bond-buying programme at its meeting on December 18.

But with November payrolls set to give the first clean reading on the state of the jobs market since October's government shutdown scrambled the data, the detail of the report will be even more important than the headline number.

After the official October jobs report showed an unexpectedly strong 204,000 increase, one question will be whether that is revised downwards, with the Fed more likely to look at average jobs growth over three, six and 12 months than November's number alone.

"Remember last month a lot of the payroll cognoscenti were looking for October to be revised down, not believing the reported 212,000 for private sector payrolls," noted Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG in New York. "The ADP data suggest a large downward revision is not likely."

Another important question is whether a big drop in labour force participation - to its lowest level since the late 1970s at 62.8 per cent in October - turns out to be a blip. If it persists, it will probably cause a big drop in the unemployment rate from 7.3 per cent.

Economists have struggled to explain the big fall in October participation . Most expect it to be reversed in November.

The jobs report will also come alongside another piece of crucial data for the Fed: updated numbers for gross domestic product in the third quarter and for its preferred measure of inflation. Any further slowdown in price rises could counteract a strong number for jobs growth.

"The job market remained surprisingly resilient to the government shutdown and brinkmanship over the Treasury debt limit . . . If anything, job growth appears to be picking up," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sAnalytics, which jointly produces the ADP payrolls report.

One cautious note yesterday came from the release of purchasing managers' index data for the service sector, which fell to 53.9 in November from 55.4 the month before. That is still above the level of 50 that divides expansion from contraction but was not as strong as the separate manufacturing index .

The employment subindex, which measures service companies' desire to hire new workers, fell from 56.2 to 52.5. This is "consistent with our expectations for a small moderation in non-farm payroll performance in November to 187,000", said Gennadiy Goldberg at TD Securities in New York.

Putting the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing indices together is consistent with annualised economic growth of 2 per cent in the fourth quarter and monthly jobs growth of about 180,000, said Paul Dales of Capital Economics.

180,000 Forecast for new jobs tally in November

U.S. News: Fed Snapshot Shows Growth

By Sarah Portlock and Eric Morath

The U.S. economy expanded at a "modest to moderate" pace in recent months, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a report that showed mixed economic conditions across the nation just weeks before a key policy decision by the central bank.

The central bank's beige book, which assesses the economic environment in the Fed's 12 districts, cited strength in the U.S. manufacturing sector and consumer spending. Seven districts reported steady growth rates, while four indicated a less robust expansion than the others. One region simply said economic activity continued to expand.

The snapshot, based on data gathered from early October through Nov. 22, comes two weeks before the Fed's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting. The Fed will decide at that meeting whether to start pulling back its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program, which is aimed at lowering borrowing costs to spur stronger spending, hiring and growth.

Uncertainty about the Fed's next steps remains a key risk hanging over investors and employers. Fed officials expect to start scaling back the program "in coming months," if the overall economy and labor market continue to improve, according to minutes from its last policy meeting in October.

A separate survey released Wednesday by the Business Roundtable, a group of corporate executives, found CEOs the most bullish they've been about the economy in almost two years. The survey's economic-outlook index for the fourth quarter rose to its highest point since early 2012. Executives said clearer signals from Washington could help the economy accelerate.

"We have an economy that is on the cusp of growing at more than the 2-to-3% we've seen," said Boeing Co. CEO Jim McNerney, chairman of the group. "Washington sorting themselves out would give businesses a more predictable environment to invest the cash on their balance sheets and hire people."

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will meet the CEOs at the Business Roundtable's quarterly meeting Thursday in Washington. The event is closed to the public, and the roster of CEOs who plan to attend hasn't been released. The group has about 200 member CEOs from large companies, whose planning decisions could be influenced by the direction of interest rates and whose plans could influence the Fed's policy decisions.

Mr. McNerney said the Fed would need to pull back on the pace of its bond purchases at some point "for the well-being of our financial system."

"They've chosen to keep interest rates very low, to keep the economy in a very highly liquid state," he said. "I think we're all mindful of the fact that tapering does need to happen somewhere along the line or we're going to have a very difficult inflationary environment here."

The overall economy is starting to see stabilization in key areas after a turbulent summer. Sales of new homes picked up in October and inventory fell, according to a Commerce Department report released Wednesday, a sign the housing market may be stabilizing. New-home sales rose 25% in October to an annual rate of 444,000.

A separate report Wednesday by payroll-processing firm Automatic Data Processing Inc. and Moody'sAnalytics found U.S. businesses added more jobs in November than in any month this year. Private-sector jobs rose by 215,000 last month, while the October increase was revised to 184,000 from 130,000.

Markets
Stocks Suffer Fourth Straight Loss

Stocks declined for a fourth consecutive session, as investors weighed the outlook for the Federal Reserve to start paring stimulus efforts this month after a raft of economic reports.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 24.85 points, or 0.2%, to 15889.77. The S&P 500-stock index declined 2.34 points, or 0.1%, to 1792.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.80 point, or less than 0.1%, to 4038.

The S&P 500 is down 0.7% this week, after eight straight weeks of gains. Traders and investors said that a slate of better-than-expected economic reports have lifted expectations among some investors that the Fed could start trimming its easy-money policies as soon as this month.

"Investors have gotten used to the idea that at some point the Fed will need to start getting out of the way," said Colleen Supran, principal with Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, which manages $2.7 billion. "But that is not going to be a straight and smooth road. We're certainly going to have volatility in stock prices."

As the S&P 500 entered December with a 27% year-to-date gain, investors said they are pausing to determine their outlook for 2014. Many said it has gotten more difficult to take a strong, near-term bullish stance on stocks after a steep rise in U.S. and European markets.

"It's tough," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments, which manages $49 billion in Atlanta. "There are lots of crosscurrents for investors and portfolio managers into the end of the year."

Trading was choppy Wednesday, and stocks briefly turned sharply lower in afternoon trading to hit session lows, with the Dow falling 123 points at one point.

Wednesday's data provided a mixed picture for investors.

Activity in the U.S. services sector expanded in November at a slower pace than expected. The Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index fell by more than expected for that month. New-home sales surged more than expected in October. But revisions to September sales figures showed sales at a much slower pace than had been previously reported.

Meanwhile, a report from Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics said 215,000 private-sector jobs were added last month, up from 130,000 in October, and above expectations of 178,000. The ADP report is seen as a preview of the U.S. government's November employment report, due Friday. The Fed has said that the strength of the labor market would be a core factor in determining when the U.S. economy is strong enough for the central bank to step back from its bond-buying program.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.841% from 2.773% late Tuesday, as bond prices fell.

Gold gained 2.2%, to $1,248.20 a troy ounce, after settling at a five-month low on Tuesday. Crude oil gained 1.2% to $97.20 a barrel. The dollar slipped against the euro and yen.

In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.6%, continuing its retreat from last Thursday's 51/2-year closing high. Germany's DAX index shed 0.9%, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 eased 0.3% and France's CAC-40 slipped 0.6%.

Retail sales in the euro zone declined 0.2% in October, missing expectations of a 0.2% rise. In addition, Markit's composite purchasing managers index fell in November from October.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average shed 2.2%, as some strengthening in the yen prompted a pullback from Tuesday's 61/2-month closing high. China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.3%, after the country's central bank said it would launch overhauls for Shanghai's Free-Trade Zone in the next three months.

In corporate news, J.C. Penney declined 45 cents, or 4.4%, to $9.66, despite a report from the retailer showing same-store sales for November rose 10% above year-earlier levels.

OmniVision Technologies fell 47 cents, or 2.9%, to 15.52, after the mobile camera-sensor maker reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue but provided a downbeat outlook for the current quarter.

Out of the Office

Private-equity giant Blackstone Group LP has been using initial public offerings to exit its massive investments in shopping centers and hotels, like next week's expected IPO for Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

But Blackstone is taking a different approach to exit a large portfolio of office buildings it bought before the economic downturn: The firm is selling off the properties bit by bit.

In all, Blackstone, through its Equity Office Properties affiliate, has reached deals to sell more than 41 office properties for over $3.5 billion in the past 12 months, according to data provider Real Capital Analytics Inc.

In the latest example, Blackstone reached a deal to sell Center Plaza in Boston, a 725,000-square-foot building, to Shorenstein Properties LLC for $307 million, according to people familiar with the agreement.

There is still plenty left to sell. Blackstone's largest office holdings include a set of towers in downtown Boston and a portfolio in West Los Angeles worth billions.

Grudge Match

A tag-team of activist investors battling for control of office landlord CommonWealth REIT is taking its case to the voters -- again.

Weeks after getting the green light from an arbitration panel, a fund controlled by billionaire Stephen Ross's Related Cos. and Keith Meister's Corvex Management LP is seeking votes from CommonWealth's shareholders to oust the company's board of directors.

Related and Corvex say CommonWealth is undervalued and pays exorbitant management fees to an entity controlled by its founders, the Portnoy family. The funds first tried to oust CommonWealth's board in a similar move -- known as a consent solicitation -- in the spring, winning support of more than 70% of CommonWealth's shareholders.

CommonWealth challenged the validity of the vote, and took the matter to arbitration. While the arbitration panel ruled that the earlier solicitation was invalid, it said Related and Corvex had the power to call for a vote, clearing the way for the new effort launched Tuesday. It requires support of two-thirds of shareholders.

CommonWealth vowed to defend itself, saying Tuesday the new vote is "another attempt to seize control of the company for short term gains."

Palace Intrigue

Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, the Dallas-based luxury-hotel company that has been aggressively expanding abroad under a new Chinese owner, is entering into Paris with elan.

The company says it will take over management operations of the Hotel de Crillon, which was built in 1758 as a palace for King Louis XV. The building, which has served as a hotel for more than a century, is owned by a member of the Saudi royal family. It closed for renovations in March and is expected to reopen in 2015.

Rosewood is talking to German fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld about redesigning the roughly 150 rooms and suites. Hiring Mr. Lagerfeld would be an inspired choice, suggests Rosewood President Radha Arora, since "he is 80 years old and has reinvented himself many times."

The company has focused mostly on the U.S. But since its 2011 acquisition by a unit of Hong Kong-based New World Development Ltd., it has looked primarily abroad. Rosewood now manages or will manage seven properties in Asia and six in the Middle East.

Rosewood is led by chief executive officer Sonia Cheng, the granddaughter of New World's founder, Cheng Yu-tung.

Banks need to take on Amazon and Google or die

Some bankers and analysts think that Google, Facebook, Amazon or the like will not fully enter a highly regulated, low-margin business such as banking . I disagree. What is more, I think banks that are not prepared for such new competitors face certain death.

Technology has already transformed many industries. Next in line is banking. In two or three years, only 5 per cent of consumer interaction will be through branches. The rules have changed and a new league of competitors is emerging.

New entrants are free from the legacies of banks: obsolete systems and costly distribution networks. So far, most (PayPal, Square , iZettle, SumUp, Dwolla) are seen as niche businesses. However, they may expand or seek alliances. And almost certainly some big names in the digital world, companies with strong brands and millions or billions of users, will jump into the fray.

Yet while this is disconcerting for banks, the good news is that we still have one significant advantage, which is the vast array of financial and non-financial data that we accumulate. This information reveals a lot about habits, tastes, needs and aspirations. Banks need to turn it into knowledge and use that knowledge to provide users with exactly what they want, precisely how and when they need it.

People want simple, transparent services with real-time customised pricing, and it has to be available on the move. Mobile services not only provide a much more flexible, convenient customer experience, they also offer the potential to double or even triple the number of bank customers worldwide in the next decade.

Customers expect the same level of service through all channels, whether mobile, PC or branch, and the ability to jump freely from one to another. They also seek innovative content, products and services - financial or non-financial - that fit their changing needs.

In combination, big data and cloud computing will be important tools for giving customers an improved experience. "Open innovation" models are also needed, such as when the bank opens its technological platform to outside developers to create services. Employees, clients, partners and other stakeholders must be involved at every step.

The financial services industry is becoming what I call the BIT industry (banking, information and technology), where information, through technology, is transformed into knowledge. In this new world, banks should transform into "digital" banks, or rather into new forms of information services company. Their engine will be a platform that can integrate limitless volumes of data. For existing banks, this implies a monumental undertaking. Most banking platforms were designed in the 1960s and 1970s, and have been patched up over the years, creating what Professor Peter Weil of Massachusetts Institute of Technology calls "spaghetti platforms". This refers to the complex, unwieldy connectivity among different applications, which results in rigid, inefficient tools.

In view of the difficulties in replacing core platforms, some banks have opted for adding middleware - that is, intermediate applications that interact with the "core" system and support the front end. However, this is a temporary solution as the need for processing capacities increases more and more.

A new financial ecosystem is being created. In two decades, we will go from 20,000 "analogue" banks today worldwide to no more than several dozen "digital" banks. Diverse niche businesses will exist, but most will be mere "suppliers" for the much-reduced number of digital banks acting as "knowledge distributors". They will own the platform through which products and services are channelled to the end customer. Here we will see the main clash between digital banks and new entrants.

The shift from analogue to digital requires a complete overhaul of banks' technology and corporate culture. This is a matter of survival. We at BBVA have been working on this process for six years and we are making substantial progress in our transformation. We now have a state of the art platform. But we need to sustain this effort throughout the years to come.

Huge challenges also await regulators. They should maintain a level playing field somewhere between the existing regulatory burden for banks and the largely unregulated virtual environment. They need to ensure security, privacy, consumer protection and systemic stability in a digital world that is largely unmapped and gets bigger, faster and more complex by the minute. And, at the same time, they should leave space for fair competition and innovation.

Banks are losing their monopoly on banking. It is up to each one to rise to the challenge of offering the information services (banking or otherwise) that people need.

The writer is chief executive of BBVA

Top rating agencies face threat of fines; GENERAL FINANCIAL

Regulator uncovers process 'deficiencies'

Shortcomings pose risk to quality

The top credit rating agencies face the threat of fines after an EU regulator said it had uncovered "deficiencies" in the way they manage the highly market-sensitive task of assigning ratings to government debt.

The European Securities and Markets Authority said a probe into the processes at Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch had found shortcomings that pose risks to "the quality, independence and integrity" of ratings.

The watchdog's review raised concerns over delays in the publication of ratings changes, the use of junior staff to lead analysis on sovereigns and the involvement of senior company management in rating decisions.

Esma said that the deficiencies also included disclosure of forthcoming rating actions to an unauthorised third party and inadequate controls related to the use of external communications consultants.

The watchdog has called for "remedial action" to fix the problems and said that it had not yet decided if the problems amounted to breaches of the EU regulation covering rating agencies. If it were to launch a full-blown enforcement action, Esma could levy fines or withdraw an agency's registration.

The Esma report comes after the agencies were accused of exacerbating the sovereign debt crisis by publishing debt rating downgrades of periphery and core European states.

The Paris-based regulator, created in 2011, was given responsibility for the supervision of rating agencies in Europe after policy makers decided to tighten scrutiny of the companies . Two earlier Esma reports have also found shortcomings with controls and resources at the agencies.

Responding yesterday, S&P said it was committed to the highest standards and was continually enhancing its analytics and operations, while Moody's said it was committed to complying with the EU rules and enhancing its performance, processes and transparency.

Fitch said it was confident all its policies and procedures meet regulatory standards and was moving to address any issues identified in the report.

Esma said it also found good practices among the companies it surveyed, including analytical training programmes, and practices aimed at giving rating committees more power to challenge decisions.

Institutions look for higher revenues in information deluge, says Ellen Kelleher

With low interest rates crimping its net interest margins, State Street is the latest custodian bank to attempt to drive its sluggish revenues higher by moving into data mining.

State Street's idea is to profit from helping asset managers exploit investment data to gain an edge against competitors . This cannot be described as an original thought, however, as BNY Mellon and other rival banks are pursuing similar strategies.

"It's a logical move when you are a custodial bank and you are at the centre of the marketplace," explains Brad Hintz, an analyst with the research group Sanford Bernstein.

As things stand, the asset managers and pension funds who hire custodian banks are swamped by the onslaught of data coming their way as new regulations create changes across the investment industry and electronic trading jacks up the speed and volume of transactions taking place.

"Our investors are getting overwhelmed by data . . . It has become fundamental to competitive positioning and creating a sustainable business that will grow in time," said Jeff Conway, an executive vice-president overseeing State Street's data and analytics division. "There's more demand for finding ways to address it, then there is supply that's creating business opportunities."

Custodian banks receive non-public, though arguably not material financial information, from their clients. Put together this data can become a source of information that has potential value. And statisticians and systems designers now build platforms that can discover understandable patterns in the large data sets using statistics, numerical linear algebra and optimisation.

As a result, custodian banks now seize the chance to roll out systems which permit clients to sift through the wreckage of unfiltered gigabytes of information and pinpoint business and investment trends that might improve the way they do business.

Suresh Kumar, chief information officer with BNY Mellon, sums the situation up this way: "The ease of access to data and the quality of that data are not that good . . . Anyone can collect a lot of data, but you have to realise what its significance is."

Albridge, a division of Pershing, which BNY Mellon owns, for example offers a range of programmes. One allows asset managers to monitor their relationships with the subadvisors they deal with. Another identifies trends in asset flows and transactions to pinpoint opportunities to profit. And a third analyses the profitability of products, advisers and clients.

Analysts who cover custodian banks expect State Street's foray into data mining to be costly, but no indication of its expense as well as its revenues will be released until first-quarter earnings come at the start of next year. A spokesman for BNY Mellon also declined to discuss the profitability of its programme.

The push into data mining by State Street arrives as custodial banks' business models face pressure because foreign exchange , cash management and securities lending are not the profit centres they were.

Custodial banks boast more cash on deposit these days, but low interest rates hurt net interest margins, so they are making less money. State Street's net interest margins, for example, fell to 1.33 per cent in the third quarter of this year, from 1.53 per cent in the same period last year. Rival BNY Mellon's net interest margins also dropped to 1.16 per cent by the close of September from 1.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2012.

As State Street and BNY Mellon wade into the data mining business, analysts continue to debate why these banks lack pricing power in their bread-and-butter custody businesses. Conspiracy theories abound.

"Custodial banks are an oligopoly that doesn't know how to use its pricing power," concludes Mr Hintz. "Opec and the custodial banks need to organise a meeting so the banks learn how to run an oligopoly."

A more serious analysis also put forth by Mr Hintz is that custodians lack pricing power because the asset managers who they count as clients do as well. And it is no secret that asset managers want to keep custody fees low as they pass these costs on to their investors. "In the asset management business, barriers to entry are low, competition between firms is high, and the threat of cheaper substitutes (index funds, ETFs ) is believed to have pressured pricing for many years," wrote Mr Hintz in a report published last May.

As custodian banks zero in on data mining as a profitable new business, questions are also being raised about their rights to own the data they exploit for commercial purposes. Whether they will be stopped in their tracks some day by lawyers remains up for debate. Who does the data belong to - the client or the bank? and how can it be used? "Right now the customers providing the data to the custodial banks give it to them for free. Will this continue?" asks Mr Hintz in a final question.

Innovation Group has said strong annual profit growth has put it in a good position to expand into digital analytics and mobile technology and provide its insurance company clients with new services

Pre-tax profits at the London-listed company, which provides software to motor and property insurers, beat analysts' expectations - rising by 22 per cent to 14.4m in the year to September 30.

This performance was boosted by the group's businesses in Germany and the UK, which process large volumes of claims for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, the car hire company. Innovation renewed a 25m five-year contract with Enterprise in July and signed a 75m contract with a major UK insurer in October.

"This past year has been our strongest, most successful ever as a group," said Andy Roberts, chief executive.

The company makes money from a combination of sources: by taking a slice of transaction fees on insurance claims, by selling goods such as paint to the auto industry and by profit sharing with insurance company clients.

However, in looking forward to the year ahead, the company noted that insurers are increasingly "moving from paying claims to preventing them . . . through the application of data analytics" and "working with customers to reduce potential losses".

Innovation said it was therefore working to enhance its existing claims analytics products.

It already offers a tool called "Rapid Assess" that allows users to upload pictures they have taken of car damage with a smartphone and get a quick estimate of the cost of repair work.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>Like other providers of software to financial companies, it is also having to adapt to new technological developments. "Telematics" and in-car sensors, for example, are opening up the possibility of motor insurance premiums being tailored to individual drivers' habits - although a recent report by Celent, a research firm, pointed to the costs of data capture and storage.

Nevertheless, Mr Roberts forecast that the software group could maintain its profitability. "Given the strength of our position I believe we are well positioned for a further strong performance in the year ahead," he said.

For the full-year period, Innovation said its North American division suffered an adjusted loss of 1.2m, after restructuring costs for its Chicago-based business, exits from lossmaking contracts, a management change and the introduction of new voice and data technology.

Even so, George O'Connor, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said new US contracts and investment in research and development suggested that "organically, the US seems nicely pepped for a series of upgrades". He said he expected Innovation's North American arm to return to profit in 2014.

At a group level, revenues grew 6 per cent over the year to 204.4m. Fully diluted earnings per share were up from 1.2p to 1.4p.

Asia
Data Centers Prosper Amid Uncertainties; Digital Realty CEO Michael Foust discusses why demand for new data centers remains strong and what opportunities the company sees in Asia.

Demand for data centers, or facilities that house servers and other network gear, has grown rapidly over the past several years amid a proliferation of mobile-computing devices and growing needs among businesses to outsource their data storage and management.

Despite uncertainties in most major global markets, total global spending on data centers is expected to grow 4% annually through 2017, according to Gartner, with spending in the Asian-Pacific region expanding at a 7% annual rate.

One of the beneficiaries of this trend is Digital Realty Trust, a San Francisco-based firm that operates as a real-estate investment trust. "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/06/21/qa-digital-realty-seeks-growth-in-asia/", which posted 2012 revenue of $1.28 billion, acquires and develops properties for data centers and leases them out to its customers. Its clients include companies from a wide range of industries finance, manufacturing, health care and energy, as well as major Internet companies like Facebook Inc. and IT service providers. Firms that manage data centers, such as Equinix Inc., are also clients, as they rent out Digital Realty's properties to provide their services.

In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Digital Realty Chief Executive Michael Foust talked about why demand for new data centers remains strong even during economic downturns and what opportunities the company sees in Asia, and particularly in China.

WSJ: What is driving demand for data centers despite the sluggish global economy?

Mr. Foust: Corporations try to outsource their data centers to new facilities &.In challenging economic times, it's a good way to drive productivity and cut costs. In the financial-services industry, which makes up almost 30% of our revenue, companies are looking to consolidate facilities that are sprung up in individual departments. Those facilities are often in converted conference rooms and other spaces in office buildings that are very ill-suited for critical data-management facilities. So their IT departments are looking for a more efficient operating environment that will also allow them to roll out their new applications or expand their existing applications much more easily.

WSJ: What trends do you see among your customers in various industries?

Mr. Foust: Demand from financial-services companies is very strong, as they are always growing their IT capabilities and consolidating their facilities. But we also see growth in demand from health-care industries, especially in the U.S. Energy is another hot area, as demand for analytics for oil and gas exploration continues to expand.

WSJ: North America accounts for almost 80% of your annualized rent, while the Asian-Pacific region is only about 2%. How will this breakdown change?

Mr. Foust: The U.S. has so many different kinds of markets in it, and it is always going to be by far the largest component of our revenue. But keep in mind that our Asia-Pacific business portfolio is only about three years old. We would expect that, over the course of the next three to four years, the Asia-Pacific region will be about 5% or 6% of our global revenue, as we complete the development of existing properties and start leasing them up. We just launched our second-phase facility in Melbourne, which will be for multiple tenants, and we [opened a new facility in Hong Kong last week]. Next year, we will enter the Japanese market by opening our site in Osaka.

WSJ: You haven't entered China or India. What are your plans?

Mr. Foust: China is obviously a huge growth market. We want to create a joint venture with a local IT services company or Internet provider. Finding a well-established local partner is a prerequisite for entering China. We are currently having early-stage discussions with a few potential Chinese partners. We will see how it goes over the next couple of years. At this point, it's hard to say when exactly we can enter the Chinese market. But over the next 12 months our strong focus is on the projects in other markets that we already have under way, and ensuring that they will be successful.

India is really not on our radar yet at this point in time, but in the future it will be. Like China, if we were to enter India it would have to be with a joint venture with a local partner. But I think that would be further off in the horizon. We don't have any definite plans for India at this point.

WSJ: What are the biggest challenges for Digital Realty?

Mr. Foust: The biggest challenge for us really is finding the right sites for new development. The sites we look for are those with access to good power supply and network services from different Internet providers, and they also need to be logistically in the areas where our enterprise customers want to be located. In the Asia-Pacific region, finding such sites in markets like Singapore and Hong Kong is always challenging. Some of the most desirable markets for data centers are also those that have the most challenging real-estate markets to break into.

We are also aware of challenges from our competitors. There are good international companies such as Global Switch, which is our major competitor in Sydney and Singapore.

Lenders, Companies Balk at Proposed Loan Rules

WASHINGTON -- An attempt by regulators to prevent the kind of lax underwriting that exacerbated the financial crisis is running into resistance from corporations, investors and asset managers who said new rules will cripple a $300 billion market for loans to U.S. companies.

Regulators want those who manage or arrange collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, to retain some of the loans' risk on their books. Policy makers said requiring such skin in the game will ensure loans sliced, packaged and sold to investors are of high quality and help protect against default.

In a collateralized loan obligation, a company that generally has a lower credit rating gets a loan from a group of banks, known as a syndicated loan. CLO managers buy pieces of these loans, pool them together into a CLO and then sell slices of debt to investors based on different risk and return profiles.

CLOs are the second-biggest source of financing for syndicated loans, which provide nearly $2.8 trillion in financing to U.S. companies. Investors are lured to CLOs as they typically offer higher returns than corporate bonds and other loans.

Among those that have benefited from CLO financing are Wendy's Co., H.J. Heinz Co., Dunkin' Brands Group Inc., J.C. Penney Co., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., and United Airlines, according to industry representatives.

"The public hasn't largely heard of CLOs, but they're an important part of the economy overall and the single-largest lender to corporations beside banks," said Josh Terry, head of structured products at Dallas-based Highland Capital Management LP, the largest CLO manager in the U.S. with about $18 billion in assets under management.

This summer six regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, proposed that managers who put together CLOs for investors buy and hold a 5% interest in the loans underlying the securities. Alternatively, those who arrange the loans, including banks, could retain at least 5% on their balance sheet. Banks and CLO managers would be banned from hedging or selling off risk for at least two years, mimicking a similar restriction that applies to banks and other firms that sell mortgage- and other asset-backed securities.

The proposal is an outgrowth of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which required risk retention for all asset-backed securities as a way to limit shoddy loans.

Market participants insist the risk-retention rules will hamper a vital source of funding for U.S. companies. They argue CLO managers, and the banks arranging the loans, will be unable or unwilling to retain a 5% stake that can't be hedged or sold for even a short period.

CLO managers, who invest money on behalf of customers, would struggle to retain 5% of the loans, which may be between $400 million and $900 million, Mr. Terry said.

Banks said they would be hard-pressed to retain 5% on their books given regulatory pressure to mitigate risks and the additional capital they would need to hold against such an asset. In a letter to regulators last month, Wells Fargo & Co. said the requirement to retain exposure to a borrower that can't be hedged or sold "is generally inconsistent with prudent lending practices."

The companies that rely on CLO funding have also expressed concern. SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. Chief Financial Officer Jim Heaney, in a letter to regulators last month, said "CLOs provide an important engine for our businesses, and we are concerned that the re-proposed rules will have adverse consequences on this valuable form of financing."

A spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., one of the regulators behind the plan, said the agency doesn't comment on proposals during the rule-making process. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it is in the process of considering comments.

In its August proposal, regulators said the plan could benefit commercial borrowers and wouldn't cause significant disruption to the CLO market. Regulators still must approve a final rule that could change based on comments they receive.

CLOs have increased rapidly since the financial crisis as the low-interest-rate environment has pushed investors into securities that offer the possibility of high returns. A total of 98 CLOs closed in the first half of 2013, a 151% increase from the same period in 2012, according to a July report by Appleby Global Group Services Ltd. Over the past 18 months, the average deal size has risen to $482 million, according to Appleby. Investors include mutual funds, U.S. pension funds and Japanese banks.

Some market observers said such heady growth makes CLOs ripe for stronger rules as regulators look to gird the financial system against the type of lax lending standards that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis.

"It's prudent and encourages good underwriting judgment," said Sheila Bair, former chairman of the FDIC and now a senior adviser at the Pew Charitable Trusts.

Some critics said the proposal may not go far enough given concerns about the quality of CLOs, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

"There's growing concern about the quality of underlying loans," Mr. Zandi said. "Bankers will tell you underwriting standards on commercial and industrial lending is down because of CLOs. The concern is we're going down the same path as 2005 to 2006 with mortgage loans, although I don't think we're in the same universe yet. There's the adage of 'if it's growing like a weed, it probably is a weed.' "

Mr. Zandi pointed to a warning by bank regulators this fall, in which examiners noted increased frequency of weak underwriting standards over the past year. The report focused on banks' leveraged-loan portfolios -- loans to companies with high levels of debt and part of the fuel powering the CLO market.

FCA accused of clipping angel investors' wings; GENERAL FINANCIAL

News analysis

Critics hit out at the regulator's restrictions on crowdfunding, says Jonathan Moules

The potential of crowdfunding to unleash a nation of angel investors is being held back by the regulator's refusal to allow people to use these platforms to back start-ups created by friends and family, says venture capitalist Jon Moulton.

Mr Moulton, founder and managing partner of Better Capital, which specialises in company turnrounds, says the Financial Conduct Authority was mistaken to limit the ability of "unsophisticated" investors to use crowdfunding services to invest in companies.

"Investors want to support UK companies at a time when high street banks aren't lending," he says. "However, the FCA rules propose stopping those that are not classed as 'sophisticated' or 'high net worth' investing more than 10 per cent of their net investible portfolio in unlisted shares, unless advised. This is wrong."

His views are echoed by crowdfunding website operators. Jeff Lynn, chief executive of Seedrs, says US law was a lot more accommodating to people who wish to put money into ventures by friends and family.

"Most people who want to get a portfolio of investments pass the [FCA] sophisticated investor test," notes Mr Lynn. "Where we have concerns is where there are people who probably shouldn't be investing in start-ups generally but are good friends with someone who is starting a business and wants to put 50 into it as an investment."

A poll of 1,000 active investors, not classed as sophisticated or high net worth, conducted by crowdfunding platform InvestingZone found that two-thirds wanted more control over their investments and a third were frustrated with broker and adviser fees.

Richard Brockbank, co-founder of InvestingZone, says he welcomes the FCA's regulation of crowdfunding because it standardises the rules and gives investors confidence to use it.

However, he claims that the benefits should not be limited to those classed as sophisticated investors or high net worth.

"At InvestingZone, we have gone to great efforts to make sure that the risks inherent in early stage investments are clearly presented on our platform and that only investors who understand those risks are admitted.

Tom Ball, founder of NearDesk, a web business that enables people to rent desk space by the hour, was approached by an angel wanting to invest 50,000, who ended up investing through the company's 84,500 crowdfunding campaign on Seedrs.

"Having the crowd attracted the angel and gave him confidence," says Mr Ball. "Seeing a large amount go in gave the crowd confidence, so the two worked well together."

Another keen supporter of crowdfunding is Caspar Craven, co-founder of business analytics provider Trovus. "We needed more working capital earlier this year [and] the offer from our bank frankly didn't make sense for us," he says.

"We turned to crowdfunding and raised all we needed within one hour. It was unbelievably quick and easy."

The growth generated by the investment round has meant that Trovus is looking at further financing rounds using crowdfunding platforms, adds Mr Craven.

"I'm on a mission now to share with fellow entrepreneurs how crowdfunding is a game changer for the entrepreneur."

David Cross, an FCA spokesman, says the proposed rules would not prevent people from putting money into their family members' start-ups on a one-to-one basis, but would limit the potential risks to individuals of losing money.

"I understand Mr Moul-ton's criticisms, however, there is nothing in the example he cites stopping kin from investing in their family member's venture," Mr Cross explains, adding that the FCA's proposed rules related to the promotion of unlisted shares through a crowdfunding platform.

"We want to make sure that those who are investing in quite high risk equities have the ability to either have access to advice or are sophisticated investors and have a limit on how much they could potentially lose," he adds.

U.S. Call Centers Dial Up Employee Service --- PNC Ditches Beige Cubicles in Leased Office Space for Chandeliers and Marble Columns in Former Lord & Taylor Store

PITTSBURGH -- Call-center workers often toil in dreary offices, sometimes in dying strip malls or converted warehouses.

In the heart of downtown Pittsburgh, though, call-center employees of PNC Financial Services Group Inc. this month moved into luxurious space inside a six-story granite building that once housed Mellon National Bank and later served as a Lord & Taylor department store.

The newly renovated Classical building features the original marble columns, with ceilings as high as 32 feet and antique bronze chandeliers updated with LED lighting.

The new space is so bright and white that "it feels like we're in the Apple Store," said Shawn Buys, one of about 700 PNC employees working in the 90-year-old building across from Mellon Square Park.

Some other employers also are giving call-center workers more pleasant quarters.

At an eBay Inc. call center in Draper, Utah, the company has provided two basketball courts, indoor bicycle storage and a massage-therapy room, among other amenities.

Zappos, an online shoe and clothing retailer owned by Amazon.com Inc., houses call-center workers in its new downtown Las Vegas headquarters, where they get the same types of desks and chairs as executives and have access to a rooftop deck, said Rob Siefker, director of Zappos' "customer loyalty team."

Upgrading call-center workspaces makes economic sense, said Matthew Dixon, an executive director at Corporate Executive Board Co., a research and advisory company based in Arlington, Va., that did a recent study of call centers. They tend to handle more complex customer questions and problems than they did years ago, Mr. Dixon said. Customers get basic information from websites, and that leaves the more complicated matters for the call centers.

Companies also are striving to avoid being "blasted on Facebook or Twitter" for lousy service, Mr. Dixon said. As a result, they are making more efforts to recruit and retain high-quality call-center people. Those efforts sometimes include offering something more than "nondescript buildings in nondescript locations," he said.

Despite the offshoring of some call centers, it is still a big business in the U.S. As of last year, about two million Americans worked as customer-service representatives, many of them in call centers, according to the Labor Department. That was up 6% from a decade before. About 68% of those workers are women.

"Companies are more likely to keep call-center operations in the U.S. today than they were 10 years ago," said Jeff Lessard, a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield Inc. in New York. Workers have become more available amid a weak job market, and employers like the idea of having more control over their call centers, he said.

New call centers often are being created in small cities with plentiful labor, said Mark Seeley, a Phoenix-based senior managing director in CBRE Group Inc.'s labor analytics group. Because lots of employee parking is needed, empty supermarkets or other retail sites can be good candidates for conversion to call centers, he said.

The PNC workers used to occupy a warren of beige cubicles in leased space in the nearby U.S. Steel Tower. PNC figured it could house them less expensively inside the former Mellon building, which PNC acquired for about $3.8 million last year, while also providing a better working environment.

PNC considered suburban locations for the call center, said Gary Saulson, the banking company's real estate chief. But Mr. Saulson didn't believe PNC could have found a suitable location in the suburbs that would have been cheaper. Another consideration: Any suburban location would have been inconvenient for some of the current employees and might have prompted some to quit.

"There's a huge cost to turnover," Mr. Saulson noted.

After the Lord & Taylor store closed in 2004, the building stood empty for years. "Nobody could figure out what to do with it," Mr. Saulson said. PNC decided it was a bargain, even though it needed heavy renovation.

The building's history is on display. The reception desk is made from a slab of marble once used for writing Mellon Bank checks. Bronze gates that once stood outside the vault are hung on the wall.

Other bits of the bank's past, including velvet-covered railings that once kept customers in line, are scattered around the building.

Lord & Taylor also has left traces, including a brown marble wall in one break area. Outside the basement cafeteria, Mr. Saulson told a visitor: "The floor you're standing on was the Ralph Lauren shop."

Matthew Jeynes finds the team's style has been too popular and they are prepared for underperformance

First State Investments has warned that its successful Asia Pacific and Emerging Market strategies may be set for a period of underperformance.

The funds, managed by the First State Stewart team, have significantly outperformed their peers and indices for many years, but Stuart Paul, managing partner at First State, has warned that the run may come to an end.

"We are not market timers but the fact is that our style has been too popular for too long and we are overdue a period of underperformance," he said during a client webcast.

The style of the Stewart team is to invest in so-called "quality" stocks, which tend to be defensive companies with high recurring cash flows and strong management.

Historically these stocks would be expected to underperform when the overall market rises, as market rallies tend to favour cyclical or deep-value stocks.

However, quality defensive companies outperformed, in Asia and emerging markets as well as the developed world, in 2012 and early 2013, as investors sold out of bonds but were not bullish enough to buy cyclical companies .

The result is that quality stocks have reached high valuations. This has led Tom Prew, co-manager of the Global Emerging Markets Leaders fund with Jonathan Asante, and Alistair Thompson, co-manager of the 6.5bn Asia Pacific Leaders fund with Angus Tulloch, to warn of expensive valuations on the stocks in their funds in recent weeks.

The range also includes a selection of single-country Asian and emerging market funds, alongside Mr Asante's Worldwide Equity fund and David Gait's Sustainability funds.

Mr Paul says the "comments from Tom and Alistair on valuations ring true across the team and we are acutely aware that we are due for a difficult environment at some point".

He says the team invests with this knowledge in mind and they were "well prepared for it".

The funds have become favourites among investors for their ability to outperform in the long run.

Adrian Lowcock, senior investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, says his analysis showed Mr Tulloch had outperformed the MSCI Asia Pacific ex Japan index by 5.4 per cent a year since 1988, and the emerging market fund had consistently been in the top quartile of its sector since launch.

Performance in the short term has been less impressive though, with both funds in the bottom quartile of their respective sectors in the past three months, according to FE Analytics.

The managers have made slight moves to try and address this by purchasing some more cyclical stocks. Mr Thompson took the Asia Pacific Leaders fund's India weighting to its highest level in more than a decade after buying into Titan, a jewellery firm.

Experts agree that the First State teams' style could be set for a tough period, especially if there is an economic recovery, which would lead to a value-led stock market rally.

Gavin Haynes, managing director of Whitechurch Securities, says investors in recent years had "really favoured" the stocks First State invests in.

He says it is "refreshing" to hear such a "candid claim" from a fund manager, but adds it was easier for First State to make such statements because "a number of the funds were soft closed and others were reaching capacity".

An "inspirational" account of the rise of Amazon and Jeff Bezos, the ecommerce group's founder, has won this year's Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.

The Everything Store by journalist Brad Stone was awarded the 30,000 prize for the year's "most compelling and enjoyable" business book at a ceremony in London on Monday.

The award judges' decision is at odds with the views of Mr Bezos's wife, MacKenzie, who posted her own critical review of the book on Amazon, awarding it a single star out of a possible five. But Vindi Banga, a partner at Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and a member of the judging panel, described The Everything Store as "inspirational" for young entrepreneurs and said it was "full of management lessons".

Monday's final judging session saw panellists continue the robust debate they started at the meeting to select six finalists in September. They eventually narrowed the shortlist down to three titles - including Anita Raghavan's The Billionaire's Apprentice, about the Galleon insider trading scandal, and The Alchemists, Neil Irwin's analysis of how UK, US and European central bankers handled the crisis - before finally selecting The Everything Store.

The winner, published last month by Little, Brown in the US and Transworld/Bantam Press in the UK, was described by Lionel Barber, the FT's editor and chairman of the judging panel, as a "must-read for disrupters around the world". Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said the book was "a provocative take" on Amazon's transformation of the publishing, consumer electronics and cloud computing industries.

Mr Stone's book interweaves the story of Amazon with that of Mr Bezos, who gave up his job with a Wall Street hedge fund to exploit the potential of the internet. He started with the online sale of books, but expanded the range to turn Amazon into the web equivalent of a department store. "I thought he was a little crazy," says one early employee of the company quoted in the book, which describe Mr Bezos's frugality, obsessive attention to detail and desire for long-term success rather than short-term profit.

The FT and Goldman Sachs award started in 2005 and is given annually to the book that provides "the most compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues". Last year's winner was Private Empire , about ExxonMobil, by Steve Coll, who was on the 2013 judging panel.

The other shortlisted titles this year were Making It Happen by Iain Martin, about the rise and fall of Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, Viktor Mayer-Schnberger and Kenneth Cukier's Big Data, on the benefits and challenges of the information revolution, and Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg's manifesto for women to advance in the workplace. Each of the runners-up will receive 10,000.

Europe Agrees on Rules for Insurers --- Companies Welcome Solvency II Regulations; Critics Say Sweeping Changes Were Lost to Government Pressure

LONDON -- European insurance companies celebrated a partial victory over regulators as the EU agreed on new rules for the world's largest insurance market after more than a decade of haggling.

The rules, known widely as "Solvency II," were approved late Wednesday night in Brussels, and appeared to satisfy industry demands in softening the requirement to hold more capital against potential losses in their businesses, and in easing access to fast-growing emerging markets and to North America.

The deal was welcomed by insurance companies and industry associations.

"We welcome the fact that there was an agreement," the German reinsurance giant Munich Re said. "The compromise is an appropriate balance between consumers, business and the insurers in member states."

However, the deal drew criticism from some quarters for caving in to pressure from national governments on behalf of their domestic lobbies. Proposals for more sweeping and harmonized powers for the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority were largely diluted.

"Years of intensive lobbying have paid off for the insurance companies of the largest member states," said Sven Giegold, who coordinated the work of Green parties in the European Parliament on the directive. "Solvency II looks now like a grab bag of goodies for each national industry."

Mr. Giegold said that the deal relieved the insurance industry of the need to hold nearly 280 billion euros ($377.6 billion) in extra capital to protect themselves against future losses, and gave them too much freedom to distribute profits in the meantime.

Solvency II aims, broadly, to do for insurance companies what the Basel accords have done for banks: requiring them to hold more capital and improve their accounting, taking more-realistic and up-to-date views of their liabilities.

It also would require insurers to take into account the effect of financial market volatility. Life-insurance companies, in particular, are locked into liabilities stretching decades into the future, which the weaker ones may not be able to meet if interest rates stay in the trough they fell into after the 2008 financial crisis.

The industry has argued constantly that the initial proposals put too much emphasis on demanding protection against short-term market volatility, and that excessive capital requirements would depress profitability and returns to policyholders.

Despite the softer rules, the cost and complexity of the new regulations remain likely to weigh on insurers' profits, pushing up costs and depressing returns on the trillions of euros tied up in long-term savings products across Europe.

Paul Clarke, head of global insurance regulation at consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that top industry executives felt that reporting and disclosure requirements would be the most challenging part of implementing the rules.

David Simmons, managing director of analytics at reinsurance broker Willis Re, said many small insurers across Europe, particularly mutual insurers, will be hit particularly hard by Solvency II. He said the new regulation may penalize them for a lack of diversification, and they have only limited capacity to raise more capital. They also may not have the resources to pay for the more sophisticated risk management and reporting that Solvency II will require.

Parliament will schedule a vote on the directive in the new year before being dissolved for elections. The law will come into force Jan. 1, 2016.

The European Commission, which is the EU's executive arm, had initially trumpeted Solvency as a global standard for modernizing the insurance industry. However, the initial proposals were sidelined by the financial crisis, and international interest has waned as the EU has wrangled over the details.

If the proposals had been in place in one of their earliest forms in 2008, the industry would have been forced into large fire sales of assets at the bottom of a market, said Paul Fulcher, managing director for asset-liability management structuring at Nomura in London. Since then, he said, "it's become like one of those miniseries, like 'Lost' or 'Homeland,' that start with a bang and a clearly defined narrative arc but that gradually wear out their welcome as yet another series is commissioned."

The compromise has been taking shape throughout this year. Lobbyists from insurance industries in Germany and the U.K. both secured major concessions in the areas most important to them.

The new rules on reporting will be phased in over 16 years, shielding existing German life-insurance products from mark-to-market accounting.

The U.K., meanwhile, has ensured that the new rules won't overburden the annuity business, which is the most popular method in the U.K. for guaranteeing retirement income.

Property: Moody's Adds WTC Space

Moody's Corp., the anchor tenant of the first tower to be rebuilt in Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is expanding again downtown.

The company, which includes both the credit-rating unit and an analytics arm, is taking the top three floors of 7 World Trade Center, a 52-story building developed by Larry Silverstein that was the first to replace those destroyed by the 9/11 attacks.

When it opened about seven years ago, some predicted the building would struggle to attract large tenants, but leases by Moody's, which agreed to occupy a third of the tower, and music licensing company BMI provided early evidence the area could bounce back.

Moody's is subleasing its 129,000-square-foot space from Germany's Portigon Financial Services, which emerged from WestLB after the company underwent a restructuring a couple of years ago. It leased the space in 2008.

Portigon, a portfolio-services provider, is currently undergoing a restructuring and has reduced both administrative and personnel expenses by about a third, according to an August news release. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.

The asking rent for the space was $65 a square foot, significantly higher than the average asking rent for top space in Lower Manhattan, which is nearly $46 a square foot, according to Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.

Moody's has expanded in 7 World Trade Center, even as many financial-services companies cut back on space during the recession. It first leased about 580,000 square feet in 2006 and added about 80,000 square feet of expansion space in 2007.

"It's nice to see a downtown tenant expanding. You see so much talk about companies compressing, that it's good to see one going the other way," said Mark Weiss, a broker at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, who represented Portigon.

A spokesman for Moody's said it has seen strong market demand for its research, ratings and analytical products in recent years. "We've secured additional space at 7 World Trade Center to support our needs while remaining committed to downtown," he said.

Cushman & Wakefield, which represented Moody's, declined to comment.

COMMENT
Business leaders must take a stand on mental health

The fact that we only talk about workplace stress when there is a high-profile case of mental ill-health is a problem. Such cases seem to be occurring more frequently, or at least more publicly. Sir Hector Sants , for example, the former head of the UK financial regulator, has stepped down from a senior role at Barclays after last month's announcement that he was taking leave because of "exhaustion and stress". Antnio Horta-Osrio , chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, two years ago took a leave of absence on doctors' advice, returning in early 2012. Carsten Schloter , chief executive of Swisscom, Switzerland's biggest telecoms company, is presumed to have committed suicide in July, having talked publicly about the relentless demands of the job. The following month, Pierre Wauthier , chief financial officer of Zurich Insurance, committed suicide, blaming a difficult work relationship.

These events vary from deeply unpleasant for the individual affected to shocking and tragic for them and their friends, families and colleagues. They also bring to the surface how ill-prepared society is to deal with mental health, and highlight the lack of understanding of this widespread family of diseases - now among the world's most prevalent illnesses.

I am no expert - beyond my own first-hand knowledge of depression: I "came out" (tellingly, this is the term that tends to be used) in the 1990s when I agreed to be featured in publicity for a government mental health programme. I now chair a charity, MQ, which aims to become the leading fundraiser for focused research so badly needed in this field. But I know enough to know this is an area where business can and should also take a lead.

This is not because of the role of the workplace as an incubator of stress: there is no direct link between stress and mental illness, still less suicide. Many people thrive on stress - and almost all survive it. Stress can provoke an underlying predisposition to mental ill health, but one cannot elide the two. They are not two sides of the same coin.

Indeed, mental illness is an illness, just like hypertension. That may sound semantic but it is important. It helps sufferers counter the (understandable) impulse to think: "I must snap out of it." That will not lead them to good health, any more than it would for blood pressure. Recognising these illnesses as illnesses will help sufferers and those around them take them seriously.

The most common question I heard after revealing my condition was: "Should I come out?" My reply was "no". There is no virtue in doing so if it harms your life. We must work to make it acceptable - to reduce the number of people who feel they must hide, freeing them to understand their illness and seek treatment.

And this is why business leaders must take the lead. Many mentally unwell people refuse either to accept treatment or to discuss their illness for fear of impairing their careers. If chief executives make clear that they expect colleagues with such problems to come forward, that it will not harm their prospects and that their illness is like any other, it will help.

This would push at an open door. This year, with Gavin Barwell, a Conservative MP, I took the Mental Health (Discrimination) Bill through parliament. It went through with scarcely any negative public reaction, building on the brave work of people such as Stephen Fry in describing their own illness.

But removing stigma goes only so far. We need better treatment. The clinical outlook for sufferers is less than satisfactory: drugs and psychological treatments work, but not for all people and not all the time. Suicide has become a global health crisis - we are living in an age where it is a leading cause of mortality among people aged 15-44. Disability and premature death because of mental ill-health are not caused only by societal issues; a big obstacle to progress is how little we understand of how the brain works.

But this, too, is changing. Genetic sequencing and MRI scanning allow us better insight into brain function and to spot patterns that indicate why some are unwell and others are not. The analysis of big data sets from such studies is the new frontier in the understanding of mental ill- health. MQ has been established to aid and abet this process.

Virtually everyone reading this will have been touched by mental ill-health, either personally or in their family. To anyone reading this in a position of authority in business - or indeed in any employing situation - I send the following plea. Please be aware that business has a vital role in creating widespread acceptance of mental ill-health as a "normal", so that tragic deaths such as those of Schloter and Wauthier become much rarer events.

The writer is chairman of MQ Transforming Mental Health and an independent member of the House of Lords

World News: Deflation Threat Emerges In More European Nations

LONDON -- A slowdown in inflation in Europe is being felt outside the 17 nations that use the euro, adding to fears that the wider region could be in danger of entering a damaging and prolonged period of falling prices.

Figures from Sweden and Hungary, which don't use the euro, showed already low inflationary pressures weakened further in October. The development -- while echoing a dramatic cooling in inflation in the euro zone -- also underlines the potential broader effects of anemic world demand.

Even the U.K., which has grappled with much higher rates of inflation than its neighbors for most of the past five years, appears to be experiencing at least a temporary respite from rapid price increases, data showed.

"It's a global phenomenon. Inflation is very low and getting lower with each passing day," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics, adding, "This is a significant threat to global fiscal sustainability and the global economic recovery."

Europe's low inflation comes as policy makers in Japan appear finally to be making some progress in tackling the outright deflation that has persisted there for more than a decade.

Tuesday's figures from Sweden and Hungary come less than two weeks after the European Union's statistics agency recorded a sharp drop in the annual rate of inflation in the euro zone to just 0.7% from 1.1% in September, taking it further below the European Central Bank's target of just under 2%.

That prompted a quick response from the ECB, which cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25% last week. Fresh price data Tuesday from euro-zone members Germany, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal underscored the weakness of inflation across the currency union.

The latest figures indicate that falling inflation rates are a broader issue for economies throughout Europe, many of which are struggling to return to growth.

The slowdown in inflation last month in many cases reflected, at least in part, a fall in domestic fuel costs triggered by lower oil prices on international markets. Weak consumer demand and stubbornly high unemployment are also contributing.

Although the slowdown in inflation, if sustained, should provide the region's central banks with extra time to support their economies with low interest rates and other easy-money policies, it also raises the specter of deflation -- a sustained fall in prices that can play havoc with public and private efforts to repay debts and risks bringing consumer spending to a halt.

ECB executive board member Joerg Asmussen, in an interview published by German newspaper Neue Osnabreucker Zeitung Tuesday, said policy makers may have go beyond last week's surprise rate cut and take other radical steps to support the euro-zone economy, including charging banks to park their cash. He told the newspaper that there was no question that the cut was needed to keep inflation closer to its desired range.

In Sweden, a fall in annual inflation is likely to put pressure on Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, to follow the ECB in cutting its benchmark interest rate, economists said. The official statistics agency Tuesday showed Sweden's consumer-price index fell 0.1% on the year in October, the second annual fall in inflation this year.

In Hungary, the annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 0.9% in October, the lowest level since 1974, according to official data. That makes further rate cuts from the National Bank of Hungary's Monetary Policy Council more likely. The key rate is now at 3.4%.

Meanwhile, in the U.K., the Office for National Statistics said annual inflation fell to 2.2% in October from 2.7% in September. The slowdown takes the annual rate to a level last seen in the U.K. in September 2012. Recently announced increases in home energy prices make it unlikely the inflation rate will fall further soon.

The first ObamaCare enrollment numbers were coming out, and the guys at TalkingPointsMemo.com were expecting bad news--"bad" in this case meaning very small numbers, as TPM is pro-ObamaCare. So early this morning the site's Dylan Scott published "Your Guide to Understanding the Obamacare Enrollment Numbers."

"The administration was expecting 500,000 enrollments in October," Scott notes. "For context ... that was the baseline before the rollout went awry."

What was the baseline after? "Obamacare supporters say that freak-out threshold doesn't exist," Scott helpfully explains. He quotes one expert who pretty much says it all: "'I think there's no number that's too low,' Tim Jost, a Washington and Lee law professor and supporter of the law, told TPM. 'The main thing that we're going to learn is that the website isn't working.'"

Oh, so that's all. Whew!

As low as supporters were setting expectations, though, the administration still felt obliged to inflate the numbers. The Wall Street Journal reports that "fewer than 50,000 people had successfully navigated the troubled federal health-care website and enrolled in private insurance plans as of last week."

 Corbis Another satisfied ObamaCare customer.

How many fewer is anybody's guess, because, as the Washington Post's Sarah Kliff reported yesterday, the Obama administration isn't limiting its count of enrollees to people who have actually enrolled in a health-insurance plan. Instead, "it will use a more expansive definition." Get ready for it: "It will count people who have purchased a plan as well as those who have a plan sitting in their online shopping cart but have not yet paid."

What if Amazon.com counted its revenues that way in reports to investors? One suspects the Securities and Exchange Commission would not approve.

Oh well, at least the state exchanges are doing fine, right? Well, no. Reuters reports that ObamaCare "has reached only about 3 percent of its enrollment target for 2014 in 12 U.S. states" whose exchanges "are mostly working smoothly." Avalere Health, the consulting firm that conducted the study, blamed George W. Bu--we mean Barack Obama: "With enrollment in the federal HealthCare.gov website serving 36 states stalled by technical failures, the weak sign-ups for functioning insurance exchanges could be due to the administration's difficulty to promote the program as a success, Avalere said."

Again, that's in states where the websites are supposedly functional. So maybe we've learned something more than that the website isn't working.

And even states with functional websites have serious problems. The Hill, citing the Avalere study, reports that "about 8,000 Washington state residents were told they qualified for more generous tax subsidies than they would actually receive when they enrolled for ObamaCare via their state's online marketplace." This "technical glitch"--that word apparently hasn't quite been banished from the language yet--"led many enrollees in the Washington exchange to select generous insurance plans they likely wouldn't be able to afford once their subsidies are reduced."

Most astonishing, the 8,000 botched Evergreen State applications--which require complete do-overs by the applicants--represent more than 15% of the total enrollment Avalere found in the 12 state exchanges it studied.

The Avalere study excludes California, "which has only released the number of started applications." The press release doesn't say if it includes Oregon, but that actually doesn't affect the result one way or another. The Beaver State's website is completely nonfunctional, so that its total enrollment is zero, zip, zilch, nada, nil, naught--in other words, a big goose egg.

The Associated Press has one of the all-time great look-on-the-sunny-side quotes, from Amy Fauver, chief communications officer for Cover Oregon: "We stuck to the vision, and we're experiencing now the bumps that go along with having a grand vision that doesn't work out exactly the way you hope it will."

If she were good at math, she might have added that Cover Oregon's enrollment has been growing exponentially.

Another state excluded from the Avalere study is Massachusetts. You might think that's because Massachusettsans are old pros at running a health-insurance exchange, having set one up way back in 2006 after Mitt Romney's reform. But no. As the Boston Herald reports, the old, functional Commonwealth Connector had to be scrapped and replaced with an ObamaCare-compliant exchange.

The new Massachusetts Health Connector is beset with "embarrassing glitches," the Herald reports, and little wonder, since the state hired CGI Group, the same Canadian firm that designed the beglitched federal exchange. Result: "Only 549 applicants--out of the 150,000 Bay Staters forced to switch their health plans to comply with Obamacare rules--are poised to receive insurance."

"Poised" turns out to be the local dialect for what the Obama administration calls "enrolled"; in Massachusetts, at least, the latter word retains its earlier meaning. "No, nobody's enrolled," Scott Devonshire, the exchange's chief information officer, told the Herald, "because enrollment ... doesn't happen until a [health plan] carrier receives payment. It's a semantics issue, I guess."

Which seems like a perfect segue to Bill Clinton. The Weekly Standard's Daniel Halper notes that the 42nd president said in a recent interview that Obama ought to keep his most infamous promise: "I personally believe, even if it takes a change to the law, the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got." As we noted Friday, it's highly unlikely that is even possible. But maybe they can compromise and put your old plan in a shopping cart.

Something Has to Give In a Forbes.com column, conservative think-tanker Steven Hayward offers a bold prediction: "Even if HealthCare.gov is fixed by the end of the month (unlikely), Obamacare is going to be repealed well in advance of next year's election." We know, but hear him out:

If the website continues to fail, the push for repeal--from endangered Democrats--will occur very rapidly. The website is a sideshow: the real action is the number of people and businesses who are losing their health plans or having to pay a lot more. Fixing the website will only delay the inevitable....

Senate Democrats endangered for re-election will lead the charge for repeal perhaps as soon as January, after they get an earful over the Christmas break. They'll call it "reform," and clothe it in calls for delaying the individual mandate and allowing people and businesses to keep their existing health insurance policies. But it is probably too late to go back in many cases. With the political damage guaranteed to continue, the momentum toward repeal will be unstoppable. Democrats will not want to face the voters next November with the albatross of Obamacare.

Hayward goes on to offer some tips to Republicans about how to handle the prospective Democratic repeal push (let the Senate go first) as well as dangers to avoid (leaving in place the Medicaid expansion). But is his bold prediction plausible?

We'd say, very tentatively, yes--which is to say you could get us to take a bet on his proposition, but you'd have to give us pretty steep odds.

What does seem clear is that the Democrats and especially the administration are in a political holding pattern, having bought some time by setting the Nov.30 deadline for resolving the technical problems. That suggests that on Dec.1--or perhaps a few days earlier, if it is acknowledged early the deadline won't be met--the Democratic politics of ObamaCare will get a lot less stable and more interesting.

Bottom Stories of the Day

Boehner the Oracle Harold Pollack, a professor of "social service administration," has a piece at The Nation's website arguing that ObamaCare's failure is somehow going to persuade Republicans to get behind the law. It's an odd and convoluted argument, but it includes this admission:

Almost everyone expected the rollout to include some embarrassing glitches. But few people expected the deep bureaucratic failure that actually occurred.

Actually, though, one man who did expect deep bureaucratic failure is now speaker of the House. A June 2009 DailyKos.com post quotes John Boehner:

"I'm opposed to a government option, period. Listen, if you like going to the DMV, and you think they do a great job, or if you like going to the post office and think it's the most efficient thing you have run into, then you will love the government-run health care system that they're proposing, because that's basically what you're going to have."

The DailyKos poster, who goes by the handle "citisven," proceeds to defend the U.S. Postal Service and the DMV.

Come to think of it, citisven has a point. We do business occasionally with both the Postal Service and the (New York) DMV, and neither of them is nearly as nightmarish as ObamaCare.

KPMG, the giant professional services company, will today launch its first investment fund as it branches out into new areas in a sign of the big changes afoot in the financial services industry.

The move is significant as the fund will invest in data and analytics businesses, which are increasingly popular with investors as technology is considered a growth area that should benefit from economic recovery.

The group, one of the big four professional services companies employing 152,000 people around the world in 156 countries and with combined revenues of $23bn, is creating KPMG Capital, a new wholly owned fund.

Mark Toon, chief executive of the new fund, said: "With more data produced and stored in the last two years than in the rest of human history, many businesses are looking for strategic and practical solutions to manage the volume, velocity and variety of this data revolution."

KPMG, which is a tax, auditing and advisory firm, has decided to diversify to use its expertise around the world to build up a business in data and analytics. The fund will launch with about $100m.

It will invest primarily in data and analytics businesses via strategic acquisitions, tech-nology partnerships and other data and analytics capabilities.

The move follows last month's announcement by Deloitte, another big four professional services firm, that it is buying Seattle-based social media marketing agency Banyan Branch for an undisclosed sum.

Deloitte's acquisition is another example of how these big groups are looking to take advantage of the rapid changes in technology, social media and data provision.

The KPMG fund will have its headquarters in London and invest globally. It aims to invest in a number of critical business areas including enhancing business flexibility; finance; risk, regulation and compliance; improving workforce productivity; and customer and revenue growth.

The new fund will also coinvest, sponsor and partner other groups at early stages with the aim to encourage entrepreneurs to be bold, focusing on growth sectors such as healthcare, financial services, energy and telecommunications.

The fund will not be open to third-party investment.

Europe learns from CFTC on trade reporting

A powerful body overseeing one of the world's main derivatives markets has ruled that an important piece of legislation should be mandatory in months, in spite of industry warnings about difficulties in implementation.

This was not the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its rulings over the summer as it introduced swap execution facilities (Sefs); instead this was the European Commission last week forcing mandatory reporting of all derivatives trades by mid-February.

The European Securities and Markets Authority, the pan-European regulator, had been pushing for a delay until January 2015, arguing about the onerous technical complexity.

Now hopes of an extension have been squashed, and the race is on to comply. To help the process along, Esma also approved its first trade repositories.

Nevertheless, the European approach seems remarkably similar to the hardline stance chairman Gary Gensler at the CFTC took as the industry got into a panic about issues such as "certainty of clearing" on Sefs.

Already the first mutterings about trade reporting have been heard. Apparently, it's going to be "hell"; "there are significant risks to getting it wrong"; "the extent of the data required is troubling"; "a lot of unknowns about how to meet one's obligations"; and "a mammoth onboarding effort from the repositories".

As with Sefs, some of the grievances have merit. Unlike the US, Europe has mandated that both listed derivatives and OTC derivatives be reported, as well as both sides of the trade. Not only that but the obligation will apply to derivatives entered into on August 16 2012. Trades outstanding on that day, even if they have since been closed, are also captured.

Turning it into a reality is a slightly simpler process for the OTC markets (assuming that what regulators ask for is clear and precise) since standards have never existed before. As an electronic market, listed derivatives already have competing standards and protocols.

Some argue that operators of repositories will benefit commercially from the changes. That remains to be seen. Market participants should reflect on the life of Markit's BOAT reporting service. BOAT was created by a consortium of banks to prevent exchanges from charging too much to report equities trades, as required by the 2007 Mifid directive, then sold to Markit a year later. Now Markit, one of the best in the business at data analytics, is closing the service having candidly admitted hopes did not match reality.

But these concerns miss the point. The financial services industry is unlikely ever to agree there will be a good time to introduce rules. The time for debating the wisdom of the policy is past. At this stage it is better to have something and iron out the flaws. The experience of the CFTC and Sefs appear to bear this out. The regulator won no points for subtlety; problems emerged. However, they are being worked through.

Apart from learning a trick about dealing with the financial services industry from departing chairman Mr Gensler, the commission's intervention is also much needed.

Creating a record of all derivatives trades was a key part of the G20 agreement of Pittsburgh in 2009 to reform the industry. The deadline for reform was 11 months ago and the US is pressing ahead. Europe, the other key global derivatives market, could ill-afford delays. Instead, the three-month timescale has given them time to catch up.

In coming months the CFTC will be changing three of its five commissioners, including Mr Gensler, and there may be some slowdown while the new faces get their feet under the table.

By the time the two sides hit their final negotiations on the arcane but critical details around definitions of legal extraterritoriality and mutual recognition, Europe may have also concluded its trialogue on the review of Mifid.

Consequently it may have a far clearer idea what it wants, or won't accept. That clarity can only be beneficial for all.

Turning "big data" into smarter investment decisions has become an acute challenge for asset managers and owners facing rapid changes in financial markets.

Nine out of 10 institutional investors view data and analytics as a key strategic priority. But in spite of ramping up their investments in data technologies and platforms, less than a third currently gain any competitive advantage from their data and analytics capabilities, according to a survey of 400 asset managers and owners conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit on behalf of State Street.

"The ability to aggregate, analyse and transform data has become key to institutional investors ability to compete," said Jeff Conway, the head of State Street's Global Exchange business.

Data accuracy was cited as the top challenge in the survey. Institutional investors can draw on hundreds of external data sources and 42 per cent of those surveyed noted a lack of data integration facilities. A third also complained about high pricing and the lack of timeliness in external data.

State Street's research also showed that institutional investors divided into data leaders and laggards.

Leaders felt their data capabilities helped them better manage risks across multi-asset portfolios and to keep pace with the evolving demand of regulators and compliance.

Effective data management was also seen by leaders as essential to developing profitable investment strategies and acting on them in real time.

Investors, said Mr Conway, that developed the right data tools and strategies would be rewarded with better insights, improved performance measurement and a deeper capacity to understand risk across their global activities.

Three-quarters of all those surveyed said they planned to spend more on portfolio optimisation tools while 86 per cent cited order and execution management systems as their top priority.

"Without the ability to deploy data to solve a problem, it is just noise," warned Mr Conway.

How Teen Nick D'Aloisio Has Changed the Way We Read; When a Hong Kong billionaire emailed a London tech startup to inquire about investing, he didn't realize its entire workforce consisted of a single kid working in his bedroom.

UPON HEARING, IN MARCH of this year, reports that a 17-year-old schoolboy had sold a piece of software to Yahoo! for $30 million, you might well have entertained a few preconceived notions about what sort of child this must be.A geeky specimen, no doubt. A savant with zero interests outside writing lines of code. A twitchy creature, prone to mumbling, averse to eye contact.

Thus it's rather a shock when you first encounter Nick D'Aloisio striding into London's Bar Boulud restaurant, firmly shaking hands and proceeding to outline his entrepreneurial vision. To imagine him in person, picture a Silicon Valley CEO blessed with an easy manner and 97th percentile media skills. Picture a guy who can confidently expound (while maintaining steady eye contact) on topics ranging from Noam Chomsky's theories to the science of neural networks to the immigrant mind-set to the Buddhist concept of jnana. And now picture this fellow trapped inside the gangly body of a British teen who might easily be mistaken for a member of the pop boy band One Direction clad in a hipster T-shirt beneath a fitted blazer, hair swooping over his forehead, taking bites of a cheeseburger between bold pronouncements.

Photography by David Bailey GOING MOBILE | D'Aloisio, who turns 18 this month, is the mastermind behind Summly, a summarization app that sold to Yahoo! earlier this year for a reported $30 million.

The app D'Aloisio designed, Summly, compresses long pieces of text into a few representative sentences. When he released an early iteration, tech observers realized that an app that could deliver brief, accurate summaries would be hugely valuable in a world where we read everything from news stories to corporate reports on our phones, on the go. The app attracted the interest of investors around the world, ranging from Hollywood celebrities to Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, the wealthiest man in Asia. 

In 2011, at age 15, D'Aloisio closed a seed round of funding from Li Ka-shing. A year later, Summly launched, and within a month it had attracted 500,000 users and became the number-one news app in 28 countries. The Yahoo! sale capped off a remarkable run for someone not yet out of high school. But it's not mere technological savvy that sets D'Aloisio apart. Since long before he could shave, he has been driven by an intense curiosity and a desire to make some sort of mark on the tech world. Not just to create but to build and, yes, to monetize.

He's lately begun taking meetings with the likes of Marissa Mayer and Rupert Murdoch. (Murdoch is chairman of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal.) Though D'Aloisio's net worth at this point is merely eye-popping, not obscene, in his own youthful way he seems every bit as formidable as relative gray-hairs like 27-year-old Tumblr founder David Karp or 29-year-old Facebook wunderkind Mark Zuckerberg. "He captivates a room," says Joshua Kushner, founder of Thrive Capital, an early backer of Summly. "He is incredibly self-aware for his age."

D'ALOISIO BEGAN designing iPhone apps nearly the moment the app store opened in 2008. He was 12 years old, working on a Mac in his bedroom in the London district of Wimbledon. Because he was too young, he signed up for the Apple developer's license using his father's name. He'd taken no formal computer science classes at school, and neither of his parents (Diana and Lou, a lawyer and a business executive, respectively) knew much about tech. Instead, he learned how to program almost entirely by himself, scouring websites and watching instructional videos.

His first coding effort resulted in an app that played audio snippets from speeches by his idol, Steve Jobs, whose unauthorized biography he'd recently devoured. "It was rejected by Apple for every reason," D'Aloisio says now, laughing. "Copyrighted audio, poor functionality, too simple." Another early design allowed users to touch a picture of wood, producing a knocking sound. A third transformed a smartphone screen into a treadmill for your fingers. That one earned about $120 in sales on its first day.

When he wasn't programming or doing schoolwork, D'Aloisio began to fill his spare time reading about natural language processing. He'd studied languages as diverse as Latin and Mandarin, and became fascinated by concepts like grammatical frameworks, morpheme parsing and the 1960s work of the linguist Richard Montague. "He's my favorite," D'Aloisio enthuses. "He theorized that natural language could be described like a syntactical programming language."

As he scanned the Internet for knowledge, D'Aloisio decided that what he really needed was a better way to determine, at a glance, what was worth reading. He envisioned a summarization tool that used language theory to give a meaningful synopsis in fewer than 400 characters.

"There are two ways of doing natural language processing: statistical or semantic," D'Aloisio explains. A semantic system attempts to figure out the actual meaning of a text and translate it succinctly.A statistical system the type D'Aloisio used for Summly doesn't bother with that; it keeps phrases and sentences intact and figures out how to pick a few that best encapsulate the entire work. "It ranks and classifies each sentence, or phrase, as a candidate for inclusion in the summary. It's very mathematical. It looks at frequencies and distributions, but not at what the words mean."

An early iteration of Summly, called Trimit, was featured in Apple's app store in July 2011 on a list of new and noteworthy offerings. There it was noticed by the influential Silicon Valley blog TechCrunch and quickly came to the attention of an investment group led by Li Ka-shing.When D'Aloisio was approached over email by Li's people at Horizons Ventures, he was only 15 and so far mostly managed to conceal that fact. He'd never met with anyone in the tech world face to face, and the information he'd listed when he registered Trimit spoke only vaguely of a London technology company. It failed to mention that the company's management and technology teams in fact, its entire workforce consisted of a single kid in a suburban bedroom who wasn't yet old enough to drive.

"I thought I was going to sell the app in the Apple store for a pound or two each, and then I'd use the money to buy a new computer," says D'Aloisio. "I'd never had any contact from an investor before. And now here's an email supposedly from a Hong Kong billionaire. It sounded dodgy. I didn't respond the first time. They had to email me again." D'Aloisio was accompanied by his mother and father ("they were a bit bewildered, it was kind of insane") as he took a meeting with Horizons Ventures's representatives in London in August 2011. The meeting ended with D'Aloisio receiving a seed investment of $300,000.

As fall arrived and school began, D'Aloisio felt immense pressure to deliver for his backers. He needed to whip his algorithm into better shape, so he contracted a team of Israeli coders who specialize in natural language processing. Searching on Google, he found and hired a retired professor living in Thailand who'd written seminal books on the topic. "He became our main scientist," says D'Aloisio. "He now works at Yahoo! in the Sunnyvale office."

Meanwhile, he was being ferried around the globe to tech conferences, getting introduced to other potential investors. D'Aloisio made a remarkable impression on everyone he crossed paths with. "He has an eerie maturity," says Andrew Halls, headmaster of the King's College School in Wimbledon, which D'Aloisio has attended since he was 11. "He has an extraordinary articulateness in the face of situations that, for me, even as a 54-year-old, might be terrifying."

"I was blown away by him," Kushner recalls. "The first time I interacted with him was at News Corp, when he was meeting with Murdoch, and I was looped in to provide perspective. Nick described the vision of what he was trying to accomplish. And he was providing insight to Rupert." D'Aloisio's stage presence, coupled with the deep-pocketed credibility brought by Li, attracted a large group of benefactors to Summly, including Ashton Kutcher, Yoko Ono and Stephen Fry.

D'ALOISIO HAS BEEN quoted opining that "time is the new currency." It's the driving notion behind Summly. It's also a strangely wise observation from a 17-year-old. At that age, many of us had more time on our hands than we knew how to fill without plummeting into severe boredom. It's easy to forget conversing over lunch in a London caf or strolling through the Tate Modern that D'Aloisio was born in 1995 and has not yet graduated from high school. Or that he still lives in his childhood bedroom, in a cozy upper-middle-class home. As I chat with his parents, he excuses himself to work on his computer. Slouching down the hall in his stocking feet, hems of his skinny jeans brushing the hallway carpet, it is the most kidlike you will ever see him.

D'Aloisio's parents came to England from Australia. His father, Lou, has worked in commodities for BP and Morgan Stanley, while his mother, Diana, is a corporate lawyer who also serves as her son's contractual representative. They always knew D'Aloisio was an extremely inquisitive child. "But he was our first, so we didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary," says Diana. (D'Aloisio's brother, Matthew, is 14.) They stress that despite his impressive accomplishments, he remains a normal kid. Or at least as normal as a kid can be when he's making offhand references to Markov models and stochastic processes. "He still goes out on weekends, still goes to parties," says Diana. "He's got a girlfriend. All the things you do at 17."

D'Aloisio himself strives to maintain a bubble of normalcy. He dates the same girl he did before the whirlwind hit. And though he's stopped attending school he's too busy to sit in class while overseeing Summly's development he still gets his work from his teachers and meets with them regularly. He cherishes the fact that his circle of friends knows little of his life as a budding industrialist. When I met him, he was about to head to Greece for a weeklong vacation with a pack of high school pals.

For now, D'Aloisio isn't touching the money. "I'm too young to appreciate the value of it," he insists. "I don't have a mortgage, I'm 17. To me, a hundred pounds is a lot. Take that as a benchmark." Though he's not allowed to comment on Summly's sale price, when pressed he allows that he might one day like to deploy his newfound riches as an angel investor. No one around him seems to think there's a danger that the money will ruin him or that he'll be tempted to spend the rest of his life dissipating on a beach. "He's pretty well grounded. You wouldn't believe how frugal he is," says Diane. "He's got a great engine," says Lou. "He won't stop at this."

Perhaps the more interesting question is what drove Yahoo! to shell out that reported $30 million for a single app. To be sure, Summly's text-compression abilities dovetail nicely with Yahoo!'s new focus on mobile utilities. Along with Yahoo!'s $1.1 billion purchase of the blogging service Tumblr and the launch of an acclaimed new weather app, the Summly move marks a commitment to owning the tiny real estate of the smartphone screen and serving advertising to the youthful eyeballs that tend to gravitate to mobile devices.

But there's little doubt this was also an "acqui-hire," in which the person being bought is just as important as the product. D'Aloisio is now working full time in Yahoo!'s London office, and his youth, his energy and his undeniable it-factor have brought the formerly musty tech giant a much-needed injection of cool. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer who lends the company some of her own it-factor praises his "commitment to excellence in design and simplicity" and says she is "inspired by the creativity and tenacity Nick brings to his work."

While D'Aloisio spends 80 percent of his work time retooling and improving Summly (which has already been integrated into Yahoo!'s iPhone app), the other 20 percent is devoted to imagining the expansive challenges he'll take on next. He predicts there will be summarization programs that do for video what Summly does for the written word. He has grand thoughts about using technology to aid learning and would like to help fellow autodidacts while disrupting the old educational models.

As for his own education: He's weighing whether to enroll in university in England or maybe the U.S. to be closer to Silicon Valley. Or perhaps he'll skip college entirely and just focus on his work. "I absolutely want to start another company," he says. "Serial entrepreneurs get addicted to creation. I want to be passionate. I feel really bad when I'm not doing something new."

The Twitter IPO: Seven Ways Marketers Would Fix Twitter --- Ad Executives Point to How the Messaging Service Can Win Them Over, Need for More Information About Its Users

As Twitter Inc. made its stock-market debut, a fundamental question loomed: Can the messaging service turn its army of followers into a moneymaking business?

Although the service and its 140-character messages have become part of popular culture, many marketers still view Twitter as experimental. It doesn't have enough scale for some marketers, and some advertisers want more information about Twitter's users and more proof that ads on the service work.

Over the past year, Twitter has taken steps to be more advertiser friendly, such as adding new services.

"Twitter has made significant improvements in the ability to target specific groups, which has made the platform much more desirable," said Steve Shannon, vice president of marketing at Hyundai Motor America. For example, Mr. Shannon says Twitter has helped them identify consumers who are in the market for a car.

Still, others say the company has to do more. The Wall Street Journal asked seven ad executives for their thoughts on what Twitter can do to be more appealing to marketers.

Unilever

We are fans of Twitter and what it enables us to do. Although we are using Twitter for many of our brands, there are a few things that Twitter could do more of or differently to help advertisers like us. Use research to show that the very high levels of engagement that Twitter commands translate into increased brand equity. We are very encouraged to see them partnering with Datalogix [an ad research company], so we're confident that this is underway, but it is crucial that this link is made, in order to drive more advertisers to invest in the platform.

-- Keith Weed, chief marketing and communications officer at Unilever PLC, chief marketing and communications officer at

LG Electronics

I want to find out if Twitter is a viable ad platform. I want to see if their ad products give us brand favorability and how it drives purchase indicators such as, 'Are you visiting my site?' or, 'Are you engaging with my products?'

We have used Twitter's TV targeting product [which allows marketers to send tweets to consumers that Twitter says have just seen the marketers' TV ads]. It's very promising as a product. I want to see more TV-related ad products and I want them to share analytics. We have a fairly sizable investment in Twitter and we are looking closely at how it performs.

-- Christopher Ray, digital marketing director at LG Electronics USA Inc.

Giant Spoon

Beyond Twitter's Trending Topics service, Twitter needs to help users pinpoint the most interesting and relevant tweets.

Twitter can't let the feed just pass the user by. Currently, the feed is organized around time -- so if you're not checking it frequently -- you could miss something. Twitter needs to organize the content to make it more relevant to the user and give brands large, contextual environments to engage with users. If Twitter could pinpoint these water-cooler moments and align brands, they'll see leaps in advertiser interest and their bottom line.

-- Trevor Guthrie, co-founder of Giant Spoon, a New York marketing firm

Publicis Groupe

I would like to see Twitter make its service more essential to a broader public.

Currently it's too narrow and inside baseball with a small sliver of users making most of the content.

Twitter can do this by improving its search or filters so consumers can better filter the hose of information.

If they broaden usage it will allow advertisers to scale the benefits that Twitter brings to marketing such as reaching people on the go.

It will also make the innovative ad products from Twitter have a big enough impact to matter.

-- Rishad Tobaccowala, chairman of Publicis Groupe SA's digital ad agencies Razorfish and DigitasLBI

Chobani

Chobani currently doesn't buy ads on Twitter but we use the site to push out content and provoke a dialogue with consumers.

Brands have to be careful with what they do on the platform because there is a trust there. If you are not careful and you push out overly commercial messages it could have a bad effect on your brand.

I would like to see less intrusive advertising units that are more organic and relevant to the platform. I would buy those kinds of ads.

-- Peter McGuinness, chief marketing officer of Greek-yogurt-maker Chobani Inc.

WPP

It would be helpful to understand what the usage dynamics of Twitter are: What are active and passive users and what are the demographics of those groups?

Twitter is a cultural phenomena that deserves to be better understood.

When you think about a TV show, you get an audience and you get a profile of that audience.

The same goes for when you buy ads in Vogue -- you get the circulation and the profile of the readers.

-- Rob Norman, global chief digital officer of GroupM, a media buying arm of WPP PLC

Dentsu

Marketers want more ways to target Twitter users. Twitter currently offers enhanced targeting capabilities on its ad products, but not yet for non-promoted content.

The ability to customize messages to consumers based on their location or interests would create a better experience for both marketers and the end user.

-- Sarah Hofstetter, CEO of 360i US, a digital ad firm owned by Denstu Inc.

Worries about outlook knock Experian shares

Shares in Experian, the credit information group, dropped sharply on Wednesday because of some disappointment over its results and fears it had overpaid for a US business.

Experian also announced the acquisition of Passport Health Communications , which provides analytics and software in the US healthcare payments market. The $850m deal will bolster the group in its key US market and extend its drive to expand worldwide.

Experian said the acquisition, its third deal this year, was the company's biggest and one of its most significant as it is in the fast-growing area of US healthcare payments.

A spokesperson for the company said: "This acquisition will be a good driver of growth. The US healthcare payments market is expected to double in size over the next three or four years and this gives us real scale in this area."

But the shares fell more than 7 per cent, sharply underperforming the wider market, as some investors warned that the organic growth at the group was disappointing.

The shares also came under pressure because of the increase in net debt levels, above internal targets, caused by the acquisition of Passport Health Communications .

The company spokesperson, however, insisted the group had always said it would be flexible on net debt levels and was prepared to break internal targets for the right opportunities, which this acquisition provided. The spokesperson stressed the group had not changed its internal targets and expected net debt to fall back over time.

By mid-morning trading in London they were down 90p at 11.73. They have, however, risen 20 per cent since the start of the year, outperforming the wider market by 5 percentage points.

The group reported pre-tax profits of $480m compared with $73m in the same period last year as demand for information on credit and fraud continues to grow. Revenues rose to $2.34bn compared with $2.29bn in the same period in 2012.

However, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the group to "neutral" from "buy". It said this was on valuation grounds and weaker than expected organic growth. The group has focused on acquisitions at the expense of organic growth, say other market participants.

Jefferies, the US group, also downgraded Experian from "buy" to "hold", as it worried about the acquisition of Passport Health Communications . It said that although Experian's results were in line with market expectations, there were some doubts about the cost of the group's latest transaction.

Don Roberts, chief executive, said: "We have delivered another successive half year of good organic revenue growth, with all regions and business lines contributing."

Earnings per share rose sharply to $0.34 US cents compared with $0.07 US cents in the same period in 2012. This enabled the group to announce its first interim dividend of $0.11 US cents per ordinary share, a 7 per cent increase.

Established in 1995, the UK group employs 17,000 people and has operations in 40 countries.

International Property: Montreal: Investor Bets on a Downtown Revival --- A Company Owned by One of Canada's Largest Pension Funds Wants to Expand Montreal's Business Center

For more than two decades, Montreal was one of the sleepiest office markets in Canada, seeing no new private development as cities such as Toronto and energy-rich Calgary added millions of square feet of new space.

Now, as Canadian investors step up real-estate investment throughout the world, a company owned by one of Canada's largest pension funds is looking to shake things up.

Cadillac Fairview Corp., a unit of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, wants to expand the city's business center to the south with a planned 1.9 billion Canadian dollar ($1.82 billion) development next to the Bell Centre, where the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens play. The company earlier this year broke ground on the first building on the 9.2 acre (3.7 hectare) site, named the Deloitte Tower after the professional-services firm that it lured from Montreal's traditional downtown.

Owners of office buildings in Montreal's core dismiss the competitive threat, citing the lack of retail and transportation in the Deloitte Tower area. "I don't think that people who went to that location will be happy," says Bill Tresham, president of global investments at Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., which owns the Place Ville Marie office complex that Deloitte is vacating.

But Cadillac Fairview executives say businesses will be attracted to the tower's modern workspaces, energy efficiency and the civic square and skating rink in the complex modeled on New York's Rockefeller Center. "That's where we feel the growth is," says Sal Iacono, Cadillac's senior vice president for development in Eastern Canada.

Developers in other cities have had mixed results when they have tried to build new business districts to compete with traditional downtowns. London's Canary Wharf development was forced to seek bankruptcy protection in its early years, although it eventually turned into a success. The Fan Pier project in Boston finally has gained traction after years of delay.

The Cadillac Fairview development is partly a sign that Montreal has absorbed a glut of space that has hung over its office market for years. Its third-quarter vacancy rate for top-quality space downtown was 5.4%, compared with 9.4% in the third quarter of 2010, according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc.

But the project also is a sign of the increasing appetite that Canadian investors have for real-estate risk as the world slowly recovers from the downturn. Canadian investors are on track to purchase at least US$15.6 billion of commercial real estate world-wide in 2013, up from US$14.5 billion in 2012, and a postcrash record, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc.

Much of the interest is coming from Canadian pension funds, which have more of an appetite for risk than U.S. and European institutions because Canadian property wasn't hurt as badly by the downturn, experts say. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country's largest pension fund, allocated 11.1% of its assets to real estate, for a total of C$20.9 billion, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. That is up from 10.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, for a total of C$17.7 billion.

Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan has been aggressive in several other sectors as it tries to shore up its funding deficit amid stubbornly low interest rates. The fund last month acquired Busy Bees Nursery Group, the largest child-care provider in the United Kingdom, for an undisclosed sum, while contributing US$500 million to Hudson's Bay Co.'s purchase of Saks Fifth Avenue for US$2.9 billion in July. Over the past year, Teachers' also has made investments in Australian telecom companies, oil assets in Saskatchewan and a supplier of outdoor sports-storage systems.

Cadillac Fairview's real-estate portfolio increased to C$16.9 billion at the end of 2012, the last period for which data is available, up from C$15 billion in 2011.

Montreal has a population of 1.65 million and its business sector, which relies heavily on aerospace, information technology, pharmaceuticals and tourism, remained relatively healthy during the downturn. The last commercial office buildings in its modern office district were completed by private developers in 1992. Nearly 20% of the city's office inventory was built before 1960, more than in other large Canadian cities, according to Cushman & Wakefield.

Other pension funds also are making new investments in Montreal's office market, though they are focusing on core properties. Ivanhoe Cambridge, an arm of Quebec-based pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, spent more than C$400 million in August to acquire full control of the Place Ville Marie office complex, and is planning a C$100 million upgrade.

Cadillac Fairview began assembling land for its project in 2009 when it acquired Windsor Station, a historic hub that dates to the 19th century. The area is southwest of Old Montreal, the historic section of the city near the St. Lawrence River.

But the area has been unappealing to most office-building developers because it lacks many stores, restaurants or other amenities. "No one was interested in developing," Mr. Iacono says.

The company has been planning a development including retail, office and residential space since then, but many were skeptical that businesses could be convinced to move outside of the city's traditional business center.

That skepticism was damped when Deloitte announced plans to move. Then this year, the Alcan unit of mining giant Rio Tinto said it would move its headquarters to the top eight floors of the 500,000 square-foot tower, increasing its occupancy to 70%.

Cadillac Fairview also has started building a 555-unit condo on the site. Eventually, the entire complex will include an additional 4 million square feet of office, retail and residential space as well as public areas.

Deloitte executives say the new building -- slated to open in 2015 -- was appealing because of its energy efficiency and green features such as stalls for charging electric cars. "This building is a catalyst for a whole energy for that part of the city," says Sheila Botting, national leader of real estate for Deloitte in Canada.

For more than two decades, Montreal was one of the sleepiest office markets in Canada, seeing no new private development as cities such as Toronto and energy-rich Calgary added millions of square feet of new space.

Now, as Canadian investors step up real-estate investment throughout the world, a company owned by one of Canada's largest pension funds is looking to shake things up.

Cadillac Fairview Corp., a unit of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, wants to expand the city's business center to the south with a planned 1.9 billion Canadian dollars ($1.82 billion) development next to the Bell Centre, where the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens play.

Business
SolarCity Seeks to Expand Financing for Its Business; Company Plans to Privately Place $54 million of Asset-Backed Securities

SolarCity Corp. disclosed plans for a new way to finance small-scale installations of its solar-power systems, sending the company's stock surging.

SolarCity said Monday that it intends to privately place $54 million of securities backed by a pool of solar-power systems, leases and electricity contracts.

The company has achieved strong growth by leasing its systems to homeowners, rather than asking them to cover the hefty upfront costs of buying and putting up solar panels. Asset-backed securities would provide a new way to finance the leased systems.

After the San Mateo, Calif., company announced the plan Monday morning, its shares shot up 17% to $64.17 but later fell back to finish 4 p.m. trading up 11% at $60.97. The shares have more than quadrupled this year, giving the company a stock-market value of about $4.8 billion.

A SolarCity spokesman declined to comment.

The stock has tended to be volatile; insiders, including the high-profile entrepreneur Elon Musk, own about 73% of the SolarCity's 78 million shares outstanding, leaving a relatively small proportion in public hands.

Adding to the volatility, some traders are betting the company's stock will fall; these "short sellers," had sold about 7.3 million borrowed shares of SolarCity as of Oct. 15 according to Nasdaq, hoping to profit by replacing them later with shares purchased at a lower price.

Some analysts have been critical of the rising stock prices for solar companies, including SolarCity, SunPower Corp. and First Solar Inc., citing their heavy reliance on government subsidies that are likely to shrink.

SolarCity said in August that it expected an adjusted third-quarter loss of 50 cents to 60 cents a share. The company is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Wednesday.

SolarCity risks disappointing investors, whose expectations tend to rise with the stock price, said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. "When a stock is priced for perfection," he said, "it's very hard to impress the market."

Asset-backed securities are widely used in the home-mortgage and auto-loan markets. Banks or other investors who lend consumers the money for home or auto purchases bundle those loans together and issue debt to investors, using the homes and autos as collateral. The debt is paid off using the borrowers' monthly payments.

But use of this financing technique would be "a very big deal for the solar industry," said Richard Matsui, chief executive and co-founder of kWh Analytics, a firm that advises clients who want to invest in solar-panel projects.

Under its plan, SolarCity would likely bundle the leases on several solar-panel systems it had installed on properties. The property owners would have agreed to pay monthly fees to SolarCity for the electricity the panels generate.

SolarCity would use the bundled systems as collateral for the debt, and it would use the monthly lease payments to service the debt.

Solar leases pose risks that would have to be mitigated somehow, said Ben Shih, an analyst at credit-rating company Moody's Investors Service, which isn't involved in the SolarCity plan. For example, it isn't clear what the value of a solar-power system would be if it were repossessed due to nonpayment or some other cause, Mr. Shih said.

A spokesman for Standard & Poor's declined to comment.

Investing: Things a Fund Prospectus Won't Tell You --- Despite Data, a Lot of Crucial Information Just Isn't There. Here's What's Missing -- and How to Get It

So, you're trying to decide whether to buy a mutual fund or ETF, and you need to know the essential facts. Here's an unfortunate truth: You won't find many of the answers you need in the prospectus.

Whether you have the svelte "summary" version or the less commonly distributed "statutory" prospectus, which can run to dozens of pages, a lot of the information necessary to make an informed decision just isn't there.

Here are 10 key questions that aren't answered by the prospectus, and instructions on how to easily find this must-have information:

1. Is this fund costly compared with other choices?

The prospectus details a fund's expenses using a standardized methodology from the Securities and Exchange Commission, but it offers no context.

For an actively managed fund, look at the average for the fund's Morningstar Inc. category. For example, look up a diversified emerging-markets stock fund on Morningstar.com, go to the "Expense" tab, and you'll see an average expense ratio of 1.64%.

David Grecsek, director of investment strategy and research for financial adviser Aspiriant, says he compares a fund's expense ratio with those of competing funds and also checks "how much it would cost us to replicate market exposure passively" with an index mutual fund or exchange-traded fund.

Among emerging-markets ETFs, for example, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF charges 0.18%.

2. How has this fund performed relative to competitors?

Prospectuses show performance relative to one or more market indexes, but generally not to peers. On Morningstar.com and on WSJ.com (which uses data from Thomson Reuters Corp.'s Lipper unit) you can see how a fund has performed vs. peers over periods such as the past one, three and five years, as well as year by year.

(The fund and markets data on WSJ.com is available to nonsubscribers as well as subscribers.)

David Snowball, publisher of the Mutual Fund Observer website, looks for funds that have been average to above average year after year -- but he doesn't avoid stock funds that are laggards in periods when the market is frothy and the manager is playing it safe.

3. What's the fund's actual asset mix?

While prospectuses describe what a fund may invest in, look to the fund's website for what the fund actually held recently. Many list the top 10 holdings and provide pie charts that show the sectors or countries a manager has been favoring.

For an index fund or ETF, that breakdown shows the areas that dominate the benchmark. That information may be part of a monthly or quarterly fact sheet on the website. On Morningstar.com, the "Portfolio" tab for a stock fund shows how a fund's sector and world-region exposure compares with a benchmark and peers.

Note that a fund with an idiosyncratic portfolio might do a lot better -- or a lot worse -- than the benchmark and peers.

4. How concentrated is that stock portfolio?

The average U.S.-stock mutual fund (excluding sector funds) recently had around one-third of its assets in its top 10 holdings, according to Morningstar, but some funds have more than 80% or even 90%. You can typically find the figure -- or add up the largest holdings yourself -- on a fund's website.

"We think it's a good thing to concentrate -- or it can be in the hands of the right person," says Doug Muenzenmay, a financial adviser with Medley & Brown LLC in Jackson, Miss. But because a concentrated fund will usually be more volatile, he generally doesn't want to see a figure over 50%.

Concentration is an issue for many single-country index funds, because a few huge companies may dominate a market. Numerous single-country ETFs in the iShares lineup employ a capping methodology to limit concentration but still have more than 50% of assets in their top 10 holdings.

5. For a bond fund, what is the average duration and credit quality?

While the prospectus will spell out the parameters for picking bonds, look to the fund's website for recent figures on how much interest-rate risk and default risk a fund is taking.

"Duration" is the standard gauge for rate risk: If the average duration of the fund's holdings is five years, for example, that suggests that the fund's share price would fall 5% for a one-percentage-point climb in rates.

For default risk, look for the portfolio's average credit rating or how the holdings are spread among different credit ratings.

As one point of comparison, the iShares Core Total U.S. Bond Market ETF, which tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, has a duration of about five years and 70% of assets in triple-A bonds.

6. Do the managers and board members invest in the fund?

Many financial advisers favor funds whose portfolio managers and directors "eat their own cooking" by investing sizable sums of their own money in the funds. This is disclosed in a fund's Statement of Additional Information, commonly available on fund websites.

The data is supplied with ranges, not actual dollar figures. For example, as of March 31, Wallace Weitz had more than $1 million invested in each of four funds he manages, according to the Weitz Funds SAI.

Some fund firms also discuss their managers' investments on their websites or in other materials.

7. How volatile is this fund compared with other choices?

Funds that bounce around less in price aren't necessarily going to do better over time, but they are "easier for people to hold," says Dan Culloton, associate director of fund analysis at Morningstar.

With such funds, investors "are less likely to make the stupid psychological mistakes that many of us make," such as panic selling after a fund has tumbled, he says.

A simple but not perfect way to gauge volatility is to compare the standard deviation of a fund's returns over, say, the past three years to the standard deviation of its peers or an index. A higher figure indicates a wider range of monthly returns. Look under "Risk" on WSJ.com or "Ratings & Risk" on Morningstar.com.

8. For an ETF, what is the bid-ask spread?

When investors buy and sell conventional mutual funds, the price (excluding any commissions) is the "net asset value" of the fund's holdings.

With ETFs, by contrast, at any given moment, the price you would pay to buy is higher than what you would get to sell. That bid-ask spread will vary over time, but effectively adds to your cost, notes Paul Baiocchi, vice president of ETF analytics for IndexUniverse. It is typically wider for less-liquid investments.

An ETF's average spread over the past 60 days is available on indexuniverse.com.

9. How does the manager really invest?

In considering an active fund, says Mr. Snowball, you want to try to understand the manager's investing process and how he or she sees the world. That can show if there is "a compelling justification" for using this fund -- and maybe help you remain comfortable with the manager during an inevitable rough patch.

Read the fund's recent shareholder reports and any additional commentary on the website.

John Coumarianos, an investment manager in Northvale, N.J., favors managers who write investor letters in which "their voices come through." He says that is more common at funds from small firms, such as the FPA and Third Avenue families, but he points to the American Funds complex as a standout among large companies.

10. Do payments from the fund company to my brokerage pose a conflict?

There's typically a short notice in the prospectus indicating that payments from the fund or fund company to financial intermediaries may influence a brokerage or individual broker to recommend that fund over other investments.

For more information, check your brokerage's website, says Mercer Bullard, an associate professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law. (You can try searching for "revenue sharing.")

For instance, a disclosure from Morgan Stanley lists more than 100 fund firms that made such payments to the brokerage in 2012; 37 of them are identified as "Global Partners" that "dedicate significant financial and staffing resources" to educational and marketing activities at Morgan Stanley and may have greater access to the firm's representatives.

6.19: The average multiple of debt to earnings this year at large companies acquired by private-equity firms

Low interest rates and cash aplenty are encouraging private-equity firms -- also known as leveraged-buyout firms -- to borrow more to get deals done. With the credit spigot wide open, the multiples the buyout firms are paying for companies have reached the highest levels since the last buyout boom ended in 2007.

Companies with more than $500 million in sales are getting private-equity firms to sign deals that include 6.19 times as much debt as the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. That's the highest since 2007, when the multiple averaged 7.05 times.

Investors want to put their money to work on new deals, and that helps drive up multiples, said Ioana Barza, director of analytics at Thomson Reuters LPC.

The buyout firms depend on loan funds for much of their deal financing. For the past several years, most of the deals in which loan funds have been investing have been refinancings. This year more money has been flowing into loan funds, and new deals from private-equity firms offer those funds the chance to expand their portfolios, Ms. Barza said.

Buyers paid for companies such as H.J. Heinz Co., Dell Inc., and BMC Software Inc., for example, with borrowings large enough to hark back to the last boom.

Leveraged buyouts so far this year have totaled $159.84 billion, topping the $149.62 billion recorded for all of last year, according to Dealogic. The year-to-date figure for 2013 also beats the full-year total for every year since 2007, when private-equity buyers made $590.27 billion of deals.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- Spotlight / Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF: Staying Short For Safety

With interest rates still at uber-low levels, investors aren't taking any chances. The list of the most popular exchange-traded bond funds this year is dominated by those with only limited interest-rate sensitivity.

The biggest draw for net new cash through Oct. 30 was the $13.8 billion Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF, according to IndexUniverse in San Francisco. Besides offering broad exposure to both government and corporate issues, the fund comes with an expense ratio of 0.10%, vs. an average 0.37% for U.S.-focused bond ETFs, the research firm notes.

The Vanguard ETF -- with an average effective duration, or rate sensitivity, of 2 1/2 years -- was able to escape much of the market pressures felt earlier in the year by longer-dated bond funds. So far in 2013, through October, Vanguard Short-Term Bond has returned 0.4%. Meanwhile, the intermediate-term iShares Core Total Aggregate U.S. Bond ETF has lost 1.2%.

Vanguard Short-Term "isn't throwing off a lot of cash" -- with a recent yield of 0.75% -- but it can make sense "for investors who want to remain defensive in bonds until the rates pendulum swings in the other direction," says Kim Arthur, chief investment officer at Main Management LLC in San Francisco.

The fund's 71% stake in Treasury and agency bonds should prove attractive for more conservative investors, while the 22% in corporate bonds adds some yield, notes Matt Hougan, president of analytics and publications for IndexUniverse. The ETF also includes dollar-denominated debt from foreign issuers, typically about 10% of the portfolio, he observes.

IndexUniverse ranks the Vanguard ETF at the top of its peer group based on fees, tracking error and liquidity levels. "It's a very liquid and well-managed bond ETF that does exactly what it says it's going to do," Mr. Hougan says.

For example, look up a diversified emerging-markets stock fund on Morningstar.com, go to the "Expense" tab, and you'll see an average expense ratio of 1.64%.

David Grecsek, director of investment strategy and research for financial adviser Aspiriant, says he compares a fund's expense ratio with those of competing funds and also checks "how much it would cost us to replicate market exposure passively" with an index mutual fund or exchange-traded fund. Among emerging-markets ETFs, for example, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF charges 0.18%.

2. How has this fund performed relative to competitors?

Prospectuses show performance relative to one or more market indexes, but generally not to peers. On Morningstar.com and on WSJ.com (which uses data from Thomson Reuters Corp.'s Lipper unit) you can see how a fund has performed vs. peers over periods such as the past one, three and five years, as well as year by year. (The fund and markets data on WSJ.com is available to nonsubscribers as well as subscribers.)

David Snowball, publisher of the Mutual Fund Observer website, looks for funds that have been average to above average year after year but he doesn't avoid stock funds that are laggards in periods when the market is frothy and the manager is playing it safe.

3. What's the fund's actual asset mix?

While prospectuses describe what a fund may invest in, look to the fund's website for what the fund actually held recently. Many list the top 10 holdings and provide pie charts that show the sectors or countries a manager has been favoring. For an index fund or ETF, that breakdown shows the areas that dominate the benchmark. That information may be part of a monthly or quarterly fact sheet on the website.

pict054.jpg

On Morningstar.com, the "Portfolio" tab for a stock fund shows how a fund's sector and world-region exposure compares with a benchmark and peers. Note that a fund with an idiosyncratic portfolio might do a lot better or a lot worse than the benchmark and peers.

4. How concentrated is that stock portfolio?

The average U.S.-stock mutual fund (excluding sector funds) recently had around one-third of its assets in its top 10 holdings, according to Morningstar, but some funds have more than 80% or even 90%. You can typically find the figure or add up the largest holdings yourself on a fund's website.

"We think it's a good thing to concentrate or it can be in the hands of the right person," says Doug Muenzenmay, a financial adviser with Medley & Brown LLC in Jackson, Miss. But because a concentrated fund will usually be more volatile, he generally doesn't want to see a figure over 50%.

Concentration is an issue for many single-country index funds, because a few huge companies may dominate a market. Numerous single-country ETFs in the iShares lineup employ a capping methodology to limit concentration but still have more than 50% of assets in their top 10 holdings.

5. For a bond fund, what is the average duration and credit quality?

While the prospectus will spell out the parameters for picking bonds, look to the fund's website for recent figures on how much interest-rate risk and default risk a fund is taking. "Duration" is the standard gauge for rate risk: If the average duration of the fund's holdings is five years, for example, that suggests that the fund's share price would fall 5% for a one-percentage-point climb in rates. For default risk, look for the portfolio's average credit rating or how the holdings are spread among different credit ratings.

As one point of comparison, the iShares Core Total U.S. Bond Market ETF, which tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, has a duration of about five years and 70% of assets in triple-A bonds.

6. Do the managers and board members invest in the fund?

Many financial advisers favor funds whose portfolio managers and directors "eat their own cooking" by investing sizable sums of their own money in the funds. This is disclosed in a fund's Statement of Additional Information, commonly available on fund websites. The data is supplied with ranges, not actual dollar figures. For example, as of March 31, Wallace Weitz had more than $1 million invested in each of four funds he manages, according to the Weitz Funds SAI.

Some fund firms also discuss their managers' investments on their websites or in other materials.

7. How volatile is this fund compared with other choices?

Funds that bounce around less in price aren't necessarily going to do better over time, but they are "easier for people to hold," says Dan Culloton, associate director of fund analysis at Morningstar. With such funds, investors "are less likely to make the stupid psychological mistakes that many of us make," such as panic selling after a fund has tumbled, he says.

A simple but not perfect way to gauge volatility is to compare the standard deviation of a fund's returns over, say, the past three years to the standard deviation of its peers or an index. A higher figure indicates a wider range of monthly returns. Look under "Risk" on WSJ.com or "Ratings & Risk" on Morningstar.com.

8. For an ETF, what is the bid-ask spread?

When investors buy and sell conventional mutual funds, the price (excluding any commissions) is the "net asset value" of the fund's holdings. With ETFs, by contrast, at any given moment, the price you would pay to buy is higher than what you would get to sell. That bid-ask spread will vary over time, but effectively adds to your cost, notes Paul Baiocchi, vice president of ETF analytics for IndexUniverse. It is typically wider for less-liquid investments.

An ETF's average spread over the past 60 days is available on indexuniverse.com.

9. How does the manager really invest?

In considering an active fund, says Mr. Snowball, you want to try to understand the manager's investing process and how he or she sees the world. That can show if there is "a compelling justification" for using this fund and maybe help you remain comfortable with the manager during an inevitable rough patch.

Read the fund's recent shareholder reports and any additional commentary on the website.

John Coumarianos, an investment manager in Northvale, N.J., favors managers who write investor letters in which "their voices come through." He says that is more common at funds from small firms, such as the FPA and Third Avenue families, but he points to the American Funds complex as a standout among large companies.

10. Do payments from the fund company to my brokerage pose a conflict?

There's typically a short notice in the prospectus indicating that payments from the fund or fund company to financial intermediaries may influence a brokerage or individual broker to recommend that fund over other investments.

For more information, check your brokerage's website, says Mercer Bullard, an associate professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law. (You can try searching for "revenue sharing.")

For instance, a disclosure from Morgan Stanley lists more than 100 fund firms that made such payments to the brokerage in 2012; 37 of them are identified as "Global Partners" that "dedicate significant financial and staffing resources" to educational and marketing activities at Morgan Stanley and may have greater access to the firm's representatives.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Hedge fund wisdom is cut to the bone; Investing

I flew from Scotland to London with my children on Thursday. Everyone was in a remarkably good mood - possibly because they were either flying on or working for British Airways rather than Ryanair - and the captain asked us in to see the flight deck. It went well. No one pressed any buttons they weren't supposed to and everyone was polite to the pilots. But I was not altogether thrilled to be reminded just how complicated a cockpit is - so many buttons, so much risk.

Thank goodness, I thought, that I work in a relatively simple business. Then I dropped the children off and went to the Sohn Conference , where I was reminded why so many people think finance is more complicated than flying a plane.

The Sohn is an annual event, once US-only but now in the UK, at which the super well paid of the UK get to show their compassionate side. The conference is designed to raise money for the treatment and cure of paediatric cancer. The tickets cost 1,000 each and everyone who is anyone in hedge fund land straps on their most expensive status symbol - a ludicrous luxury watch in most cases, an "I've visited the flight deck" sticker in mine - and heads off to be seen.

The lure is not the charity itself but that a series of well known and successful fund managers take to the podium to tell you which stocks they love and which they hate . Much of it was complicated and one or two of the interesting ideas might not work for ordinary investors. But here is a few of the simple and interesting ones. First, Julian Sinclair of Talisman Global Asset Management, who like most of the managers was advertised as a contrarian investor. He tipped Tata Motors on the basis that some 80 per cent of its value is made up of Jaguar Land Rover. He figures the brand value of that business alone is $17bn - not much less than the entire market cap of Tata. Look at it like that and the current price gives you the luxury car business very cheaply, particularly given that there is scope for profit margin expansion and that the firm is just coming to the end of an expensive cycle of investment - so its cash flow should now improve dramatically. In effect you get the Indian commercial vehicle business that makes up the rest of the company for free, which sounds nice.

Also telling a simple story was Chris Hohn. If you have read anything about the head of the sweetly named Children's Investment Fund you will know that he is the largest investor in the Royal Mail apart from the UK government. That was a good call (for him if not the taxpayer ) - the shares are up around 60 per cent or more since the IPO. Mr Hohn loves privatisations. "Governments are just about the worst owners of companies you can find," he reminded us. When companies move into private hands, they always transform and offer their investors "huge financial upside".

So he tipped Australian railway company Aurizon. He got the largest allocation of stock in this from the state when it was sold off in 2010 and it "continues transformation" thanks to contract repricing, the "releveraging of the company" and the "voluntary and involuntary" departure of thousands of employees.

Mr Hohn also tipped EADS, maker of Airbus airliners. It is also recently privatised , is cheap and has huge potential in a duopoly business with firm barriers to entry. Other convincing tips from speakers included credit rating company Experian (strong growth, a beneficiary of "big data" and again a business with almost insurmountable barriers to entry); Sampo, owner of 21 per cent of Nordea, the leading Scandinavian banking franchise; and one of my favourites, oil distribution services group DCC, which is successfully consolidating a fragmented industry with lots of acquisitions. However, I know that some of you like to buy markets and not individual stocks.

Good news then, in that I think the most gripping talk of the day came from Andrew Weiss of Weiss Asset Management. He told us to buy Korea. You have heard this before - David Stevenson wrote about it in Adventurous Investor in May - but to reappraise: amazing infrastructure, fantastic education system and lots of potential cheap labour from enterprise zones bordering North Korea.

Of course, rapid economic growth is entirely irrelevant to stock market returns: high levels of investment and low levels of regard for shareholders mean that high growth economies almost always have low growth stock markets. So what might make Korea different? First it is not starting from too high a price; second, much of the investment is done; and third, there are huge changes to corporate governance under way. If regulations on the way through now pass, South Korea will soon have the "best shareholder rights in the world".

You can buy into this story in a complicated way - getting what Mr Weiss calls a "double discount" by picking up ultra-cheap preference shares (Hyundai's are trading on a p/e of 3.1 times) - or a potentially less lucrative but simpler way with a Korean exchange traded fund . I will be acting on some of the tips from the conference myself in the next few weeks, but if you want an even simpler takeaway from the Sohn conference it is this: register to become a bone marrow donor . A short talk explained that it does not take that long and if you turn out to be a match for someone it will show your compassionate side even more than paying 1,000 to attend a conference.

US
Senate GOP Blocks Two Obama Nominees; Democrats Ponder 'Nuclear Option' of Rules Change, but No Move Expected Soon; Reid to Bring Up More Candidates

WASHINGTON Republicans blocked the Senate from voting Thursday on two of President Barack Obama's nominees, reviving the prospect of a broader fight over nominations that both parties have said could poison relations and shut down all other business in the chamber.

Two prominent Obama nominees Rep. Mel Watt (D., N.C.), picked to head the agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Patricia Millett, nominated for a seat on a key federal appeals court failed to clear procedural hurdles in back-to-back votes. Each fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance.

The GOP opposition angered the majority Democrats, who said they were considering whether to take new steps to limit Republicans' ability to prevent confirmation votes.

The rules for confirming nominees are arcane but highly sensitive because they give the minority party the power to flex its muscles by requiring the majority to secure 60 votes to cut off debate before proceeding to a confirmation vote, which requires only a simple majority.

Thursday's votes one of which involved the rare step of blocking a sitting member of Congress from an executive post threatened to interrupt a period of relative comity in the two weeks since the two parties ended a budget fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown. Lawmakers earlier this week confirmed nominees to two key federal agencies and began budget negotiations Wednesday with an unusually conciliatory meeting.

Thursday's action left Democrats incensed. "If [nominees with] these kinds of qualifications can't get through the byzantine rules of the Senate, maybe it's time for us to seriously consider changing those rules," said Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said he expected the Senate to reconsider the nominations of Ms. Millett and Mr. Watt in the "very near future" and voted no on both to preserve that option. He also said he wouldn't make a decision Thursday on whether to invoke what is known as the "nuclear option" of the rules change.

The move discussed this past summer would have ended the need for Democrats to corral 60 votes to cut off debate on executive-branch nominees. But a deal was reached that averted any rule changes.

Republicans cautioned that Democrats could live to regret any permanent rules changes. "I don't think any of them would want to see a Republican president in 2016 having a 51-vote right to have another Justice [Antonin] Scalia or somebody else on the Supreme Court," said Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.).

Some say such a change would harm the Senate's traditionally courteous culture. "It will make this chamber even more polarized than it already is," Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the chamber's second-highest ranking Republican, warned on the Senate floor Thursday.

Democrats indicated Thursday they wanted to let the fight over presidential nominees play out longer before coalescing behind any changes. Mr. Reid said he planned to line up votes on two more nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, for which Ms. Millett was nominated. With the GOP likely to oppose those nominees as they did Ms. Millett, that could give Democrats incentive to push for rules changes for judicial nominees.

Including new Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), the Senate has 55 members of the Democratic caucus and 45 Republicans.

Ms. Millett, a Washington lawyer, received 55 votes including two from Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in favor of moving forward on her nomination to the District of Columbia Circuit Court, often considered the nation's second-most powerful court. It regularly hears legal challenges to federal regulations and has been a stepping stone for Supreme Court nominees.

Thursday clash's had little to do with Ms. Millett's qualifications. A former Justice Department lawyer who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, she has argued 32 cases at the Supreme Court. Both sides have spoken highly of her resume.

Her fight is part of a broader battle about the Washington appeals court, which long has been at the center of political sparring over the direction of the judiciary. Each party at times has resisted filling some vacancies on the court, which is split 4-4 between active judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents. However, the court's semiretired "senior" judges still hear cases, and most of those were appointed by Republicans.

Mr. Watt was nominated in May to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which controls the government-supported mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and has become one of the most important economic-policy posts in Washington. He received 56 votes, including from two Republicans: Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rob Portman of Ohio.

But other Republicans said a politician shouldn't oversee two companies that were lobbying forces before they collapsed during the financial crisis. Several lawmakers have said the agency would be better suited by a "technocrat" with deeper regulatory experience, and many prefer the agency's acting director, Edward DeMarco, who has at times resisted White House policy preferences. The agency was created by Congress in July 2008 to oversee Fannie, Freddie and the Federal Home Loan Banks and has never had a Senate-confirmed director.

Mr. Watt has offered few specifics about how he would lead the agency, which did little to calm Republicans' fears that the independent regulatory agency would be heavily influenced by the White House. Keeping Mr. DeMarco could help Republicans maintain greater leverage over the shape of any overhaul.

If Mr. Watt isn't ultimately confirmed, the White House could take other steps to replace Mr. DeMarco. It could name a new acting director from one of three FHFA senior directors, it could bypass the Senate by nominating Mr. Watt through a recess appointment, or it could nominate a new director.

The Obama administration had considered Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics, before nominating Mr. Watt. At least two Republican senators had signaled openness to supporting Mr. Zandi before Mr. Watt was selected in May.

The Obama administration has clashed publicly and privately with Mr. DeMarco, who has served since 2009 as the FHFA's acting director. He has come under withering criticism from liberal political activist groups and some Democrats in Congress for not approving more generous borrower relief in the aftermath of the foreclosure crisis. Many Republicans have lauded Mr. DeMarco for his management of Fannie and Freddie

Administration and industry officials have grown more concerned in recent weeks over the way in which Mr. DeMarco has moved ahead to unilaterally shrink the footprint of Fannie and Freddie. Current and former administration officials have said that Mr. Watt would be better suited to overseeing the transition of Fannie and Freddie than Mr. DeMarco.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Mr. Obama is disappointed in the Senate vote and is committed to seeing Mr. Watt's nomination through.

"We absolutely believe that Mel Watt is enormously qualified & "We know that he would do a good job, and there's a heck of a lot of important work that needs to be done in that agency," he said.

Fed stays the course on bond-buying

The US Federal Reserve said the world's largest economy is still expanding at a moderate pace in a statement that suggests a slowing of asset purchases in December or January is still under consideration.

The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee made no changes to policy at its October meeting, keeping its asset purchases steady at $85bn a month, but the statement implied it does not see a lot of damage from a three-week government shutdown earlier this month.

Although markets have assumed the Fed will not "taper" its asset purchases until March, the statement implies it could still slow its asset purchases earlier than that - perhaps as early as its December meeting - if the economic data justifies it.

The Fed surprised markets in September by choosing to keep purchases on hold. That prompted a big fall in market interest rates, which had risen after Fed communications in June and July suggested it was close to a taper, and a global rally in risky assets.

Combined with the effects of the shutdown - which has scrambled the economic data for October - markets have assumed the September decision meant the Fed was automatically on hold for some months. But October's statement suggests that is not necessarily correct.

In the most notable change, the Fed eliminated a sentence from September saying that tighter financial conditions - Fed code for higher market interest rates - could lead to slower improvement in the economy. Scrapping the sentence suggests it is now comfortable with market interest rates.

It also kept September's language that the economy is expanding at a "moderate" pace, choosing not to downgrade it to "modest", although it noted that the housing sector has slowed somewhat in recent months.

However, the Fed pointedly said that its judgment was based on "available data", indicating that it could yet change as more detailed information for October becomes available.

The FOMC voted for the decision by a majority of 9-1. Esther George, the president of the Kansas City Fed, dissented because she was concerned about the risk of future economic and financial imbalances.

Data earlier in the day showed that the US private sector added 130,000 jobs during October in a sign that the government shutdown had modest effects on the rest of the economy.

ADP, the payroll processor, said that private jobs growth had fallen well below the recent average as the government shutdown for almost three weeks earlier in the month but the figures did not show a catastrophic slump in employment.

The ADP report suggests that the shutdown did have a marked knock-on effect on private employment, further slowing an already weakening trend, but it appears that employers held on to existing staff even if they slowed their hiring plans.

The question for the US Federal Reserve will be whether the weakness in October is a one-off or whether the drag on jobs growth continues in the months ahead. In that case, it would be unlikely to slow its asset purchases from $85bn a month in December.

"The government shutdown and debt limit brinksmanship hurt the already softening job market in October," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody'sAnalytics, which compiles the ADP report. "Average monthly growth has fallen below 150,000. Any further weakening would signal rising unemployment."

Fed Outlook Hurts Treasurys

Treasury bonds were hit with moderate selling as the Federal Reserve's interest-rate statement reminded investors that the central bank could dial back bond buying at an earlier date than many expected.

The Fed struck a relatively more optimistic tone on the economic outlook even though it decided to maintain its monthly $85 billion bond-buying program. In particular, the central bank believes the U.S. economy will continue to improve even in the wake of this month's 16-day partial government shutdown.

"The Fed didn't seem to see the government shutdown and fiscal retrenchment as a big concern for the economy," said Jason Evans, co-founder of hedge fund NineAlpha Capital LP in New York. "If the Fed is right about the underlying strength of the U.S. economy, the taper timing could be earlier than many people expected. A December taper is not completely out of the question. But the bar is high."

In late-afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 5/32 lower, yielding 2.527%, according to Tradeweb.

The yield rose to as high as 2.549% from 2.485% just before the Fed statement. Bond prices rise when their yields fall.

"Many people have thought that the Fed would mention that the government shutdown would be a drag on growth," said Dan Mulholland, head of U.S. Treasury trading at BNY Mellon Capital Markets.

Mr. Mulholland took the selling as a short-term pullback for Treasurys, whose prices have rallied considerably over the past few weeks as speculation had grown that the central bank wouldn't be in a rush to cut back stimulus given the tepid pace of the economic growth.

In Wednesday afternoon's statement, the Fed reiterated that the timing to pull back on its monetary stimulus hinges on the health of U.S. economic data.

Many big banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have argued that the Fed might not start to taper its bond buying until the spring of 2014. Some investors said the Fed could wait longer to pull back stimulus if the growth outlook fails to improve at the speed the central bank wants.

Wednesday's disappointing employment data backed some investors' argument that the Fed needs to stay in wait-and-see mode before moving to taper.

The U.S. private sector added 130,000 jobs in October, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing in conjunction with Moody'sAnalytics. That was lower than the 150,000 forecast by economists, propping up Treasury prices in early trade.

The report signaled the negative impact from the government shutdown, the result of a fiscal stalemate that was one of the main reasons the Fed decided to refrain from cutting back its bond buying at its monetary-policy meeting in September.

Tame inflation also bolstered some investors' view that the Fed won't be in a rush to scale back monetary stimulus. Data released Wednesday showed the consumer price index rose by 0.2% in September, in line with economists' forecasts. But stripping out food and energy, the reading was 0.1%, half of what economists had expected.

The 10-year yield has dropped after briefly topping 3% in early September. This month through Tuesday, Treasury bonds have handed investors a gain of 0.56% in total return, according to Barclays.

The U.S. Treasury has benefited from the shift to lower yields. Wednesday, a sale of $29 billion in seven-year notes was offered at a yield of 1.87%, the lowest borrowing cost for the U.S. government since May. Overall demand was the strongest in months. One highlight was the 23.9% direct bid, which includes buying from U.S. investment firms; it hit the highest-ever level for a seven-year note sale.

Even so, bond bears are still ahead for the year.

The 10-year yield is still higher than the 1.76% seen at the end of last year. Treasury bonds have handed investors a loss of 1.46% in total return this year through Tuesday, according to Barclays. In contrast, high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds have posted a total return of 6.2%.

Stocks Close Lower After Fed; Statement Indicates Resilient Economy, Boosting Speculation About Tapering by Year-End

Stocks backed away from record highs after the Federal Reserve left its assessment of the economy relatively unchanged, surprising investors and leading to speculation the central bank could begin scaling back stimulus efforts at year-end.

Many investors and analysts were expecting the Fed to downgrade its economic outlook due to budget wrangling in Washington earlier this month that caused a government shutdown.

The fact that it didn't raises the likelihood that the central bank could pare, or "taper," stimulus measures as early as its next policy-setting meeting, scheduled for December. At the meeting that concluded Wednesday, the Fed made no change to its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 61.59 points, or 0.4%, to 15618.76, with 25 of 30 components lower. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 111 points to beat out the previous record high from September.

The S&P 500 index fell 8.64 points, or 0.5%, to 1763.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 21.72 points, or 0.5%, to 3930.62.

"The Fed didn't seem to see the government shutdown and fiscal retrenchment as a big concern for the economy," said Jason Evans, co-founder of hedge fund NineAlpha Capital LP in New York. "If the Fed is right about the underlying strength of the U.S. economy, the taper timing could be earlier than many people expected. A December taper is not completely out of the question. But the bar is high."

Bonds and gold also fell, while the dollar strengthened against major currencies. The moves indicated that investors across a broad swathe of markets readjusted their expectations for when the Fed would taper.

Yields on 10-year Treasurys rose as high as 2.549%, compared with 2.485% ahead of the Fed statement. When yields rise, bond prices fall.

"Many people thought that the Fed would mention that the government shutdown would be a drag on growth," said Dan Mulholland, head of U.S. Treasury trading at BNY Mellon Capital Markets.

While the Fed didn't mention any slowdown from the partial government shutdown earlier this month, data hasn't indicated that growth is picking up, particularly in the labor market, which Fed officials have said will play a key factor in policy decisions. On Wednesday, private-sector payrolls reported by Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics were lower than expected, and the consumer-price index indicated that inflation wasn't picking up.

"The labor data right now is extraordinarily weak," said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, which manages $367 billion. "We need to see some really strong reports to meet the threshold" for the Fed to start to cut back on its bond-buying programs, he said.

The Fed statement took investor attention from the ongoing stream of corporate earnings reports. Now that 314 of S&P 500 companies have reported results, the index is on track for earnings to grow 2.6% in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2012, according to FactSet. Analysts expected earnings growth of 3% before the start of earnings-reporting season.

General Motors gained after reporting profit that came in above analyst estimates, with continued strength in North America and an improved performance in Europe.

Elsewhere, some recent highflying social-media stocks fell after reporting results. LinkedIn fell after providing a downbeat fourth-quarter revenue outlook. Yelp slid after it reported a wider-than-expected loss. This year, LinkedIn is up 96% and Yelp has more than doubled.

Social-media heavyweight Facebook surged in after-hours trading after its latest quarterly earnings, reported after the market's close, easily beat Wall Street forecasts.

Property: Woodbury Common Spruces Up for Shoppers

CENTRAL VALLEY, N.Y. -- Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, the sprawling 150-acre shopping mecca that is the country's largest outlet center, is getting a partial makeover.

Simon Property Group has begun a $170 million renovation of Woodbury Common -- the first since the real-estate investment trust acquired the property in 2004. The three-year project's goal: Keep Woodbury a compelling shopping destination, said Richard S. Sokolov, the company's president and chief operating officer.

Years ago, shopping outlets were places where retailers fobbed off their clothes with missed stitches or non-matching buttons on price-conscious customers. Retail experts say the outlet model has evolved, with many brands creating products that are uniquely sold in outlet stores.

At Woodbury Common, both luxury and budget shoppers can find something to suit their fancy, from the $1,750 men's sports jacket at Dunhill to the $29 pink glitter clutch purse at Armani Exchange. Many of the stores post signs advertising 30% to 70% off, while so-called VIP discount coupons are distributed freely.

On a recent midweek afternoon, shoppers wheeling suitcases stuffed with purchases were literally running between Woodbury Common stores. Annual sales here top $1.3 billion, with the average sales per square foot exceeding $1,550, on par with high-end Manhattan shopping areas such Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.

Simon Property has spent the last decade attracting more upscale brands, not a quick task at a fully leased shopping center where only eight stores out of more than 200 change tenants in a typical year. Since the company started managing the property, Jimmy Choo, Balenciaga, Valentino, Michael Kors and Tom Ford have moved in.

More than 13 million shoppers trek each year to the center in Orange County, with many of them paying about $40 round-trip for the hourlong bus ride from Manhattan.

But some market experts say that Woodbury Common was due for at least a partial redo. "It was tired," said Dan Fasulo, the director of market analysis at Real Capital Analytics, a real-estate data firm.

Built in 1985 as one of the first outlet centers, it was expanded three times in the 1990s by the original developer, Chelsea Property Group. The renovation project is the first new construction in 15 years.

The plan includes relatively little new store space, adding 60,000 square feet to bring the total to more than 900,000 square feet. Workers have broken ground on a new sheltered waiting area where buses are expected to start arriving late next year.

The current welcome center -- which sports such amenities as dollar bill-operated massage chairs and placards promoting Simon Property's other outlets as far away as South Korea -- will be demolished to make way for a more expansive welcome center dubbed "Market Hall." This new Colonial-style building will also replace the food court, one of the original 1985 structures, which will then be torn down to create new shops.

Simon Property plans fresh facades for the Woodbury stores, with a few retailers such as Tumi, Ann Taylor Loft and DKNY already sporting a spruced-up look. Work has begun on a new four-story parking structure with sensors to inform drivers about which levels are open, and the center's internal roads will be realigned to help alleviate traffic jams during peak shopping seasons.

A new restaurant is planned to open next year to augment the fast-food options that dominate the center. Currently, an Applebee's on the edge of the parking lot is the only casual-dining option.

Harried shoppers racing for the last bus might benefit most of all from the new navigation. The serpentine plan can be confusing. "The center is laid out in such a way that there is a higher importance on giving the shopper a good road map," Mr. Sokolov said. He hopes to achieve this with new signage that creates districts named for New York destinations like Madison Avenue, Niagara and Saratoga.

The New York theme might appeal to foreign tourists, who flock to the center from as far off as Brazil, China and Japan. Woodbury caters to foreign shoppers in diverse ways, from the currency exchange and international size conversion charts to the recorded announcements in Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese).

The attraction for foreign tourists is obvious, said Nigel Hollis, chief global analyst at Millward Brown, a retail brand consultant. Many of them can buy luxury goods here for 30% less than in Beijing or Shanghai. "Fashion is notoriously price sensitive," Mr. Hollis said, "because customers know there are many little black dresses to choose from."

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Bank regulators often speak a language all their own, replete with a host of acronyms amd jargon describing the nuances of different capital buffers. Even bank stress tests, a seemingly simple term, get dressed up as CCAR, or comprehensive capital analysis and review.

And regulators feel free to inject new phrases at will. So it was when the Federal Reserve last week proposed new rules governing assets a bank must keep on hand that it can readily convert into cash should it face a run. These are more stringent than international ones proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

But the Fed didn't want to say it was being tougher or breaking from the international regulatory pack. Instead, it said its proposed rules were "super-equivalent" to others. Marveling at "the wonders of regulatory prose," Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics wrote in a note late last week: "I'm pretty sure that this means that, if a person is 200 pounds, he is 'super-equivalent' to someone weighing in at 150."

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Artemis equity fund could fall prey to rising global interest rates; Fund focus

Manager is adding companies that have dividend prospects, says Matthew Jeynes

Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a rising star at Artemis Fund Managers, has warned that funds aiming to generate income from holding equities could be under threat from increasing interest rates.

In the recent years of the global economic crisis, central banks in the developed world slashed interest rates to historic lows of 0-0.5 per cent to fuel cheap lending in the hope of rallying ailing economies. This caused income levels from "low-risk" assets such as cash and government-issued bonds to plunge. It forced savers into riskier assets such as equities to try and maintain income levels.

The 338m Artemis Global Income fund, which has paid out a "historic yield" of roughly 4.28 per cent in the past year, has benefited from this trend. A year ago it managed just 59m, but investors have since ploughed in.

But as a global economic recovery becomes entrenched, the prospect of central bank rate rises to more normal levels seems increasingly likely.

Mr de Tusch-Lec says that as this inevitably causes income from lower-risk assets to rise, income-paying equities could plummet in value as investors switch out.

"In a world where government bond yields are at 4 per cent, equity income comes under pressure, and you have to ask how you run a fund in that environment," he says.

"It will be difficult. Suddenly a number of dividend yields do not seem that high and suddenly a lot of companies' investments do not make the same return on capital.

"High interest rates could be the moment at which global income needs to have a bit of a rethink."

In an environment of rate rises, the kind of equities investors should avoid particularly include the so-called " bond proxies ", he says. These large, established equities resemble corporate bonds due to their low levels of risk and low levels of income.

The manager is already making early cuts in sectors such as telecoms, utilities and real estate investment trusts, from 20 per cent of the fund to 10 per cent.

Instead, he is adding to growth-orientated companies that offer the prospect of rising levels of dividend income in the future, sacrificing initial yield for a better total return.

Artemis Global Income has been the top-performing fund in the IMA Global Equity Income sector over the past year, generating a return of 30.1 per cent compared with the sector average of 19.2 per cent, according to FE Analytics.

The fund is also second best in the sector over the past three years.

Mr de Tusch-Lec says the fund's structure provides him with flexibility that has served him well in the past three years. It allowed him to move into different investment themes during the "violent rotations" in the markets.

Equity income funds that do not have the same flexibility may become trapped in the bond proxies as interest rates rise, he warns.

However, Mr de Tusch-Lec admits he held on to a weighting on leveraged real estate investment trusts for too long following their bull run at the start of the year. This position hurt performance as the companies retrenched.

Copper Firm Drops Bid to Halt ETFs; Southwire Says Suit Isn't Necessary as Banks Retreat From Commodities

Southwire Co., the largest copper-wire maker in the U.S., has ended its legal battle against the launch of two exchange-traded funds as some banks retreat from the physical-commodities business.

The Carrollton, Ga., company had been fighting decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve certain waivers that paved the way for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc. to list ETFs backed by physical copper.

It is unlikely that the two ETF sponsors would be able to launch those products in the form outlined by their respective prospectuses, making any legal challenge moot, an attorney representing Southwire said Monday.

Southwire's decision to withdraw its lawsuit is the latest sign that the rush to develop financial products to track commodities has stalled. The raw-materials sector, hot for much of the last decade, has cooled as investors see better opportunities elsewhere. Meanwhile, regulators are scrutinizing Wall Street's influence on raw materials from corn to copper.

The SEC in December and February approved exceptions to a securities rule, allowing J.P. Morgan and BlackRock to roll out copper-backed ETFs that both had proposed in 2010. In response, Southwire sued the SEC in federal court, arguing that the approvals didn't include a rigorous enough analysis of whether the funds would keep supply off the market and drive up prices for industrial users.

But since then, J.P. Morgan has put its physical commodities business, including the Henry Bath & Son Ltd. unit that would have stored the copper for its ETF, up for sale. The warehouse company that would have stored BlackRock's metal, Goldman Sachs's Metro International Trade Services, was also shopped around briefly, and the investment bank has said in any case that it would no longer participate in the fund.

"Since the filing of these appeals [against the ETFs' approval], certain events now make it unlikely that these proposed products will ever come to market," Robert Bernstein, an attorney with Eaton & Van Winkle LLP who is representing Southwire, said in a filing requesting the dismissal of the suit on Monday.

The SEC didn't have an immediate comment. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and BlackRock declined to comment.

Some market watchers say the ETF proposals, if resubmitted, may face a tougher road with the SEC amid Washington's sharper focus on commodities.

A Senate committee held a hearing in July on bank ownership of warehouses, partially in response to years of complaints by metal users that long wait times to get metal was artificially inflating prices. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Justice Department have opened probes into the matter, and the Federal Reserve is revisiting a decade-old waiver that allowed banks such as Goldman and Morgan Stanley to participate in physical commodities markets.

Analysts say investor appetite for the copper funds looks less likely to materialize than it did when the products were first envisioned. When J.P. Morgan and BlackRock made their proposals in late 2010, copper prices were hitting record highs as China's surging demand overwhelmed the ability of the world's mines to keep up. Now the industrial metal is out of favor, with supply exceeding demand and prices on track to fall for a second consecutive year.

"When [the copper market] was hot and when these were filed, they were pushing them hard," Matt Hougan, president of analytics and publications with ETF tracker IndexUniverse LLC, said of J.P. Morgan and BlackRock. Now, "there's no investor demand. There are legal and regulatory concerns. They're not going to spend their good grace with regulators on these products."

The products would likely come with relatively high fees for commodity funds. Because copper is less expensive than metals like gold and silver compared with its size, it is a more expensive proposition to store the metal in vaults. ETF Securities' U.K.-listed physical copper fund costs investors about 3% a year, compared with a 0.4% charge for the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest ETF that holds physical gold.

In other words, copper prices would have to rise by 3% a year to offset the funds' storage costs. Neither J.P. Morgan nor BlackRock have outlined their projected fees in filings.

ETF Securities' copper fund, in its third year of operation, holds just under 2,400 metric tons of copper worth about $17 million.

Profit Falls Short of Forecasts At China Construction Bank

BEIJING -- China Construction Bank Corp. reported third-quarter net-profit results that missed market expectations, as the state-run bank and other lenders grapple with China's slowing economy and Beijing's efforts to liberalize financial markets.

The country's second-largest bank by assets reported Sunday that net profit for the quarter rose 9.4% to 56.8 billion yuan ($9.34 billion), lower than the average forecast of 57.69 billion yuan among four analysts polled by Thomson One Analytics.

The third-quarter profit growth for China Construction Bank, the first of the state-run banks to report quarterly earnings, marked a slowdown from its 13% growth in the first half of the year and the second-slowest growth in more than four years.

The profit gain was driven by a rise in net-interest income, which accounted for more than 70% of the bank's operating income. Third-quarter net-interest income rose 8.2% to 98.85 billion yuan.

Though they remain among the most profitable in the world, Chinese banks have been facing mounting challenges, including narrowing interest margins and rising bad loans, amid a slowing economy and Beijing's push to liberalize government-controlled interest rates.

China Construction Bank's net-interest margin, a measure of the profitability of lending, was 2.71% at the end of September, unchanged from the end of June, but was lower than the 2.74% the bank posted a year earlier.

An anticipated push by Beijing to further liberalize interest rates is expected to further hurt banks' margins, as funding costs rise and competition for customers increases.

In July, China's central bank scrapped a floor on lending rates, a move toward promised overhauls. On Friday, the central bank introduced a market-based loan prime rate in a bid to eventually replace official benchmark interest rates.

The regulatory changes come as growth in the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, has slowed from double-digit percentages in previous years to 7.8% year on year in the third quarter. That has triggered concern over rising bad loans, especially after Beijing's huge 2009 stimulus plan that was supercharged by bank lending.

Still, the ratio of nonperforming loans to overall loans at Chinese commercial banks stood at 0.96% at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.

China Construction Bank's bad-loan ratio declined to 0.98% by the end of September from 0.99% the pervious quarter. Its provision coverage ratio for bad loans was 267.9% at the end of the third quarter, down 3.41% from the end of last year.

The five biggest Chinese banks wrote off a total of 22.1 billion yuan of bad loans from their books in the first half of the year, in a bid to address a surge in bad assets and prepare for a fresh wave of defaults as the economy slows.

Information security is a priority for companies. But the process of keeping financial, employee and a host of other data safe is not without its challenges.

With this in mind, we posed the following question to The Experts: What is the information security issue (or two or three) that companies should be worried about?

This discussion relates to a recent Journal Report on "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-leadership.html?mg=inert-wsj" and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Oct. 24.

Employees: Beware What Your Company Knows About You

LEE NEWMAN: The importance of safeguarding employee data is not a new imperative, but I think there are reasons to believe it should be given much greater importance. With the rise of talent analytics, companies are collecting increasing quantities of information about their employees, and perhaps even more important is that the predictive power of this information is increasing as well.

As we continue to learn more about the scientific linkages between behavior, brain and body, the fact is that information collected about any one member of this triad has the potential to reveal much about the others. For example, measurements about a healthy person's gait while walking is now linked to the later onset of Alzheimer's disease. Several startup companies working with scientists are developing simple games that are thought to implicitly measure various cognitive abilities and personality traits.

Why does this matter? Companies are using increasingly sophisticated types of cognitive, emotional and social assessments of their employees with the objective of using advanced analytics to link these measures to performance. As both the scientific understanding of human behavior and the use of talent analytics advances, employee data collected and maintained by companies will become ever more predictive and revealing. This data in the wrong hands has the potential to ruin careers and lives, and companies have an obligation to take the effort required to safeguard it.

Use Big Data to Keep Big Data Secure

JEFF JONAS: Whether an organization loses all its data all at once or the adversary is able to find that one perfect record to steal, in either case, such unintended disclosures are "Wicked Leaks."

One major challenge is that the risk-assessment engines being deployed to alert humans about possible data breaches are all too often producing enormous volumes of false positives. Heck, there are not enough humans on Earth to inspect all these alerts.

More bad news: All of these potential alarms lying around in reports or queues each probably innocuous but possibly a smoking gun might be used against you if something goes wrong.

Imagine: Judgment day arrives after something bad happens. Forensic analysis is then performed to figure out how this breach went undetected, only to have the oversight committee say, "Look, the alert is right here in the alert log on page 32,912. If you had appropriately resourced, this disaster would not have happened!"

Will your organization be able to find leaks lurking in that Big Data?

Now the good news: Using Big Data on Big Data for better security will prove to be one of best ways to reduce false alarms.

Let me explain. If I handed you a puzzle piece with flames on it, would you think this is good news or bad news? Is this a fire in the fireplace near a glass of wine? Or is this a fire in the hallway? Without more context (related puzzle pieces), just staring at one transaction (a puzzle piece with flames on it), one might be inclined to raise an alarm just to be on the safe side, of course.

Context-accumulating engines, systems that weave the transactions of the enterprise together, will transform piles of puzzle pieces into pictures. With these more complete pictures will come fewer false alarms and, at the same time, the discovery of interesting, and otherwise nonobvious, real alarms.

Global Companies: Protect Your Intellectual Property

ROBERT HOWELL: The answer to this question depends, in great part, on the industry and specific company involved. However, generally speaking, in a competitive global environment, it is absolutely essential that intellectual property be protected. Without it, a firm loses its global competitive position and ability to ultimately survive.

Obviously, competitors always have the opportunity to "reverse-engineer" a company's existing products and services to understand how they work and how they differ from the competitor's own offerings. It is, however, what is in the R&D, process and organizational pipeline that has not been introduced which must be protected with a vengeance.

Second, it is essential that companies' financial systems not be hacked. Unfortunately, it is often company employees who, in the absence of tamper-proof internal controls, are often doing the hacking. However, especially in the case of financial institutions, breaches of security, from the outside, have had, and can have, significant economic consequences.

Third, hacking into a firm's customer information, including personal information and accounts is, potentially, another huge exposure risk. With the digitization of almost every kind of information, broad-based information-security management is both very challenging and absolutely essential.

Check Your Garbage! (Or How Discarded Hardware Can Hurt Companies)

ROBERT PLANT: Security is only as strong as the weakest link. One area frequently overlooked is the potential risks associated with systems, mobile devices and hardware when they reach the end of their useful life. Every day, vast amounts of hardware are discarded by firms replacing and upgrading their equipment. Usually, firms think that they are doing the right thing during decommissioning by ecologically recycling, perhaps deleting the hard drives and 'wiping' the phones.

However, once this has been done, few firms ever take the trouble to independently audit what is left on those drives or trace where they ultimately go in their long journey after they leave. Unfortunately, pressing "delete" is seldom enough. Law enforcement; the security services, and industrial spies who dumpster-dive (or more accurately bid on containers of e-waste) have the tools and the capabilities to retrieve your deleted data from sources such as cache memory and discarded routers. In addition, they can piece together data from multiple sources. For example, it is likely that whole trading floors' computers at an investment bank would be switched out in one go. A forensic-data-recovery specialist may buy the computers as a wholesale lot with the pretense of recycling them, only to then recover the data from each machine, creating a larger window into the original data set, and then sell this to a competitor interested in the originating banks' trading positions.

Another potential treasure trove for data spies is the office photocopier. These are often managed by a third-party vendor who one day just turns up and delivers a new one and everyone is happy. Unfortunately, many organizations do not undertake their own data-cleansing operation before handing over the machine to the vendor, nor do they stipulate what happens to the machine once it has left the premise.

Perhaps for many firms it is time to start reassessing their corporate-information disposal processes. They need to stop thinking of this as a disposal problem for facilities to handle, and realign this under the correct risk-management authority it truly deserves.

Fear of water shortages provides incentive to refine processes; Water

Investment in a basic natural resource will benefit us all, writes Rose Jacobs

There is a drip-drip feel to the development of tools for water retention, collection, treatment and reuse, says Simon Gottelier, head of water strategy at Apax Asset Management private equity group.

"It's not a market where there are huge numbers of new and exciting technologies. It's more a matter of adapting existing technologies to new circumstances."

For example desalination by reverse osmosis has been around since the late 17th century - though it took more than 200 years to apply that work outside the laboratory - while the listening sticks used by water workers to find leaks date back to Victorian times.

Yet Mr Gottelier is excited about growth prospects for water-focused companies, largely because of growing demand for the technologies they offer - however old-fashioned, or how slowly they develop.

Population growth, urbanisation, the developed world's ageing infrastructure, and climate change all point to increased water scarcity over the coming decades. Eiris, an environmental research group, forecasts that demand could exceed supply by 40 per cent by 2030.

"We would probably see the emerging markets as the principal drivers of opportunities in the sector," says Mr Gottelier, though he adds that the developed world's need to update water infrastructure comes in a close second.

The big disappointment among investors in the water sector over the past decade has been industrialised countries' failure to upgrade, in part because coping with the credit crunch and recession took precedence.

The big hope is that, with the worst of the economic malaise behind them, authorities will seek to address a backlog in repairs and overhauls that means 3-4 gallons of water are lost to leakage out of every 10 that pass through ageing systems. "Municipal tax receipts are looking healthier now, so projects that were delayed are back on the slate and ready for execution," says Mr Gottelier.

Mark Hanrahan, a director at PwC, does not foresee a step-change in spending by state governments or local authorities. But he has seen growing interest in the sector from a wide range of investors, with pension funds drawn to the stability of regulated assets, and organisations in the developing world seeking not just financial returns, but access to technologies that they might adopt.

Corporations, particularly in the food and beverage sector, are also driving growth, says Bjrn Haugland, chief sustainability officer at DNV-DL group, which offers clients water footprinting - assessments of a company's water usage, and its impact on the environment.

Mr Haugland believes regulations and international standards - such as a standard for water footprinting to be adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in mid-2014 - will make these measurement tools and methodologies more valuable.

And Mr Hanrahan thinks big data could change the water monitoring landscape fundamentally.

Sanjay Wijesekera, chief of water, sanitation and hygiene at Unicef, agrees that technologies that improve transparency will be central to combating the growing gap between supply and demand.

For example, being able to monitor water usage in real time, he says, "gives information to service providers and governments, but it also means organised -citizens can get involved. You start to see the level of discourse that can lead to change."

New and cheaper technologies are improving poor communities, he adds.

Pumps powered by solar energy panels have helped local governments in rural areas to distribute clean water to individual households, charge for the service, and pay back the initial capital costs within less than four years; household water treatment products have fallen in price, making them accessible for the first time to the world's poorest citizens; and desalination systems - which "traditionally we've not been even able to consider" - are also becoming cheaper, thanks to new technology.

Improved membranes are changing the way large desalination operations work, but energy costs are a bigger variable. That means most of the work on desalination is in parts of the world where water is scarce but fuel abundant, such as Saudi Arabia, Australia and parts of the US.

Mr Gottelier at Impax notes that in the US, at least, fracking could bring down the costs of desalination as well as ratchet up demand, given the large quantities of water the practice requires.

Researchers at Harvard point to concerns that the processes used in shale gas extraction could lead to the contamination of aquifers, and pollute water that cannot be returned to the system. This said, an Apax report published this year, points to opportunities for companies that offer water testing, treatment and recycling, and waste materials storage.

It says: "We could be about to witness a modern-day equivalent of selling shovels in a gold rush."

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Axa fund plunges two-thirds; Fund focus

Axa Framlington global equities fund hit hard by Mercer downgrade, writes Matthew Jeynes

The assets under management of the Axa Framlington Global Opportunities fund has plunged by two-thirds in just two months after a large consultancy slashed its rating.

Mercer, one of the world's biggest investment consulting firms, downgraded the fund in July in a move that triggered many exits from institutional investors.

The global equity fund had 293m of assets in mid-July but by mid-September this had fallen to 92.3m, according to estimates by FE Analytics.

Mark Hargraves, the fund's manager, says the rating cut follows the news in June that Anu Narula, his former co-manager, was leaving to join Mirabaud Asset Management.

"It is frustrating because you never like to lose assets, but it is up to us to get that rating back," he says.

The 37-year-old fund was once managed by First State's emerging market expert Jonathan Asante. Before that it was headed by Caspar Rock, now a multi-manager at Axa Architas.

In 2007, it was taken over by Mark Tinker, Axa Investment Managers' high-profile manager. It was renamed from its previous title, the Managed Growth fund, the following year.

But Mr Tinker's performance faltered in 2008 as he failed to foresee fully the deep financial crisis that engulfed the global economy. Macroeconomic expert Anu Narula joined as a co-manager in January 2009.

Mr Hargraves, who once co-managed the fund in the past, has recently rejoined to replace Mr Narula.

Since the downgrade, Axa has also announced that Mr Tinker is relocating to Hong Kong to work on the company's Asian expansion.

But while management turnover has been relatively high, the fund's performance has stabilised somewhat since the slump of 2008.

The fund ranked in the third quartile of the IMA Global sector in the past year. It delivered a 15.4 per cent return, just below the 15.7 per cent average return from the sector, although it has outperformed so far in 2013.

Mr Hargraves said he "would not dwell on the rating change", adding that the money flowing out had not disrupted the portfolio unduly or had an impact on the remaining investors.

He said he had not made any big changes to the portfolio since taking over and that he would continue to play the investment themes that were in place before he joined.

According to Mr Hargraves, a significant theme had been investing in developed-world companies that were taking advantage of the growth in Asia and the developing world.

However, the fund had avoided consumer stocks such as Unilever and pure emerging market themes, both of which have underperformed in recent months. The fund also has a bias towards gaming stocks and technology companies such as Google.

The Global Opportunities fund is not the only product affected by a recent reshuffle at Axa amid Mr Tinker's move to Asia.

The fund's offshore clone, the Luxembourg-based Axa WF Framlington Global Opportunities fund, which is distributed to continental European investors, has been handed over to the group's global sector team, led by Mr Hargraves. The fund will be managed in line with the existing Axa WF Framlington Global fund.

Axa recently appointed William Howard to manage the Axa WF Framlington Global High Income fund, with Anne Tolmunen as a deputy manager, and installed a number of deputy managers across its UK equity range.

The Hidden Upside of U.S.'s Budget Crisis

By E.S. Browning

The Washington mess of the past few weeks was ugly and disruptive for financial markets. It could do more damage in December as investors contemplate resumed acrimony when 2014 arrives.

Yet it all has a silver lining. The federal government's shutdown and threat of default on U.S. debt spawned anxiety among businesses and consumers, hurt the U.S.'s image around the world and took about half a percentage point off fourth-quarter economic growth, economists estimate.

But the economy kept growing. Inflation stayed low. And the turmoil is widely expected to keep the Federal Reserve more supportive of the economy and markets than money managers had anticipated until recently.

Analysts who have studied past market behavior say that backdrop -- moderate economic growth with low inflation and strong central-bank backing -- is excellent for stocks. That may help explain why financial markets remained fairly calm throughout the crisis and how the S&P 500 stock index finished Friday at 1744.50, a record high. The S&P 500 is up 22.3% this year.

"This is the best environment for stocks right now. You don't have rising interest rates becoming a problem. You don't have inflationary pressures. You do have earnings growth," said Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. The firm has studied stock performance in a wide variety of economic environments going back decades.

One of the most positive indicators today, Mr. Hayes said, is that unemployment is a high 7.3%, but declining.

"When the unemployment rate is above 6% and falling, that is the best situation for the stock market" based on the performance of the S&P 500 back to the 1940s, Mr. Hayes said.

Stocks average 13.5% annual gains when unemployment is above 6%, and 16.5% when the rate is that high and falling. Joblessness isn't good for ordinary people, of course, but stocks respond more to expectations for corporate earnings, inflation, interest rates and the like.

High unemployment is good for stocks if it holds down labor costs. High but falling unemployment is even better because it keeps a lid on costs and fuels consumer-spending growth, as expanding employment puts money in people's pockets.

Stocks also do better when earnings growth is below 5% on a year-over-year basis than when it is above 5%, according to the Ned Davis studies. That is because moderate earnings growth is less likely to spur inflation or push interest rates higher.

Another big boost for stocks is the growing hope that low inflation and worries about economic growth will induce the Federal Reserve to keep stimulating the economy by holding down long-term interest rates.

Over the summer, many investors expected the Fed would decide in September that the economy was strong enough for it to cut back on its $85 billion in monthly bond-buying stimulus. Then the Fed surprised investors by delaying action, citing among other things the risk to growth from Washington's fight over debt and government funding.

Now, many economists think the Fed could hold off until the end of the year or longer. Laurence Fink, chairman and chief executive of BlackRock Inc., which oversees $3.8 trillion and is the world's biggest asset manager, as well as other well-known Wall Street executives and investors, have predicted that the Fed could wait until March or even June.

Fed stimulus helps stocks because low interest rates hold down corporate costs, and the stimulus money itself leaks into the stock market, fueling investment there. The longer the Fed maintains the central bank's exceptionally supportive policy, the longer stocks benefit, said Michael Fredericks, a BlackRock portfolio manager.

Mr. Fredericks also has studied the market's behavior during varying economic circumstances. He agrees with Mr. Hayes of Ned Davis that low inflation and low labor costs help stock performance. Mr. Fredericks believes strong growth is better than slow growth, but the two men define slow growth differently, making it hard to compare their views. The two agree on the Fed's importance to continued stock gains, especially now.

"We think a lot of this comes down to just the importance of central-bank policy," Mr. Fredericks said.

A big question for the future, he said, is how and when central banks around the world unwind their financial stimulus. Mr. Hayes thinks how that is handled could determine when stocks next face a bear market, most commonly defined as a 20% decline from a high. While he is optimistic about the immediate future, he said he wouldn't be surprised to see stocks pull back by next summer.

Such a decline is common after stocks have risen strongly for years, Mr. Hayes said. That is especially true when stock prices are above average when compared to corporate earnings, as they are today. The S&P 500 trades at more than 18 times its component companies' earnings for the past 12 months, above the historical average of about 16.

"I wouldn't be surprised if we see a cyclical bear market next year" or at least a sharp decline, Mr. Hayes said.

His best guess about the trigger: continued stock gains that make the market look expensive whenever the Fed finally trims its bond-buying stimulus and pushes long-term interest rates higher.

But as long as inflation remains low and the economy is growing, any pullback could be brief, he said. The economic backdrop would support renewed stock gains, assuming Washington isn't back in crisis when the Fed is withdrawing stimulus.

Eventually, dysfunction in Washington is bad for the stock market and economy, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

For years, the ability to cut labor costs has helped companies remain profitable despite limited business investment, he said. Now, wages and hiring are on the rise. Future business success depends on expansion and investment. Stocks seem to be shrugging off Washington's acrimony in the short run, but in the longer run it damages business confidence and limits investment, Mr. Zandi said.

"I'm not sure I draw the conclusion that this kind of climate is good for business and stock investors in the long run," he said.

Health Website Woes Widen As Insurers Get Wrong Data

By Christopher Weaver and Louise Radnofsky

Insurers say the federal health-care marketplace is generating flawed data that is straining their ability to handle even the trickle of enrollees who have gotten through so far, in a sign that technological problems extend further than the website traffic and software issues already identified.

Emerging errors include duplicate enrollments, spouses reported as children, missing data fields and suspect eligibility determinations, say executives at more than a dozen health plans. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Nebraska said it had to hire temporary workers to contact new customers directly to resolve inaccuracies in submissions. Medical Mutual of Ohio said one customer had successfully signed up for three of its plans.

The flaws could do lasting damage to the law if customers are deterred from signing up or mistakenly believe they have obtained coverage.

"The longer this takes to resolve . . . the harder it will be to get people to [come back and] sign up," said Aetna Inc. Chief Executive Mark Bertolini. "It's not off to a great start," he said, though he believes the marketplaces are "here to stay."

The new troubles for the Affordable Care Act arrive as Washington's attention is expected to sharply shift toward scrutiny of the site's rocky rollout, whose problems had been overshadowed by a two-week brawl over the government shutdown and debt ceiling.

Pressure is rising on the Obama administration to fix the problems. A number of Republicans have urged Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, to resign. Prominent Democrats, including House Ways and Means ranking member Rep. Sander Levin (D., Mich.), have called for fixes to be accelerated. The White House has said it has full confidence in Ms. Sebelius.

HHS, which is running all or part of the marketplaces in 36 states, has repeatedly declined to answer specific questions about its handling of the rollout, including specific glitches, enrollment figures, or its plans to fix the problems.

"We know that people are enrolling in coverage and the system works. As individual problems are raised by insurers, we work aggressively to address them," HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said Thursday.

Health-department officials have pressured insurers to refrain from commenting publicly about the problems, according to executives at four health plans, who asked not to be named. The HHS declined to comment.

In prolonging the battles over the budget and debt ceiling, "all Republicans did was give [President Obama] great cover for the complete screw-up on the opening of the exchanges," said Gail Wilensky, a Medicare director in the administration of George H.W. Bush and UnitedHealth Group Inc. board member.

But the persistence of the technological problems could force a steeper political price for the Obama administration as Republican lawmakers redirect their focus. The GOP-led House Energy and Commerce Committee announced Thursday night it would hold a hearing next week on the rollout of the law and called on HHS to "voluntarily" make officials available after the secretary's staff said she couldn't come. Ms Peters said the department intended to be "responsive" to the request.

Under the law, most Americans would have to buy coverage starting next year, or pay a fine.

The latest round of problems has emerged after a technical bottleneck that blocked many potential customers from accessing the marketplace began to clear this week. People familiar with the development of the exchange said some technical problems improved this week.

Of 209,000 users who began to register on healthcare.gov on Monday or Tuesday of this week, just over one-quarter finished the process, according to an estimate made by the analytics firm comScore for The Wall Street Journal. In the first week, only 10% did so. The estimates are based on a sampling of Internet users tracked by the company.

As more of those users attempted to sign up for plans this week, insurers began noticing problems with enrollment data. For now, they say they are largely able to manually correct the errors. But as enrollment increases -- up to 7 million consumers are expected to sign up in the next 5 1/2 months -- that may not be possible, they worry.

Scott & White Health Plan in Temple, Texas, has received 25 enrollees from the federally run exchange so far. "There are some missing data elements that are requiring a lot of research on our part," said Allan Einboden, the health plan's chief executive. "If we'd received 5,000 and they all had to be worked, that's a lot of extra administrative costs," said Mr. Einboden, who said he expects the problems to be fixed.

After realizing that some applications listed up to three spouses in a single family, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Nebraska, which has about 50 health-law enrollees, had to "stop those enrollments from going through the automated process," said Matt Leonard, the insurer's sales manager. "It takes an automated process and turns it into a manual process," he said.

At Priority Health in Michigan, health-plan staff are calling new customers to confirm each of their "couple of dozen" enrollees accurately picked the plan, said Joan Budden, chief marketing officer, after realizing some had enrolled in multiple health plans, likely owing to user error linked to slow healthcare.gov response times. "Sometimes they pushed the [submit] button three times," Ms. Budden said.

As consumers struggle to navigate healthcare.gov, some health-plan executives worry that only the sickest -- those who most expect to need insurance -- will persist in seeking coverage. If younger consumers who are on the fence about buying coverage find the process too onerous, insurers may end up with too few healthier members to offset the costs of less-healthy enrollees.

Tara Seidenberg, a 48-year-old paralegal from suburban Houston with multiple sclerosis, says she is likely to put up with all kinds of hurdles to buy coverage. After days of failed attempts to sign up on healthcare.gov, she is taking a break to wait for the glitches to resolve. She takes medications that cost $4,600 a month and her current coverage won't be available next year. "I'm pretty much guaranteed to try it again," Ms. Seidenberg said.

Is Hedge-Fund Advertising Good or Bad for Investors?

Hedge funds can now advertise. But it remains to be seen what this will mean for individuals.

With this in mind, we asked The Experts: Is the lifting of the ban on hedge-fund advertising good or bad for investors?

This discussion relates to a recent Journal Report article on how to look under a hedge fund's hood and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Oct. 8.

GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS: At first, I had mixed feelings about it. I can understand the reasons behind the Securities and Exchange Commission voting to change this rule that has been in place for decades. As part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), this rule intended to make it easier for companies to raise funds, and presumably hire more people. Our economy can certainly use more jobs. We will just have to see how much of this happens in practice.

I do not expect to see commercials for hedge funds while watching CNN or the Super Bowl anytime soon. Remember, the hedge-fund industry has long been quite secretive and thrived on this exclusivity. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see how mutual funds react to this new entrant onto their turf and, most importantly, the variation that will undoubtedly develop in touting performance numbers. The mutual-fund industry must adhere to uniform rules on how to advertise performance; the hedge-fund industry does not. I can see a commercial already claiming, "The XYZ hedge fund beat all U.S.-based mutual funds by X% last month. Get in NOW!"

Investors must be extra vigilant, and they still are better off steering clear of hedge funds. Not only will they likely end up with more money in their pockets; they will certainly sleep better at night.

For a collection of hilarious tweets on this subject please check this article: "Hedge Fund Ads Allowed by SEC: Some Creative Slogans."

George Papadopoulos is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich., serving affluent individuals and families. You can follow him at twitter (@feeonlyplanner), connect with him at Google+ or visit his firm's website.

MANISHA THAKOR: Ironically, I think lifting the ban on hedge-fund advertising is good for investors. As someone who thinks it's the rare average individual who should even consider investing in a hedge fund, that may sound odd.

The reason I support advertising is that it lifts the veil of secrecy and exclusivity that has so long surrounded the hedge-fund world. Let's face it, it's just plain old human nature to want what we can't have. By peering behind the screen, the discerning potential individual investor can see for themselves the generally hefty fee structures and often surprisingly lackluster returns relative to overall market indexes. (Don't take my word for it, review the eye-popping data as compiled by my BAM Alliance colleague Larry Swedroe for yourself).

As Groucho Marx said, "I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member." Lifting the ban on advertising may encourage more individuals to say the same thing about hedge funds.

Manisha Thakor (@ManishaThakor) is the founder and CEO of Santa Fe, N.M.-based MoneyZen Wealth Management VLLC, an independent registered investment adviser and member of the BAM Alliance).

TOM BRAKKE: It is hard to see any benefit for investors, since those qualified (in a legal sense) to invest in hedge funds already could do so.

For perspective, look at the mutual-fund industry. It spends huge money on advertising and other marketing activities, and it doesn't seem that investors have gotten more educated about investing as a result or received very good investment outcomes overall. Many mutual-fund firms appear to spend a lot more money and energy on gathering assets than on managing them well.

Of late, lackluster performance by hedge funds has led to a debate about whether it makes sense to invest in them at all. There has been no shortage of big paydays for hedge-fund managers, however. No wonder that hedge funds have been called "a compensation scheme rather than an asset class." (For what it's worth, that saying has been around at least 20 years.)

As is true in every part of the investment business, there will always be some hedge funds that do better than others for a period of time. Just like with mutual funds, those stars often turn into shooting stars about the time the advertising campaigns really kick into gear.

Tom Brakke, CFA (@researchpuzzler) is a consultant, writer, and investment advisor who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

CHARLES ROTBLUT : The lifting of the ban on hedge-fund advertising is a win for the industry and a loss for investors. The advertising is going to lure in investors who don't understand what they are investing in.

The term "hedge fund" has become a catchall phrase for a vehicle that invests in any strategy a manager can create. Though there are probably some funds that still attempt to hedge against certain risks, many other funds focus either on a total return or some type of alternative return rather than truly attempting to hedge risk. Some of these strategies are very complex and not even easy for those of us who are professionals to grasp by simply reading a prospectus.

A recent survey by Charles Schwab supports my reason for concern. Over half of 401(k) participants surveyed said "401(k) investment info is more confusing than health-care benefits info." If investors don't understand their mutual-fund choices, they are certainly not going to understand their hedge-fund choices.

Then there is the issue of actual benefit. Hedge funds follow a "heads we win, tails you lose" type of fee system. The traditional fee is 2% of assets managed and 20% of profits realized. Making matters worse, the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index lost 13.6% over the past five years, according to Barry Ritholtz of Fusion IQ.

Finally, there is the question of why a top-performing hedge fund would advertise at all. Too much in assets under management ruins returns, as has occurred in the mutual-fund space. Thus, investors would be wise to follow a paraphrased version of Groucho Marx's observation and refuse to join any hedge fund that would have them as a shareholder.

Charles Rotblut (@charlesrotblut) is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors .

RICK FERRI: The only item that has changed is that hedge funds are now allowed to advertise like mutual funds. That may make some hedge funds more visible, but I'm not sure it's in the best interest of people to buy these funds. Aren't the best funds supposed to be exclusive offerings that only the chosen few are invited to buy into? I see a potential red flag in hedge funds that need to reach out to the general public for funding.

I don't invest in hedge funds or recommend them to my clients. Why make things more complicated than they need to be? A portfolio of low-cost index funds is all that's needed for financial success.

Rick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is RickFerri.com.

MATT HOUGAN: That strikes me as the wrong question. We've let mutual funds that charge way too much, offer terrible transparency and deliver subpar returns advertise direct to consumers for decades. Why should hedge funds be any different?

Given that past performance is no guarantee of future returns, the bigger advertising question we should ask is: Should any fund company be allowed to advertise returns of any kind to investors? My guess is we'd be a lot better off if they couldn't.

Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

JOHN ROGERS : So long as the advertising adheres to common and accepted standards of performance presentation, such as the Global Investment Performance Standards, then this has the potential for benefiting investors.

CFA Institute has long held that relevant, timely and complete information is necessary for investors to make informed decisions, and advertising in this manner may assist investors in that goal. The key to positive results, however, is for regulators to ensure that the advertising is directed at so-called accredited investors who have the means, experience and understanding sufficient to help them discern fact from flattering exaggeration.

John Rogers is the president and chief executive of the CFA Institute.

LARRY ZIMPLEMAN : It will be interesting to see how the lifting of the ban on hedge-fund advertising may cause other changes in the traditional hedge-fund industry.

Historically, hedge funds have restricted their activity to institutional investors and to individuals who have substantial net worth thus, not a lot of need for general retail advertising. Now that the ban is lifted, will some hedge funds seek to find ways to offer products that might appeal to more traditional retail investors? I think that any changes will occur relatively slowly and over time. But, in the long run, it may open up some additional investing options for the more typical retail investor.

Star Manager Neil Woodford to Leave Invesco; Plans New Business Serving Institutional, Retail Clients

Invesco Perpetual's multibillion-dollar man is quitting to set up his own fund.

Neil Woodford, who personally manages about 27 billion ($43 billion) across five separate funds, said in a statement that he is planning to set up a new fund-management business aimed at institutional and retail clients next year.

Mr. Woodford, who has been at Invesco for 25 years, has become one of the U.K.'s highest-profile fund managers. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire this year for services to the economy. His departure will likely be seen as a blow for the Atlanta-based investment firm.

Its U.K. arm, Invesco Perpetual, is one of Britain's largest money managers.

"Clearly, there are a number of very good portfolio managers at Invesco Perpetual but Neil Woodford has been the name behind their strategy and success in recent years," said Edward Rogers, senior investment manager at JM Finn, a British investment-management firm.

The departure of a high-profile manager can trigger outflows. This year, U.K. equities manager Richard Buxton left Schroders as head of the Schroder UK Alpha Plus fund in March. Around 1.7 billion left the Schroders fund between the end of March and early August after Mr. Buxton's move to rival Old Mutual.

Liontrust Asset Management suffered a drop in assets under management of more than 2 billion following the departure of two star managers in January 2009. Before the exit of Jeremy Lang and Bill Pattisson, who ran about 90% of Liontrust's funds between them, assets under management stood at 3.4 billion. By March of 2009, assets had fallen to 1.1 billion.

"I expect many Woodford followers will migrate with him in due course," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, chief economist and strategist at London-based brokerage Charles Stanley.

"Most of Woodford's money, totally over 30 billion, is invested with him because of who he is and his success," Tim Cockerill, investment director at Rowan Dartington, said.

Some of the funds Mr. Woodford manages are among the strongest performers in the industry. The 13.9 billion Invesco Perpetual High Income had annualized returns of 12.2% over the 10 years ending September 2013, while the 10.6 billion income fund has achieved 12.1% over the same period, according to FE Analytics. The benchmark return of the Investment Management Association Equity Income sector was 8.5% over the same period.

Mr. Woodford is to continue managing both funds until he leaves Invesco on April 29, when Mark Barnett will take over as head of U.K. equities. Mr. Woodford couldn't be reached to comment.

Mark Armour, chief executive of Invesco Perpetual, said succession has been planned for many years. Mr. Woodford started out at Dominion Insurance in 1981 before joining insurer Eagle Star six years later.

Invesco Perpetual's multibillion-dollar man, Neil Woodford, will leave the fund manager, one of the U.K.'s largest, next April, with the aim of setting up a new fund-management business.

Mr. Woodford will stay on as manager of the GBP 13.9 billion ($22.2 billion) Invesco Perpetual High Income and GBP 10.6 billion Income funds until his departure on April 29, 2014, when Mark Barnett will take over as head of U.K. equities.

The High Income fund has achieved annualized returns of 12.2% during the 10 years through the end of September 2013, while the Income fund has achieved 12.1% over the same period, according to FE Analytics. Mr. Woodford is the sole manager of these funds and one of the U.K.'s highest-profile fund managers. He also has sole responsibility for the SJP U.K. High Income and SJP Strategic Managed funds, which manage combined assets of GBP 1.35 billion. Outside these four funds, he also runs the closed-ended Edinburgh Investment Trust, which has a further GBP 1.17 billion in assets.

"My decision to leave is a personal one based on my views about where I see long-term opportunities in the fund-management industry," Mr. Woodford said in a statement. "My intention is to establish a new fund-management business serving institutional and retail clients as soon as possible after 29th April 2014. There will be no further comment at this stage."

The departure of a high-profile manager can trigger outflows. This year, U.K. equities manager Richard Buxton left Schroders as head of the Schroder UK Alpha Plus fund in March. Mr. Buxton's move to Old Mutual led to around GBP 1.7 billion leaving the Schroders fund between the end of March and early August.

Liontrust Asset Management suffered a drop in assets under management of more than GBP 2 billion following the departure of two star managers in January 2009. Prior to the exit of Jeremy Lang and Bill Pattisson, who ran about 90% of Liontrust's funds between them, assets under management stood at GBP 3.4 billion. By March of 2009, assets had fallen to GBP 1.1 billion.

"I expect many Woodford followers will migrate with him in due course," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, chief economist and strategist at London-based brokerage Charles Stanley.

Mr. Woodford started out at Dominion Insurance in 1981 before joining Eagle Star six years later. He is a graduate of Exeter University and London Business School.

Mark Armour, chief executive of Invesco Perpetual, acknowledged Mr. Woodford's considerable contribution to the company over the past 25 years and said he was ready for new challenges.

Mr. Armour said the succession has been in the planning for many years and that Mr. Barnett was an "exceptional" fund manager.

Ciaran Mallon is to take responsibility for the U.K. equity part of the Monthly Income Plus and Distribution funds, effective immediately, working alongside existing fixed-income managers Paul Causer and Paul Read. Mr. Woodford previously ran the U.K. equity element of these funds.

A J.P. Morgan Doctorate?; The Bank May Need One to Understand Itself

J.P. Morgan Chase has grown so complex that people now have to get doctorate degrees in J.P. Morgan Chase.

America's biggest bank by assets is trying to buy itself a doctoral program at the University of Delaware. It has offered to spend $17 million to help students earn advanced degrees in "financial analytics," according to a report last week by Insider Higher Ed.

Some faculty are calling it the "J.P. Morgan Ph.D." They argue the program would cross a line between financial support and financial control of a quasi-public university. The $2.5 trillion bank wants to select the faculty that would run the program and even place its own employees on dissertation committees, roles traditionally left to academicians.

Professors also complain that the bank's grip on the school is tightening with each donation. It has even set up an office on campus using student interns. "I like banks and corporations but not on campus," Sheldon Pollack, a law and political-science professor told The Atlantic.

If this were a master's program, an arrangement like this would be acceptable, Mr. Pollack explained. M.B.A.s, after all, are professional degrees. But this is a doctoral program, and doctorates are academic degrees.

Such purist views are almost always sidelined by money. The fact is, J.P. Morgan has grown so large it needs Ph.D.s to help it understand itself. Course work could include a host of topics that have emerged in just the past few years:

"How to trade like the London Whale." Explain how the bank lost $6 billion in reckless derivatives trades and had to pay regulators a $920 million fine for "unsafe and unsound practices."

"How to properly foreclose on a home." Explain why the bank had to pony up billions for wrongfully foreclosing on active-duty military personnel as well as what regulators called "shoddy loan servicing, illegal robo-signing, and faulty foreclosure processing."

"How to bounce checks." Explain why J.P. Morgan had to settle litigation alleging it processed its customers' checks by size, rather than the order in which they were cashed, so it could bag unwarranted overdraft fees.

"Define 'misappropriation of funds.' " Explain why J.P. Morgan was forced to repay $546 million to MF Global customers after its collapse.

"How to manipulate energy prices." Explain why J.P. Morgan had to pay $410 million in fines for allegedly engaging in the same kind of illegal activity as Enron.

"How to rig the bond market." Explore J.P. Morgan's $229 million settlement with federal and state authorities for allegedly gaming the bidding process for bond deals affecting 31 states.

"What is a 'fortress balance sheet'?" J.P. Morgan CEO James Dimon used to brag that his bank had a "fortress balance sheet." It didn't need the bailout it got during the 2008 financial crisis, but was forced to take it, he said. Investigate whether this is true.

Complexity is hitting the bottom line: On Friday the bank reported its first quarterly loss under Mr. Dimon $380 million, compared with a year-earlier $5.7 billion profit.

I think J.P. Morgan gets in trouble not because Mr. Dimon is a bad guy, but because its sheer size makes it unmanageable. It has thousands of Type-A personalities running over themselves to get deals done. No one can keep a firm handle on them all.

Candidates for a J.P. Morgan Ph.D. will need all the help they can get.

U.S. News: Health Exchange's Flaws Pinpointed

Government officials are considering rebuilding some parts of the federally run health-insurance marketplace that have been identified as the key flaws that blocked many consumers from getting coverage.

Much of the problem stems from a design element that requires users of the federal site, which serves 36 states, to create accounts before shopping for insurance, according to policy and technology experts. The site, healthcare.gov, was initially going to include an option to browse before registering, but that tool was delayed, people familiar with the situation said.

The decision to move ahead without that feature proved crucial because, before users can begin shopping for coverage, they must cross a busy digital junction in which data are swapped among computer systems built or run by contractors including CGI Group Inc., the healthcare.gov developer; Quality Software Services Inc., a UnitedHealth Group Inc. unit; and credit-checker Experian PLC.

If any part of the web of systems fails to work properly, it could lead to a traffic jam blocking most users from the marketplace. That's just what happened: On Oct. 2, officials identified a bottleneck where those systems intersect at a software component sold by Oracle Corp. that still hasn't been cleared.

The series of decisions and technical stumbles came together like a perfect storm amid political pressure to open the marketplaces on the health-overhaul law's deadline of Oct. 1, according to the accounts of multiple people involved in the exchange and experts following the developments. As a result, many fewer people are able to navigate the marketplace than called for in the initial plan, said people familiar with the situation.

Former officials at the Department of Health and Human Services say the decision to require account creation came as a surprise to them and were critical of it. "People should be able to get [insurance] quotes" without going through the technical hurdles upfront, said Jay Angoff, a former director of the federal office overseeing the development of the marketplace.

The problems haven't yet been resolved, but people familiar with the situation said officials are debating whether to replace parts of the registration system this weekend. By Thursday morning, a new tool that allows users to preview plans without registering appeared on the site with little fanfare.

The work has led to improvements in recent days, people familiar with the matter said. HHS officials said some consumers were able to complete applications, though they have declined to specify how many people.

Of just over two million users who visited healthcare.gov's registration page through last Sunday, about 125,000 made it to the end of the account creation process, according to an estimate by Internet analytics company comScore. The estimate, made at The Wall Street Journal's request, was based on a sampling of computer users tracked by the company.

An HHS spokeswoman, Joanne Peters, declined to answer detailed questions provided Wednesday and Thursday by the Journal. The department said government information-technology experts and contractors were working around the clock to improve the website's performance. "We have a plan in place and are making progress," Ms. Peters said Wednesday.

The main bottleneck federal officials are now plumbing occurs as the slate of registration systems intersect with Oracle Identity Manager, a software component embedded in a government identity-checking system, according to people familiar with the situation. Late on Wednesday, Oct. 2, Oracle sent a handful of experts from California, where the firm is based, to the Washington area to begin work on the problems, some of the people said.

"Our software is the identical product deployed in most of the world's most complex systems" and is working correctly, Oracle said in a statement issued by Deborah Hellinger, vice president of corporate communications. Oracle engineers have worked with other contractors to fix configurations and add server capacity, she said.

Obama administration officials initially attributed the site's problems to an unexpectedly high volume of Web traffic driven by consumer enthusiasm for coverage under the law -- some nine million visitors as of last Friday. The administration has conceded that software and design issues also contributed to hang-ups.

Outside technology experts and people close to the situation say the first week and half of exchange operations has revealed a half-finished product.

"The fatal mistake they made is bringing up everything at once," making debugging the sprawling system a challenge, said David Starr, a former chief information officer for 3Com Corp., ITT Corp. and other large companies.

Federal officials had debated internally whether to allow users to view plans without applying, according to people familiar with the process.

An HHS spokeswoman said the agency wanted to ensure that users were aware of their eligibility for subsidies that could help pay for coverage, before they started seeing the prices of policies.

What CFOs Are Saying About the Shutdown; Companies' Businesses Could Suffer Because of Furloughs and Agency Closures

As companies begin reporting third-quarter financial results this week, executives are warning that a long-term government shutdown could crimp their businesses, especially if they are close to federal installations or have customers near the poverty line.

Scores of companies in nearly 200 public filings have already cautioned investors that their businesses could suffer from the shutdown, in its ninth day Wednesday. Among them: J.C. Penney Co ., Family Dollar Stores Inc . and Humana Inc ., which all warned this week of the potential bottom-line consequences of broad federal furloughs and agency closures.

"Over half of our customers are on &some sort of government assistance," Howard Levine , chief executive of Family Dollar Stores, told investors Wednesday. The current and potential economic effects of the shutdown "are very real to our customer every day."

In addition, corporate plans for mergers and acquisitions could be put on hold as executives wait for the government to reach an agreement on a new budget and a higher debt ceiling.

Mergers typically require antitrust and government reviews, said Keith Moore , a managing director with MKM Partners LLC , an equity research firm, and though various agencies are accepting applications, it remains uncertain when they will be able to provide clearances. Plus, the risk of a U.S. government default on its debt could roil stock markets and make any negotiated deal premiums look foolish in retrospect.

"Over the past two weeks we saw what seemed to be an acceleration" in deal making, Mr. Moore said. "But there was nothing on Monday," which is often the busiest day of the week.

Every week that the government is closed trims economic output by an estimated $800 million, or 0.08 percentage point for the quarter, according to the economic research firm IHS Inc . "If the shutdown drags on," it said, "the effects will start to add up."

The biggest casualties will be government contractors, aerospace and defense companies and firms, such as pharmaceutical makers, that rely on agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration for approvals. But in addition, companies that serve budget-conscious customers, such as Costco Wholesale Corp ., are feeling the impact.

When the government last shut down for 21 days ending in January 1996, the gross domestic product was sliced by 0.5 percentage point for the 1995 fourth quarter, and "the technology boom of that time made underlying growth much stronger than it is today," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

Intel Corp . Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith is worried about another battle over raising the debt ceiling.

"We saw it with the last fight: It had a real impact on the economy for the past couple of quarters," he said in an interview last month. "It impacted people's confidence."

And with the year-end shopping season approaching, that is critical, especially for retailers. According to a transcript from S&P Capital IQ, Charles Bergh , chief executive of Levi Strauss & Co ., told investors last week, "If that is a prolonged [shutdown], that is going to have a market impact, I think, on everyone's business as we cruise into the holiday season."

Stocks had been stoic toward the beginning of the shutdown, but by Wednesday's close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 2%.

In addition, the price to borrow cash against securities such as Treasurys is rising, and some lenders are unwilling to accept Treasury securities maturing in October as backing for their loans. The Treasury Department has indicated it could reach its borrowing capacity around Oct. 17.

Penney on Tuesday added the following disclaimer to its list of what could throw off its business projections: "the ability of the federal government to fund and conduct its operations."

A Penney spokeswoman said the company's "risk factors encompass everything that &could materially adversely affect our business [including] factors beyond our control."

Wolverine World Wide Inc ., meanwhile, was more specific. Its new risk-factor disclosure cautioned of "delays in importing products at U.S. ports, supply-chain disruption and reduced purchasing by the Department of Defense or other military purchasers."

A spokesman for the footwear maker didn't respond to a request for comment.

Humana said the Defense Health Agency told it last week that the agency can't make payments "until it has received a signed appropriation, continuing resolution or other legal authority." The agency also told Humana that, once it has that, "all payments due will be accelerated with interest."

The agency authorized Humana to continue to administer benefits for two weeks without payments, the company said. Humana didn't say what would happen after that, but it expects the claims submitted during that time will total about $175 million and doesn't believe the payment halt will have a material negative effect on its operations.

A Humana spokesman didn't respond to a request for additional comment.

On Wednesday, Costco reported a scant increase in sales growth. And despite the shaky economy, which has encouraged shoppers to make bulk purchases to save money, the wholesaler is already noticing a drop in customers around Washington, D.C., where many furloughed government employees live.

Asked by a stock analyst whether there was anything strategic Costco was doing because of the shutdown, CFO Richard Galanti deadpanned: "Other than scratching our head in disbelief?"

Lenders Scour Emails Amid Currency Probe

Several of the world's largest banks have searched through emails and other electronic communications of employees in response to probes by European regulators into suspected manipulation of foreign-exchange markets, according to people familiar with the matter.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC has turned over electronic communications by a former employee to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, one person said. As part of the FCA investigation, which began in June, the largest banks in the business are examining their own trading patterns or communications -- including Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. and Barclays PLC, according to other people familiar with the matter.

The actions indicate that ongoing examinations of currency markets by regulators in Switzerland, the U.K. and Brussels are gaining traction.

Early Wednesday, Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf raised eyebrows by telling reporters that manipulation of foreign-exchange rates "has taken place." Later in the day, however, a spokesman for the Swiss Federal Department of Finance said that she had misspoken and meant to say the Swiss market regulator was examining the issue. Switzerland's main market regulator, Finma, said Friday it was investigating several Swiss financial institutions for possible manipulation of exchange rates.

Much of the concern centers on "fixes" -- daily snapshots of where currencies are trading.

Some investors are already steering clear of these fixes. They worry that they are receiving disadvantageous prices for currency transactions, and that the process for determining the so-called fixes is too opaque.

Currencies trade around the globe and around the clock, so there is no moment when the market closes to use as a daily benchmark. Instead, data providers take periodic snapshots; the most popular is the price computed at 4 p.m. London time by WM/Reuters, a joint venture between State Street's WM unit and Thomson Reuters. That fix serves as a reference point, and many investors will ask their banks to process transactions at the fix price.

But some market participants have grown wary of the fix, which they say is plagued by unexplained price spikes and variable liquidity.

A spokeswoman for WM referred a reporter to a document on the company's website that describes the methodology for computing the fixes. A spokesman for Thomson Reuters said the company provides data from which WM calculates the benchmark. Thomson Reuters would cooperate with any regulators' enquiries, he said.

"Unless you are forced to trade at a certain benchmark, you are better off avoiding the fix," said Klaus Paesler, head of currency and overlay strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Russell Investments, a big asset manager that offers its own foreign-exchange services. "Fixes can be points of low liquidity and increased volatility with higher transaction costs versus the average price of the day."

In addition to the Swiss regulator, the EU's antitrust commission is looking at allegations of exchange-rate manipulation "at a very preliminary stage," said spokesman Antoine Colombani on Tuesday.

It wasn't clear when RBS turned over the electronic communications to the FCA, or whether those communications formed the bank's entire submission to the regulator. News that it had done so was earlier reported by Bloomberg.

The person familiar with the matter said the former employee left the bank some time ago for reasons unrelated to the probe.

The precise focus of the investigations also isn't clear.

The WM/Reuters fix is computed by examining trade data received from multiple execution venues over a period of 60 seconds around 4 p.m.

Major currency pairs, such as the euro-dollar or the pound-dollar, are heavily traded, which suggests collusion to influence the rate would be a difficult undertaking.

For less-liquid currencies, WM/Reuters uses bid and offer rates seen in the market and applies "further quality checks," according to the document posted on the WM website.

Fixes are especially popular with index funds designed to track the broader market. By executing currency trades at the fix price, funds can ensure that foreign-exchange fluctuations don't cause their returns to drift from the indexes.

But some investors and investment advisers believe the opaque nature of the calculations -- it's impossible to know whose big trades might be swinging the fix price up or down -- is a danger sign.

"Our clients, such as local pension funds, come to us with the explicit request to trade at fixes also because this is recommended by their investment consultants. But we have serious concerns over their use," said the head of trading at an asset-management firm. "They do not always guarantee the most transparent rate."

Stuart Catt of Mercer Consulting, which advises clients about investment strategy, said there were better alternatives to fixes.

"You can be less confident the price you get at 4 p.m. is good, as it's more likely to be affected by market activity," Mr. Catt said. Banks "are certainly aware of the volume of institutional client activity predicated on the 4 p.m. fix and seek to position their books to benefit from this."

James Cochrane, a director at ITG Analytics, said he didn't recommend the fix to his clients. "For one thing, the pricing is not always great, and for another, there is no one watching this, no watchdog," he said. "It is an unregulated benchmark."

Healthcare.Gov's Flaws Found, Fixes Eyed; Site's Design Opened Door to Bottleneck That Persists

Healthcare.gov's main application, developed by CGI, collects information from users as they begin creating accounts. It transfers that data to a Quality Software Services system used by the federal Medicare agency called Enterprise Identification Management. That system, in turn, submits data to Experian, which loads a series of questions used to confirm new users' identities.

Quality Software Services subcontracted with Oracle for the identity management system's key software component, according to people familiar with the matter. The other systems are not interfacing consistently with the Oracle software, blocking many users from completing the registration process, other people said.

"Our software is the identical product deployed in most of the world's most complex systems" and is working correctly, Oracle said in a statement issued by Deborah Hellinger, vice president of corporate communications. Oracle engineers have worked with other contractors to fix configurations and add server capacity, she said.

Obama administration officials initially attributed the site's problems to an unexpectedly high volume of Web traffic driven by consumer enthusiasm for coverage under the law some nine million visitors as of last Friday. The administration has conceded that software and design issues also contributed to hang-ups.

But officials maintained this week in conversations with congressional Democrats that the main issue with the site is its popularity and focused on expanded server capacity as a solution to that problem, congressional aides said.

Outside technology experts and people close to the situation say the first week and half of exchange operations has revealed a half-finished product.

"The fatal mistake they made is bringing up everything at once," making debugging the sprawling system a challenge, said David Starr, a former chief information officer for 3Com Corp., ITT Corp. and other large companies. But, "it's almost always better to postpone things than bring them up broken," said Mr. Starr, who is not involved in the exchange development.

The problem might have been largely averted if consumers had been able to browse plans without going through the complex registration process first, experts say.

"If you put a critical pathway at the front of the experience, you're going to logjam everything," said Patrick Byrne, chief executive of Overstock.com, an e-commerce company. "If you have a bunch of Web services talking to each other, you want to put the transaction at the end," he said.

Several states that took that approach 14 states are running their own exchanges have seen more success managing the tide of Web traffic. Washington state, California, Kentucky and other states that allow so-called window shopping have largely overcome early glitches. In Washington, for instance, 10,000 people have enrolled in coverage and thousands more have begun applying, officials said.

Federal officials had debated internally whether to allow users to view plans without applying, according to people familiar with the process.

An HHS spokeswoman said the agency wanted to ensure that users were aware of their eligibility for subsidies that could help pay for coverage, before they started seeing the prices of policies.

Distressed debt group raises 50m

Sale of stake values business at 360m

Shares in Arrow Global, one of the UK's biggest debt recovery companies, jumped yesterday after the group made its debut on the stock market.

Arrow, which buys distressed consumer debt from banks and credit card companies, priced the sale of a 52.8 per cent stake at 205p, valuing the company at about 360m. The shares rose to a high of 227p before falling to 218.5p at the close.

The listing raised about 50m for the company and about 140m for its shareholders, which include a fund run by Royal Bank of Scotland . The RBS Special Opportunities Fund has retained slightly less than 30 per cent of Arrow's shares. Sir George Mathewson, former chief executive of RBS, is a non-executive director.

Arrow owns and manages about 8bn of distressed consumer debt and has about 5m customers. It buys the debt at deeply discounted prices - typically offering about 10p for every 1 - and attempts to squeeze out the value by reconnecting with borrowers. It expects to use the 50m it raised from the listing to purchase more packages of debt.

It is one of a number of debt management companies that have benefited from a buoyant market in recent months, as banks move to clean up their balance sheets and release capital by shedding soured debt. Rivals in the sector have also attracted investors - JC Flowers, the US private equity group, acquired Cabot Credit Management, another debt collector, from Anacap in a deal worth about 500m in May, for example.

Revenue at Arrow increased more than 50 per cent in the first six months of 2013, compared with a year earlier. Much of its work involves using technology and data analytics to identify and track down debtors after their contact information has been lost by the original lender. Once it has the information it uses third-party collectors to recoup the debt.

Tom Drury, chief executive of Arrow, said: "Our focus now is on continuing to drive growth, leveraging our sophisticated data and analytics capabilities, in order to offer investors a highly cash-generative business with significant earnings visibility.

"We also look forward to continuing our commitment to providing our customers with an excellent service based on a fair and collaborative approach."

Goldman Sachs acted as global co-ordinator on the listing and, along with Jefferies, was joint bookrunner.

Corporate News: Data Mining Evolves, Thanks to Twitter --- 'Social Listening Firms' Emerge, Analyzing the Site's Stream of Information for Insights on News and Trends

In its IPO filing Thursday, Twitter Inc. disclosed how much the microblogging platform earned from a lesser-known side business: $47.5 million came from selling off its data to a fast-growing group of companies that analyze the data for insights into news events and trends.

That is a small amount compared with the revenue generated from advertising, but Twitter's data business has rippled across the economy. The site's constant stream of experiences, opinions and sentiments has spawned a vast commercial ecosystem, serving up putative insights to product developers, Hollywood studios, major retailers and -- potentially most profitably -- hedge funds and other investors. Backed by millions of dollars in venture capital, hundreds of "social listening" firms have emerged.

"The economic impact of Twitter is massively bigger than whatever lies in their [IPO] filing," says Rob Bailey, chief executive of Data Sift, a London-based social-data analytics company.

Social-data firms spot trends that it would take a long time for humans to see on their own. The United Nations is using algorithms derived from Twitter to pinpoint hot spots of social unrest. DirecTV uses Twitter data as an early-warning system to spot power outages based on customer complaints. Human-resources departments analyze the data to evaluate job candidates.

One opportunity may be on Wall Street. Dataminr Inc., which has raised $30 million in funding this year alone, has made serving traders its core business. It uses algorithms similar to those employed by hedge funds to conduct high-speed trading. Five minutes before news of last week's Capitol Hill shooting in Washington, D.C., broke on television, Dataminr subscribers got an alert to take action -- giving them a leg up on the news that led the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to drop 20 points five minutes later.

Dataminr's algorithms spotted just a handful of early eyewitness shooting reports posted on Twitter and instantaneously deduced from their timing, along with the Tweeters' influence and physical location that something urgent was happening. Other trading algorithms use "sentiment scores" to track the mood about certain stocks, driving decisions about whether to be bullish or bearish on firms.

These social-data companies are subsets of a burgeoning data industry that collects, disseminates and analyzes all the information that firms amass and people leave online. While estimates of the market value of the social-data industry are hard to come by, one research firm, IDC, estimates that the entire "big data" market has grown seven times as quickly as the information-technology sector as a whole. It may be valued at $16.9 billion in two years.

Most of the social companies pull data from a range of sources, including Yahoo Inc.'s Tumblr, Facebook Inc.'s Instagram, and the review site Yelp Inc. But Twitter, because of its public real-time data stream, is the industry giant. Even the U.S. Library of Congress is now cataloging tweets.

Twitter's social-network rival Facebook, on the other hand, has largely eschewed getting involved in the data business. In part, that is because Facebook's product isn't set up for public conversations, but rather for private sharing among friends. But with an eye toward Twitter's success in leading public conversations about real-time events, Facebook recently has joined with major media companies to provide aggregated information about consumer conversations on certain topics.

Each social-data firm boasts proprietary dating-mining tools that go beyond basic keyword searches. Some can zoom in on a subset of people -- say, women in a certain postal zone -- and monitor phrases that show emotion. Then they can create a heat map or a sentiment score that measures how that subset feels about a topic. They have trained natural language processing algorithms to look at slang and broken grammar and to highlight tweets that indicate urgency because of words like "BREAKING."

"We don't just count the volume of these trends. That's naive," says Nova Spivack, chief executive of the Los Angeles-based firm Bottlenose. Rather, his firm looks at the momentum of trends.

"Businesses have spent years understanding the past," says Mr. Spivack. "Twitter has found a way to measure the present."

Twitter data aren't a perfect crystal ball. The service's most active U.S. users aren't entirely representative of the American population. According to the Pew Internet Project, though three-quarters of American adults are sharing information on social-networking sites, Twitter users, in particular, skew young -- 30% are under the age of 30. College graduates and wealthier Americans also have higher rates of Twitter use, but that gap is small, and narrowing.

Companies say it is still too early to determine the long-term value of Twitter data. One risk that Twitter raised in its IPO prospectus is that the company's growth could be undermined by spammers and fake Twitter accounts. Another risk: Twitter accounts can be hacked and used to put out incorrect information.

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment.

Companies are still struggling to understand how the Twitter conversation relates to the real world. Most aren't yet abandoning focus groups or customer-satisfaction surveys for social-media monitoring, says Darrell Jursa, of Fleishman-Hillard, a public-relations firm specializing in crisis management. Some "80% to 90% of conversations still take place offline," he says. "You need to put the social data in context with everything else."

Moreover, companies that tap the data are increasingly trying to figure out whether a Twitter "crisis" actually resonates with all Americans or stays in an echo chamber.

Restaurant-chain Five Guys used Washington, D.C.-based New Brand Analytics to compare hamburger-bun quality in different parts of the country, leading the company to flag issues in some areas. But the firm warned the chain not to overreact to complaints, says Five Guys spokeswoman Molly Catalano. While some individual complaints were nasty, overall Five Guys was popular among Twitter users, New Brand found.

Twitter is still figuring out how to extract the most value from its data business, which grew 53% over the past year, according to papers the company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has clamped down on the amount of data that outside firms are allowed to pull from its system free of charge.

Many smaller analytics startups are now turning to four companies that Twitter has dubbed "certified data resellers." These brokers, Gnip, Data Sift, Topsy and the Japanese company NTT Data, account for the bulk of Twitter's data revenue. Last year, they paid Twitter monthly fees of about $35.6 million.

Twitter's exponential growth has meant its influence extends well beyond marketing and crisis public relations. Nonprofits, human-resource managers and politicians have found Twitter data useful, too. The Red Cross began analyzing Twitter data during 2012's Hurricane Sandy, says spokeswoman Anne Marie Borrego, using social-media-generated heat maps to direct aid. Twitter itself analyzed the site's chatter to predict the outcome of last year's U.S. presidential election.

But as Twitter plans to go public, some smaller firms worry that Twitter could further limit access to its valuable data. "Free," says Kristin Muhlner, CEO of New Brand Analytics, "isn't interesting to investors."

A German fund is to make the biggest property investment in Portugal since before the eurozone debt crisis, in the latest sign of a long-awaited rebound in the periphery's commercial real estate market , write Alice Ross and Peter Wise.

Deka Immobilien will announce today that it is paying  43m for the Bltico building, an office block in Lisbon, its first transaction in Portugal since the financial crisis five years ago.

The deal will be the largest acquisition by an international institutional investor in Portugal since 2009, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, the commercial property group. The acquisition of the 16-storey riverside building comes amid other early signs of an economic turnround in Portugal.

Matthias Danne, head of Deka's real estate arm, said it was starting to dip a toe back into the waters of southern European property markets.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- The Experts: Insights From Our Online Panel

Last month's Investing in Funds & ETFs report raised issues for the full range of investors, from beginners seeking free information to those with more experience who may be considering whether so-called alternative investments, such as hedge funds, may be right for them. For answers, we turned to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics covered in the report. Edited excerpts follow. To read more, go to WSJ.com/WealthReport.

How can people with limited assets and income get good investment advice?

First, Learn the Basics

Before you dive into implementing any advice, understand the basics (e.g., discount vs. full-service brokerages, ETFs vs. mutual funds). Next, assess your overall financial situation to see whether you are even in a position to invest. Do you have any debt to tackle first? And do you have an emergency savings account set up with enough cash to cover your living expenses for six-plus months (or more if you have a family)?

-- Alexa von Tobel, founder and CEO, LearnVest.com

Favorite Low-Cost Site

My favorite solution? Wealthfront. It's a Silicon Valley startup that offers incredibly well-constructed portfolios. It charges $0 for accounts less than $10,000 and 0.25% for accounts larger than that. For that, you get all-ETF portfolios based on the latest in modern portfolio theory, managed by Burton Malkiel (author of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street"). I am not in any way affiliated with Wealthfront.

-- Matt Hougan, president, ETF analytics, global head of editorial, IndexUniverse LLC

Four Sites for Free Advice

AAII has asset-allocation suggestions, T. Rowe Price has a great simulator for determining when and how to take Social Security benefits, Yahoo has a retirement budget tool, and Mint.com can help you track your spending so you might be able to save more.

-- Charles Rotblut, vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors

Free Tips From Bogleheads

Go to Bogleheads.org for advice. It's an online organization of knowledgeable investors who are ready to help anyone who asks. The site is operated by a nonprofit organization, so there is no commercialism, there are no hassles, and it's free. The site consists of the wiki and the forum. Both were built by volunteers dedicated to helping people begin or improve their investing journey through the application of sound investing principles. These values come from Vanguard founder Jack Bogle. I've been an active member of the community for more than a decade.

-- Rick Ferri, founder, Portfolio Solutions LLC, author and blogger

Go to Your Local Library

Start at the library and focus on savings and planning books first. There may also be charitable and governmental organizations that provide services for free, and some financial planners do pro bono work for those in need.

-- Tom Brakke, consultant, investment adviser

For investors who can't stomach much stock-market volatility, what do you recommend?

Balanced Is Best

Invest in a balanced fund. The combination of stocks and bonds in the fund should produce the portfolio return with lower volatility. At the same time, the investor would not be able to directly observe the impact of the equity component during market downturns, and would, therefore, be more likely to stay the course and less likely to overreact to the equity decline.

-- George U. "Gus" Sauter, senior consultant, former chief investment officer, Vanguard Group

Five Basic Tips

1. Don't talk about the stock market around the water cooler. Listening to others venting about their investments or giving financial advice will only stir up nervousness and doubt.

2. Get your advice and guidance from a financial planner. They are there to help you navigate the stock-market cycles.

3. Don't look at your portfolio daily.

4. Maintain your equity investments with a time horizon of at least seven years.

5. Continuously educate yourself by reading the newspaper finance section, but don't overdo it by having the business news on 24-7.

-- Michelle Perry Higgins, financial planner and principal, California Financial Advisors

Consider These Two Strategies

Rebalance your portfolio back to its intended allocation; use dollar-cost averaging, which is investing a set amount at regular intervals.

When rebalancing, you're forcing yourself to buy low and sell high. With dollar-cost averaging, you're buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.

These habits can help investors discipline themselves to use market volatility to their advantage and resist the urge to do the worst thing, which is bail out and head for the hills.

-- Greg McBride, senior financial analyst and vice president, Bankrate.com

If It Makes You Unhappy, Stop

While it is important to try to make good decisions for the future, your investment approach should not make you miserable. Life is too short to chase returns if you are unhappy along the way.

-- Tom Brakke

Own Fewer Stocks

If your tolerance for financial risk is below your current equity allocation, then sell down to a level that's palatable -- and then stay there. This isn't a sign of weakness; it's a sign of intelligent decision making.

-- Rick Ferri

Do you recommend individuals hold "alternative" investments? And if so, which ones?

Not Appropriate for Most

Alternative funds, such as hedge funds, are more sexy than standard mutual funds. And, for some investors, they might provide some marginal advantage to their portfolio. However, I don't believe they are appropriate for most investors. While some alts have produced very impressive results, many have not.

Several years ago, when I was at Vanguard, a manager of a sovereign-wealth fund asked me how they could identify the best alt funds. My response was to look for the ones that are closed. Remember, you're not Yale or Harvard.

-- George U. "Gus" Sauter

Smart for Certain Portfolios

I believe that "alternative" investments can be a strong choice for certain portfolios. We have seen periods where alternatives have had a low correlation to traditional assets, thus lowering risk and increasing diversification. However, these investment choices are typically more complex, can have higher fees, offer less liquidity and may frustrate investors in good market times. Alternatives are not a one-size-fits-all solution. It would therefore take a thorough understanding of an investor's risk tolerance, long-term goals and objectives before making a recommendation.

-- Michelle Perry Higgins

Make Sure It Is Truly Alternative

Foreign-currency funds, gold and preferred stocks can all add alternative return characteristics for considerably less expense than most alternative funds being marketed heavily to advisers right now. Some might make sense, but I would take a hard look at their expenses and the length of their histories (many have been formed after the last bear market). I would use a wait-and-see approach to see how alternative they really are once the next bear market occurs.

-- Charles Rotblut

Higher Fees -- Not Higher Returns

No. Most are designed to extract higher fees from investors, not to deliver better returns.

-- Matt Hougan

No, Thank You

They tend to be complex, illiquid, nontransparent, hard to value and very expensive. Will investors be compensated enough to overcome the fees and lack of transparency and liquidity? Maybe, but I certainly would not invest my money in these products, so why would I ever recommend to my clients that they should?

-- George Papadopoulos, fee-only wealth manager

German fund buys Lisbon office block amid early signs of upturn

A German fund is to make the biggest property investment in Portugal since before the eurozone debt crisis, in the latest sign of a long-awaited rebound in the periphery's commercial real estate market.

Deka Immobilien will announce on Monday that it is paying  43m for the Bltico building, an office block in Lisbon, its first transaction in Portugal since the financial crisis five years ago.

The deal will be the largest acquisition by an international institutional investor in Portugal since 2009, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, the commercial property group.

The acquisition of the 16-storey riverside building comes amid other early signs of an economic turnround in Portugal after three years of deep recession and record unemployment as the country struggles to comply with the terms of a  78bn international bailout.

Matthias Danne, head of Deka's real estate arm, said that the investor, which manages the largest open-ended property funds in Germany, was starting to dip a toe back into the waters of southern European property markets. The fund is also looking at opportunities in Spain and Italy.

"We think that the European Union will stick together: that is the most important question you have to ask yourself," he told the Financial Times.

"Lisbon is one of the most important cities in Europe and we are convinced that business will continue to happen there. Now is a good point in time to buy there as capitalisation rates [rates of return] and prices are reasonable even given the dangerous economic situation the country is in."

The deal is the latest sign that commercial property in peripheral eurozone states has become attractive to investors once more. The value of property transactions in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain reached  2.3bn in the quarter to July, up 60 per cent from the first three months of the year, according to research for Cushman & Wakefield, a property consultancy.

Portugal, depressed by more than a decade of low economic growth, was passed over by the boom in property prices that swept through many other European countries from the mid-1990s.

According a recent report by Cushman & Wakeman, real estate investment has been one of the sectors hit hardest by the current crisis.

Falling demand for office space and difficult access to financing have damped investment. But Cushman & Wakeman say there is demand for "high-quality, well-located office buildings with long lease terms and a solid tenant base" of which there is a shortage in the Portuguese market.

The Bltico building was completed in 2010 in the Parque das Naes, a prime development area on the Tagus river in northeast Lisbon, an area that was transformed in the 1990s when it was chosen as the location for the Expo '98 World Exhibition. The building has five floors below ground and 16 above, including 13,400 sq metres of office space on 13 floors.

Winging It in the Shutdown

As far as anyone can tell, the U.S. job market is holding steady. But until the government shutdown ends, who really knows?

Wednesday, check-cutting giant Automatic Data Processing reported that private-sector employers added 166,000 jobs last month, a shade less than the 178,000 expected by economists. But the Conference Board reported its measure of online help-wanted ads reached its highest level on record. And on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing employment rose to its highest level in more than a year.

Absent the shutdown, these would have been just a preamble to Friday's monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which economists were expecting to show a gain of 181,000 jobs. But with its publication on ice, investors, the Federal Reserve and businesses must rely on mostly private measures for a sense of how the job market is faring.

None of these are nearly as rich as the employment report. Take the ADP figures. Even putting aside the qualms many economists have over its methodology, it covers only jobs held at private-sector firms, while the so-called establishment survey used by the U.S. Labor Department includes government employers. The establishment-survey data also include important figures on how much workers are paid and how much time they put on the clock.

The jobs report also encompasses the entirely separate survey of households from which the unemployment rate, labor-force participation rate and other key measures are derived. Described by one prominent statistics textbook as a "massive and beautifully organized sample survey," no privately produced survey compares.

The data vacuum doesn't end with the jobs report. Key figures on international trade, inflation and retail sales will be postponed next week if the shutdown persists. So will the U.S. Department of Agriculture's monthly crop report, a crucial indicator not just for commodities traders but farmers and food companies.

Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration says it has funds available to release its petroleum and natural-gas reports through next week. If the shutdown continues to the point where it can't provide reports, energy traders will lack some of the few reasonably reliable, and regular, data points in the global energy market. Heavy oil and gas users, such as chemical companies, would also have a tougher time gauging things.

Left by a prolonged shutdown to rely on a mishmash of private reports and available government data, trying to figure out what the economy is doing is "like trying to fly a huge airplane with just a few instruments," says economist Mark Zandi of Moody'sAnalytics, which prepares ADP's report. "You can fly it, but you can't fly it very well."

All of which would be bad enough without the threat of economic disruption from the shutdown and brewing fight over the debt ceiling. The plane could be flying into a storm.

Asian Superman Unloading Power

Hong Kong's "Superman" is running ahead of Ben Bernanke. Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man according to Forbes, earned the moniker "Superman" in his Hong Kong hometown after decades of spotting the right trends. His empire today stretches from ports to grocery stores. He now is taking his Hong Kong utilities business public before the U.S. Federal Reserve starts winding down its bond purchases soon.

Mr. Li-controlled Power Assets Holdings, which runs electricity operations in Hong Kong, Europe and Australia, will spin off up to 49% of its Hong Kong unit. It may sell shares by the end of the year, though pricing and other details aren't out yet. The company says the listing is to gain "financial strength" so it can look for assets abroad.

Timing matters, though, and Mr. Li may be striking while the iron still is hot.

When interest rates are low, utilities stocks tend to do well, thanks to their steady profits and high dividends. But if the Fed pushes rates upward, valuations could cool look at what happened to U.S. utility stocks after May, when Fed chief Mr. Bernanke first hinted bond purchases might taper off soon. Hong Kong directly imports U.S. interest rates through its dollar peg.

Power Assets used to trade at 16.5 times forward earnings before Mr. Bernanke's whispers in late May. It is now at 14 times, but that is still rich compared with a 15-year average of 11.7, according to FactSet.

Mr. Li also may be getting out before regulations crimp profits. The return on assets that Hong Kong utilities are allowed are among the highest in the world, even though this city-state is a mature market like the West now. Regulators could reduce the rate to 7% or lower in 2018, from 10% today, CLSA says.

Mr. Li has a history of cashing out of richly valued businesses and deploying the cash into bargain bets. He exited from an Indian telecom business in 2007, listed a Hong Kong ports trust in 2011 and now is selling his Hong Kong supermarket chain. Investors hungry for yield drove up these businesses' valuations to some extent, but they all have questionable growth prospects.

This record should now make investors in Hong Kong utilities nervous. And which sector should feel encouraged? European infrastructure and telecoms, since that is where Mr. Li has plowed roughly $25 billion in the past four years.

Royal Mail

Carries

Heavy

Baggage

Royal Mail might look like a first-class play on one of the world's biggest e-commerce markets. But the landmark float of the U.K. postal operator, expected to be valued at up to <pound>3.3 billion ($5.35 billion) when it starts trading in London this month, comes with some heavy baggage.

A likely strike soon after Royal Mail's listing is a reminder of the company's Achilles' heel. The powerful Communication Workers Union should get the votes it needs to call a strike in protest over the privatization, pensions and pay. Sure, this would be the union's first nationwide strike since 2009, and any hit to Royal Mail's sales likely will prove temporary. But the re-emergence of labor-relations troubles is a concern.

The bigger challenge for Royal Mail is growth. There is no end in sight for a near decadelong slide in letter volumes, down 8% in the year to March. That makes sustaining growth in parcel volumes, which account for almost half of Royal Mail's sales, important if the group is to deliver targeted 2% to 3% annual sales growth over the next few years.

True, the U.K. spends more online per capita than any other market, which has boosted demand for delivery services. But just as letters are being replaced by email, the e-book market is growing rapidly while more shoppers are opting to collect online purchases from stores. Parcel volumes in the U.K. could expand 3% a year through 2018, down from an annual average 3.7% rise since 2008, estimates PricewaterhouseCoopers.

That could leave Royal Mail more reliant on price increases to sustain sales growth. But that isn't easy given there are some 15 logistics operators vying for a piece of Royal Mail's roughly 50% share of the U.K. parcel market by volumes. And cutting costs is getting harder now that Royal Mail is most of the way through a major restructuring. While operating-profit margins more than doubled to 4.4% last year, Royal Mail now is targeting a 0.5-percentage-point annual improvement.

Royal Mail's offering was fully subscribed within hours of its launch late last week. The 7% dividend yield at the midpoint of the price range certainly looks appealing. Even so, investors should hope the final price delivers a decent enough discount.

-- Renee Schultes

Ocado's Tricky

Overseas Delivery

Online grocer Ocado has proved itself to be a force in e-commerce. What is less clear is how much more it can deliver for investors.

The company, which sells fresh food online and trucks it to customers' doorsteps, had a number of earnings downgrades and a lousy stock performance in the first couple of years after its 2010 listing. But the stock has more than quadrupled this year and now trades at 32 times Ebitda. Part of that rally is justified. Ocado said in May it would manage an online delivery service for rival Wm. Morrison Supermarkets said in May it would manage an online delivery service for rival

. The deal included a hefty <pound>165 million ($267.7 million) cash payment that wiped out all of Ocado's debt.

But that is likely to be as good as it gets at least in the U.K., Ocado agreed to make Morrison its exclusive partner, ruling out more deals. And while analysts expect online grocery retailing to rise about 15% annually for the next few years, there is no guarantee Ocado will expand so fast. Larger rivals such as Tesco and J Sainsbury will be vying for their piece of the pie.

The real reason investors have gorged on Ocado is its prospects further afield. Ocado's edge lies in its sophisticated system that helps it reach wide areas with a small number of distribution centers. That could help another grocer that wants to jump-start its online operations quickly.

Yet in countries where people aren't already shopping for groceries online regularly, it would be hard to justify a large upfront payment to Ocado.

Other markets where online shopping is more advanced are very competitive. The U.S., for instance, will probably never be an option because domestic players such as FreshDirect have conquered the most attractive regions already. Amazon.com, the clear leader in online retail, delivers fresh food in Seattle and Los Angeles and reportedly has plans to reach dozens more with the help of its existing infrastructure. That leaves little room for a new player with no experience in the U.S. market.

Ocado looks set to thrive in the U.K. But investors waiting for international expansion may find the shares have spoiled before it makes the leap.

No one likes to stare into the abyss. But for U.S. banks, the experience is meant to be cathartic.

The biggest banks have again submitted to regulators so-called living wills, essentially guides to how to put them out of their misery in the event of a crisis. Such road maps should prove helpful in trying to understand the financial behemoths, which can include scores of legal subsidiaries in numerous countries around the world.

The exercise is meant to further insure against U.S. taxpayers again having to bail out failing financial giants.

But while helpful, it is far from a cure. For starters, much will depend in any future financial crisis on the willingness of regulators to break up a big bank.

And chances are that if one giant is teetering, a whole bunch are likely to be in trouble.

Even worse, taking down a big bank could spark a run on others.

Having a map is a start. But it doesn't guarantee you'll reach your destination.

From Mr Zachary Townsend.

Sir, Banks are " Realising the promise of new technologies " (The Connected Business, FT.com, September 30), despite being saddled by outdated and outmoded core banking technologies. Some of the best but least studied innovation is happening inside treasury management and commercial banking groups. There, far from the public eye, new technologies - such as application programming interfaces - are allowing financial institutions and businesses of all sizes to interact in new, faster ways. These technologies speed the flow of transactions for the business while decreasing risk and delivery costs for the bank.

Unfortunately, Eric Openshaw and Larry Albin continue the false dichotomy between the business and technology functions of banks. Ultimately, banks are "big" data and technology companies. At the centre of every bank is simply a data store that records who has how much money and the rules governing transaction processing. We call this data store a core banking system, which is then surrounded by delivery channels, risk management and other technologies. Banks, their boards and their shareholders will come to realise that huge portions of bank budgets and headcounts can be replaced by modern web technology if architectured correctly. Those financial institutions that remake themselves fastest in the model of software engineering first companies such as Google or Facebook, including picking a forward-thinking technologist as chief executive, will be the true benefactors of this new era in finance.

US budget politics: America goes dark

It is no small job shutting down the US government.

On Tuesday morning, hours after the midnight deadline to pass a new budget, Washington bureaucrats went to work as usual, where they began issuing orders to colleagues to go home until further notice.

It took a day or two for the impact of the government shutdown to begin rippling across the country. Hundreds of thousands of workers were temporarily laid off; supermarkets on military bases were closed; medical research was halted and pantries for the poor were running out of food.

By week's end, the White House and its Republican foes were no closer to an agreement. Although fraying around the edges, conservatives in Congress were holding firm: they would not vote for a new short-term budget unless President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms, which became law in 2010, were delayed or gutted.

"The grand strategy can be summarised in two words: don't blink," says Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Partners, an asset manager.

These stand-offs have become almost routine since Tea Party Republicans swept into Congress in 2010. But the notion that this is just more of the same political kabuki ahead of an inevitable one-minute-to-midnight deal will vanish if Congress falls at its next hurdle - the October 17 deadline to allow the government to take on more debt to keep itself running.

The effects of America's political dysfunction in recent years have spilled over its borders, spreading the domestic economic damage around the world and rattling global stock and bond markets. But the failure to raise the so-called debt ceiling, leaving the US Treasury to scramble for funds to pay the country's debts, would dwarf the fallout from the last showdown in August 2011. That episode cost the US its triple A credit rating from Standard & Poor's.

"There is precedent for a government shutdown, but there is no precedent for a default," Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, said after emerging with fellow bankers from a White House meeting this week. "I'm not anxious to be part of the process that witnesses it."

If there is no deal, the US Treasury would run out of cash sometime between October 18 and November 5. With no legal ability to borrow, the US would have to immediately start cutting deeply into government programmes to prioritise payments among the 100m-odd it makes a month, to everyone from foreign creditors to pension recipients.

"It will be an instant crisis, complete bedlam" if the debt ceiling isn't raised, says Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody'sAnalytics.

The conventional wisdom of the moment has Mr Obama and the Democrats winning the politics of the shutdown, successfully painting the Republican leadership as captive to the Tea Party faction in the House of Representatives.

John Boehner, the Republican House speaker, has never forgotten how the last government shutdowns, in 1995 and 1996, worked out for his party. Newt Gingrich, then the speaker of the House, never recovered politically, and Bill Clinton coasted to a second term as president.

It is no surprise, then, that Mr Boehner opposed the idea of tying the new budget to striking a blow against Obamacare. Polls show that his instinct was right: regardless of how Americans feel about the Affordable Health Care Act, as it is officially known, they oppose the idea of holding the budget hostage in order to neuter it.

But Mr Boehner was cornered after a Tea Party rebellion last month, and he now cuts a beleaguered figure as he defends the position.

Mr Obama, pushed around by the Republicans in the 2011 budget clash, is piling on the pressure. "The only thing keeping the government shut down," he told a campaign-style rally near Washington on Thursday, "is that Speaker John Boehner won't even let the [budget] bill get a yes-or-no vote, because he doesn't want to anger the extremists in his party."

With the White House refusing to discuss changes to the heathcare reforms in budget talks, Mr Boehner's colleagues say he may be able to cut a deal - but only at the expense of his job.

The frustration at not being able to find a way out of the cul-de-sac that the Tea Party has pushed the leadership into is evident among the Speaker's colleagues in the hothouse of Capitol Hill. "We're not going to be disrespected," said Marlin Stutzman, a Republican congressman from Indiana, on Tuesday. "We have got to get something out of this, and I don't know what that even is." Mr Stutzman later apologised for his "careless" remarks.

Tea Party Republicans, far from being apologetic, insist they are exactly where they want to be. Tim Huelskamp, a Kansas Republican who led an unsuccessful attempt to topple Mr Boehner earlier this year, thinks he has already compromised by supporting a one-year delay in the core of Obamacare, rather than withholding funds from it altogether.

"You don't get the best choices up here [in Washington]," he said in an interview in his office this week, lamenting that the Republican leadership was not taking an even tougher line. "But this is about the budget. Obamacare is not going to save us money, Mr President!" When Mr Boehner's name comes up, he damns his leader with faint praise, saying: "He has moved quite a bit."

The White House also remembers the government shutdown wars of the mid-1990s, when Mr Clinton stared down Mr Gingrich. They are hoping that history will repeat itself.

But veterans of the Clinton White House caution about getting too cocky, saying victory was never preordained. "I remember day after day, we had significant debates about whether we were going to come out of this ahead or behind," says Mike McCurry, Mr Clinton's spokesman at the time.

The Republican leadership has tried to paper over the party's infighting this week, talking of compromise, and one by one, sent bills to the Senate funding various arms of the government without conditions. These stunts aside, however, the Republicans' best hope may be that, for all the clamour in Washington, much of the US heartland is still not tuning in.

Greater Washington, with its high concentration of federal workers, and areas with military bases or large national parks, have been immediately hit by the shutdown. In places such as the city of Normal, Illinois, however, the capital's crisis has yet to grip, except as a spectacle of political dysfunction.

"If this had been a year ago, when we were building this building, it would have been a nightmare," says Chris Koos, Normal's mayor, of its new municipal offices.

The adjoining cities of Bloomington and Normal are prosperous, largely white-collar communities surrounded by the broad plains of central Illinois. The biggest employers are two universities and the State Farm insurance firm. "This is as close to middle America as you can get," says Tari Renner, mayor of Bloomington.

The cities might lose some federal grants, and the low-income women lining up at the McLean County Health Department for extra food for their babies might soon have to look elsewhere. But Bloomington has few federal jobs to be cut.

The early signs of the crisis are there, however. Mr Koos says the city cancelled buying municipal bonds this week, despite the attractive rates on offer. "The market is too unpredictable right now," he says.

Politically, the same divisions tearing the Republicans apart in Washington are evident in Bloomington and Normal.

The country-club Republicans who once dominated the local party - Mr Boehner is the epitome of the breed - are being pushed aside by small-government conservatives. "The Republican leadership is just like the Democratic leadership: they just want to get re-elected," says Jerry Vogler, 66, who runs a service for veterans, funded by a county-level tax. "They like big government too much. They have gotten away from their roots."

Other local Republicans do not support their party's tough tactics in Washington. "I am not pleased about this kind of behaviour," says Mike O'Grady, who heads the local economic development council.

The split among local conservatives helped elect Mr Renner, who says he is Bloomington's first Democratic mayor since the city was founded in the 1860s.

Back in Washington, Mr Boehner has yet to blink. But he seems to be at least winking at the markets, with leaked stories saying he will make sure there is no default.

As speaker, Mr Boehner decides which bills will be brought to the House floor for a vote. The numbers are already there, among both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a budget and probably the debt ceiling.

But the Tea Party has made clear this will not happen without a fight.

"This is just the first play of (our commitment) to the 10-year path to balance the budget," says Mr Huelskamp. "You cannot do that with Obamacare on the books."

Goldman Pulling Ahead of Morgan Stanley on Internet IPO Deals

In the perpetual Wall Street rivalry between Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley long claimed the lead in Internet and technology U.S. initial public stock offerings. This year, that is starting to change.

In landing the lead role on Twitter Inc.'s public stock offering, Goldman is pulling ahead of Morgan Stanley in the horse race for such deals for the first time in at least two years.

The win culminates Goldman's effort Goldman to rev up its Internet IPO franchise and strengthen its ties to startup founders and their backers. The firm launched a conference last year aimed at entrepreneurs, brought back a former star analyst to help lead its banking efforts in the industry and has made its top executives more visible in Silicon Valley.

A person familiar with Twitter's thinking said executives there also felt Goldman understands the company. The bank allows its traders and other employees to read tweets the company's 140-character messages to monitor news and rumors that could affect clients or move markets, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman also advertises on the social-media service. Those efforts helped the firm land the lead role on the IPO, the person familiar with Twitter's thinking said.

Internet deals, for the likes of Zynga, Pandora Media Inc. and Facebook Inc., aren't necessarily the biggest moneymakers on Wall Street. But what they lack in fee potential they often make up for in publicity and prestige, with the companies' flashy features and newly minted young millionaires in casual clothes.

And at a time when big banks are exiting from businesses, being cautious with their capital and tweaking algorithms to win slivers of market share in trading, the courting of technology companies pursuing stock offerings remains one of the most visible and fierce competitions.

IPOs are also an opportunity for banks to develop relationships with companies coming into the resources stock and cash for potential big acquisitions.

Goldman is no laggard in the business. Between them, Goldman and Morgan Stanley have been the first underwriting bank on nearly half of Internet and technology U.S.-listed IPOs since the beginning of 2011, according to Dealogic.

But Morgan Stanley had maintained a lead, winning the lion's share of lead assignments, in 32 of the 109 total deals since 2011.

In 2013, Goldman won nine lead Internet and technology assignments overall, more than Credit Suisse Group AG's six and Morgan Stanley's four, according to Dealogic. Goldman has also won more overall roles on technology and Internet IPOs, including nonlead roles, working on 18 deals this year, tied with Deutsche Bank AG, according to Dealogic. Morgan Stanley has been on 16 deals.

In part, the door for Goldman was opened by Morgan Stanley's role in Facebook's troubled IPO, according to people familiar with Twitter's thinking. Facebook's May 2012 IPO, the biggest-ever U.S. technology debut at $16 billion, was beset by a technology glitch on the Nasdaq Stock Market and also selling pressure from investors who thought the deal was too large and too richly priced. Facebook's share price has more recently risen well above its IPO price.

One of the people familiar with Twitter's thinking also said that while the company did consider what happened with Facebook, Morgan Stanley was very much in the running for the lead role, because of its still-formidable reputation and capabilities. According to Twitter's IPO filing, revealed publicly on Thursday, Morgan Stanley is the second bank on the deal after Goldman.

Morgan Stanley won the two biggest Internet IPOs so far this year as measured by the companies' market cap: online coupon-seller RetailMeNot Inc., and airplane Internet access provider Gogo Inc., according to Dealogic. Morgan Stanley has led the IPOs of eight of the last 10 Internet and software companies with a market capitalization over $1 billion at their IPOs.

Goldman snagged the biggest software deal of the year by market value, "big data" firm Tableau Software Inc., on which Morgan Stanley was the second underwriter. Last year, Goldman didn't have a role in Splunk Inc.

Working on some smaller IPOs also helped Goldman pull ahead, including Marketo Inc. and ChannelAdvisor Corp., which both raised less than $100 million each. A person familiar with those deals said that Morgan Stanley didn't pitch for them. Goldman also led the March $93 million IPO of Silver Spring Networks Inc., which had originally signed up Morgan Stanley as its lead banker in 2011, according to public filings.

One big prize is yet to be claimed: the IPO of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which is expected to raise more than $10 billion in a U.S. offering, people familiar with its thinking have said.

A key move on Goldman's part, according to people familiar with the bank's effort, included bringing back Anthony Noto as co-head of global technology, media and telecommunications banking. Mr. Noto is a former star dot-com company research analyst who had left in 2008 to work with the National Football League. He returned to Goldman as a banker in 2010.

Mr. Noto led the firm's efforts to win the Twitter assignment, while his co-head, George Lee, led the team that pursued the Facebook deal, people familiar with the matter said.

Goldman held a board meeting in the Bay Area in June, giving senior executives and directors access to regional clients. Senior executives, including President Gary Cohn, are frequent visitors, people familiar with the matter said.

Monsanto snaps up Climate Corp; COMMODITIES

Monsanto, the agricultural products company, is looking to take advantage of the data surrounding more extreme weather patterns with the acquisition of the Climate Corporation, a data science company that it expects to help raise crop yields.

The St Louis-based company said the cash acquisition, valued at roughly $930m, would give it leadership in the growing field of big data, giving farmers access to wide swaths of information.

Hugh Grant, chief executive, said data represented a potential $20bn industry-wide sales opportunity and linked the deal to climate change.

"Farmers today are challenged to make key decisions for their farms in the face of increasingly volatile weather conditions," Mr Grant told analysts.

"Because of this we believe there is a real opportunity and value in working with farmers to manage the risks that affect them every year."

Climate Corp's hyperlocal weather forecasting and risk management tools will bolster Monsanto's FieldScripts product, which provides farmers with field mapping, soil data, seed recommendations and other data points.

Farmers access FieldScripts via an iPad in their tractor cab which sets the planter on the basis of transmissions received from Monsanto. The product is being trialled by about 160 US farmers covering 40,000 acres.

Robert Fraley , chief technology officer, said the acquisition would help Monsanto's big data offerings grow "at a faster pace" internationally along with strengthening its core seed business.

Monsanto is not alone in capitalising on the demand for data to make agriculture more precise. Rival DuPont Pioneer launched its own subscription service, Field 360, this summer. It provides farmers access to soil, weather and precipitation information.

The news came as Monsanto reported a larger-than-expected loss during what has historically been its weakest quarter. It reported a net loss of $249m, or 47 cents a share, excluding one-time items, during the three months ending in August compared with $229m, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier.

Revenues rose 5 per cent to $2.2bn in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with $2.1bn last year. Analysts had forecast a loss of 43 cents a share on $2.24bn in sales. The company said it would earn $5 to $5.20 a share in the fiscal year ending next August, including a 14 cent charge related to the Climate Corp deal.

The shares were down by 0.96 per cent, at $104.04, yesterday in New York.

It is nice to have something to distract investors from weak quarterly earnings. The bad news for Monsanto is that its diversion was a $900m acquisition of a data analytics start-up that is expected to cut 14 cents out of next year's earnings.

For its fiscal fourth quarter, the seed maker reported a loss of 47 cents a share, a few pennies more than Wall Street expected, sending its shares down a tick or two. For the year, earnings did sprout 20 per cent, and the company predicts another 9 per cent to 13 per cent next year. But even that growth is not coming cheap. Excluding the just-announced acquisition of Climate Corp , capital expenditures will still leave free cash flow below the levels reached in recent years, an unusual pattern for a company that commands a premium valuation.

The global population keeps growing and prospering. That is good news for a company that offers corn and soyabean seeds along with herbicides to farmers. But the science involved is constantly advancing and there is plenty of competition from upstarts and large rivals such as DuPont and Syngenta. Monsanto spent $1.5bn last year on capital expenditures and research and development, a full fifth of sales. Free cash flow has been steady at about $2bn for the past three years. But with capital expenditures alone set to jump 50 per cent in 2014 to over $1bn, free cash flow, excluding the Climate acquisition, still drops to about $1.6bn.

Monsanto shares now trade at 11.5 times operating cash flow, exactly the midpoint of its valuation range since 2011. It has spent nearly all of free cash flow on returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. But its total shareholder return this year is just 13 per cent, below the overall market. And with an unspectacular 2014 forecast, Monsanto investors should not expect a bountiful harvest soon.

Fed Hawks

May Feast

On ISM

Maybe it wasn't so much a "close call" as a bad call.

A number of rate-setters at the Federal Reserve used words to that effect to describe their decision not to taper bond purchases at last month's meeting. The economic data just weren't quite strong enough. Some economists pointed to Wednesday's slightly disappointing figure on private-payroll growth as proof of their wisdom.

Evidence that the private economy isn't merely healthy, but positively humming, outweighs that, though. Exhibit A is one of the most useful and forward-looking data series out there. (And it is probably the best available given the government shutdown). The Institute for Supply Management's surveys of executives have an impressive record in signaling the beginnings and ends of economic expansions.

Earlier this week, the ISM Manufacturing Index registered a reading of 56.2 for September, the highest in 29 months. Because it has a longer track record, that index and its subcomponents often attract more attention. But the nonmanufacturing index, which is due Thursday, actually covers a larger swath of the U.S. economy -- nearly nine-tenths.

It has been even stronger lately, hitting 58.6 in August. That is the highest measure of service activity since December 2005. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires see the index dropping slightly to a still-stellar 57.

As a direct result of the decision not to curb bond buying, though, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have slipped in a matter of weeks to just over 2.6% from nearly 3%. In normal times, such a sharp drop would come only in response to weak leading indicators.

Michael Shaoul, chief executive of Marketfield Asset Management, noted that "much of the U.S. economic data that has been released in recent weeks is utterly incompatible with the current level of yields offered in the bond market. Sooner or later, something will have to give, and we doubt that it will be the data which collapses."

There has been a 75% correlation between the level of the index and quarterly change in gross domestic product for the service and construction sectors, according to Haver Analytics. So, unless the ISM is giving false signals or the dysfunction in Washington turns into a full-blown fiscal crisis, the Fed will have a tough time justifying further foot dragging.

Corporate News: Monsanto to Buy Climate Corp. in Data-Science Push

By David Kesmodel

Monsanto Co., the world's largest seed company by sales, agreed to buy farm-analytics firm Climate Corp. for about $930 million, deepening its push into technology designed to help farmers boost productivity and manage risk.

The purchase of closely held Climate Corp. will enable Monsanto to offer farmers a wider range of tools -- including individualized weather statistics -- as it seeks to build on its main business of selling genetically engineered seeds.

Monsanto is betting that tapping vast databases to help farmers increase their production will be one of the fastest-growing areas of agribusiness in coming years. It also expects weather and soil analytics to lead to significant gains in crop yields, complementing the biotechnology advances made by Monsanto and its rivals.

Such "precision farming" technology already has started to change how some farmers operate, and has attracted the interest of rivals including DuPont Co. Modern tractors can house tablet computers and GPS guidance systems that can automatically cover fields with seed or fertilizer tailored for local conditions, often without the vehicle's operator needing to steer.

Executives at St. Louis-based Monsanto, which has about $15 billion in annual revenue, said acquiring Climate Corp. would enhance the company's offerings to help farmers cope with threats like climate change and water shortages.

"We believe that data science has tremendous potential to boost productivity," said Kerry Preete, Monsanto's executive vice president of global strategy. In coming decades, "farmers around the world are going to be asked to produce more on their existing footprint of land."

San Francisco-based Climate Corp. was founded in 2006 by software engineers and data scientists who previously worked at Google Inc. and other Silicon Valley companies. The company's products include weather-monitoring and yield-forecasting data that farmers use to make decisions such as where and when to plant crops.

Farmers access the data through the company's Climate.com website or via mobile devices. The company also sells weather insurance and crop insurance through independent crop-insurance agents.

Climate Corp. Chief Executive David Friedberg told reporters that the company's clients include thousands of U.S. farmers, who account for several millions acres of crops. He declined to disclose the company's revenue.

Monsanto plans to integrate Climate Corp.'s weather information and analytics into a product it has been testing this year called FieldScripts, which farmers can access through an iPad in their tractor cabs. Using data on a farm's soil characteristics, the tool helps farmers maximize their yields by varying the amount of seed they apply in specific areas.

Monsanto has said FieldScripts could lead to an increase in corn yields of five to 10 bushels an acre, a gain of up to 7% based on average U.S. corn yields of about 148 bushels an acre over the past five years. The company plans to launch the product in four states next year.

Tim Tiberio, an analyst with Miller Tabak & Co., said the segment offers significant growth potential. But he said Monsanto also faces challenges, such as persuading large numbers of farmers to share data about their farms with the company.

Monsanto made a big move into the precision-farming arena with the purchase last year of Precision Planting Inc., a Tremont, Ill., company that has developed software tools to help farmers improve seed spacing and depth using a national database of soil conditions. That deal was valued at up to $250 million.

Separately, Monsanto reported a wider loss for its fiscal fourth quarter, hurt by lower seed sales, and forecast earnings for fiscal 2014 that trailed analysts' expectations.

For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Monsanto posted a loss of $249 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $229 million, or 42 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, the company had a year-earlier per-share loss of 44 cents.

Net sales for the quarter rose 5% to $2.2 billion. But sales at Monsanto's seeds and genomics business, its biggest contributor to revenue, fell 1.5% from a year earlier to $1.19 billion.

For the new fiscal year, Monsanto predicted per-share profit of between $5 and $5.20, below forecasts of $5.33 from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.

Experian, the credit checking and information services company, has agreed to buy US-based fraud protection provider 41st Parameter in a $324m deal that boosts Experian's reach in fighting web and mobile fraud.

The cash purchase will help Experian expand its fraud prevention and identity management division to account for about a tenth of its overall business within the next few years, the company said on Tuesday.

"[41st Parameter ] really fills a hole [in technology] that we would not be able to develop in real time to get to market as fast as we can by acquiring," said Peg Smith , executive vice-president of investor relations at Experian.

Ms Smith said Experian was drawn to 41st Parameter 's technology, which can identity devices that people use to access an online bank account, for example, to determine whether that device would put the transaction at risk.

She said their device detection capabilities added "another layer" in fraud prevention, and would bolster Experian's existing data analytics system.

Experian's fraud prevention operations already generate about 6-7 per cent, or $300m, of its overall revenue. The company said a proliferation of mobile devices and the growth in ecommerce would fuel an increasing demand for products and services that prevent web fraud.

41st Parameter 's clients range from banks and travel companies to payment service providers, and Ms Smith said Experian would be able to sell the technology to its clients worldwide.

"This adds pretty material scale to the US [business] but we're really looking at it as a global capability," she said.

She added that 41st Parameter had been limited in its ability to grow because of the size of their sales force.

Analysts at Shore Capital said: "We assume that [the acquisition] brings to Experian comparative advantage that will enhance segment growth and bring capability that differentiates Experian, further strengthening its position in a market segment that undoubtedly has a clear view of growth."

Experian, which is also widely known for its credit ratings business, said it was expecting 41st Parameter to generate about $26m of revenue for the year ending December 31 2013. They added that the acquisition was expected to be neutral in terms of earnings per share in the year ending 31 March 2014.

41st Parameter 's investors include Norwest Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested in ecommerce start-ups, and Jafco Ventures , a California-based firm that invests in communications and software companies.

Experian's share price closed up slightly at 11.87p on Tuesday, a gain of 0.85 per cent.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT: IGNITES RETAIL FUNDS / ALTERNATIVES
Retirement plans put new dishes on the menu; Pensions

Funds are looking at diversifying to counter volatility, writes Emile Hallez

Alternative assets and investment strategies are gradually gaining ground in retirement plans, as mutual fund companies address -volatility by diversifying holdings in target-date funds and other products.

Few of the standard options on the US 401(k) pension plan menus emphasise alternatives, but target-date funds - which increasingly hold alternatives as underlying investments - are growing faster than any other product type.

Defined contribution (DC) plan options are becoming simpler, as plan sponsors reduce the number of investments available to participants and often default them into target-date funds.

"Plan sponsors are understanding that they need to limit the number of choices. If you have too many choices, people get immobilised," says Fred Barstein, founder of The Retirement Advisor University, noting that outside of plans with more than $1bn in assets, sponsors hesitate to put alternative funds on plan menus.

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (Tips), real estate investment trusts (Reits) and commodities accounted for 7 per cent of the assets in target-date funds, according to data for 2012 provided by Target Date Analytics.

But the small holdings of individual asset classes mean each amount is insufficient to make any real difference to portfolio diversification, one expert notes.

"If you can achieve full meaningful diversification without adding emerging markets bonds, then adding emerging markets bonds is simply not a big factor in the overall success of that portfolio," says Joe Nagengast, principal of Target Date Analytics.

"The focus on alternative asset classes is usually misplaced. What we should be focusing on is the overall effective diversification of the portfolio - not the latest hot buzz asset class."

Target-date fund providers have avoided dedicating a larger portion of asset allocation to alternatives for several reasons, among them liquidity constraints and that fact that alternatives can be more difficult for 401(k) participants to understand than traditional asset classes such as equity and fixed income.

Though target-date funds are the most common product through which 401(k) investors have exposure to alternatives, some DC plans have also added real estate or Tips funds to their investment options. Those funds are typically diversified, composed of holdings in other mutual funds.

"They're not necessarily getting pure commodities as one fund - they're getting it as a piece of a fund that's invested in things like Tips and Reits," says James Veneruso, a vice-president at research company Callan Associates. About one third of DC plans offer such investment options, Mr Veneruso says, noting that the recent proliferation of such mutual funds has been fuelled by the decline in defined benefit (DB) plans.

As asset management companies see business in DB plans taper, some are weighing options in the retail market. KKR and Blackstone have recently established mutual funds.

Eighty to 90 per cent of individual retirement account rollover assets come from DC plans, a detail well known to private equity and hedge fund firms, Mr Barstein says.

"They're really eyeing this market," he says. "This is a tremendous distribution vehicle for them."

Since Callan created its DC index in 2006, DB plans have outperformed DC plans by an average of 1.2 per cent annually. The difference is largely due to the use of alternatives and hedge-fund like strategies in DB plans, Mr Veneruso says.

Mr Barstein says, given the potential to increase long-term performance, alternatives will inevitably see greater allocations within target-date funds, and therefore 401(k) plans.

"It's not a question of whether there are going to be alternatives. It's just when, and in what form," he says.

"It's all going to come to asset allocation, because that is where people are investing anyway."

In a survey of target-date managers conducted last year, Callan found that 3 per cent of such target-date funds invested in private real estate, 43 per cent had allocations to global Reits, 47 per cent used commodities, while 20 per cent -indicated that they invested with an alternative strategy such as absolute return.

To address liquidity concerns, fund managers have added cash buffers and have offered real estate only as a portion of a fund.

Multiple Reits are often bundled within the same mutual fund, Mr Veneruso explains. Fund companies that emphasise active management are more likely than index fund providers to offer alternative strategies within retirement plans, he says.

The ranks of target-date providers that have incorporated alternatives include Putnam Investments, Invesco, Prudential and Pimco.

Putnam's funds include holdings in the company's line of Dynamic Asset Allocation and absolute return funds.

Prudential, which is in the midst of rebranding its four-year-old target-date series, incorporates a higher percentage of non-traditional assets as a fund progresses along its glide path, when an investor's assets have less time to recover from volatility.

"We think it helps produce better outcomes through having the diversity," says Joan Bozek, -senior vice-president of investment products at -Prudential. "It has not had a huge impact. But it has had an impact in maintaining competitive, reliable returns overall."

Business
Digital Diligence, Doubts Show at Ad Gathering; Marketers Prove Willing to Experiment but Aren't Convinced of Results

At this year's Advertising Week gathering in New York, it was clear that marketers were willing to try just about any digital experiment from syncing TV ads with tablet spots, to embedding ads in Twitter streams, to letting machines automate ad buying.

But, despite all the excitement, marketers still aren't sure if all their digital initiatives are helping them reach new audiences. A survey released this week by Adobe Systems Inc. showed that just 9% of marketers strongly agreed with the statement "I know our digital marketing is working."

Beyond serving up more than 100 seminars on topics like "Big Data and the Death of the Big Idea," the annual marketing jamboree, which began Monday, gave executives a chance to schmooze and swap notes on the sweeping changes in the ad industry. Cocktail-hour gossip ranged from the implications of the pending merger between industry giants Omnicom Group Inc. and Publicis Groupe SA to Twitter Inc.'s initial-public-offering plans.

Madison Avenue's elite have been cozying up more and more to their Silicon Valley counterparts. Facebook Inc. threw a party on the High Line, an elevated park in Manhattan, at which Keith Weed, Unilever's chief marketing officer, chatted with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, partygoers said.

Chuck Porter, chairman of ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, was seen at a poker game hosted by online-game maker Zynga Inc., sporting a velvet smoking jacket and munching sliders.

"There is a genuine relationship aspect to this business," said Tim Spengler, chief executive officer of Magna Global, a media-buying arm of Interpublic Group of Cos.

The Adobe survey found that 76% of marketers think marketing has changed more in the past two years than in the past 50.

At one discussion, called "Creative Carousel," top ad executives spoke of the mounting demands on ad creators as technology offers new advertising opportunities. Agency talent needs to know as much about Facebook posts and sponsored tweets as traditional formats, they said.

"Sometimes I miss the days when I had a print ad and a radio spot," said Carlos Figueiredo, a creative director at PublicisKaplan Thaler. He said it feels like there are "a billion" ad options.

On the digital front, a priority for advertisers is figuring out how to amplify their "first screen," or television, ads with spots on other screens  whether laptops, smartphones or tablets.

Twitter is proving a popular outlet for making that happen. The social-media service has been signing up media partners and advertisers for a program that puts ad-supported video clips into users' feeds. The latest example: the National Football League said this week that it will put football- game clips on Twitter that will include short ads from sponsors including Verizon Wireless.

Such Twitter deals still represent a tiny share of spending. The sponsorships for the NFL deal, for example, are in the low-eight-figure range for the 17-week regular season and playoffs, according to a person familiar with the matter. By contrast, the price of a single 30-second spot on "American Idol" last year ranged from roughly $300,000 to $500,000, according to ad buyers.

The music app Shazam offers another way to link TV with laptops and mobile devices. The app's audio fingerprint-recognition technology started out as a way to identify a song playing in a bar or on a car radio. But marketers are putting it to use to augment TV advertising.

When viewers watch certain TV ads and want more information, they can hold Shazam up to the set and it will transfer the information to their phones. Y&R, an ad firm owned by WPP PLC, talked up its collaborations with tech companies like Shazam at one of the panels.

Meanwhile, Vivaki, the digital arm of Publicis Groupe, touted Zeebox, a service that allows marketers to place ads on mobile devices that are synced up with ads running on TV.

Some in the ad industry say this is overkill, and potentially distracting to consumers. But marketers are trying it out. Vivaki ran campaigns for brands such as Kraft Foods Group Inc.'s Mio flavored water drops. Ads running on the Zeebox app saw click-through rates of about 39%, said Beth Doyle, vice president of Innovations at Vivaki.

Based on the numbers, marketers are embracing the digital chaos. Digital-ad spending will represent about a quarter of world-wide ad spending by 2014, up from 20.7% last year, according to a report released Wednesday by eMarketer and Publicis's Starcom MediaVest Group.

That isn't to say the focus at this year's gathering was all digital. The traditional media businesses went all out. Clear Channel Media & Entertainment, a unit of CC Media Holdings Inc., wined and dined marketers such as Bank of America Corp. with the help of mini egg rolls, cookies and milk and a serenade from singer John Mayer.

JC Penney in further decline as short sellers pile on the pressure; WALL STREET

JC Penney shares continued a nightmarish year yesterday while the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks hit an intraday record high.

The budget retailer fell 14.5 per cent to $10.17 after analysts at Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the company and hit the stock with an "underperform" rating.

Shares in JC Penney are down 60 per cent in the past 12 months, which has included an ill-fated attempt by Bill Ackman , manager of hedge fund Pershing Square, to reinvent the company.

The sale of Ackman's stake attracted some buyers, who helped boost the stock in early September. But consistent short selling, which intensified yesterday, has kept downward pressure on shares.

"The number of [JC Penney] shares being shorted has been increasing quite significantly and today alone there seems to be another 4m shares borrowed . . . about a 6 per cent increase," said Tim Smith, executive vice-president of Sungard's Astec Analytics, which provides short selling analysis. "It's at the highest level its been this year. Over the past few days, it has climbed significantly - from 61m to about 67m."

US indices were volatile for much of the day, opening lower, rising in midday trading, then falling sharply after reports came out that Walmart had cut back on new orders due to rising inventories. The claims, which Walmart denied, helped send shares down 1.5 per cent to $74.65.

The S&P 500 closed off 0.3 per cent to 1,692.77. The financial sector was the strongest area, up 0.5 per cent, while the healthcare sector declined 0.8 per cent.

The S&P remains 1.6 per cent off its record highs of last week. The same cannot be said for the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalisation companis, which is only 0.3 per cent off its all-time high.

The Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies with a median market capitalisation of $616m, briefly touched an intraday record of 1,082, but ended the day off 0.1 per cent to 1,073.51.

JPMorgan Chase supported the buying as investors learned that the bank was in talks to settle allegations over wrongdoing in the mortgage securities market for about $4bn.

Shares of the bank were up 2.7 per cent to $51.70.

Cruise ship operator Carnival extended Tuesday's fall with another decline, as analysts from JPMorgan, Nomura, and Credit Suisse downgraded the company after it announced disappointing third-quarter results.

Carnival shares lost 5.3 per cent on the day to $32.70, and are down 12.6 per cent in the past two days.

Car parts retailer AutoZone added 2.6 per cent to $425.07 despite reporting fourth-quarter results that missed expectations. The company has been boosted in 2013 by continued strength from US car manufacturers, and is up 19.3 per cent on the year to date.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 15,273.26, and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 0.2 per cent to 3,761.10.

The day's decline was a fifth-consecutive negative session for the S&P and the Dow.

While there is concern that a possible government shutdown and a debt ceiling debate may spook investors leading into Halloween, the recent selling has been far from a rush for the exits.

"You're seeing the market cautious, but you're not seeing panic in the market," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.

Political wrangling in Washington continues to loom over the market, she added, but investors have seen a government shutdown before, along with its effect on the markets.

Aviva division head leaves after year in job

The head of one of Aviva's biggest divisions is leaving the FTSE 100 insurer after little more than a year in the job in the latest management shake-up under Mark Wilson, its new chief executive.

Robin Spencer joined one of Aviva's predecessor companies almost 20 years ago but has run the UK & Ireland general insurance business only since July last year.

He will be replaced by Maurice Tulloch, who runs Aviva's Canada business, after Mr Wilson said he wanted to have "the right people in the right jobs".

Insiders said that while the new chief executive regarded the financial performance of the UK general insurance operation as satisfactory, he wanted a new face to lead efforts to expand the business.

They said Mr Wilson feels that the division, which sells products including motor, home and commercial insurance, could do more to capitalise on Aviva's extensive life business, possibly through more cross-selling.

Aviva rebuffed a 5bn offer for the UK general insurance business from rival RSA three years ago during the tenure of Andrew Moss, former chief executive who quit after a pay row last year.

Some analysts think Aviva's recent rejig of its complex financial structure - the holding company owes billions of pounds worth of internal debt to the division - would make it easier to sell the operation.

However, senior Aviva managers have denied this is the rationale for the changes to the group's capital structure.

The UK general insurance business is among the most cash generative of Aviva's units.

However, it operates in one of the most competitive markets for insurance in the developed world and Mr Spencer - who is also a former chief executive of Aviva Canada - has led a cost-cutting push.

For every pound in premiums it received last year, it incurred 98p in claims costs and other expenses. This was the same as the year before.

In contrast, the general insurance business in Canada incurred 93p in claims costs and other expenses last year - an improvement from 95p a year earlier.

Mr Tulloch delivered a 63 per cent rise in profits at the Canada business during his tenure as chief executive, since 2009.

He has sought to expand Aviva's use of "predicative analytics" to price insurance policies more accurately - modelling, for example, how the height of buildings affects wind speeds and the risks of storm-related damage to nearby property.

Mr Wilson has said Aviva should be better at sharing expertise across its internal operations and Mr Tulloch's arrival in the UK should herald the expansion of such techniques in the insurer's domestic markets.

He joined one of the insurer's predecessor companies in 1992 and has spent most of his career in Canada - home to Aviva's second largest general insurance business after the UK - apart from a two-year spell in London.

In a statement, Mr Wilson said Mr Tulloch had an "impeccable track record" and was "the best leader to take the UK business to the next stage of its development."

He added: "Robin has done a fine job for the group, most recently leading the UK & Ireland GI business through the transformation and expense savings programme.

I would like to thank Robin for his considerable contribution to Aviva and he leaves the group with our best wishes."

FireEye, Rocket Fuel Surge as Investors Boost Tech IPOs

Shares of Internet security firm FireEye Inc. soared on their first day of trading Friday, benefiting from investor interest in the security sector following some high-profile hacks at companies and government agencies in recent years.

The successful initial public offering comes even as some question whether the market can support so many antihacking companies, many of which rely on similar technology.

Meanwhile, another hot IPO by Rocket Fuel Inc. suggests that investors also are optimistic about some advertising-technology companies.

Both companies' shares more than doubled in early trading Friday, though they gave back some of those gains later in the trading session.

FireEye, a Silicon Valley company led by veteran software executive Dave DeWalt, priced its first round of shares Thursday at $20, raising $280 million. The stock closed at $36, up 80%, giving it a market capitalization of about $4.2 billion.

The valuation might seem high for a company with $83.3 million in revenues in 2012. Mr. DeWalt said the "evil emanating from the Internet" is creating a surge in spending for companies like FireEye. "There's going to be a tectonic shift in spending and someone is going to get that," he said. "We have as good a chance as anybody."

Mr. DeWalt's past exploits include selling McAfee, a bigger security company known for antivirus software, to Intel Corp. for $7.68 billion. Last year he joined FireEye, which was founded in 2004. He now holds stock worth nearly $166 million at Friday's closing price.

FireEye seeks to block the most advanced hackers by observing the behavior of their code, rather than the longtime approach of matching incoming software with known malicious programs. It does this by testing code downloaded onto a computer in a sort of digital petri dish walled off from the rest of the network.

In theory, this allows the company to block dangerous code never seen before called a "Zero-Day" attack simply because it acts like something up to no good.

However, many larger companies, including Trend Micro Inc. of Japan, Palo Alto Networks Inc. and AhnLab Inc. of South Korea use similar approaches and are improving their products, some security experts say.

"It's a bit of a bubble," said Adam Hils, a researcher on cybersecurity technology at Gartner Inc., of the buzz around FireEye. "If they're going to be a viable product company, they need to broaden their portfolio and they're doing that."

"There is a limit to what the market can absorb," said investor Ted Schlein, whose firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has invested in many security companies.

FireEye has already expanded its offerings, and they work on servers and data centers instead of just individual machines, according to Mr. DeWalt.

For the six months ended June 2013, FireEye reported a $67.2 million loss. Its revenue for the same period more than doubled to $61.6 million.

Like other companies that offer software as a subscription service, FireEye books much of its revenue over time rather than as it cuts sales deals.

Shares of advertising firm Rocket Fuel, meanwhile, shot up 93% to close at $56.10 in its first trading session Friday. The company fared much better than some other advertising-related IPOs of the recent past.

Most ad technology companies operate networks in which advertisers and publishers talk to each other about when and where to place ads. Rocket Fuel, founded in 2008, instead primarily serves advertisers with an artificial-intelligence program that makes rapid decisions about when and where to place ads.

George John, Rocket Fuel's chief executive and co-founder, said that talking about Rocket Fuel's big data use "really helped" with general tech investors on the roadshow. "A lot of people were talking about big data, and a lot of them wanted to know more about the [artificial intelligence] business on top of it," he said.

As for why investors seem more enthusiastic about advertising startups, factors include more mature companies going public and a greater familiarity with online, or cloud, offerings in a variety of sectors, said Nelson Griggs, senior vice president at Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., where FireEye and Rocket Fuel listed on Friday.

"The kind of technology [IPOs] getting done have shifted from the pure cloud companies to companies doing things important to the cloud," Mr. Griggs said.

Corrections & Amplifications Rocket Fuel Inc.'s stock rose 93% in its initial trading session Friday. An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the increase as 83%. Also, Adam Hils is a researcher on cybersecurity technology at Gartner Inc. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to him as Adam Hills.

Corporate News -- The Week Ahead: Digital Marketing Takes Center Stage

At first glance, Kardashian mother Kris Jenner, the E*Trade baby, singer-songwriter John Mayer and Twitter seem to have little in common. Then again, the Advertising Week in New York conference tends to create strange bedfellows.

Roughly 90,000 advertising and marketing professionals are expected to participate in the 10th annual Advertising Week in New York, which begins Monday. The weeklong event, which includes roughly 250 seminars and parties, will seek to show off how well Madison Avenue has embraced digital marketing, such as social media to mobile advertising.

Digital advertising continues to be a bright spot in the ad industry and it is expected to grow nearly 14% in the U.S. to $42.26 billion this year, according to research firm eMarketer.

Companies such as Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., along with more than 100 advertising technology startups, are expected to show off their latest products this week and attempt to woo dollars from ad firms and marketers, such as PepsiCo Inc., Macy's Inc. and Priceline.com Inc.

A focus of the event will be the rise of "big data" -- the use of powerful computing to analyze troves of information.

The push signifies how the marketing business is becoming "equal parts art and science," said Matt Freeman, an operating partner at Bain Capital and chairman of Advertising Week. More data are underpinning things such as media buying, product development and creative development, he said.

Madison Avenue is becoming increasingly reliant on data and analytics. Advertisers are using information on consumers' purchasing histories and their online behavior to help guide companies' ad-buying decisions.

What people say on social media sites such as Twitter is being incorporated into the ad-creation process, ad executives said.

When Publicis Groupe SA and Omnicom Group Inc. announced their pending $35 billion merger this summer, the companies played up that boosting data analytics was part of the logic of the deal.

On Tuesday, RadiumOne Inc., an online-ad firm that targets consumers based on what they share on social media, will host a panel about how marketers are "applying and finding golden nuggets in the data that helps them solve business problems," said Eric Bader, RadiumOne's chief marketing officer.

Meanwhile, Acxiom Corp. is expected to debut a new product that will allow marketers and ad firms to use more data in the media-buying and planning process in online and offline media.

Data also will be a theme Monday, when AOL Inc. hosts the first of the "upfront" presentations for advertisers for its automated ad-buying businesses. With its upfront presentation, AOL is taking a page from the television business, which holds an annual event where marketers commit to buying TV ad time in advance of the new fall season.

AOL is hoping to persuade advertisers to earmark more of their ad dollars for "programmatic ad buying," an increasingly crowded sector in which ads are bought through automated exchanges, often in real time.

Programmatic buying will account for a small portion of the estimated $505 billion that marketers world-wide are expected to shell out this year, but it is growing fast.

Real-time bidding for digital display ads in the U.S. is expected to jump 73.9% this year to $3.34 billion, according to eMarketer.

For the nongeek crowd, Ms. Jenner will talk about the Kardashian brand, while Mr. Mayer will serenade deep-pocketed marketers on behalf of media consulting firm MediaLink LLC and Clear Channel Media & Entertainment, a unit of CC Media Holdings Inc.

Ad characters such as such as StarKist Co.'s Charlie the Tuna, Travelocity.Com's Roaming Gnome, and Toucan Sam, who hawks Kellogg Co.'s Froot Loops, will ride on a double-decker bus through Times Square as they compete to be inducted into Advertising Week's Madison Avenue Walk of Fame.

U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Housing's Pillars Get Rethink

Washington is finally talking seriously about how to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance juggernauts that the government was forced to rescue five years ago. Just don't expect quick action.

The firms are proving to be as difficult to shut down as the U.S.-operated Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided over what to do. On the surface, the disagreements concern what role the government should play in the mortgage market.

But the real debate boils down to this: Should all Americans continue to have relatively easy access to the pre-payable, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage?

American homeowners love the 30-year mortgage, which isn't available in most other countries. It provides payments that are stable for the life of the loan, which makes finances easier to manage. In many other countries, homes are financed with adjustable-rate mortgages, where payments rise and fall with prevailing interest rates.

The government plays an unusually large role in the U.S. mortgage market because banks don't like holding 30-year mortgages. During the 1980s, many savings-and-loan associations failed when rates jumped because the interest they had to pay to depositors soared above the payments they received on those 30-year mortgages. This is known as "interest-rate risk."

Enter Fannie and Freddie. They don't make loans. Instead, they buy them from lenders, package them into securities, and sell those to investors. They promise to make investors whole when mortgages default. In other words, they take the credit risk.

This middleman role is important. It matches banks with pension funds and other investors that are more willing to take on the interest-rate risk. The companies also set uniform standards that facilitated very liquid securities markets.

The 30-year mortgage is available mainly because of government guarantees -- implied before the crisis and explicit since 2008.

Those who want the government out of the mortgage business say the 30-year fixed isn't all it's cracked up to be. Because borrowers pay a lot of interest during the first few years of the loan, it's hard to quickly build equity. This makes the loan less practical in an era where people move, switch jobs, and get divorced more often than in the past.

Defenders, however, say it's the wrong time to push more people into adjustable-rate loans because interest rates are likely to rise over the coming decade.

Wouldn't banks still offer the 30-year fixed mortgage without a government guarantee if it's so popular? Maybe, but they would likely require bigger down payments and higher rates.

It's a math issue. There is nearly $10 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding today with around $4.5 trillion backed by Fannie and Freddie. Scrapping the government's role means finding trillions of dollars ready to absorb the credit and interest-rate risk for new mortgages, since the firms have backed around two-thirds of those made since 2009.

Of course, every overhaul plan calls for more private capital. That goal faces three challenges:

First, private capital had a lousy track record during the bubble. Loans securitized without government backing performed worse than Fannie's or Freddie's, largely because investors relied too heavily on triple-A ratings. Between 2006 and 2012, Fannie, Freddie, and federal agencies suffered $206 billion in mortgage losses, or around 3.9% of all loans they guaranteed, according to data from Moody'sAnalytics. Privately issued securities, by contrast, faced $449 billion in losses, or 20% of all loans.

Second, a mostly private market could further concentrate lending in the largest banks -- exacerbating the "too big to fail" problem. In 2008, the top five banks in Canada, the U.K. and Australia, for example, funded more than half of all mortgages. During the crisis, many European banks were viewed as implicitly guaranteed by the government. In the U.S., pushing more mortgages into federally insured banks also doesn't get the government off the hook, a lesson already learned during the S&L crises of the 1980s.

Third, private capital takes on more risk in good times but exits quickly at the first sign of trouble. This tends to magnify the boom-and-bust nature of real estate. Downturns are worse because credit is hardest to find when it's most needed.

Several overhaul proposals propose creating federal reinsurance for mortgage-backed securities. Any government guarantee would be explicit and paid for by investors, akin to deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Government insurance solves some problems while creating others. Chiefly, taxpayers could face losses if capital levels or fees are set too low for this new insurance.

Fannie and Freddie, which held far too little capital to withstand the downturn, had for years argued successfully that higher capital standards translated to more costly mortgages, meaning less homeownership. Today, some worry that the housing industry would eventually make similar arguments for lower fees.

No one said an overhaul would be easy. Ultimately, Washington will have to be honest about what it wants and what that will cost.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
F&C Investment Trust suffers from being too small in Japan; Fund focus

Manager Jeremy Tigue is unsure if emerging markets offer value yet, says Eleanor Lawrie

F&C Investments' Jeremy Tigue, who runs the 2.7bn Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust, has admitted he missed out on the recent surge in Japanese stocks, calling it his "biggest mistake" of the year.

Japan has left other markets standing since last November, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began a successful general election campaign with the mandate of introducing a number of monetary-easing measures to devalue the yen and fuel economic growth.

From November 11 2012 to mid-September this year the Nikkei 225 index of leading Japanese shares rallied by roughly 60 per cent, compared with a 25 per cent rise in the MSCI World index of global shares.

But Mr Tigue had a 4.7 per cent weighting to Japan, an underweight position when compared with the 7.2 per cent of the trust's benchmark FTSE All World index, which the trust adopted as its benchmark at the start of 2013.

"I put my hands up and admit I got [Japan] completely wrong," he says.

"That's been my biggest mistake this year."

The manager has delivered returns of 16.5 per cent in the year to date, in line with his peers within the AIC Global Growth sector, according to FE Analytics.

Away from Japan, the manager says he has begun to brace his investment trust for a fall in markets and has removed some of the borrowing, which has contributed to the year-to-date performance.

Mr Tigue says the level of gearing, a form of borrowing that amplifies investment gains or losses, had been reduced to 12 per cent and would fall further to 10 per cent. The trust's board allows a maximum of 20 per cent - a ceiling the manager neared in 2011.

"We are definitely more cautious than we were a year ago, and in September 2011," he says.

"The eurozone was going down the tube [at that time] and US debt had been downgraded, which was a huge deal. But we thought that was ridiculous. Companies were still making a profit so we were pretty bullish and increased our gearing," he says.

He adds: "The opportunities that were there a year ago are not there now."

Mr Tigue's view extends to emerging markets. The manager says he is unsure if valuations have fallen enough to present buying opportunities. Stock prices are still "not that cheap", according to Mr Tigue.

The manager has 8.5 per cent of his portfolio exposed to emerging market stocks, compared with 15 per cent at the end of 2010.

Elsewhere, the manager says his fund would benefit from the expiry in December 2014 of a costly debenture, a 110m loan the trust took out at an interest rate of 11.25 per cent.

Mr Tigue says he and the board were "wrestling" with what to do with the money that will be at the trust's disposal once the debt instrument expires and interest payments stop. A note from Winterflood Securities, the market maker, says the debenture's market value would fall to par in December 2014, adding 15m or 2.5p per share to the net value of the trust's assets.
