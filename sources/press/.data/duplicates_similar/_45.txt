Good day. You've heard of a growth fund, an opportunity fund, and a global growth fund. Now Menlo Ventures is trying to invent a new type of fund with its "inflection fund," which it describes as an early growth fund. With SoftBank Group and others making massive late-stage deals, Menlo sees an opening to bet earlier on growth-stage companies.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Inflection funding: Menlo Ventures has closed on $500 million for a new early growth fund, with the intention of backing companies at the crucial, risky point before large-scale growth. The fund is a jump from the firm's last opportunity growth fund, which closed at $250 million in 2016. Menlo also has a $450 million early-stage fund which it closed in 2017. Menlo is looking for companies at the "inflection point," which it defined in a blog post as the "ambiguous middle ground where data, execution and risks are all open to interpretation." WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

AI for genetics: With genetics research marching forward, keeping up with all the new discoveries in the field can be a challenge for geneticists. Investors are betting Emedgene has a solution. The startup has raised $6 million to expand sales of artificial intelligence-based software that automates genetic interpretation. Geneticists use this decision-support system to help ensure they don't miss important pieces of evidence in a genetic test that could help them diagnose a patient, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Einat Metzer. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Opening up IPOs: Any company exploring whether to go public would get greater leeway to discuss their plans privately with potential investors before announcing an initial public offering, under a proposal that securities regulators released Tuesday. In a bid to boost the number of public companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed letting all companies "test the waters" before deciding whether to seek an IPO. The WSJ's Gabriel T. Rubin has the story.

Roof's Take: Social Media's Next Generation Looks to Niche Plays

By Katie Roof

Investors are looking for the next big social-media hit.

So far, the next wave of social companies hasn't reached massive scale, leaving a question of where the next Facebook or Snapchat will emerge. With few recent breakout hits, social-media funding is down, as is the number of such startups reaching a billion-dollar valuation.

Just 48 social-media businesses received $112.4 million in investment last year, according to PitchBook Data, the lowest amount of money invested in the category since 2005. The number of deals peaked at 152 in 2012.

Still, content-sharing site Pinterest Inc. is preparing for an initial public offering this year, and discussion forum Reddit Inc. just raised funding at a $3 billion valuation but both are more than a decade old.

Investors remain optimistic about chances for the next wave of social-media startups just more broadly defined.

Crypto Customers Hunt for Missing Cash

By Paul Vigna and Shane Shifflett

On a rainy January day, Jason Campbell drove for three hours from his home in Quebec City to a two-story office building in the Montreal suburb of Laval. He thought he would be picking up $1,000 in cash he had stored at cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX.

But the door of a suite on the building's second floor was locked and the office wasn't occupied. Mr. Campbell dialed the number he had been given. A man answered, refused to give his name, and said he had no money for Mr. Campbell.

The suite was the teller window in an unusual system Quadriga employed to allow customers to withdraw cash from the exchange rather than wire it to their banks. It all fell apart when the exchange filed for bankruptcy in Canada last month and claimed that $136 million of customer funds were trapped in an electronic vault rendered inaccessible by the death of the firm's chief executive.

Mr. Campbell made two fruitless trips to Laval. "I'm still hoping they'll give me a call back one day," he said.

The cash-pickup system is the latest unusual business practice at Quadriga to emerge since Gerald Cotten, the firm's 30-year-old co-founder and CEO, died in India late last year. An examination of public transaction records by independent researchers suggests Quadriga's missing funds may be gone, not stuck, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

Mr. Cotten's widow, Jennifer Robertson, is now running the company. She didn't respond to a request for comment. A company bankruptcy lawyer declined to comment.

The cash option was no secret. The exchange touted it on its website and talked about it on social media. It is unclear how much cash was funneled through the exchange in this manner. Ernst & Young, the company's bankruptcy monitor, has said Quadriga kept no accounting records.

Tara Smith, another Quadriga customer, said her husband drove eight hours to the Laval office last month to collect $1,200, only to find it closed. "Our cash went to something, whether it's an orphanage or somebody's new car," she said.

On Jan. 15, Quadriga announced on its website that Mr. Cotten had died Dec. 9 from complications related to Crohn's disease while building an orphanage in India. The company filed for bankruptcy in Nova Scotia two weeks later.

In court papers, the company claimed it owed customers about C$250 million ($188.9 million), including C$180 million in cryptocurrency, spread across more than 100,000 accounts. Ms. Robertson has said the cryptocurrency is trapped in offline accounts she can't access because only Mr. Cotten had the required codes.

But evidence is mounting that at least some of the money is missing. In particular, between $10.1 million and $24.7 million worth of the cryptocurrency ether left the online accounts of Quadriga and moved through an exchange often associated with money launderers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of publicly available transaction data.

Quadriga claimed it employed a "cold storage" system for its customers' assets, holding digital currencies like bitcoin and ether in offline vaults guarded by "the most advanced security measures in the bitcoin industry."

Yet nearly all of the 1.4 million ether in accounts seemingly controlled by Quadriga and examined by the Journal was routed to other online wallets and exchanges. At least 268,000 ether went to ShapeShift AG, a digital-asset exchange operating from Denver. Suspected criminals have used ShapeShift to launder millions of dollars, the Journal reported last year.

"It's pretty clear there are no cold wallets holding ether," said Max Galka, the chief executive of cryptocurrency analytics firm Elementus Group.

Most cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the U.S. say they follow federal rules to combat money laundering. ShapeShift didn't do so until October 2018, when it began requiring identification. Until then, users could transact anonymously.

"The customer transactions between ShapeShift and QuadrigaCX are similar to those experienced by other exchanges and would not have appeared unusual at the time of the transactions," said Veronica McGregor, ShapeShift's chief legal officer. "Although we have yet to be contacted by law enforcement, we stand ready to help in any way that we can."

Wallets associated with Quadriga's publicly identifiable accounts sent ether to ShapeShift that was converted into bitcoin and other currencies. It was later funneled to other accounts and exchanges through multiple digital wallets.

Cryptocurrency analysis firm Bloxy also tracked Quadriga's funds to ShapeShift. Quadriga's use of ShapeShift, which charges higher fees than other exchanges, should have been a red flag, said Bloxy founder Dean Karakitsos.

Quadriga's money problems may have begun with one incident just as the crypto market was heating up. In June 2017, the exchange announced that a software upgrade inadvertently sent 67,000 ether it was holding for customers to a wallet it couldn't access. The lost ether were worth $14 million at the time of the software upgrade. By the end of 2017, they would be worth $90 million.

At the time, Quadriga said it would credit customers for the missing ether and absorb the loss.

Investors Warn Against Complacency on Fed Pause; Mester Sees Rates Slightly Higher This Year; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Wednesday, February 20, 2019

Good day. Is the Federal Reserve done raising rates, or merely on a hiatus? Stocks and bonds are rising on bets that rates won't go any higher, but some investors are concerned the Fed could upend those expectations. Money managers will get another look at the Fed's view on interest rates and the economy later Wednesday, when the central bank is scheduled to release minutes from its January meeting. And Cleveland Fed leader Loretta Mester said the central bank's next rate move was likely "a little bit later this year."

Fed's Loretta Mester Sees Interest Rates Slightly Higher This Year

The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said Tuesday that interest rates "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-loretta-mester-sees-interest-rates-slightly-higher-this-year-11550586378" slightly this year, assuming the economy grows at the healthy clip she anticipates. Stocks and bonds are rising on bets that the Federal Reserve has ended its nearly four-year campaign of interest-rate increases, worrying investors who believe the central bank could upend those expectations later this year.Ms. Mester, who is not a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said she estimates a "neutral" rate that neither stimulates nor spurs economic growth to be around 3%. The fed-funds rate is currently set in a range between 2.25% and 2.5%.

How Long Will Fed's Rate Pause Last? Minutes Could Yield Clues

The Federal Reserve releases the minutes of its Jan. 29-30 meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST, providing more detail about officials' discussions before they formally signaled a halt to interest rate rises. Last month, officials also underscored their more-flexible posture by providing important updates about their policy for shrinking their $4 trillion asset portfolio. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-long-will-feds-rate-pause-last-minutes-could-yield-clues-11550658600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2"

Investors Sound Warning About Markets' Complacency on Interest Rates

Stocks and bonds are rising on bets that the Federal Reserve has ended its nearly four-year campaign of interest-rate increases, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-sound-warning-about-markets-complacency-on-interest-rates-11550588400" who believe the central bank could upend those expectations later this year. Much of the disagreement over the Fed's next rate move stems from its decision in January to remove explicit reference to future rate increases from its monetary-policy statement. Before the January meeting, the central bank had included that language in all of its statements since 2015.

Markets Warm to the Prospect of an ECB Funding Boost for Banks

Market participants are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/markets-warm-to-the-prospect-of-an-ecb-funding-boost-for-banks-11550656802" that the European Central Bank will soon try to boost the eurozone's ailing economy by rebooting its program of ultracheap long-term loans to the banking system.

Europe Again Champions Intervention to Counter China's Economic Might

European leaders are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-again-champions-intervention-to-counter-chinas-economic-might-11550572200" of giving the market's invisible hand a helping hand in an effort to counter China's state-backed capitalism. Government intervention to help build corporate champions was Europe's standard for the postwar decades but faded amid privatizations and deregulation starting in the 1980s. Now, Europe's struggle to keep up with China's government coordination of business and the economic might of the U.S. has prompted more European politicians to advocate interventionism.

Asia's Most Radical Left-Wing Economic Program Faces Harsh Reality

South Korean President Moon Jae-in's flagship economic policy, "income-led growth," has led to dramatic increases in minimum wages since he took office in 2017. Those increases are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/asias-most-radical-left-wing-economic-program-faces-a-harsh-reality-11550652596?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" a rise in unemployment, just as a slump in global trade is already buffeting Korea.

SEC Wants to Make It Easier for Companies to Explore IPOs

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTON Any company exploring whether to go public "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-companies-to-explore-ipos-11550608078" to discuss their plans privately with potential investors before announcing an initial public offering, under a proposal that securities regulators released Tuesday.

In a bid to boost the number of public companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed letting all companies "test the waters" before deciding whether to seek an IPO. The agency had previously allowed only smaller, emerging companies to talk to investors privately.

Making it easier and more appealing for companies to go public has been a central goal of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. The number of public companies has fallen by nearly 50% since the late 1990s. Several startups valued at above $1 billion, including Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., have held off on going public, though there are signs that some of those companies might make the move in 2019.

"Extending the test-the-waters reform to a broader range of issuers is designed to enhance their ability to conduct successful public securities offerings and lower their cost of capital, and ultimately to provide investors with more opportunities," Mr. Clayton said in a written statement.

Under Tuesday's proposal, firms would be able to discuss securities offerings with sophisticated investors, including institutional firms such as asset managers and other accredited investors. The conversations would allow companies to identify information that is important to investors and to gauge market interest before formally announcing a public offering.

Expanding the testing-the-waters rules is the latest in a series of efforts to boost public offerings. The move follows an action that let all companies file IPO paperwork confidentially with the SEC, which allows firms to keep their financial data secret if they decide not to go public.

The SEC also is considering changes to the shareholder proposal system, which some companies complain makes going public less appealing. The SEC is considering changing the minimum stake an investor must hold in a company to be able to submit a shareholder resolution, as well as possible modifications to how much support a proposal must receive each year in order to remain on an annual shareholder meeting proxy ballot.

The Wall Street Journal first reported that the SEC was planning changes to testing the waters last year.

Danske Bank to Shut Estonia Branch

By Samuel Rubenfeld in New York and Dominic Chopping in Stockholm

Danske Bank A/S is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/danske-bank-to-shut-estonia-branch-11550595242" in Estonia as the fallout continues from a massive money-laundering scandal that has led to investigations in several countries.

The bank said Tuesday that it was told to close down its operations in the country by Estonian regulators.

Danske Bank is under investigation in Estonia, Denmark, the U.S., U.K. and France for allegedly facilitating the laundering of about $230 billion by non-Estonians through its branch in Tallinn, Estonia, primarily by Russians, between 2007 and 2015.

Estonian regulators told Danske Bank to close the Tallinn branch within eight months and return, in full, the deposits of its customers. It has to transfer or resell all customer agreements within that time frame, or face a fine of  ¬100,000, or about $113,000, a day.

"We are sorry to be leaving Estonia against this background," said interim Danske Bank Chief Executive Jesper Nielsen, in a statement. "We understand the severity with which the Estonian [regulator] looks at this case, and we will close down our remaining activities as requested."

"We will continue our cooperation with the Estonian and other relevant authorities," Mr. Nielsen said.

Danske Bank violated antimoney-laundering rules for years by allowing high-risk clients to make suspicious transactions through the bank, and it misled Estonian authorities by providing inadequate information, the regulator said.

The bank had already closed the nonresident business line in Estonia. The scandal has led to the departure of a number of top executives. In September, Danske Bank released an investigation into the matter by a Danish law firm; its then-CEO stepped down when announcing the probe's findings.

Danske Bank said it is also closing its activities in Latvia, Lithuania and Russia independent of the Estonian order, shifting to focus on its core Nordic assets. A shared services center in Lithuania that undertakes a number of Danske administrative functions will continue operations, the bank said.

"The decision to close down our activities completely in the Baltics and in Russia is fully in keeping with this strategy," Mr. Nielsen said.

The decision won't have any bearing on the bank's 2019 guidance, it said.

Also Tuesday, the European Banking Authority, which oversees the European member-state national antimoney-laundering regulators, said it opened a formal probe into Estonian and Danish regulators over how they supervised Danske Bank's activity. The decision follows a request from the European Commission in September 2018 to use its authority to examine whether there were failures by the regulators to comply with their bloc obligations, it said.

Global Witness, an anticorruption group, welcomed the European Banking Authority's announcement, saying it's a positive step toward rebuilding the bloc's ability to fight corruption.

"The sheer scale of the money-laundering scandal at Dankse Bank in Estonia has shaken Europe to its core," said Nienke Palstra, an anticorruption campaigner at Global Witness. "We must see Danish and Estonian authorities, Danske Bank and senior bankers held to account to make sure this never happens again."

 Our Cash Went to Something': Customers Hunt for Bankrupt Crypto Exchange's Missing Millions

By Paul Vigna and Shane Shifflett

On a rainy January day, Jason Campbell drove for three hours from his home in Quebec City to a two-story office building in the Montreal suburb of Laval. He thought he would be picking up $1,000 in cash he had stored at cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX.

But the door of a suite on the building's second floor was locked and the office "https://www.wsj.com/articles/our-cash-went-to-something-customers-hunt-for-bankrupt-crypto-exchanges-missing-millions-11550596908".

McKinsey Settles Alleged Bankruptcy Abuses

By Gretchen Morgenson and Tom Corrigan

McKinsey & Co. agreed to pay $15 million to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mckinsey-u-s-settle-alleged-bankruptcy-abuses-11550605039?mod=hp_lista_pos2" that the large consulting firm failed to make required disclosures of potential conflicts in three chapter 11 cases it had advised on in recent years.

The settlement was struck between McKinsey and the U.S. Trustee Program, which is charged with protecting the integrity of the nation's bankruptcy system. The fine represents "one of the highest repayments made by a bankruptcy professional for alleged non-compliance with disclosure rules," according to the Justice Department.

"McKinsey failed to satisfy its obligations under bankruptcy law and demonstrated a lack of candor with the court" and U.S. Trustee said Cliff White, director of the Trustee Program, in a statement. "This settlement ensures that McKinsey is held to the same standards applicable to all professionals who participate in bankruptcy cases."

Mr. White added that if McKinsey repeats its problematic disclosure practices, his office "will seek even more far-reaching remedies."

McKinsey didn't have an immediate comment. In the past, McKinsey has maintained that its disclosures are appropriate and comply with the law.

McKinsey's undisclosed conflicts in bankruptcy cases it had worked on were the subject of a 2018 investigation by The Wall Street Journal. In seven of the 14 chapter 11 cases in which McKinsey acted as an adviser to the debtors, the Journal found, the firm had a financial interest in the outcome.

The Journal also found that McKinsey named far fewer connections in each bankruptcy case it worked on than other advisers did.

The chapter 11 process requires that advisers working on a case be disinterested parties and they are expected to disclose any potential conflicts so that other participants are aware of them.

Last month, the judge who had overseen a 2015 bankruptcy of coal-mining company Alpha Natural Resources decided to reopen that case to determine whether McKinsey's investment in a hedge fund that received Alpha's most valuable assets had tainted the bankruptcy process.

The judge said McKinsey never disclosed the investment to him even though he gave McKinsey an opportunity to disclose its connections privately in his chambers.

Worrying About Deficit Is Going Out of Style

"It's no longer cool to talk about the federal budget deficit," "https://www.wsj.com/articles/worrying-about-deficits-falls-out-of-style-11550503956". President Trump during his 82-minute State of the Union address this month didn't say a word about the budget deficit. Nor was it mentioned by Stacey Abrams, the rising Georgia political star, in her Democratic response, Mr. Seib points out. He says "Washington's red-ink alarms have gone dead" as the annual deficit reaches roughly $900 billion this year and is set to pass the trillion-dollar mark annually starting in 2022. Accumulated public debt just surpassed $22 trillion. He cautions that it comes at a cost: The federal debt held by the public will reach 93% of America's gross domestic product by 2029, its highest level since just after World War II, increasing the bill Americans have to pay in interest.

President Trump gave his firmest indication yet that the U.S. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-eases-off-hard-deadline-for-china-tariffs-11550621471" increase tariffs on Chinese goods on March 1, as scheduled, despite his top trade official saying the U.S. should stick to a firm deadline.

Germany's current-account surplus was the world's largest for the third year in a row in 2018. The surplus, a measure of excess savings in the economy, was $294 billion in 2018, or 7.4% of the nation's economic output, German think tank Ifo said. (Dow Jones Newswires)

The eurozone's current-account surplus narrowed further in the final month of 2018, reflecting weaker exports, European Central Bank data showed. The zone's current-account balance registered a surplus of 16 billion euros ($18.1 billion) in December compared with November's surplus of EUR23 billion. (Dow Jones Newswires)

The U.K. economy continued to add jobs in the final months of 2018, in spite of persistent jitters over the country's exit from the European Union. Vacancies were at 870,000, and the pace of wage growth stayed steady at 3.4% quarter-on-quarter. (Dow Jones Newswires)

Wage growth in Australia remained subdued in the fourth quarter, with the pace of increase easing from the previous three months. Wages rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5%, in the final three months of 2018, down from 0.6% in the prior quarter. (Dow Jones Newswires)

Menlo Ventures Closes $500 Million Fund to Back Startups at  Inflection Point'; New fund is dedicated to companies at the gap between early stage financing and mega-growth rounds

Menlo Ventures has closed $500 million for a new early growth fund, with the intention of backing companies at the crucial, risky point before large-scale growth.

The fund is a jump from the firm's last opportunity growth fund which closed at $250 million in 2016. Menlo also has a $450 million early stage fund which it closed in 2017.

Menlo is looking for companies at the "inflection point," which it defines in a blog post as the "ambiguous middle ground where data, execution and risks are all open to interpretation."

At a time when there are hundreds of seed funds, and late-stage growth funds are larger than ever, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm raised the Inflection Fund to back companies in the "gap" between early stage venture capital and large-scale growth investing. These companies can be existing Menlo portfolio companies or new investments.

Companies at this stage, Menlo wrote in a blog post, could have many promising attributes, such as a beloved product and revenue, but still carry significant risks. The firm said it has developed the capabilities to spot companies at this key juncture based on past investments at this stage in companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., Poshmark Inc. and PillPack Inc.

Menlo plans to make $20 million to $40 million investments across industries including mobility, artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure. The fund will be led by partners Matt Murphy, Mark Siegel, Shawn Carolan, Venky Ganesan, Tyler Sosin and principal Steve Sloane.

Morgan Stanley taps 'Calgary's best-kept secret'

Bank sets sights on gains from Solium Capital deal amid intense competition in wealth management sector

Morgan Stanley's bet on Solium Capital may not be big   the $900m acquisition, announced this week, amounts to a small slice of the $8.7bn that the bank earned in 2018   but it is bold.

It is a wager that technology sold to employers can give the bank an edge in the vicious competition for wealth management clients.

Whether or not Morgan Stanley turns out to be right, it is a triumph long in coming for Solium, its chief executive Marcos Lopez, and his team. They built Solium starting at the turn of the millennium in the oil and gas hub of Calgary, rather than Toronto or Vancouver, and as recently as two years ago the local newspaper was calling the business "Calgary's best-kept secret".

In its scrappy, early days, the company would let one client   the local craft brewer Big Rock   pay its bill in beer. Now Solium counts Heineken as a client, along with others including private tech companies such as Instacart, Uber and SpaceX, whose employees Morgan Stanley is keen to court.

Other financial institutions have paid up to acquire tech groups, but Solium is not a fast-growing consumer application in peer-to-peer payments or financial advice. Its revenues are running at just over $100m annually and it is modestly profitable, selling software for "equity administration, financial reporting and compliance".

It is the kind of business familiar to millions of workers who get part of their compensation in stock or stock options. Solium and its rivals, including leaders such as Computershare of Australia, produce statements and run websites or apps for workers to track how much their shares are worth.

Behind that, the software helps employers manage and monitor their stock-compensation plan, a complex back-office task that involves unpicking regulatory and reporting requirements across multiple jurisdictions. Solium also sells analytics tools that help companies automate share issuance, estimate compensation costs, optimise their capital structures, and value their equity.

One industry insider describes it as "administratively highly complex, capital-light, but very, very low-margin". It is also competitive. Every big US broker or wealth manager, from UBS to ETrade, plays in the space in one way or another, because acting as custodian for employee equity plans gives them a shot at marketing wealth management services to those employees. Someone cashing in stock or options, perhaps when an IPO or a sale makes them wealthy, could be offered financial advice and investments; longtime employees could be offered retirement products.

Such lead generation was the idea behind the creation of Solium. In 1999, it was founded by two Calgary financial advisers, John Kenny and Mark Van Hees, who left the business a few years later. Mr Lopez, barely out of college, joined the company's tech team and was chief technology officer before taking the CEO job in 2015.

Solium's shares went public at C$1 in 2001, and its was trading under C$2 as recently as 2012. Morgan Stanley paid C$19. Directors between them owned close to 20 per cent of the company before the Morgan Stanley acquisition; Mr Lopez, 42, holds a stake worth $30m, according to Bloomberg data.

Mr Lopez said Solium's edge came from approaching the task from the employers' perspective, rather than as a tool for wealth managers.

Equity administration "is an enterprise software problem that has been approached as a wealth management problem". Far from inhibiting success, being based in a smaller regional city was what made it possible for the group to survive and succeed, Mr Lopez said. Calgary was big enough to have plenty of corporate HQs, but small enough that personal relationships mattered.

"It was far enough away from the financial centres that people will take a chance on you," he said. "It was the perfect little Petri dish for us to grow."

Morgan Stanley said it would keep the business's headquarters in Calgary.

Solium has 1m equity plan participants versus Morgan Stanley's 1.5m, but a draw for Morgan Stanley is the difference between the groups: its clients are overwhelmingly public companies, but Solium's include tech groups where young employees stand a good chance of becoming wealthy down the road.

The relationships with Silicon Valley companies could prove lucrative, too, if Morgan Stanley can bag them as clients of its investment bank.

Jed Finn, chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley's wealth management business, said owning Solium allowed it to "offer our full suite of wealth management tools and advice to plan employees through Solium's platform". Steven Chubak, banking analyst at Wolfe Research, sees the acquisition as part of the US bank's effort to move its wealth management business deeper into the mass affluent category, as opposed to the higher end of the market where it is focused now.

"Looking at some of the players [in equity administration] such as ETrade, they have had a great deal of success converting these equity plan clients into [brokerage] clients," he said.

Goldman Sachs was making a similar grab for the mass affluent with its Ayco business, which provides financial coaching to employees through corporate partnerships, Mr Chubak said. Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm generated 40 per cent of the company's $11bn in pre-tax income last year, and has been central to chief executive James Gorman's push to reduce the cyclicality of the bank's earnings.

There was a hint of the Solium deal in Mr Gorman's remarks during the last quarterly earnings call. "We plan to further enhance our digital tools, as we expand and leverage our stock plan channel to convert more leads into new clients," he said. "We've long discussed the relative stability of [the wealth management] revenue base. Scale advantages only improve this story."

Banks  blockchain comedown

Your essential weekly fintech briefing

Ahblockchain. Once seen as the panacea for all that ails the financial services industry, expectations for the distributed ledger technology have been falling almost as fast as the price of the bitcoin cryptocurrency it underpins (down 82per cent from its high at the last count, in case anyone is still counting).

Citigroup boss Mike Corbat, who oversees one of the world s biggest banks and its $8bn a year technology budget, has been following the saga more closely than most and now believes that blockchain will not be  transformational  in the short term.

 I think in many of these things, the expectations and the pace of implementation far exceed 	. 	. 	. 	what s there,  he told the FT in a wide-ranging interview, where he also predicted the widespread replacement of call centre operatives by artificial intelligence.

Mr Corbat likened blockchain s evolution to  an old analogy; if you invent the fax machine and you ve got the only one, it s pretty lonely for a while, but eventually others [join]. What you re doing with blockchain and the distributed ledger, you need other players involved. And I think the industry [is] moving at different speeds. 

Or as the head of another investment bank puts it more bluntly:  The expectations at the beginning were f***ing ridiculous. 

That s not to say that bankers are giving up altogether on a technology that the financial services industry is collectively ploughing$1.7bn a yearinto, according to research from Greenwich Associates.

Mr Corbat said he has  high expectations  for the technology  in the intermediate to long term .

He called out trade finance  a multibillion dollar a year revenue line for Citi   as somewhere blockchain has serious potential since it s  one of those areas where it s still notebooks and pens and paper .

 Anything where you re trying to create a record of ownership   mortgage ownership, liens in lending, where you can go back and create a chain of ownership, it [blockchain]is very impactful,  Mr Corbat added. Another senior bank executive said blockchain has  great potential  over the longer term thanks to the need for  technology to ensure integrity (of transactions) in an inexpensive manner .

JPMorgan Chase has been fronting the industry s single largest blockchain initiative, the Interbank Information Network, where more than 100 banks are now putting information about certain cross-border transactions on to a mutually accessible ledger to cut down on delays when payments hit compliance hitches. 

Spain s BBVA has also been an active blockchain experimenter.It paired with two other banks in November to do the first ever syndicated loan on blockchain, andearlier in the year the Spanish bank issued the world s first corporate loan on blockchain.

Just last week, JPMorgan debuted their latest blockchain wheeze  the JPM Coin, whichcan be transferred almost instantly over blockchain between the banks  corporate clients, who can then convert them to dollars. The coin is known as a  stablecoin  since one JPM Coin will always equal one dollar.JPMorgan is starting small with a prototype involving a few clients and will roll it out more widely, if it goes well.

JPMorgan says the technology will help clients to do business across different time zones outside of traditionally  cut offs  and that the same technology could ultimately be used for other applications.

One to watch: FloodFlash

The claims process can be one of the most frustrating parts of insurance, often involving delays, suspicion and finally irritation when the ultimatepayment turns out to be less than you want or expect.

Parametric insurance could change all that,writes the FT's insurance correspondentOliver Ralph.Behind the nasty jargon is a straightforward concept   this is insurance that pays out as soon as an event happens, rather than after the scale of the loss has been calculated. It's often used for the sort of large scale insurance bought by governments. When there are strong stormsin the Caribbean, for example, island governments receive their money immediately.

UK-basedFloodFlashis one of the first companies to apply the principle to commercial insurance, selling flood coverage to small businesses. The company installs sensors on the outside walls of its customers  premises. If the sensor registers a flood, then a pre-agreed amount is paid immediately. No need to guess how much damage the water has actually caused, or to spend money on claims adjusters. Just the presence of the flood triggers the payment.

 Working out the likelihood of 50cm of water is one thing,  said co-founder Adam Rimmer.  Working out how 50cm of water turns into damage is a totally different problem and that s what creates uncertainty. 

Some insurers don t like the concept   they say that insurance payments should be based on actual losses. But Mr Rimmer sees scope to expand the concept to other countries. He says floods globally cause $50bn of damage a year, and only $9.5bn of that is covered by insurance.

FloodFlash soft launched its product in the UK earlier this year, and is targeting businesses in flood prone areas.  We re trying to protect people by rivers and coasts,  said Mr Rimmer.  If you are in a high risk area you could struggle to find [traditional] cover. 

Number of the week: $3.3bn

Amount invested in UK fintechs last year, according to Innovate Finance, up 18 per cent on 2017 despite uncertainties around Brexit.

Further fintech fascination

Regulators' advance:The Financial Stability Board (FSB)  a who's who of regulators from the powerful G20 countries  has become the latest watchdog to sound the alarm about Big Tech's potential impact on financial stability. The FSB warned last week that tech firms could  materially alter  financial services, creating stability risks as incumbents take chancesto keep up. The European Banking Authority and the Bank of England have separately raised similar concerns, butno one is stepping up to actually regulate the firms that offer financial services on the side. The FSB's policy recommendation is for continued monitoring of Big Tech's impact on the sector at large 	. 	. 	. 	

Trend watch:Spain's CaixaBank   less well-known for its fintech prowess than bigger rivals BBVA and Santander   has nonetheless become the first bank in Europe to unveil facial recognition at cashpoints. Caixa announced last week that its ATMs would now scan clients' faces instead of asking for their personal identification numbers, claiming the technology as a win for both  security and agility . Banks in Asia have been experimenting with facial identification for a few years now, including using it as a second layer of security in Macauand to detect fraudulent borrowers in China. Other forms of biometrics   particularly fingerprint ID   are also big on the fintech circuit and have been unveiled in afew marketsincluding South Africa. The technology is shiny and cool, but as we move to a cashless world, you can't help wondering if investment in cashpoint biometrics is money well spent 	. 	. 	. 	

Follow the money:Jack Ma'sAnt Financial is upping its advance on western markets, agreeing to pay$700m tobuyBritish payments group WorldFirst in what will be the Chinese firm'sbiggest overseas investment. The WorldFirst deal comes after Ant's attempt to buy US rival MoneyGram last year was shut down by USregulators on security grounds. Both sides are reportedly  confident  that this deal will get regulators' blessing, allowing Ant  to reach a greater number of customers, especially in the fast-growing area of cross border e-commerce . Already the world's most valuable young fintech firm   with a valuation of $150bn at its last fundraising round   Ant is best known for its Alibaba payments platform.

New frontiers:The UKgovernment is pumping1.4m into a new artificial intelligence-backed venture that will use voice recognition to spot insurance fraud.The project   a joint effort between Intelligent Voice, Strenuus and the University of East London   is aiming to  detect and interpret emotion and linguistics to assess the credibility of insurance claims . Insurance fraud costs the UK 3bn a year, a big prize to go forif the technology works. Overall, the UK government has put13m into 40 projectsin the insurance, accountancy and legal sectors as part of its Next Generation Challenge Fund, which promotes the use of AI in professional services.

Citigroup CEO says machines could cut thousands of call centre jobs

US bank can use tech to serve customers better and more cheaply, says Mike Corbat

Citigroup chief executive Mike Corbat has suggested that  tens of thousands  of people working in the US bank s call centres are likely to be replaced by machines that can  radically change or improve  customers  experience while cutting costs.

Mr Corbat, who runs America s fourth-largest bank by assets, made the comments in an interview with the Financial Times in which he also ruled out Citi s involvement in any wave of US banking consolidation triggered by the $66bn SunTrust-BB&T merger and justified its continued presence in China.

Under pressure to bring its cost base in line with peers, Citi executives have been upfront about the impact of technology on their 209,000-strong global workforce, including last summer s warning that as many as half of the 20,000 operations staff in its investment bank could be supplanted by machines.

Mr Corbat s latest comments are the most explicit the company has been on how the $8bn a year Citi spends on technology could transform its vast consumer bank, which serves 100m customers across 19 markets.

 When you think of data, AI [artificial intelligence], raw digitisation of changing processes, we still have tens of thousands of people in call centres, and we know when we can digitise those processes we not only radically change or improve the customer experience, it costs less to provide,  he said.

He would not specify how many people Citi employed in call centre jobs or how many would be affected, but said that the  30 most common customer journeys , such as ordering replacement bank cards and asking about statements, were  pretty easy to deal with .

Other companies are already using AI in call centres   UK retailer Marks and Spencer has systems that can analyse voice commands in real time and direct queries to the right department, while Google is also developing software that uses open-ended questions to find the best answers for customers and cut waiting times.

Citi has no plans to get rid of humans in its call centres altogether though.  There ll always be the kind of thing where you ve actually got to have someone to help solve,  said Mr Corbat.  We don t want people frustrated in that. 

Mr Corbat cited the potential of Citi s technology as one of the reasons that his bank would not take part in the wave of US retail banking mergers that some analysts expect to be kicked off after BB&T and SunTrust unveiled the sector s biggest post-crisis merger a fortnight ago.

SunTrust and BB&T s merger was  predominantly driven by the need for scale around the ability to invest in and implement technology , said Mr Corbat.  We have that scale 	. 	. 	. 	We re comfortable with the markets we operate in, we re comfortable with our client base 	. 	. 	. 	That very quickly leads you back to a conversation about organic growth. 

In the era of Trumpian trade wars, critics have questioned Citi s geographic spread and its exposure to Mexico, where it owns the country s second-largest bank. Citi is also the most prominent of the US banks in China.

 China needs soy, China needs beef, China needs pork, Chinese needs import of raw materials into their supply chain,  said Mr Corbat.  Those routes may change. So as we [in the US] get tariffs and embargoes and things, those soy routes may move from the US to Brazil and Argentina   two places where we operate. We ve seen a redrawing of these trade routes, but the demand hasn t gone away. 

He added that Citi remained the best owner for Citibanamex in Mexico because  if you look at the pace of digital adoption and the expectation of consumer clients, the technology we re already using in Asia and the US is totally portable to Mexico today .

Employers seek specialist hires using MBA rankings

Recruiters are joining in debates on how business schools  performance is assessed

What is the purpose of business school rankings? The question made it on to the agenda of January s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with the publication of an in-depth report:  Business School Rankings for the 21st Century .

It came from the UN Global Compact, the world s largest global corporate sustainability initiative, and the report calls for a dramatic rethink of ranking methodologies. Significantly, the driving force for change in this report is not a school or student group but a multinational financial services group, Aviva Investors, which sponsored the research.

Aviva believes that MBA rankings  methodology should reward programmes that teach responsible capitalism, according to Steve Waygood, the company s chief responsible investment officer.  As MBA course offerings are increasingly driven by rankings, how can we ensure this race to the top between MBA programmes encourages a deeper integration of sustainable finance?  he asks.

Cambridge university research associate Ellen Quigley, who co-authored the report, says,  rankings are seen as both a shortcut [for employers] to finding good people and a driver of the types of education people want to obtain .

But finding overall agreement among employers on the best set of criteria to use to rank schools seems an impossible task. The UN Global Compact report criticises ranking lists for over-emphasising graduate salaries, penalising schools whose students go on to non-profit organisations and for not properly accounting for teaching quality.

It highlighted the Financial Times s recent introduction of sustainability teaching as a requirement for inclusion in its business school rankings as an example of a change that could be made to make the lists take on a more ethical purpose. (The Financial Times has announced that it is reviewing its methodology more widely.)

Dennis Zietsman, group deputy chairman at Servest Group, a facilities management business, says any business school ranking designed for employers would be difficult to assess because individual students vary so much even within a single institution.

Servest takes on 300 management level recruits each year, of which fewer than ten have MBAs. The London-based company, a division of Atalian Servest, employs 52,000 people across 16 countries in Europe, the US and Africa.

Mr Zietsman says that an MBA qualification would only make a difference to an applicant if it came from a school ranked among the top 15 worldwide. And the only measure on existing ranking tables that might be of use to Servest, he says, would be the percentage of international students.

Some employers look through ranking lists seeking outliers in business education, says Andrew Crisp, co-founder of the education marketing business Carrington Crisp.  Companies are often looking for people who can manage and lead new technological change,  he says.  So it can be useful if a list shows which schools are teaching subjects such as data science. 

Bain & Company, the consultancy, takes on about 400 MBA graduates each year from as many as 60 business schools. Keith Bevans, a partner who oversees Bain s MBA hiring process globally, looks to find new entrants from specialist masters and joint degree lists, such as the MBA with a combined masters in engineering sciences launched by Harvard Business School in 2017.

These lists highlight which schools provide the specific training that Bain is interested in, such as data analytics, Mr Bevans says.  We are always interested in understanding how the profiles of the schools and expectations of their students change over time, and rankings provide a measure of this,  he adds.

One of the most discussed elements of existing business school ranking lists as they stand are the salary levels graduates obtain.

While would-be business school students like to see salary data when they are choosing a course, business schools often claim that too much focus on salary detracts from the value of the teaching and other criteria.

Some employers, however, say they find rankings useful in determining salary levels for potential hires, according to Stphane Rambosson, chief executive of executive search firm Vici Advisory.

 They look at these as ballpark figures of what they can expect to pay hires,  Mr Rambosson says.  They are not going to treat the rankings like the Bible, but they are a good guide, allowing companies to tweak their offers. 

He points out that employers are interested in attracting people from schools with the strongest brands, which is what a ranking list provides.

Mark Butter, managing director of Blueprint Recruitment Solutions, says his clients are looking for particular skills from their MBA hires, so will only be interested in candidates from schools that include training in that area on their courses.

For most employers, though, an MBA from a school with a good position in a ranking list is  a nice to have  rather than the deciding factor when considering a candidate s potential, Mr Butter adds.  Their primary driver is the candidate themselves and what they can bring to the role,  he says.

Rankings still represent an enormous opportunity to ensure students are taught the skills needed to manage in the 21st century, according to Ms Quigley.

 I was told by one school that if a ranking provider announced that teaching a particular subject would count towards their place on their list, they would add that course to their curriculum instantly,  she says.

Investors expect arguments at annual meetings as some companies tackle largesse but others don't, writes Owen Walker

Executive pay has long caused conflict between shareholders and boards but this AGM season the attention will be on overgenerous pension deals.

UK investors are irate at the difference in benefits between company bosses and ordinary workers. In some cases, FTSE 100 chief executives receive retirement benefits worth more than half of their salary while other staff in the company are lucky to get a tenth of their pay as a pension contribution.

"The UK's gold-plated executive pension arrangements have to be tackled," says Iain Richards, head of responsible investments at Columbia Threadneedle, the $430bn asset manager.

"The disparity between employer contributions and those in FTSE executive schemes are unconscionable. How do you justify annual pension payments that can be 20 times or more the total gross annual earnings of the average fulltime UK employee? "There is broad agreement that investors need to tackle the issue."

A handful of FTSE 100 bosses receive a pension benefit equal to more than half their salary, including Alistair Phillips-Davies of SSE, the electric utility, George Weston of Associated British Foods and Friedrich Joussen of Tui, the travel company.

The figures are based on last year's annual results and for the financial year ending in 2017. They were compiled by the High Pay Centre and Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.

Top of the list was Erik Engstrom, chief executive of Relx, the information and analytics company, whose pension benefit was equivalent to 66 per cent of his 1.2m salary.

The company said Mr Engstrom's pension appeared especially high because he was one of the few FTSE 100 chief executives in a defined benefit scheme   about 1,000 of the company's 30,000 staff are also members.

The Investment Association, the UK industry body, is taking a tough stance. Its view was set out in a letter sent by Andrew Ninian, director of stewardship and governance at the IA, to chairs of the remuneration committees at FTSE 350 companies. This said investors were frustrated at companies that did not align executive pay   and pension contributions   with performance.

"A stubborn minority still do not respond to shareholder concerns ... companies need to demonstrate more robustly the link between pay and company performance," Mr Ninian wrote in November's note. "If they don't, they should brace themselves for more shareholder revolts in 2019."

One reason more shareholders are objecting to lavish pension deals is a change made to the UK's corporate governance code from January 1. It says pension contribution rates for executives should be in line with those for the wider workforce.

Listed companies have to comply with the principles of the code or give reasons why they have not done so.

Companies are listening: Deloitte's annual review of FTSE 100 director pay showed that while median chief executive pension contributions were unchanged at 25 per cent in 2017-18, the upper quartile dropped from 30 to 25 per cent and the lower quartile from 20 to 16 per cent.

For companies outside the largest 30, the median pension contribution for CEOs fell from 25 to 20 per cent.

By contrast, the average FTSE 100 employer contribution to staff pensions is between 8.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent, according to Willis Towers Watson, the consultancy.

Pearson, the FTSE 100 education company, suffered a shareholder revolt against the pay award to chief executive John Fallon in 2017, two years after it sold the Financial Times.

Mr Fallon received a pension contribution equal to 40 per cent of his salary, which boosted his retirement pot by 309,000. His defined benefit scheme has since reached the maximum level for contributions so he is now in the money-purchase plan with a 26 per cent contribution rate.

While some boards are responding to shareholder criticism, others still give especially generous pensions deals to executives. They will have to be braced for showdowns at their annual meetings.

Mirza Baig, global head of governance at Aviva Investors, says shareholders will home in on egregious retirement deals. "Anything over 15 per cent is going to be fair game," he says.

"With the number of redundancies being announced and the threat of a no-deal Brexit, fairness will be one of the big themes of the AGM season. There will be less tolerance for big pay awards."

Pension entitlements should be the same across a company, according to Aviva Investors' voting policy. It acknowledges it will take time for some companies to adopt fairer arrangements but says that in the interim big differences must be disclosed and justified.

Some asset managers go further.

JPMorgan Asset Management, the $1.7tn investment business, updated its UK voting policy last month. It says executive contribution levels should mirror those of the wider workforce and that bosses should not benefit from schemes that are not open to other staff.

It adds that one-off payments into directors' pension pots and changes to their entitlement, as well as early retirement deals, should be disclosed and justified.

One argument used by shareholders to back a clampdown on largesse is that if a company has common pension rights, those who set pay policies will raise contribution rates across the board.

It is not only shareholders who seek greater fairness. "We are clear that fair pay policies are necessary to ensure good employee morale," says Caroline Escott, head of policy for investment and stewardship at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, the UK industry group.

"Significant discrepancies, including those between senior executives and the rest of the workforce can be a signifier of wider problems with a workplace's culture and processes," she adds.

Do we need a global technology regulator for financial services?

Why fintech doesn't work without a set of global regulatory standards.

This is a guest post by Axel P. Lehmann, UBS president of personal and corporate banking and president of UBS Switzerland, and Steffen Kern, chief economist and head of risk analysis at the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma). Both are also members of the WEF global future council on financial and monetary systems.

Consistent international standards are vital to underpin the efficient flow of capital to the best opportunities. Cross-border financial intermediation provides the necessary connection between borrowers and savers, which supports GDP growth.

We saw this exemplified following the financial crisis, when the international community, through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) developed an ambitious global response. A global crisis demanded a global reaction. International co-operation among regulators was central to making financial markets more resilient.

This said, the world of 2008 was very different to the one in which we are currently operating. Increasingly, inward-focused domestic policy perspectives are shaping policy agendas. Evidence of this shift in political strategy is seen in the US  doctrine of patriotism , the UK s decision to leave the European Union, and escalating trade disputes as a few examples. The belief that going it alone yields better outcomes than international co-operation continues to gain traction.

And these tendencies are deeply concerning. Our global economy is characterised by unprecedented levels of interconnectedness and these connections have benefited many citizens, investors and corporations.

The new challenge posed by technology

While certainly not a global crisis, technology is currently positioned to cause tremendous change in financial services at a global level. Distributed ledger technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other innovations have the potential to change business models and value chains across the financial industry.

A recent example of new opportunities made possible through technology is the development of digital identities (E-IDs). E-IDs are particularly significant as verifiable identities are key to the next phase of the digital financial experience. The main benefit of an E-ID will be its transportability, enabling clients to access their optimal choice of services wherever and whenever they choose in a borderless online world. Important policy advances have been made in some economies, but E-IDs will only work if there are common regulatory standards and recognition of various E-ID schemes at international level.

Aligning international regulation is not a challenge isolated to E-ID technology. Rapid technological change has the potential to usher in a new phase of financial globalisation, with benefits for investors and households in both developed and developing countries. However, making effective use of technology's potential will require a new wave of global policy co-ordination.

Why technology in financial services requires co-ordinated regulation

As new technology multiplies and becomes ubiquitous in the financial sector, new risks will need to be contained and regulatory frameworks will need to be internationally co-ordinated and upgraded.

From a risk perspective, cyber security and cyber resilience are top priorities. According to the World Economic Forum Center for Cybersecurity, economic loss due to cyber crime is predicted to reach $3tn by 2020, and 74 per cent of the world s businesses can expect to be hacked in the coming year. Digital connectivity makes cyber crime a global threat that requires a standardised approach, yet, as recognised by the FSB, regulatory and supervisory approaches to cyber security are becoming increasingly fragmented, undermining the effectiveness of financial institutions' efforts to address cyber threats.

Additionally, new products, business models and players fall out of the current remit of existing regulatory and supervisory mandates of banking and capital markets authorities. This requires reflecting on the need for adaptation of existing mandates as well as on the necessity of aiming for a single regulatory approach to technology in financial services at international level.

Unlocking the benefits of new technology

Despite the regulatory challenges, the opportunities made possible with new technology are too great to ignore. Such changes range from product design to client interaction to back office operations to compliance and reporting. And they can translate into significant benefits for consumers of financial services as well as society in general.

Mobile and internet-based services are being made available independent of physical location. Only via co-operation will global resilience be ensured and the necessary level playing field emerge, enabling higher liquidity in financial products, safer transactions, fair pricing, lower compliance costs and less complexity   all to the ultimate benefit of corporate and retail consumers of financial services.

In terms of inclusion, new technologies also have great potential for supporting access to finance in less developed regions of the world, with mobile payment platforms in Kenya or India being prime examples. Yet, the challenges from multinational payment systems in terms of investor protection, information security and system integrity will be similar around the world and they will require a cohesive response.

Global policy co-operation on emerging technology is necessary to enable better finance

Opportunities will emerge from these technological changes. And they have immense potential. Globally aligned standards, data templates, protocols, conduct-of-business and anti-fraud rules are necessary preconditions for optimal development of new technological advances to support growth and, ultimately, societal wellbeing. The conclusions of the recent G20 Summit in Buenos Aires send a reassuring message, highlighting the commitment to continued regulatory and supervisory co-operation.

WSJ Tax Guide 2019: The Housing Market; By shrinking the tax benefits of homeownership, the tax law is starting to have a big impact on the housing market

The tax-code overhaul that partially wiped out decades-old perks designed to encourage homeownership is slowly beginning to reshape the housing market and give an extra push to those considering fleeing high-tax states.

By almost doubling the standard deductions for individual and joint tax filers, the law blunts the advantage of the mortgage-interest deduction. The overhaul also capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, a blow to homeowners in high-tax states.

["https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/wsj-tax-guide-2019-83be16c8" and "https://www.wsjplus.com/offers/tax-guide-2019".]

Taken together, the changes diminish significantly the perks of homeownership built into the tax code. ZIP Codes for areas that rely most heavily on the state and local tax deduction saw home values grow nearly a percentage point more slowly in December than ZIP Codes that rely least on the deduction, according to data from Zillow provided to The Wall Street Journal. That is a shift from November 2017, before the tax overhaul passed.

Despite the changes, U.S. home prices are still growing. But they are expected to be about 4% lower in the summer of 2019 than if there had been no change to the tax code, according to Moody's Analytics. In pricier markets in states like New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania, prices could be as much as 10% lower than they otherwise might have been, Moody's said.

Trump eyes bypassing Congress to privatise Fannie and Freddie

Move considered to end 10-year government control of state-backed mortgage groups

The Trump administration is considering bypassing Congress as it looks to reform the country s two largest mortgage guarantors, according to people who have been briefed on the plans, following years of failed attempts to remove them from state control.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, is working on a set of proposals that he hopes will end the 10-year government control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which guarantee most of the mortgages in the $10tn US housing market.

Mr Mnuchin has previously said he wanted to achieve this with support from Democrats in Congress, but with Washington as divided as it has been in recent years, officials are considering what options they have to act unilaterally.

Speaking on Thursday, Mark Calabria, the administration s nominee to run the housing regulator, said he thought the administration could recapitalise the two entities without having to secure congressional support.

But he added that more meaningful reform, such as introducing new competition into the mortgage market, would need new legislation   and therefore cross-party backing.

Mr Calabria told the Senate banking committee: I do believe that the regulator can make a number of changes that can try and get the GSEs [government-sponsored enterprises] on a stable footing for the next downturn when it inevitably comes.

 But I believe that the fundamental things that need to be changed by the system have to be done by Congress. 

One person who has been consulted on the administration s thinking said:  They want bipartisan support, but they know that is going to be difficult, especially with so many Democrats running for president. But there are plenty of things they can do without Congress giving its support. 

Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have been in  conservatorship    which gives the government control of the two entities, but does not put their liabilities on the public balance sheet   since they were bailed out at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Collectively their balance sheets are worth about $5tn.

In recent years, politicians on both sides have made moves to end this state of limbo. But so far these have foundered as lawmakers argue over how to restore them to the private sector while also making sure they underwrite loans for low-income households but do not pose a risk to the taxpayer.

The Trump administration has put privatisation back on the table, however, making housing reform one of its top goals for this year.

Mr Mnuchin said this month:  Protecting American taxpayers by ensuring the safety and stability of the United States housing finance system is a priority for the Treasury department. 

If Mr Mnuchin wants to succeed where others have failed, he needs either to persuade Democrats in Congress to back his plans or to find a way to avoid congressional approval altogether.

Some believe that the Trump administration can secure Democratic support if it guarantees a set amount of money for affordable housing.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody s Analytics, said:  If you had the same affordability regime [as now] and on top of that provided extra money to subsidise an expansion of credit, there is a comfort level at which you get progressives on board. 

Most however believe that agreeing a package that is palatable to Democrats and Republicans is all but impossible, leaving Mr Mnuchin looking for solutions that do not require Congressional backing.

One option would be simply to recapitalise the two institutions and allow them to enter the private market as they are.

Since 2012, Fannie and Freddie have been required to return all their profits to the Treasury   a policy known as the  net worth sweep . Investors argue that ending this requirement would allow the two institutions to build up their capital buffers so they no longer present a risk to the taxpayer.

Tim Pagliara, executive director of a group of investors in Fannie and Freddie known as Investors Unite, said:  If they had capital requirements of 2.5-3 per cent, they would have enough money to survive the equivalent of a 500-year flood. 

Mr Pagliara points out that since 2008, the pair have returned $292bn to the Treasury in dividends   about 50 per cent more than they have drawn from the government since the crash.

Others, however, say new laws are required to make sure Fannie and Freddie continue to fulfil a public service by underwriting loans for poorer people and to make sure there is never a repeat of 2008.

Ed DeMarco, the president of the Housing Policy Council and former head of the FHFA, said:  Any administrative effort to remove Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from conservatorship without legislation falls short on a fundamental goal of housing finance reform. 

One alternative option for the administration is not to remove them from conservatorship at all, but to recapitalise them while under government control and shrink their scope.

Suchan option however, is likely to attract anger from private shareholders hoping for a return, as well as from large parts of the banking industry, which does not want to compete with two fully-capitalised government-backed entities.

Given the complexities involved, many believe this administration is no more likely to succeed in privatising Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than the host of members of Congress who have failed in the past.

Nevertheless, there remains an ideological impulse on both sides of politics to end the status quo.

Ron Haynie, who spent 20 years working for Freddie Mac and is now senior vice-president at the Independent Community Bankers of America group, said:  These two enterprises have been all but nationalised. That is something we simply don t do in this country.

Chipmaker Nvidia falls from ranks of tech darlings

Sale of stake by SoftBank s Vision Fund comes as group hit by end of cryptocurrency boom

When SoftBank s Vision Fund took a stake of about 5 per cent in chipmaker Nvidia in 2017, it looked like vindication for one of the boldest strategies in the US semiconductor industry.

Jen-hsun Huang, Nvidia s chief executive, had long argued that the company s graphics processing units, developed to handle processes such as video gaming, would play a central role in the new era of data-intensive computing.

Last month, however, the vision ran out. SoftBank revealed that its fund had dumped its entire Nvidia stake   a holding which was worth more than $7bn at its peak last October, but which had collapsed to only $3.4bn at the end of 2018.

Among the questions left by the sale is how deep SoftBank s vision runs. The giant fund has promoted itself to both investors and the companies it backs as a new type of tech investor, willing to place bigger, long-term bets on the major disruptions caused by technology. But it held the Nvidia stake for less than two years, while also hedging its stake amid last autumn s tech stock tumble to protect itself from much of the decline.

SoftBank did not respond to a question about the length of its investment, which was unusual for the Vision Fund in being in a public company. Last month, it claimed a $2.8bn profit from the holding.

For Nvidia, the sale has thrown a spotlight on a difficult transition.

Two weeks ago, the chipmaker warned that it was likely to report revenues of only $2.2bn in the three months to the end of January, the final quarter of its fiscal year. That is 30 per cent less than Wall Street had been expecting only two months before, and represents a shocking reversal: after growing by 40 per cent in the first nine months of its fiscal year, the change implies that revenues slumped by a quarter in the final three months.

The recent hit to highly valued tech stocks   along with the company s own revenue slump   wiped 57 per cent, or $100bn, off Nvidia s stock market value in the final quarter of last year before a bounce that erased a fifth of the losses. The question now is whether the pain is over   and whether Nvidia s long-term prospects are still intact after the massive  reset  in its business.

Mr Huang is due to discuss Nvidia s prospects on a call with analysts on Thursday.

The immediate cause of Nvidia s pain can be traced to the collapse in the cryptocurrency market, where equipment based on its GPUs is used by  miners  to handle the intensive calculations required to authenticate transactions.

This dependence, which first led to a warning from Nvidia last November, has turned out to be greater than many investors expected. Some 25 per cent of the company s sales were probably tied to demand from the cryptocurrency markets, said Ambrish Srivastava, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in San Francisco.

The end of the bitcoin boom has had other knock-on effects. While GPUs were in short supply, companies building machines for gamers submitted orders to Nvidia for far more chips than they needed, said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy in Austin.

That contributed to a spike in pricing across the GPU market last year: AMD, one of the major producers, reported that its average selling prices in its computing and graphics business had jumped by 55 per cent in the first half of last year, with much of that down to GPUs. With excess inventory likely to take another quarter or two to clear, according to Mr Moorhead, those forces have gone into reverse.

Underlying conditions in the gaming market have made the sudden slump more intense. China s limits on licensing new video games last year was seen as a major blow to demand. At the same time, Nvidia has reported slow take-up from gamers for its latest advance: chips that use so-called  ray tracing  technology, a way of simulating the effect of light hitting virtual objects that is credited with creating far more realistic images.

The question is whether this is anything more than a temporary blip. History suggests that gamers will quickly take to chips with ray tracing once developers produce more games that take advantage of it, said Mr Moorhead. Even if demand from the cryptocurrency market does not return, that would still bring renewed growth in Nvidia s main market.

The company warned last month, however, that it is facing a new headwind: weaker demand from data centre customers, who represent one of its biggest hopes for long-term growth.

Thanks to their ability to handle large amounts of data, GPUs have been added on as accelerators in machine learning systems. The AI boom has made GPUs a key component in the data centres of cloud computing companies, though a recent slowdown after a capital spending boom has brought a pause in spending. However, Mr Moorhead estimates that only around 5 per cent of data centre servers have AI accelerators, leaving a large market up for grabs.

Nvidia once had this market to itself. But there has been a race to develop new chip architectures to handle  inference    the task of applying machine learning algorithms to new data sets, the largest part of the new AI demand for silicon. Google has already developed its own specialised chips for machine learning, called TPUs, while Facebook and Amazon are both working on developing chips.

At the same time, other AI chips will soon become available. Intel, for instance, plans to launch a specialised chip for AI inferencing later this year, based on its CPUs. Start-ups like British company Graphcore represent another new source of competition.

The overall effect, said Mr Srivastava, is that Nvidia is facing far greater competition and will no longer have the AI market largely to itself. The stock price needs to fall further to reflect the new realities it is facing, he added.

But Mr Huang s assurances that his company s long-term prospects are undimmed   whatever the short-term troubles   still resonate with many.  It s a growing market, and Nvidia has room to grow,  said Mr Moorhead.  Yes, there will be more competition   but the market is going to be so much bigger.

Good day. Johnson & Johnson's $3.4 billion cash deal to buy Auris Health Inc., the largest acquisition of a venture-backed medical-device company, could have far-reaching effects across the industry.

Auris's Monarch system is designed to help surgeons gain access to hard-to-reach nodules in the lungs while maintaining constant vision and control, according to the company, which raised more than $700 million from Lux Capital, Highland Capital Partners, Section 32, Mithril Capital and several other investors.

Peter Hbert, a Lux managing partner, said Auris's success could draw more talented engineers into medtech and spur corporations to be more ambitious with medical-device product development and acquisitions.

Added Mr. Hbert: "I wouldn't be surprised if you saw boards at large medical-device companies [reassessing] their strategy and whether they're playing it too safe, and whether they have innovation on their road map."

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Inside the box: Venture capitalists' affection for subscription-based e-commerce startups like Birchbox Inc. waned the past couple of years, but FabFitFun Inc. has emerged as a bright spot in the category.

Los Angeles-based FabFitFun, which sends subscribers a monthly box of wellness and beauty products, held a recent funding that valued the company at more than $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The round was led by growth-stage firm Bond, one of its first since the team broke away from Kleiner Perkins last fall.

FabFitFun's latest funding was a large sum for a Series A round, but the company was founded in 2010 and has fueled growth on its own sales.

The company, which previously raised just $6.5 million in venture capital, has positive cash flow on revenue of more than $300 million, the person said. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the scoop.

Mega Mithril return: Auris Health's aforementioned pending sale to Johnson & Johnson for $3.4 billion is a victory for investors in the medical-robotics startup none more than Mithril Capital Management.

The growth-investment firm co-founded by Ajay Royan and Peter Thiel is Auris's largest investor, holding a stake of about 15%, according to a person familiar with the situation.

The deal is slated to return about $510 million in cash to Mithril, as well as more in potential future payouts. That would represent almost as much as Mithril's entire first fund, which closed with $540 million in 2013.

Auris raised more than $700 million in venture funding from Mithril, Lux Capital, Wellington Management and several others. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley and Yuliya Chernova have the scoop.

Mack's Take: Labs Take Aim at Powering Synthetic-Biology Startups

By Heather Mack

It takes trial and error on a vast scale to create bioengineered versions of things like meat, leather and even cannabis.

The excitement over the promise of synthetic biology has drawn considerable investor attention in recent years. A new generation of scientists is using high-powered tools like artificial intelligence and DNA sequencing to produce microorganisms on an industrial scale.

Culture Biosciences Inc., which was unveiled this week, could emerge as another leader in the sector. The startup in South San Francisco, Calif., is backed by $5.5 million from top venture-capital names like Verily, DCVC and Bill Maris's Science 32, and it already has landed clients including agtech startup Pivot Bio Inc. and synthetic collagen maker Geltor Inc.

Culture aims to set itself apart by offering a system that combines proprietary software with custom-built "bioreactors" think of the machinery used to brew beer to automate the fermentation stage of hard-to-scale realms like plant-based meat and textiles.

"Fermentation is a key process in the scale of those products, but it's also where a lot of the bottleneck happens," said Culture co-founder and Chief Executive William Patrick "These are situations where companies are constantly tweaking the experiments, so if you have a way to automate that, it saves a lot of time and money."

Mortgage Slowdown Sparks A Boom in Servicing Rights

By Ben Eisen

The mortgage-market slowdown is stirring up interest in a humdrum segment of American home lending: the rights to the arcane task of handling monthly payments.

Sales of mortgage-servicing rights jumped 14% in 2018 from a year earlier, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance, to more than $600 billion of loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. In the final three months of 2018, the servicing changed hands on loans worth $183 billion, up 27% from the previous year.

Mortgage servicers, in addition to collecting a borrower's installment and passing it on to the loan owner, take care of duties like ensuring taxes and insurance are paid. If the borrower defaults, the servicer is the first to jump into action. The company that services a mortgage used to be the same as the one that made the original loan, but in recent decades those two crucial housing-market functions have separated.

The increase in servicing transfers is the latest ripple effect from a slowdown in the housing market, which has forced lenders to slim down, consolidate or close.

Many of the sellers are independent mortgage lenders that don't have deposits to fund themselves or other lines of business that can help them withstand a downturn. Stronger players -- both banks and nonbanks -- have been picking up servicing rights from weaker lenders that need to raise cash.

The industry shakeout stems from a sharp decline in refinancing activity as rates have risen and a drop-off in new purchases.

"The name of the game when you're in lean periods of origination and you're not a bank is that you need sources of cash," said Eric Schuppenhauer, president of home mortgages at Citizens Financial Group Inc. "You're just trying to make it to the next good origination period."

Some buyers see servicing rights as a new source of revenue in the more challenging market and a chance to pitch additional services. Citizens bought Franklin American Mortgage Co. last year, more than doubling the number of households whose loans the Providence, R.I.-based bank services.

The lender's mortgage-banking fees, trending lower before the acquisition, jumped in the final half of last year. Servicing revenue made up 41% of all mortgage-banking fees last quarter, up from 21% in the year-earlier period.

New Residential Investment Corp., a real-estate investment trust managed by private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC, said in its Tuesday earnings report that it snapped up servicing rights on $114 billion in loans from 15 different business partners last year.

New Residential's stock is up 20% this year, more than double the S&P 500's rise.

"We do expect more consolidation in the mortgage-origination and servicing business throughout the course of 2019, and we believe that we're perfectly situated to take advantage of that," Chief Executive Michael Nierenberg said on an earnings call Tuesday. "Mortgage bankers are going to need to raise some capital, therefore, there'll be more assets for sale."

Ditech Holding Corp., which filed for bankruptcy this week, could sell its servicing rights, analysts say. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. estimated Ditech has servicing rights on $104 billion of loans that it could sell.

Mortgage servicers came under fire during the financial crisis for the way they treated homeowners who were facing foreclosure. One firm, Ocwen Financial Corp., later settled with multiple regulators to resolve allegations of mistreating borrowers.

These days, homeowner delinquency rates are low. A number of regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, now oversee mortgage servicers.

Lenders don't need a borrower's consent to sell a loan or servicing right, and the terms of the loan don't change when they are transferred.

The risk for homeowners is that they end up with a servicer they don't like or trust -- and didn't sign up to work with when they took out the loan.

When Andrew Smith took out a mortgage last winter to buy a house in Queens, N.Y., he went to FM Home Loans LLC. At the closing, he found out that his servicer would be Citigroup Inc. Last fall, he found out that the servicer would now be Cenlar FSB.

Mr. Smith, who works as a camera assistant in the entertainment industry, said that he was surprised by the multiple switches.

"It was a little unnerving," he said. "It happened twice in the first year of the loan." He said he doesn't particularly like the website of his newest servicer but was reassured by a knowledgeable customer-service representative he spoke with on the phone.

Servicing rights generally become more valuable as interest rates rise because borrowers are less likely to refinance their loans and the stream of income from servicing continues for longer.

Prices on servicing rights for mortgages backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie rose by 7% to 9% on average last year, though it varied widely based on the initial mortgage rate, according to data from MountainView Financial Solutions, which advises on servicing transactions and provides analytics.

Nonetheless, these assets can be volatile. Wells Fargo & Co., the country's biggest mortgage lender, reduced the value of its mortgage-servicing rights in the final three months of 2018, the company said in its earnings report.

What's more, banks may have less incentive to hold on to servicing rights because pending rules could force them to hold more capital as a result. The Mortgage Bankers Association, which lobbies on behalf of the industry, pushed back on these rules late last year and has said they are forcing banks out of the market.

Cyber Daily: Bumpy Road to NotPetya Insurance Payouts; Espionage in Iran

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. Is physical damage caused by cyber incidents covered by property insurance? Is data property? Who determines when a cyberattack is an act of war? And how?

In lawsuits against their insurance firms, pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co. and snackmaker Mondelez International Inc. seek to get these questions answered. The companies were denied claims for damages, expenses and losses related to the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack. The firms argue that their property policies cover physical damage, including loss of data, software and code, WSJ Pro's Catherine Stupp reports. One crucial unknown that the cases could clarify is whether NotPetya was an act of war, and what evidence is required to designate it as such.

Elsewhere, WSJ reports on the former U.S. Air Force special agent who federal prosecutors now say is a spy for Iran, in an indictment unsealed Wednesday. Monica Elfriede Witt hasn't been arrested and is believed to be in Iran.

NotPetya Insurance Disputes Debate Cyber Acts of War and Whether Data is Property

By Catherine Stupp

Two lawsuits related to the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack reveal disputes about when insurance companies should pay for large-scale hacks that disrupt business operations.

Merck & Co. and Mondelez International Inc. are suing their insurers after they refused to pay claims for losses from the incident, citing exclusions in property insurance policies for acts of war or hostile acts by government agents. Industry analysts say the insurance companies carry the burden of proof to show that NotPetya was a government-sponsored act of war.

Also at issue is the more general question of whether physical damage triggered by a cybersecurity mishap is covered under traditional property insurance.

Losses globally from NotPetya will cost the insurance industry around $3.3 billion, according to research from Verisk Analytics Inc.'s risk assessment firm Property Claim Services.

Merck's expenses and lost sales related to NotPetya are about $700 million, according to its financial filings. The company is suing multiple insurance and reinsurance companies, including Zurich Insurance Group.

Mondelez is also suing Zurich Insurance, claiming $100 million in costs related to NotPetya.

Merck and Mondelez did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Zurich Insurance declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

The U.S. and U.K. governments in February 2018 blamed Russia for the cyberattack, but have not announced charges against individual hackers or publicly discussed details to prove their allegation.

"The attribution issue will be really, really difficult for Zurich here and the other insurers that are involved," said Judy Selby, a consultant who advises companies on cyber insurance.

Is data physical property?

Insurers dispute whether data can be considered a physical asset and therefore fall under property policy coverage, according to Scott Stransky, director of emerging risk modeling at Verisk's data analytics firm AIR Worldwide.

"On a property policy, if you want to collect business interruption, there needs to be some physical damage. In this case, the data loss was that trigger [of damage]," Mr. Stransky said.

At Mondelez, for example, NotPetya broke 1,700 servers and 24,000 laptops, according to the snack company's court filing.

Last October, Mondelez sued Zurich Insurance, asking the insurer to pay $100 million to cover property damage, distribution disruption and other costs from the cyberattack. Zurich denied Mondelez's claim, citing the policy's exclusion for "hostile or warlike action," according to the complaint. Zurich later agreed to pay the claim, Mondelez said, but then changed its position several months later, again denying the claim.

Merck filed its lawsuit last August, demanding that 15 insurance companies and seven reinsurers cover damages from the attack. In denying Merck's claim, the insurers cited a coverage exclusion for acts of war in the company's property policies. Merck contends that the policies cover destruction of computer data, code, programs and software.

The lawsuit doesn't say how much Merck seeks but notes that the company's costs and losses exceed its deductibles. Merck said it has received payments of an unspecified amount for NotPetya damages from insurers through separate privacy and network liability policies.

Limiting payouts

Some insurance companies have begun to limit coverage of cyber incidents in property and other policies, according to Jim Lynch, chief actuary at the trade group Insurance Information Institute Inc.

Insurance companies can quantify risks related to traditional property threats, such as fire or fraud, he said, but cyberattacks and their after-effects are more unpredictable.

Zurich Insurance took a step this week towards clarifying its view of which policies cover what. Cyber policies cover damages that other kinds of policies don't, Lori Bailey, Zurich Insurance, global head of cyber risk, wrote in a blog post.

"Property policies typically either exclude or offer only very limited coverage for the loss of or corruption of electronic data," she said. "Cyber policies are specifically designed to fill many of the cyber coverage gaps in other types of insurance."

Quotable

U.S. Accuses Former Intelligence Officer of Giving Secrets to Iran

A federal indictment says former U.S. Air Force special agent Monica Elfriede Witt disclosed information that helped the Iranian government target her former colleagues. The indictment, unsealed Wednesday, accused Ms. Witt of providing Tehran with highly classified information about American intelligence operations overseas after she defected to Iran, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The background: Ms. Witt traveled to Iran in 2013 and after telling a friend she might follow the example of NSA leaker Edward Snowden went on to disclose secret information in an attempt to undermine U.S. intelligence operations, according the indictment. She served as a counterintelligence officer and had access to top-secret information during her time in the Air Force from 1997 until 2008, the indictment said.

Four Iranians also charged: The Iranians are accused of conducting a hacking campaign for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in 2014 and 2015 to try to obtain access to the computer networks of Ms. Witt's onetime U.S. intelligence colleagues, the indictment said. The document didn't specify how much, if any, access they obtained.

Not arrested: All five are believed to be in Iran and aren't in U.S. custody. Ms. Witt and the other defendants couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Nvidia Earnings: What to Watch; Chip maker tries to shake off cryptocurrency, videogame funk

Nvidia Corp. is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. The results come a little more than two weeks after the chip maker slashed its revenue forecast, citing slowdowns on multiple business fronts. Here's what to expect:

EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected Nvidia to report earnings of 75 cents a share as of Wednesday. A year ago, the company reported $1.12 billion in net income.

REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected revenue of $2.2 billion, on par with Nvidia's revised outlook. That would be down from $2.91 billion a year earlier.

What to Watch

CRYPTOCURRENCY WOES: Nvidia benefited handsomely when a boom in mining digital currencies led to surging demand for graphics-processing chips well suited to the task. When cryptocurrencies cratered in 2018, however, that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-grapples-with-fallout-from-cryptocurrency-miners-1542395327". Analysts warned in November that inventory problems could persist, and they will be looking for signs of whether the hangover is over. Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, appeared optimistic that Nvidia's plans to sell down inventory were going according to management's schedule. "We do not see deep-discounting at retailers, suggesting a controlled inventory burn," he wrote.

GAMING TRACTION: Weaker-than-expected sales of high-end graphics chips used by PC gamers were one of the reasons Nvidia revised its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-lowers-guidance-on-weakness-in-gaming-datacenter-businesses-11548690812" to $2.2 billion in January, slashing $500 million from its earlier projection. Thursday's results and the guidance Nvidia issues for the current quarter should yield clues about how well its newest generation of graphics processors released last fall are selling. The chips include new technologies such as ray tracing, but Nvidia said in January some customers may be putting off purchases, waiting for prices to go down and for new features to be used in more games. "We don't think that the January quarter was a 'kitchen sink' quarter that will drive a V-shaped recovery, but we do see the temporary factors gradually abating," analysts at Morgan Stanley said.

CLOUD OUTLOOK: Nvidia has a strong presence in data centers, and its chips are used widely in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. But customers are becoming more cautious as the global economic outlook cools, which the company in January said led to a number of deals not closing in the fourth quarter. Intel Corp., too, recently "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-projects-slower-revenue-growth-this-year-11548365723" for server chips. Moreover, with a data-center business that has grown quickly, booking eye-popping growth rates has become all the more difficult, wrote Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Headline risk is likely to keep increasing, he said. "And tactically the near-term cloud spending environment is unfavorable, driving near-term downside." Analysts foresee $671 million of revenue from the data-center business, down about 15% from the previous quarter.

Etienne Amic, once a managing director at JPMorgan, will lead the digital group

A blockchain oil platform launched late last year to modernise physical commodities trading has hired a former JPMorgan Chase energy trader as its chief executive.

Vakt, the platform backed by leading oil companies such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell, traders Mercuria and Gunvor, and banks such as ING and ABN Amro, has appointed Etienne Amic, a former managing director at Mercuria and JPMorgan, to lead the company.

Using blockchain technology, Vakt was set up in November as a way of speeding up trades and reducing costs by eliminating the paper-based trading process. The underlying platform provides security and an audit trail that cannot be altered.

Vakt s original investors and first users of the platform include energy majors BP, Equinor and Shell; independent traders Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading, and Mercuria; and banks ABN Amro, ING and Socit Gnrale. These have since been joined by Chevron, Total and Reliance Industries.

Mr Amic is co-founder and chairman of Vortexa, a cargo and analytics company focused on global crude oil and refined products markets, and founded CommodiTech Ventures, a group funding the next generation of commodities technology.

As well as the buyers and sellers of the raw material, the trading of physical oil involves terminal or pipeline operators, acting as de facto physical clearinghouses, and service providers such as port agents and inspection companies helping the material to move along and checking its physical characteristics.

Mr Amic said  the goal of Vakt is to facilitate all these contributions seamlessly and  on platform  .

He added that to have leading oil companies and banks, many of them competitors, pulling in the same direction indicated that Vakt was  something very powerful that the industry really needs .

White House Names Top Executives to Workforce Advisory Board; Leaders of Apple, Home Depot, IBM and Visa are among those chosen for the panel

The Trump administration named prominent business executives to its newly formed workforce-policy advisory board Wednesday, including the leaders of Apple Inc., Home Depot Inc., International Business Machines Corp. and Visa Inc., as well as education and labor officials.

The advisory board is headed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Ivanka Trump, President Trump's daughter and a top White House adviser, and will focus on worker training and matching workers to job opportunities, amid concerns about automation, artificial intelligence and rapidly changing workplace demands.

"We want all Americans to have the skills and opportunities to secure good paying jobs and successfully navigate technological disruptions and the rapidly changing nature of work," said Ms. Trump.

The panel is being formed amid a strong job market. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/job-openings-push-further-into-record-territory-at-end-of-2018-11549985771" in the U.S. rose in December to the highest level since 2000, and data for January showed robust hiring.

The 25-member advisory board was established by an executive order Mr. Trump signed in July. That order created the National Council for the American Worker, a group of senior administration officials focused on developing a nationwide strategy for training employees, as well as the advisory board.

At the time, the president announced pledges from companies to hire or train millions of workers over the next five years.

The Trump administration sought to partner early on with corporate leaders and developed several advisory councils but they collapsed in part over Mr. Trump's controversial response to a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. Mr. Trump worked to rebuild relations, however, and corporate executives have rallied around the common cause of training workers for future job needs.

"Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence will change the way every job is done. I look forward to finding new ways for all Americans to participate in this digital era by building the job skills that are already in demand in our economy," IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said in a statement.

Lockheed Martin Chairman and CEO Marillyn Hewson, another member of the advisory board, said that as the company looks to employ new technologies, "our workforce must be ready for what lies ahead."

According to a list provided by the Commerce Department, the members of the board include:

Jay Box, president, Kentucky Community and Technical College System

Walter Bumphus, president and CEO, American Association of Community Colleges

Jim Clark, president and CEO, Boys & Girls Clubs of America

Tim Cook, CEO, Apple

Tom Donohue, CEO, U.S. Chamber of Commerce

Business News: Need for Tech Upgrade Helps Drive Bank Deal

Behind one of the biggest bank deals in a decade is a recognition that BB&T Corp. and SunTrust Banks Inc., both dominant banks in the South, would be more competitive with a bigger tech budget.

The all-stock, $28.2 billion deal is expected to help the rivals close a widening digital gap that is fueling one of the biggest threats to their business: losing relevance among younger customers.

The deal, which would create the sixth-largest regional bank and a financial powerhouse in the South, underscores the urgency facing regional banks to invest heavily in client-facing and back-end technology to continue attracting consumer and corporate customers.

"What's the largest strategic risk facing the banking industry? It's technology," said Todd Baker, a senior fellow at the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business, Law and Public Policy at Columbia University. "How are they going to be more nimble and effective?"

The transaction will allow the former rivals to develop better technology together than they could on their own. They plan to reinvest $1.6 billion in projected cost savings from the merger into technology and innovation.

The companies also plan to create an innovation and technology center at the merged entity's new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to drive digital transformation, including the adoption of automation and an improved customer experience online.

"This is the early innings of an enormous transformation of all of financial services," Mr. Baker said.

In recent years, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have invested heavily in developing consumer-facing technology such as artificial intelligence-powered chatbots and digital investing apps.

Good day. Unionization inside upstart media companies has rapidly become a thing.

The latest drive to form a bargaining unit has hit the newsroom at BuzzFeed News, whose parent company is backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Founder Collective and SoftBank Group.

Although the union movement of news employees at BuzzFeed began before the company's recent wave of editorial layoffs, it has followed on the heels of similar organizing at digital-native places like Vox Media and Vice News. Workers also have been fighting for protections across the broader startup landscape, from minimum-wage campaigns for ride-hailing contractors to the independent "shoppers" at gig platforms like Instacart.

The message for investors is that being a disruptive startup doesn't forever insulate owners' ability to have free rein with the means of production.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Crypto sleuthing's heavy hitters: Accel and Benchmark are making a big blockchain bet: They have invested $30 million in Chainalysis Inc., a provider of real-time compliance and anti-money-laundering software for financial institutions working with cryptocurrencies.

The Series B round was led by Accel but included an investment from Benchmark, which led the startup's Series A round last April.

Chainalysis says it aims to build confidence in the crypto industry, which is still working to prove that it can be a safe and reliable system for sending currency and completing transactions.

Despite a prolonged downturn in crypto prices, investors have shown continued interest in investing in startups that provide infrastructure and tools to improve the use of crypto currencies. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has the story.

Gene therapy advances: The use of healthy genes to compensate for defective ones is gaining momentum for biotech startups seeking to tackle a broader range of medical problems.

One key development was the U.S. regulatory approval in 2017 of Spark Therapeutics Inc.'s Luxturna, a gene therapy to treat an inherited disease leading to blindness.

Riding on that momentum, Neurogene Inc. has set out to show that gene therapy can treat rare neurological illnesses such as AGU, a disease causing a progressive decline in mental functioning.

New York-based Neurogene, founded just over a year ago, said it has raised a $68.5 million Series A funding, as it works to develop gene therapy for AGU and a series of rare neurological diseases. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has the story.

Chernova's Take: Why Betaworks Is No Longer a Venture Studio

By Yuliya Chernova

Venture studios are getting launched left and right, with the likes of Techstars getting into the game this year. But one of the originals, Betaworks, has largely abandoned that business model.

John Borthwick created Betaworks in 2008. New York-based Betaworks incubated several social-media startups including Giphy, Dots and TweetDeck. (In a nod to some of the negative consequences of social technology, the sticker on the back of Mr. Borthwick's iPhone reads, "Social media seriously harms your mental health.")

A few years ago, Betaworks was developing some eight startups at a time in-house.

The business has since evolved. Betaworks has a venture fund, an accelerator and a membership space called Betaworks Studios, not to be confused with its original startup factory. But Betaworks isn't developing new startups the way it used to.

"I don't think it makes sense to build a new studio in New York," Mr. Borthwick said, adding that the model might be better suited for cities where technology is an emerging industry.

Nowadays there are many more places for budding founders to get money and build on their own without sacrificing a big part of the equity pie and independence that startup studios can eat up. It also has become more expensive to create new startups especially in the consumer space where Betaworks specializes.

Says Mr. Borthwick: "All the beachfront real estate has been built out for the end user."

Good day. Cory Johnson, the journalist-turned-chief market strategist, is out at Ripple.

Mr. Johnson, a former on-air personality at Bloomberg News and CNBC, is no longer with the blockchain-based global payments company. His position was eliminated because of "changes in market conditions," Ripple said in a statement.

Mr. Johnson, who joined Ripple last March, wasn't immediately available to comment. The value of Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is trading this week at about one-third of its value since he arrived at the company. Now, that is indeed a change in market conditions.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Delivery wars: Food-delivery startup DoorDash Inc. is arming itself with new funding as two of its rivals prepare for IPOs.

The venture-backed company is in the process of raising roughly $500 million at a valuation of more than $6 billion, and that might approach $7 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation.

That valuation range would be four to five times what DoorDash was valued at in a financing round less than a year ago.

Singapore's Temasek Holdings is expected to lead the round, the person said. GIC, another Singaporean state entity, is already a DoorDash investor.

DoorDash didn't respond to requests for comment. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the scoop.

Grocery goals: SoftBank Group is investing almost $1 billion in robotic-delivery-vehicle startup Nuro Inc., a hefty injection of capital that could help accelerate the race to put driverless vehicles on the road. Nuro raised $940 million from SoftBank's tech-focused Vision Fund, the startup said. Founded in 2016, Nuro is now valued by investors at $2.7 billion. The WSJ's Tim Higgins has the story.

Energy deal: In a rare venture-capital funding for a renewable-energy startup, geothermal startup Dandelion Energy Inc. raised $16 million.

GV, funded by Alphabet Inc., co-led the Series A for the startup, which is a spinout from Alphabet's X Lab. Comcast Ventures was the other co-lead. Returning investors included New Enterprise Associates, Collaborative Fund and Zhenfund.

Led by Kathy Hannun, Dandelion Energy says it has designed a more efficient heat pump and other processes to reduce the cost of residential geothermal installations.

Homebuilder Lennar Corp. also invested. The company had explored other attempts at geothermal heating and cooling for homes but they were prohibitively expensive, said Eric Feder, managing general partner for Lennar Ventures.

Roof's Take: Spotify's Podcast Shopping Could Kick Off More Deals

By Katie Roof

Spotify Technology SA may have some competition the next time it goes shopping for podcasting-related assets.

Anchor FM Inc., a platform for making and distributing podcasts, was acquired by Spotify last week for more than $150 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Spotify also snatched up Gimlet Media Inc., the content-making platform behind hit podcasts like "The Pitch" and "Reply All."

Spotify has said it plans to spend up to $500 million on podcast deals this year.

"It's going to be a very exciting year for podcasting," said Rich Greenfield, an equity research analyst at BTIG Research. "More and more of these earlier-stage startups are going to get acquired."

He said that in addition to Spotify, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are candidates to make acquisitions to complement their existing music and smart-speaker businesses.

Dave Zohrob, co-founder of Chartable Inc., a podcast analytics startup, predicted that Netflix Inc. will make purchases in the space, since audio competes with video for entertainment.

Other related startups he believes could potentially get picked up include hosting platform ART19 Inc., which has received backing from DCM and Array Ventures, as well as podcast publisher Wondery Inc., which has been funded by Greycroft Partners and Lerer Hippeau.

Patrolling the high seas with fintech

Your essential weekly fintech briefing

Late last month a huge explosion, possibly caused by a fuel transfer, engulfed two cargo ships in the Kerch Straits near Russia, killing at least 11 sailors.

It's the kind of incident that marine insurers dread. ButWindward, a Tel Aviv-based tech company, says that the warning signs were there.

The company s analytics showed the tankers involved were in the top 2 per cent of the world s riskiest vessels for smuggling. Both had been involved in ship-to-ship transfer activity and had spent a suspiciously large proportion of their time outside ports. They also turned off their AIS transponders, which broadcast their location details, far more regularly than other ships.

Windward is one of a clutch of companies hoping to apply new technology to improve the performance of marine insurers.

It's a tall order. Marine insurance is a centuries-old business   Lloyd s of London was founded as a marine market   and has a reputation for being particularly resistant to change.

But it has also been a very tough business over the past few years, with profits under pressure as prices have fallen, forcing marine insurers to look to technology for answers. Chris Sandilands, partner at consultancy Oxbow, said:  It s an area where we are seeing a lot of activity. It doesn t follow that just because a part of the industry has been around a long time, there won t be any innovation. 

 The industry does not get to choose where innovation happens. Entrepreneurs do,  he added.

One of those entrepreneurs is Ami Daniel, co-founder and CEO of Windward.

Mr Daniel, a former officer in the Israeli Navy, says life in the marines and life in marine insurance both demand a  certain type of person  since the culture is  to do things bit by bit, slowly .

Nevertheless, he reports growing interest in what his company is offering. Windward creates profiles of individual ships that tell their owners and insurers how they're operated, where they go, whether they sail in deep or shallow waters and how well maintained they are. All crucial information for people deciding how much it'd cost to insure them.

He s had some big name backing. Former CIA director David Petraeus has put money in. So have John Browne and Tom Glocer, the former CEOs of BP and Thomson Reuters, along with current Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.

More crucially, last year insurer Axa XL led a $16.5m funding round. Insurers in the industry like to move together, so an investment from Axa XL could encourage others to adopt similar technology.

Windward isn't the only tech company to have spotted an opportunity in marine insurance. UK-based Clearwater has signed a deal with DNK, a Norwegian mutual insurer that specialises in war risk for ships and covers about $224bn in assets.

Clearwater is installing specialist equipment on the 2,700 vessels covered by DNK that transmits details of their location every 7.5 minutes. If the ship enters an area where there's a high risk of war, DNK is alerted and can adjust the premium to take the higher risk into account.

Will Unwin, Clearwater s chief executive, said that his company s equipment can deliver more accurate tracking data than is available elsewhere.  DNK are accumulating data points based on true 7.5 minute reporting 	. 	. 	. 	The consistency of the data are crucial. 

The two companies have taken their partnership one stage further by setting up a joint venture called Osprey Analytics to help push the system out to other insurance companies.

There's still a long way to go before these sorts of systems are widely adopted in marine insurance. But an executive at one leading insurer says that eventually, the whole market will have to move.

 There is a lot of pressure in the marine market, and something needs to change,  he said.  Pressure is building and building. At some point something is going to shift and there could be an earthquake. 

One to watch: Pagaya

Using artificial intelligence to build portfolios of securities is a well-established practice; using AI to build the securities themselves is more of a frontier affair,writes Robert Armstrong.

Israeli fintech Pagaya, which specialises in using machine learning and big data to manage money,last week announced the issue of its first asset-backed securities (ABS) made up of consumer loans selected entirely by a computer and managed by an AI. The $100m offering was led by investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald.

The algorithm picks the loans by drawing individual borrowers' data from credit bureaus, publicly available information about past securitisations taken from the official sources such as the FDIC, as well as macroeconomic data.

Gal Krubiner, Pagaya s chief executive, says a well-designed computer model using a rich data set is  just better  at judging credit quality than a human team:  The algorithm is very good in terms of assessing the willingness of borrowers to pay. 

During the construction of the ABS, over a period of several months, the algorithms  are trying to find trends [in loan performance] rather than factors , according to Mr Krubiner. The computer is observing  the inter-connectivity between the different parameters   it is a dynamic allocation of the importance of the different factors  such as borrower, geography, credit events, and so on.

Pagaya, which now has $450m under management across its portfolio, hopes to issue as much as $2bn in consumer loan ABS in the next few years.

The loans themselves come from online lending platforms such as Lending Club, Prosper and Upgrade   and indeed, it's the appearance of those platforms in recent years that made Pagaya s business possible.  This is short duration, good quality consumer credit,  says Mr Krubiner. The average borrower FICO score is a solid 700, he says, and the average loan is for about $10,000, has an average life of a year and a half, and an annual interest rate in the mid-teens.

Number of the week: $440m

The amount SoftBank's Vision Fund has invested in British banking start-up OakNorth, making it the largest European fintech fundraising

Further fintech fascination

Stumbling blocks:Revolut, the payments unicorn best known for offering rock bottom foreign exchange rates, is being investigated by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority over a  spoof  ad campaign that drew ire from London commuters.  To the 12,750 people who ordered a single takeaway on Valentine's Day, You OK, hun?  Revolut asked on billboards across the London Underground, in a campaign reminiscent of Spotify and Netflix's controversial use of customer data to create witty ads a few years back. UK commuters weren't amused; especially when the FT's personal finance editor Claer Barrett embarrassed the payments app into admitting the figures in the Valentine's ad   and another iteration about the numbers buying Greggs vegan sausage rolls   were  just made up . In a financial services world where trust is paramount, few fintechs would want to be in Revolut's shoes right now 	. 	. 	.

Crypto chronicles:Spare a thought for the 92,000 or so crypto enthusiasts whose $150m of coin held with crypto exchange QuadrigaCX seems to have gone to the grave with Quadriga's founder. The Canadian exchange announced the death of 30-year-old Gerry Cotton last week, and said he was the only one who held the access codes to the $150m of coin Quadriga was holding on behalf of clients. Conspiracy theories abound. The Canadian regulator says it'spowerless, since it doesn't regulate Quadriga. The Canadian courts have sent in EY as a monitor to Quadriga's workout. Meanwhile, the victims, including a Californiasoftware engineer who lost his life savings, are left dangling. Still, the affair seems to have little dented the overall crypto market; bitcoin is up about 5 per cent, to around $3,600, in the six days since the debacle became public.

Trend watch:All good things come to those who wait, or at least that's the hope among those wishing to trade on Switzerland's new blockchain-enhanced exchange. The SIX exchange originally hoped to launch the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) in the summer, but is now eyeing a date in the second half of the year, chairman Romeo Lachertold Reuters last week. The SDX hopes to used distributed ledger technology to complete transactions in  fractions of seconds , a big advancement on SIX (and other traditional exchanges), where trades can take several days to clear. Blockchain is already used in other exchanges, including theGibraltar Blockchain Exchange, but these only trade crypto-based assets   the SDX believes it's in the lead to use blockchain for an exchange that trades traditional assets.

AOB:German fintech Raisin   which helps customers maximise their deposit interest   raised $114m from a flurry of big names including Index Ventures and PayPal *** Singapore police raided the offices of German fintech Wirecard after an internal probe revealed forged documents and accounting irregularities. Here's the FT's deep dive into the scandal *** The biggest risk to quant funds is  that we lose confidence and row back , Andrew Dyson, who leads the quant unit of Prudential Financial's funds arm, told the FT. *** Around 100 fintechs have applied for licences in Lithuania, including many which are looking for a new EU home after Brexit, Lithuanian central bank official Marius Jurgilastold Reuters.

Inside View: It's Time to Fire Your Doctor

By Andy Kessler

Barack Obama famously and falsely said, "If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period." But . . . what if you don't like your doctor?

Let's say you, like me, are one of the 20 million Americans who work for themselves -- no boss, but also no corporate-tax deduction for health insurance. The smart move is to get a high-deductible insurance plan. Now it suddenly matters what doctors charge: $500 to take your blood pressure and bang your knee with a rubber hammer, $1,200 for a blood test that uses pennies worth of chemicals to tell you your hemoglobin levels are fine. Plus four months to get an appointment, and then the doctor asks you to fax an authorization. What? It's 2019. It's time to fire your doctor.

Like roughly half of American adults, I'm borderline: hypertensive, high cholesterol, though only "pre"-diabetic. A streak of misdiagnoses has led me and many others to take doctoring into our own hands. I do an annual blood test for $199 through WellnessFX and get results on a smartphone app. A Bluetooth-connected cuff from Omron Healthcare tracks my blood pressure and even notes atrial fibrillation or irregular heartbeat. A Fitbit scale tracks my weight. Beautyrest Sleeptracker tells me my REM sleep duration. My Apple Watch charts my resting pulse and does a simple electrocardiogram. The more data, the better.

When you do get sick, you still need to see a doctor -- they have that prescription pad. But insurance companies tired of overpaying for five-minute doctor visits have begun setting up alternatives. Sutter Health runs walk-in clinics for $129 a visit. Online care is cheaper, so Anthem Blue Cross encourages customers to use LiveHealth, a videoconference platform, for $49. Aetna has a deal with Teladoc, a $4.5 billion public company, for $38 consultations. No pain meds, of course, but almost everything else.

Consumer-driven options have already changed nonvital care. After doing in-home teeth impressions, you can order orthodontic aligners for $80 a month. For acne treatment, you can upload photos of affected areas and receive medicine by mail monthly. Technology is lowering costs and improving care on all fronts.

Technology has moved so fast that several smartphone-based platforms now function like Uber for doctors: Doctor on Demand, PlushCare, Amwell and MeMD are cutting into primary care. These are gig-economy doctors who provide care on demand for, well, gig-economy workers and others without employer insurance coverage. Today I can upload my health stats and connect to my platform of choice 24/7, whereas just recently I could barely get a hold of my doctor by phone, let alone email or texts, because he couldn't get paid for that time, stuck in a 20th-century pay scheme.

Taking charge of your health care can be complicated and is not for everyone, but it's doable for most. I'd stick with services that hire doctors from top 25 medical schools. And here's a warning for hypochondriacs: Consult a real doctor and do not -- I repeat, do not -- Google your symptoms and convince yourself you have everything from diverticulitis to distomatosis.

If you're really sick you still need to see a specialist: urologist, gynecologist, gastroenterologist, otolaryngologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist. But by then you'll have blown through your high deductible, so that's what insurance is for anyway. And even the specialists will soon realize they can benefit from telemedicine to reduce in-office visits. For now, when you inevitably and repeatedly fill out the prescreening paperwork, specialists always ask for the name of your primary-care physician. I put down "Dr. Webb."

Doctors don't scale, so the real future of medicine is digital diagnosis. The best doctor sees one patient at a time, but a clever piece of code can be used by countless people. All the data that patients record is needed for smart artificial-intelligence-based diagnoses. So why not collect more? Current or emerging technologies can enable at-home cholesterol monitoring and better EKGs, easy glucose monitoring, blood tests to find cancer early before symptoms show up, Alzheimer's screening, thyroid-stimulating hormone tests, even DNA tests that demonstrate a propensity for certain diseases.

Data, data, data -- the more the better. As I write this, I have a Fantastic Voyage-like capsule near my stomach transmitting pH levels. How cool is that? As this technology progresses, more tests and more capsules will fill databases with personalized information.

The goal of these measurements isn't always to give a black-and-white diagnosis saying you have some disease or you don't, but to build data that can be analyzed over time. As more data is recorded, machine learning will allow programs to detect patterns of known disease progression, and flag them early when treatment is cheap and effective. The revolution is coming. But not from your doctor.

Barack Obama famously and falsely said, "If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period." But . . . what if you don't like your doctor?

Let's say you, like me, are one of the 20 million Americans who work for themselves no boss, but also no corporate-tax deduction for health insurance. The smart move is to get a high-deductible insurance plan. Now it suddenly matters what doctors charge: $500 to take your blood pressure and bang your knee with a rubber hammer, $1,200 for a blood test that uses pennies worth of chemicals to tell you your hemoglobin levels are fine. Plus four months to get an appointment, and then the doctor asks you to fax an authorization. What? It's 2019. It's time to fire your doctor.

The Internet, Divided Between the U.S. and China, Has Become a Battleground; As China and the West race for 5G dominance, two digital powers with very different approaches to technology are staking out their corners

The global internet is splitting in two.

One side, championed in China, is a digital landscape where mobile payments have replaced cash. Smartphones are the devices that matter, and users can "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphones-toughest-rival-in-china-is-wechat-a-messaging-app-1501412406". The downsides: "https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/tag/censorship/?mod=article_inline" you may have to communicate with friends in code. And "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerbergs-beijing-blues-1485791106".

On the other side, in much of the world, the internet is open to all. Users can say what they want, mostly, and web developers can roll out pretty much anything. People accustomed to China's version complain this other internet can seem clunky. You must toggle among apps to chat, shop, bank and surf the web. Some websites still don't seem to be designed with smartphones in mind.

The two zones are beginning to clash with the advent of the "https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/fiveg-report-054aca08" China aims to be the biggest provider of gear underlying the networks, and along with that it is pushing client countries to adopt its approach to the web essentially urging some to use versions of "https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/04/11/great-firewall-necessary-to-keep-out-western-propaganda-chinese-newspaper-says/"internet and contain the West's influence.

Battles are popping up around the world as Chinese tech giants try to use their market power at home to expand abroad, something they've largely failed to do so far.

Some Silicon Valley executives worry the divergence risks giving Chinese companies an advantage in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, partly because they face fewer restrictions over privacy and data protection.

"The Chinese approach could well lead to some large-scale improvements like better health outcomes benefits derived from the mass capture and analysis of data," said Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister whom Facebook Inc. hired to run its global policy and communications, in a Brussels speech last week. "But it could equally be put to more sinister surveillance ends."

"The real choice," he said, "is between an appropriately regulated tech sector, balancing the priorities of privacy, free speech, innovation and scale and an alternative in which ingenuity runs roughshod over some basic guarantees of privacy and individual rights." He and Facebook declined to comment further.

The divide is clear to people like Tom Pellman who straddle it. Mr. Pellman, a director in Washington, D.C., for an international risk advisory firm, spent a decade in Beijing from the mid-2000s. His company doesn't use "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boss-talk-slacks-ceo-wants-to-unshackle-you-from-email-1539172800", because China has blocked it. He circumvented the Great Firewall by cycling through virtual private networks, or VPNs, which can disguise activity from monitors until getting discovered and then blocked, he said. "It's Whac-A-Mole."

Beijing's censorship is like its polluted air, he said: "You're in it and it seems OK, then you leave and you realize how bad it was."

Yet he loved "https://www.wsj.com/articles/internet-tightens-popular-chinese-wechat-app-to-become-official-id-1514541980", and missed it when he left China. "When I came back to the U.S. it was like coming back to the Stone Age," he said. "Not being able to use WeChat, everything felt just old fashioned."

These parallel universes have coexisted. In one, people buy goods on Amazon; "https://graphics.wsj.com/alibaba/". In the West, Alphabet Inc.'s Google is so popular it's a verb, but you can't Google in China "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-news-is-good-for-baidu-1524810176". In London, Apple Pay can get you on the Tube; "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alipay-wechat-take-battle-for-mobile-payment-dominance-overseas-1503144003". To do all this in one app in China, there's WeChat, which lets a billion people also send texts, hail cabs and do many other tasks.

Beijing"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704117304575137960803993890?mod=article_inline", Facebook and other services, promoting domestic champions such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and WeChat owner Tencent Holdings Ltd. Outside China, though, these giants haven't had much success.

The 5G collision

The collision of these universes as 5G arrives is exacerbating conflict between the U.S. and China and could broaden the rift and drive more of the world into China's cyberspace model.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-5g-will-mean-to-consumersand-when-1536804241" are expected to download movies on phones in seconds, help enable self-driving cars, and connect components ranging from pacemakers to factory machines to the internet. Military futurists say 5G may alter battlefields, connecting tanks and drones with artificial intelligence.

China is aiming to expand its zone with 5G. It is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-being-first-in-5g-matters-1536804360", establishing a body in 2013 composed of regulators, companies and scientists to design and control every aspect of the process. It built a state facility where anyone selling 5G equipment in China must test it.

China's 5G goal is to "win primacy," said China's leading proponent of the effort, Wu Hequan of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, last month, according to a transcript conference organizers posted. The government's information office and the Cyberspace Administration, an internet regulator, didn't respond to requests for comment.

That Chinese challenge has suddenly come to the fore because one giant has leapt the divide between the parallel universes. Huawei Technologies Co. is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-huawei-took-over-the-world-11545735603".

The 5G equipment itself won't tilt the playing field the gear is the plumbing of the internet, based on global standards that are agnostic as to what web developers and users run on it.

But many in Washington, from Congress to members of the national-security and intelligence communities, warn that Huawei's Chinese ownership means Beijing could use the gear to spy on the world and more broadly be a camel's nose under the tent to expand its influence.

Huawei has publicly rejected the accusations. Founder Ren Zhengfei in a media appearance last month said "I personally would never harm the interest of my customers &And my company would not answer to such requests."

Chinese officials and cybersecurity experts point to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's allegations the agency installed surveillance backdoors in U.S.-made routers designated for export. The NSA didn't respond to requests for comment. In the past, it has said in response that it takes care to ensure that innocent users of such technologies aren't affected by U.S. intelligence gathering.

The U.S. has also accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and violating sanctions, raising the possibility the Trump administration could cut its access to critical U.S.-made components. Huawei denies wrongdoing.

If that happens, said Paul Triolo, a former federal government analyst who heads up global technology research at risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, China could build a version of 5G that isn't compatible with the U.S. network. "If the global supply chain for 5G really falls apart," he said, "we would be in totally new territory."

Huawei Deputy Chairman Ken Hu said it has amassed 13,000 suppliers and that: "If any link in this global industry chain is obstructed in an unusual way, that would have major impact on the development of the industry chain and even the economic development of countries involved." Huawei declined to comment further for this article.

Deploying 5G widely at home before the West does could benefit Chinese tech companies, said David Chao, general partner at DCM Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture-capital firm that invests in China. Chinese companies could have a leg up by using their huge domestic market to develop new apps and hardware that flourish with the faster speeds. "It could sprout a whole generation of mobile services that take advantage of that," he said, "and they may be exported to the western world."

At the heart of the divide are differing views on how to manage the internet. The U.S. pushes the open model on which the internet was built. Beijing and like-minded countries such as Russia say states should be able to censor, spy on or otherwise control internet traffic within their borders.

Beijing has sold its internet model alongside Chinese-made telecom equipment in countries as distant as Vietnam and Tanzania as part of an effort to build what it calls a "Digital Silk Road." Last year, Tanzanian officials followed up public praise for Chinese internet censorship by approving rules that threaten online content providers with fines and jail if they don't take down "prohibited content" at government request.

Tanzanian information minister Harrison Mwakyembe said the government backs China's vision of strict internet policing to protect national security and to prevent "moral degeneration."

Government officials in"https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-amazon-walmart-and-other-foreign-players-dominate-india-to-promote-domestic-tech-companies-11548766862"from American companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook, much as China has protected its own startups. India's telecom secretary, Aruna Sundararajan, said the idea is to promote Indian companies "to become global champions."

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-xi-jinping-opens-tech-conference-with-call-for-cyber-sovereignty-1479273347" China has lobbied at the United Nations for discussion of internet regulation to be limited to states, with industry and civil society relegated to the sidelines. In 2017 at a conference in China attended by Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google chief Sundar Pichai, the Communist Party's top official in charge of ideology and propaganda, Wang Huning, praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for advancing China's vision of the internet, saying it had "gained broad approval and positive responses from international society."

Firewall rising

At first, with the internet's spread, foreign companies were welcome in China and technology evolved faster than the government's censorship capabilities. Google rolled out a censored Chinese-language version of its search engine. Amazon entered the market, and Chinese users flooded onto Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.

Chinese leaders took more control after the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121614671139755287", reflecting fear of political dissent and concern Chinese businesses were struggling to compete online. "https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/10/01/chinas-great-firewall-on-off-and-on-again/?mod=article_inline". The next year, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704117304575137960803993890?mod=article_inline", and it was blocked. The websites of several foreign news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal's, are also blocked.

That left China's search market to Baidu Inc. Alibaba vanquished eBay Inc., and its Alipay payment system gave it a lock on online payments, with foreign firms from PayPal Holdings Inc. to Visa Inc. blocked from providing payment services.

Outside China, Alibaba was an afterthought in many markets. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-tech-giant-baidu-steps-back-from-middle-east-1509039191" after investing in local-language products. An Alibaba spokeswoman said the company remains "fully committed to realizing our mission of making it easy to do business anywhere in this digital era." A Baidu spokeswoman said the company still provides advertising and other services in Japan.

Despite an aggressive marketing push featuring celebrities such as soccer star Lionel Messi, Tencent has struggled to expand WeChat overseas. Since January 2012, WeChat has been downloaded about 350 million times from Apple's App store world-wide, according to research firm Sensor Tower Inc. About 83% of those downloads come from users in China and 17% from outside, according to Sensor Tower. Tencent didn't respond to requests for comment.

Some Chinese tech champions have struggled overseas because they came late to markets where competitors such as Google and Facebook have a foothold.

Another factor is suspicion the companies may have links to the Communist Party. Ant Financial Services Group, owned by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, made a 2017 bid to enter North American financial services by acquiring Texas-based MoneyGram International Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moneygram-and-ant-financial-halt-merger-deal-1514931496" It also blocked Broadcom Inc.'s planned purchase of Qualcomm Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-letter-cfius-suggests-it-may-soon-recommend-against-broadcom-bid-for-qualcomm-1520869867", a major competitor to Huawei in 5G patents.

In September, Mr. Ma recanted a pledge to create a million U.S. jobs, citing trade hostilities. He didn't respond to a request for comment sent through Alibaba, which pointed to an interview Mr. Ma did in which he said "trade should be a propeller of peace."

Washington's effort to push back on the equipment side started years ago. It blacklisted Huawei and China's rival ZTE Corp. in 2012, when the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443982904578044190738613734". ZTE and Huawei have repeatedly said they aren't a threat. The U.S. pushback escalated last month with a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-case-against-huawei-11548770785" for allegedly playing a role in breaking Iran sanctions. Separately, prosecutors accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets. Huawei has denied wrongdoing in both cases and said it was unaware of any wrongdoing by the CFO, who has denied the allegations.

Europe's eastern flank is a particular battleground. In December, the Czech Republic's top cybersecurity agency warned that sensitive data probably shouldn't be carried over Huawei gear. But the country's president, Milos Zeman, has criticized those findings. Last month, he took two senior Huawei executives on a tour of Prague's castle and in a televised interview called Huawei spying allegations hysteria. His prime minister, Andrej Babis, has taken a differing view, saying Czech agencies and European Union leaders should take such allegations seriously. A spokesman for Mr. Babis confirmed his views. Mr. Zeman's office declined to comment.

For now, motivated consumers in China can span the two internet worlds using workarounds such as smartphones with foreign SIM cards that connect to the outside internet, said Li Zhen, a Hong Kong market-research analyst who travels to China for business.

She senses the rift in the paranoia her Chinese contacts exhibit while talking on WeChat about potentially sensitive topics. "My friends in the government and media will talk in code, and it can take a long time to figure out what they're saying," she said. "Sometimes the topic is probably not so sensitive, but you never know."

JANUS HENDERSON GROUP PLC

JHG -0.3%

The "bond king" has left the building. Renowned investor Bill Gross, who won his royal moniker for bold predictions as head of what was once the world's largest bond mutual fund, said Monday that he would retire from Janus after a stormy four-year run. His tenure was marked by uneven investment returns and distracting legal battles with Pacific Investment Management Co., the firm he co-founded in 1971. Mr. Gross leaves with his flagship Janus fund controlling less than $1 billion, down from a peak above $2 billion. Janus shares eased 0.3% Monday.

PAPA JOHN'S INT'L INC.

PZZA +9%

Activist investor Starboard Value LP is working up an appetite for pizza. The firm plans to invest $200 million in Papa John's and appointed its chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, as chairman of the pizza chain's board. Papa John's ousted founder and former CEO, John Schnatter, made a competing offer of $250 million after learning of Starboard's investment, but it was rejected by the company's independent board members and withdrawn. Starboard's deal with the pizza chain comes after more than a year of tumult marked by declining same-store sales. Papa John's shares rose 9% Monday.

BB&T CORP.

BBT +4%

BB&T agreed to buy SunTrust Banks Inc. in a $28.2 billion all-stock deal, the largest union of U.S. banks since the financial crisis led to an era of ramped-up regulation and chilled merger activity in the industry. The tie-up of regional bank powerhouses would create the sixth-largest U.S. retail bank and could mark the start of consolidation among smaller lenders. BB&T shares rose 4% Thursday, while SunTrust shares jumped 10%.

ALPHABET INC.

GOOGL +0.9%

Google's parent reported a 22% jump in fourth-quarter revenue after Monday's closing bell, but the tech-industry bellwether also showed just how expensive it has become to maintain its dominance: research-and-development costs leapt 40%. Against this backdrop, Alphabet notched per-share earnings of $12.77, beating Wall Street expectations, but profit margins fell to 21% from 24% a year earlier. Analysts expect R&D costs to rise, but the company declined to elaborate on its spending on advanced technologies like artificial intelligence. Alphabet shares rose 0.9% Tuesday, rallying after early declines.

SPOTIFY TECHNOLOGY SA

SPOT -2.8%

Spotify is looking to do for podcasts what it did for music streaming. The Swedish company said Wednesday that it is acquiring podcast producer Gimlet Media and publisher Anchor, part of a strategy to capture more of users' listening time with better curation, customization and recommendation services. Spotify also turned in strong results, featuring the streaming platform's first operating profit. But the company's guidance that it expects to spend heavily this year, including as much as $500 million on multiple deals, spooked investors. Spotify shares fell 2.8% Wednesday.

TWITTER INC.

TWTR -9.8%

Twitter posted a full year of profitability for the first time in its almost 13-year history. Also a first: Twitter disclosed its total number of daily users, 126 million, and said it would stop reporting its tally of monthly active users. While daily users grew 1.6% from the previous quarter, the 321 million monthly active users fell 1.5% as Twitter steps up its policing of abuse that occurs on the site. Marketers have cheered Twitter's cleanup efforts, but investors fret that it's coming at the expense of user growth. Shares sank 9.8% Thursday amid concerns over waning user growth and mounting costs.

WELLS FARGO & CO.

WFC -2.3%

Wells Fargo customers were unable to access online banking and mobile applications Thursday after a system failure at one of the bank's facilities caused nationwide outages. This is the second time this month that the bank has experienced issues with mobile and online banking. Wells Fargo previously received a warning from the Office of the Comptroller of Currency over issues with its technology oversight, The Wall Street Journal reported late last year. Wells Fargo shares fell 2.3% Thursday.

Goldman to wield axe on bond unit as peers sit tight

US bank to 'reallocate' capital but rivals bet industry decline in fixed income will end

Goldman Sachs is the only big US bank planning major changes to its bondtrading division this year, as fixedincome bosses in other corners of Wall Street bet that a tough fourth quarter was an anomaly and that the post-crisis decline in their businesses will reverse.

After a worse-than-peers 23 per cent fall in fixed-income revenues over the past three years, Goldman has been upfront about its plans to "reallocate" capital from some fixed-income activities to less capital-intensive pursuits, such as the investment banking division where David Solomon, its new chief executive, spent most of his career.

The exercise, which is likely to involve cost cuts and withdrawals from some activities, is part of a review by Mr Solomon, whose October succession marked a historic change at the bank after the 12-year reign of Lloyd Blankfein, who was a product of the fixed income, currencies and commodities side.

"We're looking at all of our businesses, including fixed income, with a clear eye, [and] we're going to size FICC based on the opportunity set," said James Esposito, co-head of securities, adding that Goldman had been "re-allocating capital to other, higher-returning businesses over the past five years". Analysts expect more dramatic changes and say these are overdue, as Goldman continued to nurture big businesses in areas such as commodities even after post-crisis regulation prompted other banks to tweak their operations. Morgan Stanley, for example, reshaped its FICC business and cut 25 per cent of headcount in 2015.

Mr Solomon is in a strong position to push for action after a fourth quarter when rival JPMorgan hit its lowest fixedincome revenue in history, Citigroup's fixed-income revenue fell to a sevenyear low and Morgan Stanley posted a worst-in-class 30 per cent fall in fixedincome revenues year on year.

Still, despite the grim industry backdrop, Mr Solomon will be an outlier among his peers when he wields the axe.

Asked if trading in the fourth quarter, or in 2018 overall, would prompt banks like his to rethink their fixed income business, JPMorgan corporate and investment bank boss Daniel Pinto replied: "No".

Paco Ybarra, head of Citi's Global Markets business, said: "This is a cyclical business and you have to have some ability to withstand the downturn in parts of the business."

The argument from the JPMorgan and Citi executives   echoed by trading executives at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America   is that the fourth-quarter decline stemmed from an unusual combination of market forces in December. Specifically, the mounting turbulence in financial markets led interest rate expectations to oscillate wildly. Markets swung from pricing in two Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2019 to betting on a rate cut. The average yield of US corporate bonds climbed to an eight-year high of 4.37 per cent.

Those conditions rendered it harder for banks to make money in their credit businesses, which facilitate clients' trading in debt, and in their rates units.

"Volumes were actually OK. In some cases they were up. It was more about our ability to monetise that client value while managing risks associated with the volatility," said Troy Rohrbaugh, JPMorgan's markets head, describing how assets could fall in value in the short time between banks taking them from one client and selling them to another. The timing of the market moves was also problematic. Big swings can inspire opportunistic investors to take a punt on recovery, cushioning the impact of the swings   just not in December, when hedge funds and banks take extra care to manage their positions so their year-end accounts look good.

Mr Esposito said Goldman's fourthquarter performance was "completely correlated to our client franchise".

"We're not shying away from supporting our clients' risk intermediation needs," he said. "We're in the risk management business."

The bank bosses all see the fourthquarter woes as separate from the structural decline that has followed the financial crisis. Fixed-income revenues across the big five banks fell 15 per cent from 2013, thanks to regulation banning proprietary trading and making some other activities prohibitively expensive.

Mr Rohrbaugh said regulation had been "roughly the same for the last several years" and he did not expect material changes. Morgan Stanley's fixedincome boss, Sam Kellie-Smith, believes industry revenues are "pretty close" to the low point, though he does not think "the wallet is going to race away".

Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Autonomous, said he did not see the fourth quarter as evidence of wider malaise. "Most of the other firms [beyond Goldman] have a business that is reasonably well suited for today's FICC environment," he said.

The big banks cite many reasons for optimism. They argue that technology will be a key determinant of future success, as fixed-income trading follows equities to a more digital future. "There is a race playing out in the global banking industry around technology investment," said Mr Esposito. The industry's fees have already become more concentrated. In 2006, the top three players   Goldman, Citi and Deutsche   shared 35 per cent of the top 12 banks' FICC revenue, according to data from Coalition. By the first half of 2018, the top three banks   Goldman, Citi and JPMorgan   had grown their share to 45 per cent.

Technology offers the potential of more profitable fixed-income businesses, as processes are automated and artificial intelligence is deployed. "It's a big deal," said Mr Kellie-Smith. He added that parts of FICC were already "very similar to equities ... In markets such as credit, the adoption of e-trading has been slower. But in 2018 we reached an inflection point. We and our clients are taking that change very seriously.'' Capital efficiency is the other area where the big banks say they are making progress, as they have learnt the best ways to optimise their businesses for the changed regulatory environment, a process that takes years. "People are getting smarter about the capital piece, returns are getting better, even if the revenues are slightly less," said Bernie Mensah at Bank of America.

The bankers say there will always be demand for FICC activities such as hedging foreign exchange rates and offering derivatives that give companies and institutions certainty that they can meet their long-term obligations.

All of which means that big FICC cuts now would be an "irrational move" for most banks, in the words of Mr Pinto.

At Goldman, Mr Esposito declined to give specifics on where cuts would fall.

He said there would be a "laser focus" on optimising resources in commodities and elsewhere. But he added that commodities "has been an important business at GS for decades and, despite recent reports suggesting otherwise, will remain so".

He remains an optimist on his division's prospects. "I can't recall a time in the last 10 years where the macro opportunity set is this interesting," he said, listing everything from trade wars to rising populism as "macro themes that will lead to a lot client portfolio rebalancing and overall activity".

"As the sugar rush of quantitative easing fades, we should start to see a more normal environment for volatility and interest rates. For me, it is not a question of if, only when." Additional reporting by Robin Wigglesworth in New York

Large Companies Centralize AI Resources; Centers of excellence help corporations set strategies, prioritize projects

Corrections & Amplifications

Guy Peri is the chief data and analytics officer at Procter & Gamble. A previous version of this article incorrectly said his name was Peri Guy and that he was the company's chief data officer. (Feb. 8, 2019)

As organizations continue to deploy artificial intelligence, many, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Procter & Gamble Co., are creating centralized AI groups to coordinate their efforts.

These centralized resources are helping companies set corporate artificial intelligence strategies, prioritize projects, evaluate proofs of concepts, establish AI governance and structure, and spread AI knowledge and skills throughout the organization.

Of the large companies implementing AI, 37% have centers of excellence, according to Deloitte LLP, and the number is expected to increase.

"As the technology matures, you end up seeing more centers of excellence emerge because companies are trying to move from experimentation to being able to derive business value," said Jeff Loucks, executive director of Deloitte's Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications.

Centers of excellence, which also have names such as AI innovation groups or AI task groups, according to Gartner Inc. analyst Bern Elliot, come in different shapes and sizes. Some have physical locations while others are dispersed throughout the business. Some are staffed by just a few data scientists while others have teams of business executives and AI experts.

What they all have in common is a mission to harness and direct AI resources for business benefit.

"These projects, especially as they get more sophisticated, require skills. And once you get those skills you want to use them repeatedly. You don't want to start from scratch every time you do a project," said Mr. Elliot.

Here's a look at how Goldman, Morgan Stanley and P&G have centralized management of their AI initiatives.

Goldman Sachs' center of excellence, which is called the Machine Learning Team, is just getting started. Established in March 2018, the operation is led by Managing Director Charles Elkan, who reports to Chief Data Officer Jeff Wecker.

The Goldman group, a handful of people, according to Mr. Elkan, is working with the company's securities division on a machine learning system to help price products. The project calls for the AI system to look at one type of less-frequently traded bonds and analyze previous prices, the prices of similar products and other data to detect pricing patterns. Goldman will use the information to price the debt instrument.

The group is still in the early stages, but Mr. Elkan sees it spreading AI knowledge throughout the organization.

Morgan Stanley's center of excellence is a bit more established. Set up in 2017, the group is run by Managing Director Vivek Mago, who reports into the company's transformation service, a unit within the company's IT department focused on maximizing the financial services firm's technology efforts.

Like Goldman's Machine Learning Team, Morgan Stanley's group is small, numbering in the tens, said Mr. Mago. On one project, the unit, working with the bank's fraud prevention group, assembled a team of data scientists, data engineers and security experts who worked with an AI vendor called Brighterion to create a system that identifies and analyzes unusual transaction patterns. The system gives the bank an added way to spot and prevent fraud.

"We think we're already starting to make an impact and we will hopefully continue to scale the impact across the firm," said Mr. Mago.

Procter & Gamble's center of excellence is larger than those of the two banks. The operation, which is called the AI/Machine Learning Center of Expertise, was started two years ago. It is headed by data scientist Jose Ortega, who reports to P&G's chief data and analytics officer, Guy Peri. Depending on the work the center is doing at any given time, the staff can range in size between 30 and 40 people, said Mr. Peri.

P&G's team, unlike the Goldman and Morgan Stanley groups, is dispersed, with the members embedded in key business units around the world. "We need to be very close to where the business problems are," said Mr. Peri.

The center has worked on a number of P&Gartificial intelligence projects, including a precision-marketing application. The company analyzes anonymous consumer data to identify people who are most likely to purchase one of its products and then markets the product to that targeted group. The maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors also is using an algorithm that analyzes retail sales to find out which products are most popular in a given geography. Its sales force can use that information to promote those products to its retail partners.

"If we were completely federated and disconnected, and not coming together as a COE, we would be building capabilities at a much slower pace. So, the amount of capabilities I'm seeing being built in my organization, through the COE, has truly accelerated in a significant way," Mr. Peri said.

VC Daily: Gloom Over Silicon Valley | Can Biometric IDs Improve Health Care?

Good day. Silicon Valley investors have started off this year in a sour mood. And we can thank Washington for at least part of that gloom.

Confidence among the region's venture capitalists has sunk to its lowest point since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, according to the University of San Francisco Silicon Valley Venture Capital Index, now marking its 15th anniversary.

The findings of the quarterly survey by Professor Mark Cannice coincide with a drop in the number of IPO exits via in the fourth quarter, though deal flow rose sharply last year for mergers and acquisitions.

Political conditions in the U.S. and abroad were a big factor, Prof. Cannice says. "Seldom have political concerns so significantly impacted confidence" in the Valley, he said.

Political wrangling has stoked market uncertainty, dimming the outlook for exits, and causing delays in regulatory oversight of the markets.

Cash remains abundant, but the bias is shifting to capital efficiency.

The takeaway: VCs are bullish long term (as always) but in the short term, they are turning more conservative on valuations and fundraising. Happy Friday.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Digital palm readings: Biometric ID technology is going mainstream. Such systems, which identify people through fingerprints or other physical characteristics, have long been in use in law enforcement and consumer electronics. Now hospitals are using iris and palm-vein scanning to overcome a growing patient-identification problem.

In one extreme case, more than 500 women in one health system have the same name and were born on the same day.

No national standard is in place. Proponents see biometrics being increasingly accepted because of its use in smartphones, border security and elsewhere.

Says Nader Mherabi, chief information officer for NYU Langone Health in New York: "It should be the standard." WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has the story.

Collaboration platform's big jump: Startup Figma Inc. is raising a new round of funding that will boost its valuation to $400 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. Sequoia Capital is slated to lead the Series C round backing the San Francisco company, which provides online collaboration tools for product designers, according to a person familiar with the situation. The deal, which was competitive among several venture-capital firms, would give the startup's valuation a four-fold leap in a year's time. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the scoop.

Exits

Food-delivery company Postmates Inc. has filed confidentially for an initial public offering, the company said. The size and price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined, the company said.

The London-based firm is an investor in cybersecurity startup Darktrace, delivery specialist Deliveroo, and Halo Neuro Inc., maker of a brain-stimulation device to enhance various skills.

New Money

Amazon.com Inc. has invested in high-profile autonomous-vehicle startup Aurora, giving the online retailer insight into the fast-developing world of driverless cars as it navigates its growing logistics operation. Aurora Innovation Inc. raised more than $530 million in the latest funding round, which was led by Sequoia Capital and included capital from Amazon and funds and accounts advised by T.

BB&T-SunTrust Tie-Up Brings Tech Budgets Into Focus; Deal shows how banks are spending more on technology to attract new customers

Behind one of the biggest bank deals in a decade is a recognition that BB&T Corp. and SunTrust Banks Inc., both dominant banks in the South, would be more competitive with a bigger tech budget.

The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/suntrust-bb-t-to-combine-in-all-stock-merger-11549537817", announced Thursday, is expected to help the rivals close a widening digital gap that is fueling one of the biggest threats to their business: losing relevance among younger customers.

The deal, which would create the sixth-largest regional bank and a financial powerhouse in the South, underscores the urgency facing regional banks to invest heavily in client-facing and back-end technology to continue attracting consumer and corporate customers.

"What's the largest strategic risk facing the banking industry? It's technology," said Todd Baker, a senior fellow at the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business, Law and Public Policy at Columbia University. "How are they going to be more nimble and effective?"

The transaction the biggest bank deal since the financial crisis will allow the former rivals to develop better technology together than they could on their own. They plan to reinvest $1.6 billion in projected cost savings from the merger into technology and innovation.

The companies also plan to create an innovation and technology center at the merged entity's new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to drive digital transformation, including the adoption of automation and an improved customer experience online.

"This is the early innings of an enormous transformation of all of financial services," Mr. Baker said.

In recent years, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have invested heavily in developing consumer-facing technology such as "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/05/12/bank-of-america-chats-about-erica-its-new-digital-assistant/" and digital investing apps. In the process, they also have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/biggest-three-banks-gobble-up-2-4-trillion-in-new-deposits-since-crisis-1521711001" at a faster clip than smaller peers.

To understand the challenges regional banks face, consider: BB&T disclosed in November that its technology budget for 2018 was $1.1 billion. BofA, meanwhile, disclosed a total technology budget of about $10 billion.

"The world is changing and we have to change," BB&T Chief Executive Kelly King said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

The deal also presents an opportunity for cost savings. During a conference call with analysts, executives from both companies said that some of the cuts could come from redundant systems and branch closures. Together, the companies have roughly 740 locations within two miles of each other, according to a presentation.

Those savings could bolster the tech budget. "One of the most powerful benefits of this merger," BB&T Chief Financial Officer Daryl Bible said during the call, "is that we are able to take significant costs out of redundant areas and reinvest them into innovation, technology and our talent, ensuring we are better positioned for the future."

Scott Case, currently the chief information officer at SunTrust, is expected to lead technology at the combined company, while Donta Wilson, chief digital officer at BB&T, would lead the company's digital transformation.

KKR Agrees to Take Majority Stake in Financial Software Maker OneStream; Deal values the business at north of $1 billion

Private-equity firm KKR agreed to take a majority stake in OneStream Software LLC in a deal that values the corporate performance management software maker at more than $1 billion.

KKR declined to disclose the amount it invested in the Rochester, Mich., company, but a person familiar with the matter said it was more than $500 million.

The firm said the investment was made through its private-equity and growth-equity funds, adding that KKR is OneStream's first external investor.

OneStream's software unifies and simplifies financial consolidation, planning, reporting, analytics and financial data quality and can be deployed on premises or through cloud computing. The company competes with Oracle Corp. and SAP SE, as well as more specialized software makers such as such as financial planning software Anaplan Inc. and financial reporting software Workiva Inc.

OneStream software is used by more than 300 customers, including United Parcel Service Inc. and Sagent Pharmaceuticals Inc. The company grew its revenue by 137% and expanded its customer base by 66% in 2018, OneStream said.

Chief financial officers often buy separate software to tackle specific needs, such as lease accounting or planning. Over time, the cost of operating and maintaining individual systems can become unwieldy, said OneStream Chief Executive Tom Shea.

"We're changing that," he said, adding that OneStream enables finance professionals to complete reporting and planning tasks from a single platform.

A wave of new players has disrupted and reshaped segments of the enterprise software marketplace in recent years, dethroning legacy systems. Among them are Salesforce.com Inc. within the customer relationship management space, and Workday Inc. in human resources, said David Welsh, who heads KKR's technology, media and telecommunications growth-equity group.

OneStream is following a similar trajectory in the corporate performance software segment, he said.

Mr. Welsh is expected to join OneStream's board once the transaction closes. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus, who is now chairman of the KKR Global Institute, and KKR Principal Jim Miele also are expected to join the board.

Good day and welcome to what feels like the all-Carlyle edition of WSJ Pro Private Equity.

Carlyle Group held its earnings call yesterday and, like many of its peers, posted an earnings decline.

But the operative word of the call was "billion." A few takeaways: The firm aims to raise around $20 billion in 2019 and is now 90% of the way toward a $100 billion three-year fundraising goal set back in 2016. It raised $17 billion of capital in 2018, pushing its assets under management to $216.5 billion.

Meanwhile, as we report this morning, Carlyle's special situations unit is also weighing a bid for troubled U.K. bakery chain Patisserie Valerie and its European private-equity team is nearing the  ¬6 billion mark for its latest buyout fund.

Few digital-health companies have joined the billion-dollar startup club. For those that have, it has been a long road.

From primary-care startup One Medical to consumer genomics giant 23andMe Inc., most take about a decade to become members. Health Catalyst Inc. became the latest. More than 10 years after it was founded, it now commands a $1 billion valuation following a $100 million funding led by OrbiMed Advisors.

Investors and industry experts said the data analytics company has succeeded in part by amassing one of the largest datasets available, with information from more than 100 million patients.

Today, the company posts annual recurring revenue of $140 million and is frequently mentioned in digital-health circles as a likely candidate for an initial public offering.

Salt Lake City-based Health Catalyst's software can pull data from multiple sources, structure it into a single format, and recommend the next course of action for health systems such as Intermountain Healthcare, UPMC and Stanford.

It has raised around $400 million to date from the likes of Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners and several major hospitals. The latest financing, a Series F round, is planned for domestic and international expansion.

Health Catalyst's competitors include analytics startups such as Lumiata Inc. and vendors of electronic health records.

Oak Hill Capital Partners is joining the growing vanguard of private-equity firms looking to data science and artificial intelligence to bolster its operations.

The midmarket firm said Ennio Montinaro and Todd Cullen are joining the firm in New York to help incorporate data analysis and artificial intelligence into the firm's due diligence, investment processes and portfolio company operations.

Mr. Montinaro joins as the firm's chief administrative officer, and Mr. Cullen will serve as a senior adviser and operating consultant. Both are newly created roles at the firm.

Before joining Oak Hill, Mr. Montinaro was a managing director at Nomura and Citi, where he was responsible for the distribution of emerging-market products to large institutional investors, according to a news release. His career also includes stints at Morgan Stanley and Barclays.

Mr. Cullen, meanwhile, previously was a managing director at KPMG, where he led the enterprise and customer analytics practice.

Good day. The Federal Reserve released details of how it will conduct stress tests on large banks this year. One big change for 2019: Banks must show they could survive a 10% unemployment rate with enough capital to keep lending. Regarding monetary policy, Dallas Fed leader Robert Kaplan said in an essay that the central bank shouldn't make a rate move until it gets greater clarity on the economic outlook and financial conditions.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Fed to Include High Unemployment in 2019 Stress Test Scenario

The Federal Reserve on Tuesday said that its stress test for big banks will imagine a rapid increase in unemployment, as it announced the details of the hypothetical scenario that banks must survive to pass the latest round of the exams. The Fed's latest "severely adverse" scenario imagines unemployment rising by six percentage points to 10%, along with stress in corporate lending and commercial real-estate markets.

Fed's Kaplan: More Clarity Needed Before Fed Can Decide Next Rate Move

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan reiterated Tuesday his support for the central bank holding off for now on further rate rises and said changes in its balance sheet drawdown should be on the table as well. "We should take no further action on the federal-funds rate until there is greater clarity regarding a number of uncertainties relating to the economic outlook and development of financial conditions," Mr. Kaplan said in an essay published by the Dallas Fed.

Derby's Take: The Fed's Focus on Financial Conditions

Tighter financial conditions, not just risks to the economic outlook, were an important driver in the Fed's decision last week to hold off on further rate increases. And according to Goldman Sachs's chief economist, Jan Hatzius, the Fed is now locked in a tight relationship with financial conditions.

"We seem to have transitioned from a regime in which relatively aggressive rate hikes were needed in order to lean against overly easy financial conditions to a regime in which even gradual hikes might lead to substantially tighter financial conditions," he wrote in a report.

Europe's Economy Starts 2019 With a Whimper

Europe's flagging economy "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-economy-starts-2019-with-a-whimper-11549366726" in 2019, as Italy showed few signs of emerging from recession and the uncertainty around Britain's exit from the European Union dragged on U.K. growth. The eurozone economy slowed more sharply than expected in 2018 and seems set to cool further this year.

To Gauge Health of Global Economy, Look to Purchasing Managers

Bank of Thailand Keeps Benchmark Rate Unchanged At 1.75%

The Bank of Thailand on Wednesday "https://centralbanking.cmail19.com/t/d-l-nkhirit-jlohthuq-f/", as widely expected, amid benign inflation and slowing economic growth. The central bank's monetary-policy committee kept its overnight lending rate, or one-day repurchase rate, at 1.75%.

RBA Governor Lowe Says Rates Outlook More Balanced

The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia Philip Lowe said Wednesday the outlook for interest rates "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rba-governor-lowe-says-rates-outlook-more-balanced-11549421869?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb", warning that there is a risk the economy could be weaker than the central bank thinks.

Iceland Central Bank Cuts Growth Outlook as Tourism Slows

The Icelandic central bank left its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iceland-central-bank-cuts-growth-outlook-as-tourism-slows-11549450459" at 4.5% on Wednesday, but slashed its growth outlook for the Nordic island nation amid a sharp slowdown in tourism.

ECB Increases Italian, French Bond Holdings

The European Central Bank has increased its holdings of Italian and French government bonds in January despite no redemptions from those countries, according to Danske Bank research. The bank says it noticed a "solid increase" in the ECB's holdings of bonds from those two countries in Monday's ECB reinvestment purchases data. This is despite the fact that France and Italy aren't due to carry out any full payment of the principal amount on their bonds until February and April, respectively, based on Danske Bank's estimates. Conversely, there was a decline in the holdings of German, Dutch and Spanish bonds given large redemptions in these countries during January, it says. (Dow Jones Newswires)

Brazil Should Cut Rates Wednesday, But It Won't

Economists expect Brazil's central bank will leave its benchmark Selic rate unchanged at a record low of 6.5% on Wednesday. But, given declining forecasts for economic growth in the country this year, and expectations that inflation will continue to slow, the bank should cut the Selic again, according to Andre Perfeito, an economist at Sao Paulo-based Necton. Central bankers usually make their reputation by being hawkish, and outgoing Central Bank of Brazil President Ilan Goldfajn is very unlikely to cut rates now and leave his replacement, Roberto Campos Neto, in the awkward position of either having to decide to cut rates again, or change policy and hold them unchanged, Perfeito said.

Senate Panel Eyes Nomination of Fannie, Freddie Overseer Next Week

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON Senate lawmakers are expected as early as next week to consider the nomination of Mark Calabria, a critic of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to the post responsible for overseeing the housing-finance companies, according to people familiar with the matter.

The hearing is a crucial step as the Senate weighs confirming Mr. Calabria to become the director of the obscure but powerful Federal Housing Finance Agency, the regulator of the two companies. The Senate Banking Committee is expected to hear testimony from Mr. Calabria and nominees for at least two more financial posts at a hearing tentatively set for Feb. 14, the people said.

A spokeswoman for the committee declined to comment.

Mr. Calabria is now chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence. The banking panel is set to hear testimony from Mr. Calabria and other nominees next week. It would have to meet again in the coming weeks to vote on his nomination and advance it to the Senate floor.

If confirmed, Mr. Calabria would play a key role in shaping the Trump administration's efforts to end the decadelong conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, taken over at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Ending government control of Fannie and Freddie, which back roughly half of the $10 trillion mortgage market, is Congress's last major to-do item in the wake of the crisis.

The White House is preparing to release a framework for how it will develop such a plan, which is expected to rely on legislation and administrative steps by the FHFA to reduce the government's role in housing. Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), the head of the banking panel, last week released an outline for how Congress could legislatively refashion the firms, kicking off a long and complicated process that has repeatedly fizzled in prior Congresses.

Mr. Calabria would succeed Mel Watt, an Obama-appointed official whose term ended in January. The FHFA role is the last top post overseeing the financial sector to turn over to a permanent Trump appointee. Joseph Otting, the comptroller of the currency, has been heading the FHFA on an interim basis since last month, splitting his time between the two regulators.

Last month, Mr. Otting told FHFA employees the Trump administration would consider releasing Fannie and Freddie from government control without legislation, according to an audio recording of the private meeting reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The White House last week issued a statement playing down some of those comments and stressing the administration would work with Congress on any plan.

Fannie and Freddie are central players in the housing market, buying mortgages from lenders and packaging them for issuance as securities. The government effectively nationalized the two firms in 2008 in a bid to stabilize the housing market as mortgage defaults mounted.

In return for injecting about $190 billion into the firms, the government created a new class of stock senior preferred shares paying an annual 10% dividend, along with warrants to acquire nearly 80% of the firms' common stock. The Treasury revamped its bailout agreement in 2012 to require that nearly all the companies' profits be swept away as dividend payments on those preferred shares. Investors filed suit over the change.

Fannie and Freddie have sent roughly $292 billion to the federal government since their bailouts. Investors point out that return, relative to the amount of government aid the firms received, far outstrips the $16 billion return on TARP, the federal bailout fund for banks during the crisis.

U.S. Works to Pave Way for Its Pick to Lead World Bank

By Josh Zumbrun

The Trump administration is moving swiftly to shore up support for the candidacy of David Malpass to be the next president of the World Bank, hoping to head off potential challengers as the nominating process gets under way.

An official announcement of Mr. Malpass's nomination is expected Wednesday, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been speaking with foreign counterparts to rally support for Mr. Malpass's candidacy, according to a senior administration official.

The World Bank presidency is formally open to candidates from other countries, but no other country has moved with the same urgency as the U.S., no other candidates have been announced, and so the U.S. may get its way in appointing a sharp critic of the institution to lead it.

The U.S. traditionally has picked the World Bank president as part of an arrangement in which Europe gets to pick the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

This arrangement has been in place since World War II and remains popular in many European capitals, but it isn't formal and has been challenged in recent years by other countries. The final decision rests with the World Bank's board of executive directors, which begins considering nominations this week.

Mr. Mnuchin spoke last week with Italian finance minister Giovanni Tria, who said in an interview after their meeting that Italy was unlikely to fight a World Bank nomination. "There's a tradition the U.S. can propose a candidate for the World Bank," Mr. Tria said. "For Italy, this is okay because we expect a good candidate."

The U.S. has moved quickly after the World Bank's previous president, Jim Yong Kim unexpectedly announced his resignation last month. Within a week, Mr. Mnuchin and the president's daughter Ivanka Trump were looking to select a candidate, and Mr. Malpass emerged as one of the leading contenders almost immediately.

Despite a strong international desire for the bank to have its first female head and a number of strong potential candidates, no country has yet stepped forward to nominate an alternative to America's pick.

"The Trump administration seems to be bulldozing its way to having its nominee accepted as the next World Bank president," said Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and former head of the China division at the IMF. "Even if Malpass is unlikely to receive resounding endorsements from traditional U.S. allies, it appears that no country wants to take on the Trump administration frontally and challenge its presumptive nominee at this stage."

In the nearly 75 years since the World Bank and IMF came into existence, emerging market countries have grown rapidly. But despite many expressing a desire to appoint people of other nationalities to the leadership, these countries have struggled to agree on candidates.

"The emerging markets... have had a hard time really finding cohesion and having the willingness to put forward a forceful, unified position," said Mark Sobel, a former U.S. Treasury official who is now the U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based financial think tank.

The emerging-market economies have few unifying interests to rally around. Some, like Argentina and Turkey, are relatively wealthy but have faced recent currency crises; China is in the midst of tense trade negotiations with the U.S. and an economic slowdown; Brazil has just had an abrupt change in its presidency, swinging control from left to right; and India is enjoying some of the world's fastest growth amid looming elections.

In his role as Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Mr. Malpass has been a critic of the World Bank, particularly over its lending to China. But he also has worked closely with World Bank officials. He is said to have a good working relationship with Kristalina Georgieva, the bank's chief executive officer who became acting president earlier this month.

A senior administration official said that Mr. Malpass's nomination is meant to signal a focus on more economic growth in the developing world. Despite some of Mr. Malpass's critical statements about the World bank, the official said Mr. Malpass was instrumental in pushing through a capital increase for the World Bank in 2018, which U.S. officials supported.

"He knows the institution because he's been working with the World Bank in his job at Treasury, and knows how it works," said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to the Trump campaign and an economist at the Heritage Foundation who is a longtime friend of Mr. Malpass.

"I think the change he'll bring will be not radical, but gradual," said Mr. Moore, who said Mr. Malpass would bring a "supply-side, pro-growth, pro-tax cut vision to the World Bank."

Such a focus from Mr. Malpass wouldn't be at odds with all the World Bank's work. One of the bank's flagship economic reports is its "Doing Business" rankings, which pressure companies to improve their business environments and lessen regulatory burdens to free enterprise.

Goldman Plans Cuts in Commodities Trading as New CEO Digs In

By Liz Hoffman

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is planning to cut back its commodities-trading arm, once a huge moneymaker and training ground for a generation of executives including former chief Lloyd Blankfein.

The retreat follows a monthslong review under new Chief Executive David Solomon that showed the commodities business's dwindling profits don't justify its costs, according to people familiar with the matter. Executives are discussing pulling back from trading iron ore, platinum and other metals, and are ordering cost cuts to the sprawling logistics network that handles the transport and storage of physical commodities.

By taking a knife to the business, Mr. Solomon is sending a message down the ranks that nothing is sacred. Executives have been conducting in-depth reviews of each business, looking for more profitable ways to spend shareholders' money. They are expected to present their plans to the bank's board of directors later this month and brief investors this spring.

Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr last month said there was an "active and engaged move to reallocate capital" away from Goldman's troubled fixed-income-trading arm and toward priorities including lending and technology upgrades.

A Goldman spokesman said the firm hadn't reached any final conclusions related to its business reviews.

The pullback in commodities is as symbolic as it is strategic. Goldman has been a major player in commodities since its 1981 takeover of J. Aron & Co., a coffee and metals trader. Wildly profitable in the 1990s and early 2000s, J. Aron produced a bloodline of executives who would later run the firm, including Mr. Blankfein and Gary Cohn.

That dynasty ended last year with the rise of Mr. Solomon and his lieutenants, investment bankers who are less emotionally wedded to the trading business. "Lloyd Blankfein was never going to abandon" the commodities business, said Charles Peabody, a stock analyst at Portales Partners.

Investors don't value volatile trading operations as highly as they once did, preferring more predictable revenues from lending and asset management. Goldman is pushing into consumer lending and corporate cash management and said in January that more than 60% of its revenue now comes from more-recurring sources, up from 48% five years ago.

Commodities trading, meanwhile, is in decline. In 2017, Goldman's traders had their worst year on record. They fared somewhat better in 2018, but executives believe the business is unlikely to repeat its heyday of the 2000s, when it contributed as much as 15% of Goldman's pretax profits.

Since then, tighter regulations have driven most banks from the business. Morgan Stanley sold a fleet of oil tankers and scaled back its energy trading. JPMorgan Chase & Co. quit most physical trading altogether. Banks' commodities-trading revenues fell from $8.3 billion in 2011 to $2.5 billion in 2017, according to data firm Coalition, as the business migrated to less-regulated firms such as Glencore PLC.

Goldman, through its J. Aron subsidiary, largely stayed put, a move that many onlookers attributed to Mr. Blankfein's fondness for the business and belief in its eventual rebound.

Goldman is one of the country's biggest natural-gas marketers and a major player in power and oil. It is building a green-energy solutions business for corporate clients while dipping its toe into the nascent market for liquefied natural gas.

But traders have been handcuffed. Risk-taking by one measure the amount of money its commodities traders stood to lose on a given day is down by 60% since 2010. A hiring spree in 2017 meant to bring in star traders failed to spark a turnaround, and the firm's co-head of commodities, Jeremy Taylor, recently left.

A Crypto-Mystery: Is $140 Million Stuck or Missing?

By Paul Vigna

A Canadian cryptocurrency exchange says about $140 million worth of customers' holdings are stuck in an electronic vault because the company's founder, and sole employee, died without sharing the password.

But two independent researchers say publicly available transaction records associated with QuadrigaCX suggest the money may be gone, not trapped.

They say it appears Quadriga transferred customer funds to other cryptocurrency exchanges, although it isn't clear what might have happened to the money from there.

Their research is the latest twist in what is shaping up to be a bizarre case, even within the often murky and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies.

Gerald Cotten launched Quadriga in December 2013. The exchange claimed to be one of the largest in Canada, allowing customers to trade a handful of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether.

On Jan. 15, the company announced on its website that Mr. Cotten had died on Dec. 9 from complications related to Crohn's disease while building an orphanage in India. He was 30 years old. Two weeks later, the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in a Nova Scotia court.

Quadriga said its customers have accounts with a total balance of about C$250 million. Only about C$70 million of those customer funds is in cash. About C$180 million, or about $140 million, is in cryptocurrencies held in a reserve account maintained on Mr. Cotten's laptop, the company said in its bankruptcy filing. Quadriga would need control of that account to send those cryptocurrency funds to customers.

Mr. Cotten ran the business out of his home in Fall River, Nova Scotia, his widow, Jennifer Robertson, stated in an affidavit. Ms. Robertson said Mr. Cotten was the only person who moved funds from an active account called a "hot wallet" in crypto circles because it is connected to the internet to the reserve account, which is an offline "cold wallet." The company said it has been unable to break into Mr. Cotten's laptop to try to recover the access keys.

If the laptop can't be accessed, the funds could be permanently frozen. On Tuesday, a judge in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia granted the company a 30-day stay of proceedings as it tries to untangle its finances.

There are no standards or regulations in the cryptocurrency world that would prevent a situation such as at Quadriga, where one person runs an exchange that handles millions of dollars in virtual currencies using a laptop computer, and has sole access to crucial passwords.

Some cryptocurrency specialists aren't waiting for Quadriga to figure things out. James Edwards, a cryptocurrency analyst who publishes research on a website called Zerononcense, said he reviewed the exchange's claims based on an examination of publicly available transaction histories.

He says he found no evidence that Quadriga controlled any wallets that held the large amounts the company claims. "It appears that there are no identifiable cold wallet reserves for QuadrigaCX," he wrote in a report. Quadriga didn't respond to a request for comment.

The analysis Mr. Edwards performed is possible because bitcoin and other virtual currencies have publicly available digital records that allow anybody to trace the entire transaction history of a specific currency. This type of forensic analysis has become more common over the past few years in the cryptocurrency world.

Mr. Edwards collected information from more than 50 Quadriga clients and then performed an analysis of those transactions, drawing a picture of Quadriga's money flows. Transactions from the customers to Quadriga revealed the existence of its active accounts. But Mr. Edwards couldn't find any transactions going to the kinds of reserve accounts Quadriga says it has.

If the reserve accounts existed, Mr. Edwards said, then at some point transactions either to or from the active accounts should have appeared.

"None of the withdrawal addresses provided by customers led to a wallet that could be considered anything comparable to a  reserve' wallet," Mr. Edwards wrote. Mr. Edwards told The Wall Street Journal there was evidence wallets once existed that had larger balances, but those balances were currently much lower. The largest wallet currently, he said, appeared to be the hot wallet, or the one used for transactional purposes.

The exchange appeared to be satisfying withdrawal requests from the hot wallet, he said, but only after enough new deposits came in from other customers to cover the withdrawals.

Mr. Edwards focused mostly on Quadriga's bitcoin holdings. Another analytics firm, Elementus Group, traced the exchange's ether holdings, and came to the same conclusion.

"It is extremely likely that there aren't any cold wallets," CEO Max Galka told the Journal. Most of the funds appeared to be going out to other exchanges, he said, including Bitfinex, Poloniex, and ShapeShift.

Poloniex said it identified accounts that could be related to Quadriga, and is working with appropriate authorities. Bitfinex did not immediately reply to a request for comment. ShapeShift declined to comment.

Jesse Powell, the CEO of online exchange Kraken, also doubted Quadriga's claims. He said on Twitter Sunday that his exchange had wallets known to belong to Quadriga and was investigating the "bizarre" story. He suggested the Royal Canadian Mounted Police contact him. Mr. Powell declined to comment.

The researchers' analysis isn't conclusive, though. "In my opinion, that's an impossibility to determine," said David Jevans, the CEO of CipherTrace, another firm that does analytics in the sector. It is possible Quadriga had a number of accounts that served as cold wallets, rather than one, which wouldn't have shown up in the searches of Mr. Edwards and others. "It very well could be they took the money, moved it out to the cold wallets, and tragedy happened," he said.

While those suspicious of Quadriga acknowledge the public transactions don't provide certainty, some say there is a way to determine if the exchange's money is indeed trapped. A crypto developer named Amaury Sechet suggested Quadriga should publish the addresses of the cold wallets. This would allow anyone to see how much cryptocurrency is in them, even if they couldn't access it.

Poloniex said it identified accounts that could be related to Quadriga, and is working with appropriate authorities. Bitfinex did not immediately reply to a request for comment. ShapeShift declined to comment.

"Over time trust will build as the coins remains (sic) untouched," he wrote on Twitter. "If they cannot do this, their story is not credible."

Stop Worrying About the Fed's Balance Sheet

Former New York Fed President William Dudley says he is "amazed and baffled" by investors' preoccupation with the U.S. central bank's plans for its balance sheet. "It gets much more attention than it deserves," he says in a Bloomberg column. "Any new nuance of policy such as last week's statement on  balance sheet normalization' is seen as a really big deal," he adds. But what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at his Jan. 30 press conference didn't reflect much of a change at all. "The bottom line," Mr. Dudley says, is the "Fed's balance sheet isn't the threat that market participants sometimes make it out to be, and last week's announcements do not have significant implications for the interest rate outlook. Market participants would be better off focusing on the economic outlook. This is what will drive monetary policy and the Fed's decisions about the appropriate trajectory for short-term interest rates over the next year. If the outlook changes, so will the Fed's thinking."

Banks pile in to UK aggregation play

Your essential weekly fintech briefing

London-based financial technology platformBudhad an embarrassment of riches last week when it announced a $20m fundraising round supported by no fewer than five of the world s biggest banks.

HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Banco Sabadell, Investec and ANZ, plus other high-profile investors including former Man Group CEO Lord Stanley Fink, all signed on the dotted line to help develop Bud's marketplace banking project that's as expansive as its list of backers.

After initially helping customersaggregateinformation from several different financial providers, Bud is now building a platform that also lets people compare and switch between services or get recommendations for new ones like robo-advice.

Theirsis not brand new ground; aggregators likeMintand Tink are already making waves in the US and continental Europe, while in the UK Starling Bank customers can use their app to get investment advice, take out a mortgage or manage retail reward points via third parties.

While some in the financial industry are sceptical about how much mileage there is in operating solely as a marketplace, the major players clearly see potential in the space.

Bud co-founder Ed Maslaveckas said that for  all the banks that are investing - it s a financial investment yes, but there s also a commercial alignment . Bud has been working with HSBC since 2017and is hoping to work on more projects with its new investors.

 They re asking what kind of service will banks need to offer to remain relevant? That s a big mindset shift for some of these very traditional institutions - thinking  we need to get into a services business rather than just a product business ,  Mr Maslaveckas added.

Open Banking - the UK regulatory regime introduced last year to facilitate the sort of data sharing used by Bud - has been criticised for the relatively slow take-up from customers.

Supporters say the slow progress was inevitable, given the technical challenges involved in creating new services, and that a key tipping point for adoption will be when customers can feel a tangible benefit in their finances.

A case in point, they say, is the example of current account switching. Despite the influx of new providers in recent years, the most popular banks each quarter are almost always those offering the biggest cash bonus for new customers.

The UK s switching service also highlights the potential limits of customer interest. According to the latestdatareleased last week, around 930,000 customers switched in 2018 - barely 1 per cent of the country s 73m current accounts. 

A senior executive at a major bank that hasn t worked with Bud said that similar marketplace features  are on everyone s build lists , but struck a note of caution.

 In terms of functionality, letting people manage their money better, it s all brilliant, they said.  That functionality is definitely coming. I just don t know if people are interested enough in their financial affairs to do it - bankers talking to bankers can get very excited about this sort of thing, but this is an industry powered by inertia. 

One to watch: Pepper

Israeli fintech Pepper's plan tolauncha US online bank is progressing at pace,writes Laura Noonan. Pepper's CEO Hanna Schindler tells #fintechFT that her team has whittled down its potential US partners to a shortlist of threebanks with balance sheets of between $20bn and $200bn. A final decision on a partner will be made within two months, she says, which should clear the way for a launch later this year.

Pepper's parent, IsraeliBank Leumi, already has a licence in the US. Pepper could operate under that, but instead wants to create a joint venture with an established US bank that will bring a big brand and client base to complement Pepper's online capabilities. Ms Schlindler says ideally Pepper would be a 20 per cent shareholder in the joint venture.

Many online banks dip their toes into the market with a bare bones offering of deposits and limited lending, butPepper wants to start life in the US offering most of what it does in Israel. "We'll have checking accounts, deposits, loans, credit cards, debit cards, cheques, money transfer," says Ms Schlindler, stressing that Pepper isn't "starting from scratch" since it has already built the functionality for its Israeli bank.

Full-service has worked well for Pepper so far in Israel, where the online arm that Bank Leumi created to "disrupt from the inside"now opens more accounts every day than its parent bank does with its 250 bricks-and-mortar branches. High fees and a massive online-savvypopulation make the US an attractive market, but it's becoming a crowded one toowith the online banks of Barclays and Marcus by Goldman Sachs.

Further fintech fascination

Trend watch:A free-market approach by Malaysia's central bank has left the country with a whopping 49  and counting  e-wallets that its 32minhabitants can choose from to make payments. But sometimes less is more. Experts are forecasting a major shake-out, with one private equity fund boss predicting that as many as 95 per cent of the wallets could bite the dust. A salutary tale for all those firms out there that think they'll be the next big thing in payments.

Blockchain:Cobalt, ablockchain currency start-up,has won new investment from data and analytics company IHS Markit. IHS is paying an undisclosed sum for a stake in the four-year-old venture founded by former Citi banker Andy Coyne and ex-trader Adrian Patten. "For too long, FX has been burdened by an ageing, inefficient post-trade environment,  said Mr Patten. If we were to start building out connections to the market it would take years and years. Being able to plug into the [Markit] network means that we can get clients on board quicker and we can show significant cost savings to clients in year one. 

Stumbling blocks:German mobile payments firm Wirecard has had a tough few days, after the FT reported that a senior executive was suspended last year for potentially using forged and backdated contracts in a string of suspicious transactions. Wirecard'sshares fell 35 per cent on Germany's Dax index after the story, despite the German company's insistence that the claims were "inaccurate, misleading and defamatory". The FT subsequently reported that an external law firm commissioned by the firm to investigate Wirecard's Singapore officehad found evidence of  serious offences of forgery and/or of falsification of accounts".

Chief Artificial Intelligence  Officers Enter the C-Suite; Having a senior AI specialist may help businesses deploy the technology, but not everyone is convinced

Corrections & Amplifications

Tomi Poutanen, TD Bank's co-chief artificial intelligence officer, said the bank can predict customers who are in the process of buying a home. In an earlier version of this article, Mr. Poutanen misspoke when he said the bank can predict customers in the process of building a home. (Jan. 29, 2019)

A handful of companies have introduced the new role of chief artificial intelligence officer to help take their use of the technology beyond the pilot stage.

Companies that have hired AI chiefs, including Cambia Health Solutions Inc . and Toronto-Dominion Bank Group, say these executives are working across organizations and spotting new areas where AI can improve the business. They say their AI chiefs are setting strategies, coordinating projects, and recruiting sought-after data scientists and other AI experts.

"It's important for a chief AI officer to be at the table when discussing what the future looks like," said Tomi Poutanen, who, along with Jordan Jacobs, serves as a TD Bank co-chief artificial intelligence officer.

Still, a number of information technology experts argue against creating such a position. They believe a CAIO will look to deploy the technology in places where it isn't needed. Some, such as Gartner Inc. analyst Whit Andrews, said there are better ways to manage AI efforts.

Mr. Andrews said a chief data officer, often responsible for a business's data management and analytics activities, could lead a company's AI initiatives. Companies could also establish a steering committee consisting of key stakeholders and AI experts to guide strategy and decision making, he said.

"What organizational benefit will they achieve by appointing a CAIO?" Mr. Andrews asked.

Mr. Poutanen leads a team that works with the bank's business units on AI implementations, validating data, checking for bias in algorithmic models and ensuring AI applications can stand up to regulatory scrutiny. But he also spends time with TD Bank executives exploring ways AI can remake the bank.

"Everyone expects AI to be the most transformative technology of our generation. It's going to completely change how our business operates," he said. "The role I play, the role of a chief AI officer, is one of disruption."

TD Bank appointed Mr. Poutanen and Mr. Jacobs co-CAIOs in January 2018 after it bought Layer 6 Inc., an AI software company the two founded, for an undisclosed sum. Layer 6, which currently operates as a TD Bank Group -owned company, builds predictive models that can be used to recommend products and services.

Reporting to Michael Rhodes , TD's head of innovation, technology and shared services, Mr. Poutanen and Mr. Jacobs lead an AI group of 30 members, most of whom are data scientists.

The prediction business

Among the team's recent activities has been the development of a predictive AI application for the mortgage business. They built a model that analyzes credit bureau data, account and transaction data, demographic information and other sources to spot banking clients who are thinking of buying a home. Once identified, a TD representative will reach out to the person to discuss next steps or begin the loan process.

"We can, very early on, predict which customers might be in the process of buying a home rather than just waiting at the branch for them to show up with a mortgage application in their hand," he said.

Cambia Health named Faraz Shafiq as its chief artificial intelligence officer in September 2018 and tasked him with leading its data science and AI efforts. Before joining Cambia, a family of health-related companies that includes regional health plans serving 2.2 million people in the Pacific Northwest, Shafiq had been the global head of artificial intelligence, data science, and internet-of-things projects at Verizon Communications Inc .

Mr. Shafiq, who reports to Cambia's chief operating officer Jared Short, leads a team of 100 data science, engineering and analytics professionals. His group has developed a tool called Nurse Insights that uses a model to forecast a patient's future health by helping predict whether a person with diabetes might develop coronary artery disease, for example.

However, finding AI talent to create these new products and services is an obstacle for most businesses. More than one-third of organizations have implemented AI in some form, according to numbers released this month by Gartner, and AI experts are scarce.

This is where businesses with CAIOs can differentiate themselves. Cambia's Mr. Shafiq and TD Bank's Mr. Poutanen said organizations with a CAIO are in a better position to attract staff than those without a C-level AI executive.

AI experts are drawn to places with a dedicated, centralized artificial intelligence resource, where they can work with peers and share in a common mission, said Mr. Poutanen. "In the marketplace for AI, there is a demand-supply imbalance for talented individuals. So it's very important to have a strong leader that can attract talent," he said.

Databricks Makes  Boring AI' Useful for Businesses; Andreessen Horowitz leads new funding round, with Microsoft and others, to help companies use data and AI to improve their businesses

Many companies want to use artificial intelligence and analytics to improve their business, but they get frustrated because so much data resides in separate silos.

Databricks Inc. says its cloud-based technology solves the problem for thousands of corporations such as printer-maker HP Inc., engineering company Bechtel Corp. and oil-and-gas company Royal Dutch Shell PLC.

On massive construction projects, Bechtel has been using Databricks to analyze each step of the process to develop changes to the project timeline and speed up construction, said Ali Ghodsi, chief executive and co-founder of Databricks.

He said another customer, Capital One Financial Corp., uses the technology to analyze customer data and increase spending limits for some customers, increasing the company's revenue.

But few companies outside of Alphabet Inc.'s Google have the capacity to build this technology internally, said Mr. Ghodsi.

"The reality is, what enterprises need is boring AI," Mr. Ghodsi said. "It applies to every company on the planet."

Other big companies that offer cloud-based analytics include Cloudera Inc., Hortonworks Inc. and MapR Technologies Inc. San Francisco-based Databricks achieved an annual recurring revenue run rate last year of $100 million, according to Mr. Ghodsi, so if it stayed above that mark this year it would have more than $100 million in revenue.

Databricks has also raised $250 million in new Series E funding, which values the company at $2.75 billion. WSJ Pro previously reported on the company's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/databricks-seeks-2-5-billion-valuation-11547756176".

Existing investor Andreessen Horowitz led the new round, with participation from new investors Coatue Management and strategic investor Microsoft Corp., as well as existing investors including New Enterprise Associates and Battery Ventures.

US fund house seeks to save $110m over 3 years

US fund houseLegg Mason has outlined a sweeping cost-cutting plan to save up to $110m over three years as pressures on the asset management sector build.

The $727bn fund manager will streamline functions across its investment affiliates, including Western Asset, its $429bn fixed income shop.

The new operating platform will centralise a host of tasks including operations, technology, fund administration. Legal and compliance, human resources, finance and real estate will also fall on to the new platform, Joe Sullivan, chief executive, said on a Monday earnings call.

 To be clear, we are not just making short-term cost cuts in response to a challenging market. Rather, we are creating permanent, structural changes that will result in greater effectiveness and enduring efficiencies,  Mr Sullivan said.

Mr Sullivan said Legg Mason will also use emerging technologies to help cut costs. This will include robotic technology to support its accounts payable functions and artificial intelligence to boost its cyber security efforts. In addition, the fund manager will use machine learning to help disseminate its market commentary.

The move to consolidate functions will include a headcount reduction, although Legg Mason did not state how many staff would lose their jobs. A separate series of lay-offs will occur at one of the fund manager s affiliates, Peter Nachtwey, chief financial officer for Legg Mason, stated on the earnings call. He did not detail how many jobs would be lost.

The cost-cutting plan comes as the Legg Mason posted a net loss of $217m for the quarter ending in December. The fund manager lost $8.5bn in net outflows for the period.

Legg Mason s overall assets under management slipped 4 per cent for the quarter from $755bn to $727bn, in part due to the tumultuous December in US equity markets.

Asset managers are facing a series of intense cyclical and secular pressures that are dragging on revenues.

The shift from high-fee  active  investment strategies to low-cost  passive  funds that track broad indices has bitten into fund managers  profits.

In January alone investors pulled $160bn from actively managed global equity funds, the worst month of outflows on record, according to EPFR Global, the data provider.

Legg Mason s results come after a bruising series of earnings reports from peer fund managers T Rowe Price, Franklin Templeton and Invesco, which all failed to meet analyst earnings expectations.

Sequoia to make earlier and bigger bets in China

Technology. Venture capital Country's most successful venture capitalist seeks to take on SoftBank's Vision Fund

Neil Shen, China's most successful venture capitalist, is refining a twinpronged approach as he invests in the country's next generation of tech companies.

Sequoia China, which the 51-year-old Mr Shen has led for more than a decade, will increase its firepower through a new $8bn global growth fund, raised in a matter of months and with a large share of investment from China, as it tries to compete with the deep pockets of other investors, notably Softbank's Vision Fund. The financial strength of the Vision Fund was underlined again on Friday, when it emerged that it was in talks over a possible $1.5bn investment in the Chinese used car sales site Guazi.

At the same time, Sequoia China has raised a small $150m fund specifically to make very early calls on Chinese startups, either offering them seed funding or Series A investments.

"We never want to miss a trend," said Mr Shen in an interview, adding that it was essential to catch companies "early on". At the same time, he said he wanted to be able to stay with companies as they grow through their funding rounds without being displaced by other investors. "For Sequoia, what matters is to be first and to be the most important investor. You have to lead each round," he said. "And today you can't lead with $10m or even $100m sometimes.

"Why should I let other investors have the upside in companies I have invested in when there is still so much appreciation?" he added. "Today, you need bigger amounts to stay in the game. We worry that we have been too conservative."

He said the trend for tech companies to remain private for longer would continue. "There will be many private companies worth between $5bn and $50bn in the next five to ten years," he added.

It took just five years, from 2012 to 2017, for the amount of money flowing into venture capital funds in China to rise from $5bn to $65bn, according to Credit Suisse, while half of the 180 or so Chinese tech companies priced at over $1bn reached that valuation in two years or less, compared with the nine years that is typical in the US.

Sequoia entered the Chinese market in 2005 and has become the country's leading blue-chip VC, while Mr Shen is tipped by some to become co-head of the firm worldwide.

Doug Leone, global managing partner, said the firm had bet on Mr Shen, formerly the chief financial officer of the travel firm Ctrip, and given the China team autonomy.

"We would rather take a calculated risk on Neil, someone who seemed capable but was an unproven professional investor, because we were sure that we in the US would not be effective at investing in China," Mr Leone said.

To date, Sequoia China's success has rested on a number of huge consumer internet companies, notably JD.com, the e-commerce site, Meituan Dianping, the food delivery to ticketing site, and ByteDance, which owns the Toutiao news app.

Sequoia invested $34.6m in Byte-Dance in 2014. Last June, the stake was valued at $885m, according to information Sequoia sent investors. That was before a capital raise that valued the company at $80bn.

In the case of Meituan, Sequoia was also part of every funding round from the beginning in 2011 and Mr Shen retains a seat on its board   a factor many investors cited when they took part in the company's listing in Hong Kong in September. "I watched Xing Wang for years," Mr Shen said of Meituan's founder. "We didn't care that he wasn't the largest in the early stages."

Several analysts and people familiar with Sequoia said it ultimately expects to make more of a return on Meituan than it did from Google. But Meituan has been waging a fierce war against a rival food delivery service, Ele.me, backed by Alibaba, and its share price has fallen nearly 40 per cent since it went public.

Other Sequoia-backed companies to IPO last year included Pinduoduo, the e-commerce site, which has seen its shares flatline since launching on Nasdaq in the summer and NIO, the electric car company, whose share price has dropped a third since its September IPO.

The poor performance of Chinese tech stocks has put pressure on private investors, and there is potentially more trouble ahead as the economy cools and Beijing presses for lower levels of debt. Bubbles in the valuations of companies, particularly in artificial intelligence, are starting to lose air. There are also fears that tech companies face greater regulation and scrutiny from Beijing.

The correction in valuations also reflects the SoftBank effect in which large pools of capital drove prices to unsustainable levels   sparking a frenzy in sectors such as artificial intelligence.

"China has never before seen a downturn in tech," said Mr Shen. "Some investors have bet that China would never have this kind of dip."

Nevertheless, he retains his confidence that China's AI companies will have the advantage of the huge data pool created by its 1.4bn people. Sequoia's smaller fund has invested in a number of AI start-ups, as well as life sciences and biotech start-ups that use big data to diagnose illness sooner and find more effective treatments.

A glance at Sequoia China's existing funds shows how the firm has spread its bets, with few investments larger than $50m, according to documents sent to investors, and many under $1m.

Medtech is important to Sequoia on both sides of the Pacific but its China investments and local team are larger than in Silicon Valley.

One investment went into 4Paradigm, which sells machine learning programs. The company closed its Series C funding round in December, raising roughly $145m at a valuation of $1.2bn and attracting funding from several Chinese state banks. Dai Wenyuan was backed by Mr Shen when he left Baidu to found the start-up, which is working with Ruijin hospital in Shanghai to comb through data from kidney diseases. Mr Shen is a donor and a partner of the hospital.

"Entrepreneurs should not automatically choose the investors that offer the highest valuation," said Mr Shen. "There is additional value beyond the money. Also, an investor like Sequoia can invest in multiple rounds including at times when the funding environment is tough."

Why the Fed Made a U-Turn; Jobs Report Won't Change Fed Stance; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Monday, Feb. 4, 2019

Good Day. The Federal Reserve has stepped away from further rate increases even as the U.S. economy remains solid. But rising threats to the growth outlook prompted officials to make the policy about-face. A sign of continued economic strength came Friday with a robust January jobs report. But in a world where the Fed's pledge to be patient on the monetary policy front, even gangbusters jobs data doesn't put prospects of a Fed rate rise back in play. To that end, Dallas Fed leader Robert Kaplan said he isn't ready to think about a rate rise until early summer.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Why the Fed Made a U-Turn: Perceived Risks to Growth Shifted

The Fed "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-fed-made-a-u-turn-perceived-risks-to-growth-shifted-11549108800" last week when it put interest rate rises on hold, prompted by rising risks to U.S. growth in the months ahead, rather than any signs the economy's health is faltering now. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Wednesday the central bank will move to the sidelines to see whether the threats including from the slowing global economy, trade tensions and the effect of the Fed's rate increases over the last two years generate a sharper-than-anticipated slowdown for a U.S. economy that continues to look solid by most measures.

Analysis: Jobs Report Won't Change Fed's New Wait-and-See Stance

The strong January employment report "https://www.wsj.com/articles/january-jobs-report-wont-change-the-feds-new-wait-and-see-stance-11549035279"for Fed officials who are trying to gauge how the U.S. economy weathered increased market volatility and slowing global growth at the end of last year. But it will take more than one solid employment report for them to move again.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/during-shutdown-federal-employees-considered-leaving-government-work-11549038667"

Kaplan: Fed Likely on Pause Until at Least Summer

Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-fed-likely-on-pause-until-at-least-summer-11549040516" on rate increases until at least the summer. "It's very important for the Fed to get out of the way" and let uncertainties around the economy resolve themselves before weighing changes in monetary policy, Mr. Kaplan said.

Cain Says He Would Be Honored to Be Considered for Fed Job

Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain "https://www.wsj.com/articles/herman-cain-says-he-would-be-honored-to-be-considered-for-fed-job-11549050747" to be considered by President Trump for a Federal Reserve job, though a White House official said Mr. Cain's candidacy for the central-bank board is "not serious."

Consumer Sentiment Hits Lowest Level in More Than Two Years

Household sentiment in the U.S. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-sentiment-faltered-at-the-start-of-2019-11549036081", as the partial government shutdown and uncertain economic prospects weighed on consumers.

1MDB Scandal Could Hit Pay for Goldman Execs, Including Lloyd Blankfein

By Liz Hoffman

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS could withhold millions of dollars in pay from former chief Lloyd Blankfein because of the scandal around a corrupt Malaysian investment fund, the bank said Friday.

Goldman's board of directors won't for now pay out deferred bonuses that Mr. Blankfein and two other former top executives earned in prior years, and will instead await the outcome of an investigation into Goldman's work for the Malaysian fund, known as 1MDB. The bank said it might also claw back some of the $23 million it paid new Chief Executive David Solomon in 2018.

By hitting executive pay Wall Street's most obvious tool to reward and punish the moves are the clearest sign yet that Goldman sees potentially serious consequences in the 1MDB investigation. The bank faces a large fine and a reputational black eye it can ill afford as it courts retail customers and invests heavily in new businesses.

In recent months, Goldman has been laying out its case to regulators in an effort to avoid criminal charges, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Goldman raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB, of which prosecutors allege $2.7 billion was stolen by a Malaysian financier and two former Goldman bankers. One of those bankers, Tim Leissner, has pleaded guilty to stealing some $200 million and arranging bribes for government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. He hasn't commented.

The federal indictments darkened Mr. Blankfein's farewell tour and complicated the early tenure of Mr. Solomon, who took over Oct. 1 as chief executive.

Overall Mr. Blankfein earned $20.5 million in 2018, down from $24 million a year earlier, according to Friday's filing. That figure isn't affected by the potential clawback, which stems from a deferred cash grant he received in 2011 that was to be paid out this past January.

Goldman is temporarily withholding that award, which was originally granted at $7 million. The size of the ultimate payout was tied to Goldman's performance over the past eight years. The value has roughly doubled, according to a Wall Street Journal review of filings.

The bank also said it was withholding similar bonuses owed to two unnamed former executives. They are, according to a person familiar with the matter, Michael Evans, who was a senior Goldman executive at the time of the 1MDB bond sales, and Michael Sherwood, a senior executive in London who retired in 2016.

Former executive Gary Cohn also got those bonuses, but was compensated in a lump sum when he joined the Trump administration in 2017.

Mr. Solomon wasn't senior enough in 2011 to receive that particular bonus. But the bank said Friday it might later claw back some of his 2018 pay and that of other senior executives, a group likely to include President John Waldron and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr. Mr. Solomon was paid $23 million in 2018 for three months as CEO and nine months as chief operating officer. The biggest chunk, $15.4 million, is in stock units that pay out based on Goldman's performance over the next few years.

Pay for Wall Street executives, which fell sharply after the financial crisis, has crept up as banks' results have steadily improved. The highest-paid bank CEO is JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s James Dimon, who made $31 million last year, followed by Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, who earned $29 million. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. haven't yet disclosed their CEOs' compensation for 2018.

The Justice Department charged two former Goldman bankers in November. The next month, Malaysia lodged criminal charges against Goldman, and its attorney general said he would seek a fine well above the $2.7 billion allegedly stolen.

Investigators Expected to Probe Deutsche Efforts to Shed Loan to Russian Bank

By Jenny Strasburg, Rebecca Ballhaus and Dustin Volz

Congressional investigators expect the House Financial Services Committee to examine Deutsche Bank AG's efforts after the 2016 election to shed a loan it made to VTB Group, a large Russian state-owned bank.

The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Deutsche Bank, seeking to slash its exposure to Russia in late 2016, scrambled to sell a $600 million loan it had outstanding to VTB, according to documents and people familiar with the funding.

The German lender sold $300 million of the loan to Russia's Alfa Bank, in December 2016; Deutsche Bank wasn't able to sell the rest of the loan, and VTB paid it back in August 2017, the documents show and the people said.

Deutsche Bank's effort to unload the VTB loan which hadn't been previously reported came as the German bank worried about its financial contacts with Russia, which U.S. intelligence officials accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election while the campaign was still under way. The bank sought to reduce as much exposure as possible to Russian entities and was shedding assets to boost its own cash position.

Deutsche Bank considered the VTB financing standard bank-to-bank funding, provided to VTB in U.S. dollars, according to the people familiar with the funding. VTB said in a statement to the Journal that the loan "was intended for the purposes of VTB's treasury business activities."

On Jan. 6, 2017, the U.S. intelligence community formally accused the Russian government of interfering in the U.S. election on behalf of Republican candidate Donald Trump, a longtime client of Deutsche Bank.

In March 2016, Deutsche Bank rebuffed a request from the Trump Organization to expand by several million dollars a loan to Trump National Doral, one of Mr. Trump's Florida golf properties, according to other people familiar with this matter, based partly on concerns within the bank about whether it had enough information about the ultimate use of the funding. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the rebuff.

The House Intelligence Committee and House Financial Services Committee, which are controlled by Democrats, are investigating Deutsche Bank's financial dealings as part of a broader effort to scrutinize any Trump associates' ties to Russia.

Some House investigators on panels beyond the Financial Services Committee are also interested in probing whether the VTB loan and Trump-loan rebuff may be relevant to their ongoing inquiries into Mr. Trump's finances, a person familiar with the Democratic investigations said.

A Financial Services Committee spokeswoman declined to comment on Sunday. Deutsche Bank already has received information requests from both committees. A bank spokeswoman said Sunday the bank has a "productive dialogue" with the committees and is "committed to providing appropriate information."

Deutsche Bank's relationship with Mr. Trump goes back decades. Since 1998, the bank has led or participated in loans of at least $2.5 billion to companies affiliated with Mr. Trump, the Journal has previously reported.

Public disclosures during his candidacy showed borrowings from Deutsche Bank of more than $300 million by entities affiliated with Mr. Trump.

The long-term loan to VTB first originated by Deutsche Bank in 2007 at around $1 billion and restructured in 2009 gave the Russian bank leeway to use the funding as it wished, according to people familiar with the terms and bank records. As is customary in such wholesale financing, no specific purpose of the loan was earmarked on Deutsche Bank documents, according to the bank records and people familiar with the terms.

VTB's financial dealings have been under the spotlight. Felix Sater, a longtime Trump business partner, repeatedly told Mr. Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen during the 2016 campaign that he had received assurances from Russian business associates with ties to the government that VTB was willing to finance a deal for a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to people familiar with the discussions.

"No VTB Group subsidiary ever had any dealings with Mr. Trump, his representatives, or any companies affiliated with him," VTB said in its statement. Though Mr. Trump signed a letter of intent with a Russian real-estate development firm in October 2015, the proposal never went ahead.

VTB is Russia's second-largest bank and is majority-owned by the Russian government. Senior VTB executives have close ties with Mr. Putin, recently working together on a plan to wean Russia off U.S. dollars to counter damage to the Russian economy from Western sanctions.

The head of VTB, Andrey Kostin, has defended Mr. Putin's government and criticized sanctions against Russia. He joined VTB in 2002 and is president and chairman of its management board.

Deutsche Bank and VTB have worked together frequently in the past, collaborating on deals and swapping employees.

The unsecured VTB loans originated in 2007 and 2008 deals, when Deutsche Bank extended long-term loans totaling about $1 billion to VTB, according to the documents and people familiar with the matter. Those were restructured in 2009 into a single $790 million loan, the deal records show and people close to the bank said.

In 2014, VTB was hit with U.S. and European economic sanctions that limited the bank's ability to get new financing from banks in the U.S. and Europe.

The German lender did manage to sell about $150 million of the VTB financing in 2014 to a bank in India, leaving more than half a billion dollars still on its books, according to the records and people close the bank.

When Deutsche Bank agreed to sell about $300 million of the VTB loan to Alfa Bank in December 2016, it suffered a net loss on the transaction, the people said.

A separate effort by Deutsche Bank to sell about $280 million of the VTB loan to Citigroup Inc , fell through, according to people familiar with the matter.

VIX Auction Bets Land Chicago Trader With $1.3 Million Fine

By Gunjan Banerji

Cboe Global Markets Inc. CBOE 0.84% fined a trading firm for trying to include improper options trades in an auction tied to its marquee product: the VIX volatility gauge.

The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, tracks investor expectations for future turbulence in the stock market by using S&P 500 options prices.

Last year, questions escalated over whether a monthly auction tied to the VIX was being manipulated by traders. Cboe's shares have tumbled about 31% over the past 12 months.

On Friday, Cboe said in a disciplinary filing that Akuna Securities LLC submitted S&P 500 option orders to increase the likelihood that certain derivatives bets would be included in the auction that helps determine final VIX settlement values. Akuna didn't admit or deny violating Cboe's rules and agreed to pay a $1.3 million fine, according to the filing.

The firm wasn't fined for manipulation, a Cboe spokeswoman said in a statement.

Chicago-based Akuna is a derivatives trading firm dealing in options on commodities, stocks, cryptocurriencies and other assets. A spokeswoman for Akuna's law firm declined to comment on the Cboe fine when reached by phone.

"Exchanges are being more active in investigations of this kind of trading conduct," said Craig Pirrong, a professor at the University of Houston who has studied manipulation.

On Cboe's findings, he said, "It has been hard to prove intent."

In December, a federal judge sided with Donald Wilson Jr., founder and chief executive of proprietary trading firm DRW Investments LLC, in a showdown with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarding whether Mr. Wilson's firm engaged in manipulation.

According to Cboe's filing Friday, on three dates between 2016 to 2017, the final settlement values for VIX derivatives were swayed by the S&P 500 options orders that Akuna made.

Cboe looked at instant messages and emails to gauge whether Akuna intended to manipulate the auction or violated any rules, according to a person familiar with the case. The company also conducted on-record interviews, the person said, but found that Akuna didn't intend to manipulate the auction. The firm made $6,726 from the improper options trades, according to the filing.

The Wall Street Journal reported last February that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was scrutinizing whether traders bet on S&P 500 options to influence VIX futures prices. Finra is Wall Street's self-regulator and works with Cboe to help with surveillance of its market.

Sparse trading in Cboe's monthly auction tied to the VIX last year caused alarm across Wall Street on whether it was being tampered with by traders. Cboe has since made changes to this monthly auction in an effort to clarify rules around it and make trading information more widely available.

Wells Fargo Breaks Down Internal Audit Silos to Fend Off Scandals

By Kristin Broughton

Wells Fargo & Co.'s 103-page business-standards report, released this week to address changes the bank has made in response to a string of scandals, revealed nuanced changes to the company's system of internal checks.

The tweaks to the San Francisco company's internal auditing team a unit known as the "third line of defense" in risk parlance led to the creation of several new teams, including one that focuses exclusively on identifying inconsistent consumer practices.

The changes illustrate how the portfolio of risks facing banks is expanding, and how auditors are being organized to manage them.

Alterations within the company's auditing division, in place for months but disclosed Wednesday, are part of a broader effort to improve risk management at Wells Fargo.

The lender has been fighting to improve its reputation following a string of regulatory investigations throughout the bank, including in retail banking, wealth management and foreign exchange.

The company in September 2016 paid $185 million to settle allegations that it created unauthorized customer accounts. Since then, it has disclosed that it previously overcharged auto and mortgage borrowers, among other problems, leading to billions in fines and the departure of several senior executives.

As a result, the company consolidated its retail-banking auditing team under a centralized group in an effort to break down silos and have a broader view of risk across the business, according to a company spokesman. Auditors in that group previously were assigned to niche areas, such as home lending.

The restructuring shows how the company is addressing gaps in the previous system, said Will Callender, a partner in the financial institutions division at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. "They have organized themselves in a way that directly addresses some of the challenges they have had," he said.

Wells Fargo also created new teams to focus on issues such as board-level governance and capital management. Additionally, it created an audit services division that specializes in testing and data analytics.

"Those functions existed, but they were part of other audit functions," said Mark Folk, a company spokesman. "We broke those out to give them more attention."

Over the past two years, the bank has increased head count within its auditing division by about one-third, to 1,350 employees, Mr. Folk said. And it changed the way it manages risks, including by adding more experienced directors to its board-level risk committee.

Companies that have survived a crisis, such as banks in the aftermath of the mortgage meltdown, often revamp risk-management priorities to account for the challenges they have previously faced, experts said. The challenge facing auditing divisions is finding a way to account for future threats.

"It is not uncommon that companies are always tending to organize to fight the last war," said Richard Chambers, chief executive of the Institute of Internal Auditors, who said the changes at Wells Fargo are in line with industry standards.

It is impossible to know if the changes can stave off future scandals at the bank, said Cliff Rossi, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business and a former risk executive at Citigroup .

"A lot will remain to be seen as to how well they execute," he said.

Oops! An Awkward Jobs Report for the Fed

"The Federal Reserve just told us it isn't planning any more rate increases. The job market may have something to say about that," writes Justin Lahart for The Wall Street Journal. "If the recent pace of job growth continues, the unemployment rate will start pushing lower again, while wage growth will keep drifting higher. So long as the economy is able to get past some of its near-term challenges...it could get much harder for the Fed to stand pat."

European Companies Deploy AI With a Continental Twist; A focus on privacy is reflected in how European firms use artificial intelligence

Companies based in Europe are adopting artificial intelligence in a distinctly European way that emphasizes privacy and limits risk.

Heightened privacy regulations on the continent may present obstacles for companies using data to develop AI. But given a growing public debate about imposing greater limits on tech in the U.S. and elsewhere, the European approach could serve as a prototype for companies around the world as they navigate regulators' and customers' concerns.

Longstanding cultural norms and traditions make Europe less hospitable to the collection, analysis and sharing of personal data. Such information is used to fine-tune the algorithms and power the business models of many corporations in the U.S. and Asia.

Regional values were emphasized last May when the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation went into effect. It requires companies to inform users how they will use personal information and be able to disclose what data they hold.

All companies that offer services in the EU must comply with the law, regardless of where they are based.

"There is a privacy-first perspective that is much less common in North America," said Whit Andrews, vice president and analyst at Gartner Research Inc.

That perspective is reflected in how European firms use AI. Companies in Asia are about twice as likely to use AI for facial-recognition applications, compared with businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to Gartner research. European corporations are more likely than North American businesses to deploy AI in smart robotics services, according to Gartner, which declined to divulge further detail.

Overall, Europe has lagged behind U.S. and Chinese efforts in AI. European companies are adopting AI primarily in areas like manufacturing where they believe they can compete. They are largely avoiding applications that might be similar to those of internet platforms such as Facebook Inc. or Tencent Holdings Ltd., said Stefan Heumann, a member of the managing board of Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a technology think tank in Berlin.

"Everyone talks about the integration of these technologies in the industrial sector, in mobility, in energy and in health. In these areas we still have strong European companies, and we're very concerned about their competitiveness," he said.

Engineers in BMW AG's autonomous driving unit use anonymization technology to remove images of faces or any other information that could indicate a person's identity. They improved the technology over the last year to make sure it could meet the demands of GDPR, said Andr Roskopf, lead developer for artificial intelligence in BMW's autonomous driving team.

The law doesn't define how sophisticated such privacy measures should be. "We try to anonymize as much as possible. But we don't really know whether it's enough," Mr. Roskopf said.

BMW plans to introduce an AI and voice-recognition-based, in-car personal assistant in March. A company representative said privacy, free choice and transparency must be ensured and data leaks prevented.

Location data can be stored only with the customer's consent, and used to deliver "the desired added value," the company said. The customer can delete stored personal data at any time, according to BMW.

Some large companies use AI to strengthen data protection. French bank BNP Paribas SA created an in-house application that uses machine learning to automatically translate long contracts and other documents between 15 pairs of languages. The homegrown technology will help keep clients' personal data under the bank's control and reduce the need for outside contractors, said Hugues Even, chief data officer at BNP Paribas's corporate and institutional banking unit. Companies are responsible for ensuring that contractors they hire comply with GDPR.

German software company SAP SE whose AI applications include Concur, which uses machine learning to manage invoices created a tool to help document all personal data that the company processes, training employees in each of its business units how to use it.

Some European companies see the continent's tougher regulatory stance as a potential selling point.

German startup Ada Health GmbH has produced a mobile app that uses AI to assess users' medical symptoms and recommend care. The app is available in more than 100 countries, but all personal user and medical data are stored on servers within the EU, according to the company.

"On the one hand, it might slow us down when you develop," Ada Health Chief Executive Daniel Nathrath said. "On the other hand, we can &say we're about as safe and privacy- and data-protection-conscious as it gets, and we can take that to other markets and they will trust us."

TDR Capital Loses Senior Operating Partner

Copyright  2019, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

A senior operating executive at U.K.-based private-equity firm TDR Capital, owner of the David Lloyd fitness chain, has left the firm, a person familiar with the matter said.

Julian Seaward left TDR at the end of last year after a near 15-year career at the firm, where he led a team focused on improving the performance of the firm's portfolio companies.

His career has included stints in the buyout arms of investment banks Deutsche Bank AG and Nomura Holdings as well as consulting firm McKinsey & Co.

Mr. Seaward took his first role in private equity in 2001, when he joined Nomura's principal finance group. His time in that group was short-lived as the unit spun out of the bank in 2002 to form Terra Firma Partners.

After leaving Nomura that same year, he joined Deutsche Bank Capital Partners, where he first worked with TDR's founding partners, Manjit Dale and Stephen Robertson. He joined TDR's nascent operations team in 2004, two years after the other two men launched the firm.

In his time at TDR, the firm raised a succession of larger funds including its fourth, and most recent, which closed on  ¬3.5 billion ($4.01 billion) last year, TDR's website shows.

Alongside raising bigger funds, TDR has also built out its operations team over the past few years, including hiring a team of data scientists. According to the website, the firm currently employs 11 people in its operating team, nearly double the size of the team four years ago.

Improving operational performance of portfolio companies has assumed increasing importance in recent years as buyout shops must work harder to generate returns in a competitive deal environment.

To do so, investment houses typically hire operating partners with backgrounds in specific industries to help improve portfolio company performance.

Some firms, including TDR, are also turning to big data to improve their investments' performance. WSJ Pro reported in 2017 that TDR employed two data scientists focused on portfolio improvement. The firm now has a team of at least five executives working in its data science unit, its website shows.

Investors urge tech start-ups to hoard cash

VC groups say the slowing economy will make fundraising more difficult

Venture capital investors arewarning their start-ups to hold more cash as worries about the global economy and stock market volatility threaten to trickle down into private tech financings.

 We are certainly telling [entrepreneurs] they need 18 to 24 months of runway right now, to make sure they can weather any situation,  said Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures.

Just a year ago, Mr Rimer would recommend companies to hold enough cash to cover nine to 12 months  worth of expenditures and delay raising new funds if they thought they believed they could achieve higher valuations in future. Now, he suggests start-ups seek more capital sooner rather than later, and at more modest valuations.

Ten years ago, Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia sparked concerns about a tech bubble with a presentation to its entrepreneurs declaring  RIP good times . Sequoia s presentation, which was sent out to portfolio companies at the height of the financial crisis in late-2008, warned that any start-up without a year s worth of cash in the bank could find itself in trouble as the economy slowed.

While investors are not yet using such dramatic language, some have warned tech companies that a downturn in the economy could cause bigger businesses to cut IT spending and make it more difficult for funds to raise capital.

 We ve started to be a little more cautious about that run rate 	. 	. 	. 	it should be a year or one-and-a-half years,  said Klaus Hommels, founder and chief executive of Zurich-based venture firm Lakestar.  The likelihood of being refinanced and achieving a huge valuation is less. 

SoftBank s decision to slash a planned investment inWeWork, the shared office company, from $16bn to $2bn has also led to fears that valuations for private tech companies will come down, just as they have for high-flying public tech companies such asNvidia,Snap orApple in recent months.

However, some investors say there is far more capital available for tech companies now than in 2008. Investment has flowed into both traditional venture capital firms and later-stage funds such as Softbank s $97bn Vision Fund, in search of better returns while interest rates remained low.

Nonetheless, despite the emergence of more start-ups with multibillion-dollar valuations, tech start-ups are still seen as a riskier investment than the public markets.

UK augmented-reality start-up Blippar was forced into administration before Christmas after a shareholder dispute over funding when Malaysia s sovereign wealth fund blocked emergency investment from property tycoon Nick Candy. Last month, the company relaunched under the same name after Mr Candy s investment firm bought its intellectual property assets.

It is not uncommon for tech start-ups to end the year without enough cash to cover a year s worth of costs, in anticipation of future funding rounds.

According to its most recent public filings, London-based artificial intelligence start-up BenevolentAI, which is valued at more than $1bn, had 19.6m of cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017, but that year recorded research, development and administrative expenses of 36.7m. The figure includes 12.2m of share-based payments that only impact cash holdings when employees leave.

But the following April, the company was able to raise $115m from investors including Woodford Investment Management.

For investors, the concern is that start-ups founded in the last 10 years will only have experienced a strong economy and could be unprepared for a downturn.

 This year we want to look at all the companies in the portfolio and see they have enough cash in the bank,  said Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, general partner at Balderton Capital.  There are some companies that are burning a lot of cash right now 	. 	. 	. 	many of the companies we invest in haven t seen the downside.

Householders take a long view in the rush to remortgage

In a highly competitive UK home loans market and with the uncertainty of Brexit, borrowers are fixing their repayments for the long term. James Pickford examines the trend

Remortgaging is all the rage. As the uncertainties of Brexit shroud the UK's economic outlook and damp activity in the property market, homeowners are keener than ever to refinance home loans.

Amid political gridlock, banks and building societies are offering an array of highly competitive remortgage deals. With the base rate holding fast for now, borrowers want to lock down market-beating interest rates on their housing debt while they can.

Remortgaging has become big business for mortgage lenders: in October it surged to 9.2bn, the highest level for nearly a decade, according to UK Finance, the lenders' body.

But the remortgaging decision is not always straightforward. Borrowers have myriad options, including fixed-rate deals, trackers, discounted variable rates and offset mortgages. And that is before they consider how many years to fix for   or the value of "special offers" or "cashbacks", reduced or waived booking fees and other charges.

FT Money explores trends in the remortgage market, how they affect borrowers and the role of brokers.

Confidence versus cost Fixed-rate mortgages have come to dominate the market in recent years. Brokers say that when customers now approach them for a mortgage or remortgage, the classic first question: "what kind of mortgage do I want?" has increasingly been supplanted by "which fixed-rate deal do I want?" Offering the certainty of an agreed interest rate over two, three, five, seven or 10 years, fixed-rate deals give borrowers a measure of predictability over their finances. Economic uncertainty   and the current crop of enticing deals   are driving more people to pay for the privilege of knowing what their monthly outgoings will be over a set period. Another factor is the sense that interest rates may rise: the Bank of England has said "gradual" base rate rises in the medium term may be necessary, depending on the Brexit impact.

David Hollingworth, director at broker L&C Mortgages, says variablerate mortgages   or "trackers"   are less attractive in this environment.

"Unless you believe the base rate is going to drop   and you could construct an argument for that   we are still at a very low point on fixed rates, so the upsides of a variable deal are fairly limited."

Although average interest rates on new mortgages crept up last year, competition between lenders remains intense. Those with substantial equity in their homes who are looking to remortgage can get rates as low as 1.39 per cent for a two-year fix, or 1.85 per cent for a five-year deal.

Great lengths

The traditional dominance of the two-year deal is now being challenged by demand for longer-term fixes, typically of five years.

Graham Sellar, head of business development at Santander Mortgages, says the proportion of borrowers taking out five-year deals (compared with two-year offers) reached a record high in January.

"We're now seeing over half of our business coming in on five-year fixes," he says. "It could be down to Brexit, interest rates, uncertainty in general, or that five-year rates look attractive against shorter-term fixes."

The narrowing gap between interest rates on two- and five-year fixed rates is another inducement to fix for longer. Research this week from finance website Moneyfacts found that the rate gap between the two types of fixed-rate deals had fallen to its lowest level in five years.

Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts says: "As it stands, the average twoyear fixed mortgage rate of 2.5 per cent is just 0.41 [percentage points] lower than the current average fiveyear deal of 2.91 per cent, so despite average rates rising since 2017's record lows  & the gap is smaller."

Lenders are responding by introducing longerterm offerings, such aseven-year and 10-year fixed deals.

Daniel Hegarty, chief executive ofonline mortgage broker Habito, says the number of 10-year deals the broker handled, though small, doubledduring 2018. "We're seeing both amove to fixed-rate deals and an elongation of the rate period."

However, if you change your mindabout a long-term deal before the fixends you risk incurring an earlyrepayment charge (ERC).

On a five-year deal, ERCs are generally structured as 5 per cent of thedebt if you break the deal in the firstyear, 4 per cent in the second, down to1 per cent in the fifth. However, lenders such as Santander charge 5 percent throughout the term.

longerterm deals are not withoutflexibility, however. It is possible, forexample, to reduce the overall size of the debt dramatically (and the interest payable) by making regular overpayments, typically up to 10 per cent of the debt every year.

If a borrower decides to move to another property before repaying the mortgage, it may sometimes be "ported" or transferred to the new home. Mr Hollingworth, however, cautions over making assumptions on porting, particularly for longerterm deals. "There can be complications because your affordability willbe reassessed at that point. If you'reborrowing more, or your circumstances have changed, you could findit's not straightforward," he says.

The broker question When remortgaging, borrowers need to decide whether to use a mortgage broker and, if they do, what kind of broker. Borrowers are under no obligation to seek their advice and many choose to make their own decisions, or go "execution only", in industry parlance.

But in a complex market with multiple variants on offer, brokers can help borrowers sift rates, weigh the value of special offers and provide speedy overall calculations on monthly payments as well as costs across the term of a mortgage.

Andrew Hagger, founder of consumer website MoneyComms, says: "I would always say to people use a broker. You'll see the 'best buy' tables, but it will depend on the size and term of your mortgage as to which deal is best for you. Let them do the number crunching for you."

There are several charging models.

Some brokers make their money from the lender, in the form of a "procuration fee". Others charge a fee to the borrower, which could be a flat fee of, say 495, as well as a procuration fee, or ask for a percentage of the total mortgage amount.

Mr Hagger says there may be circumstances in which a fee is fully justified. "In the main, you should not be paying a fee for a mainstream residential mortgage. When it comes to more specialist requirements, such as a subprime or non-vanilla mortgage, if it's something quite complex it may be worth paying for that expertise."

Using a broker may also help if you find yourself nearing the limits of affordability or have other special circumstances, such as being selfemployed, since less time is likely to be wasted in approaching lenders with highly conservative lending limits or which are known to recoil from borrowers disclosing anything out of the ordinary.

"It's about making sure you don't apply to a lender who is never going to accommodate you and, worse still, will take two to three weeks to tell you it's a 'no'," says Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol. A string of rejections can also raise questions with subsequent lenders, who may ask about previous refusals.

One question for borrowers to a any potential broker is the extent of their coverage of the market. Some brokers offer mortgages only from a restricted range of lenders.

Another is where the best rates are to be found. In the past, there was often a substantial difference between rates available via brokers and those offered direct to borrowers, or between those offered to new customers and those staying with their lender. As competition has intensified, these gaps have narrowed or disappeared. However, marginally different rates or fee-related perks may be offered depending on how a customer has arrived at the lender.

Borrowers may get a very different reception from the big banks and smaller building societies. In tricky cases, building societies may be more willing to help, since they often retain manual underwriting processes.

Aaron Strutt, product director at broker Trinity Financial, says: "Smaller building societies are happier to do more complicated things. You'll pay more   but you might get the money."

Should I stay or should I go? Borrowers are increasingly choosing not to switch lender when they remortgage, but move to a new deal with their existing bank or building society. Known as the "product transfer" option, this part of the mortgage market has been growing rapidly in the past few years as lenders are fighting harder to hold on to their customers, not just recruit new ones.

Last year, UK Finance published data for the first time on the size of the product transfer market, finding it amounted to business of about 38bn every three months. When figures for the last quarter of 2018 are finalised, the industry expects a total for 2018 of around 150bn   nearly twice as much as the 80bn remortgaging market, which records loans that move from lender to lender.

Ten years ago, there was little to stop customers with maturing mortgages from simply rolling on to a lender's standard variable rate   a much higher rate than those offered under fixed or discounted deals   at the end of their deal. Then, lenders took few steps to communicate or persuade customers to find a new deal with them; now, they contact borrowers several months before the end of the deal and explain their options. Then, Mr Sellar estimates, two-thirds of these people would have moved to a different lender; now two-thirds stay.

Part of the allure of product transfers is that they do away with the need for paperwork, surveys and solicitors that come with moving to a new lender. Banks are also sweetening the deal by allowing their customers to switch to a new rate several months ahead of their date of maturity.

"What the market shows is that lots of customers are choosing to stay with their existing lender either to get a better rate straightaway or to have certainty of their rate when it matures," Mr Sellar says. Like other banks, Santander has made sure customers can take this decision online; some 60 per cent of its product transfers now take place digitally, up from 20 per cent three years ago.

It is clear that lenders have become slick at exploiting customers' preference for minimal hassle. But what price are they prepared to pay for that convenience? Mr Hegarty of Habito says: "My only hesitation with internal product transfers is that lenders will not ordinarily go through an advised process. This puts the consumer at a disadvantage as they won't have the opportunity to talk through their situation or to compare rates across the market."

In the past two years, banks have taken steps to win over brokers to the product transfer market, encouraging them to include the bank's current deals when advising a client on a remortgage (brokers will still receive a "proc fee" for this service, even if the borrower remains with the same lender). But Mr Hegarty's point stands for those who choose to decline advice ahead of a product transfer.

A competitive future What developments can borrowers expect to see in the mortgage market over the next few years? Unless the fog of uncertainty over Britain's political and economic outlook suddenly lifts, long-term fixed-rate deals are likely to remain popular as a hedge against future interest rate rises.

But the lengthening of deals has other ramifications. Mortgage market experts are predicting that, in the absence of a surge in home purchases, the shift to five-year deals will trigger a drop in mortgage activity from 2020 onwards. Customers who would have remortgaged every two years will now be "out of the market" for more than twice as long. And while lenders will benefit from having more of their customers on longerterm deals, they will find it harder to supply themselves with new customers by prising them from the grip of other lenders.

This means that, if banks and building societies want to sustain their current levels of business, they will need to open up new markets or types of product, or become increasingly competitive.

Specialisation is one such avenue.

Mr Boulger of John Charcol believes the need for lenders to go beyond their core markets will boost the prospects for "later life" mortgages. "It's a small part of the market but it will become a bigger part as an increasing proportion of the mortgaged population gets older."

Completing a remortgage online will continue to get easier, experts predict, though the disparate systems and lack of standardised questioning among lenders remains a barrier to marketwide tech solutions. While artificial intelligence has yet to conquer the mortgage market, Mr Boulger thinks it has potential to ease the red tape that sometimes dogs the remortgage process   and may ultimately have a role in offering advice.

"A lot of people in 10 years will still welcome getting advice from a human being," says Mr Boulger. "But I think it would be foolish to discount that artificial intelligence won't develop sufficiently to mean some advice could be given using AI."

Borrower beware

Low rates are not always the cheapest deals

High street mortgage lenders vie with each other to offer the lowest interest rates to ensure their loans come near the top of the "best buy" tables produced by finance websites and comparison sites. These tables can have a disproportionate influence on the decisions made by borrowers ahead of a remortgage, particularly where they are going it alone, without the advice of a broker.

Rates should be a key part of the decision-making process, says David Hollingworth, director at broker L&C, but it is also important to look at the overall value of a product since fees and other costs can make a big difference to a deal's overall value.

Take the example of a 150,000 repayment mortgage over 25 years, in costings calculated by L&C. Leeds Building Society is offering an attractively low interest rate of 1.39 per cent on its two-year fix, with a booking fee of 1,999 and a free valuation. The costs are: ? Monthly payment 592.18 ? Total over two years 14,212.32 ? Arrangement fee 1,999 ? Valuation 0 ? Legal work 300 (assumed cost) Total 16,511.32 Now look at a two-year deal from Platform, a broker brand of Co-operative Bank.

It has a higher interest rate of 1.89 per cent over the fixed term, but charges no booking fee and throws in valuation and basic legal work plus 250 cashback.

? Monthly payment 627.78 ? Total over two years 15,066.72 ? Arrangement fee 0 ? Valuation 0 ? Legal work 0 ? Cashback (250) Total 14,816.72 Over two years, therefore, the Platform loan at the higher interest rate will cost the borrower almost 1,700 less than the Leeds deal, in spite of the latter's lower rate.

"There is some benefit in having a lower interest rate in that the amount owed on the capital balance will be lower than at a higher rate at the end of the two years," adds Mr Hollingworth, "but that won't be enough to outweigh the difference."

Rush to remortgage ahead of Brexit

In a highly competitive market, UK borrowers are fixing deals for up to 10 years

Remortgaging is all the rage. As the uncertainties of Brexit continue to shroud the UK s economic outlook and to damp activity in the property market, homeowners are keener than ever to refinance their home loans.

Amid the political gridlock, banks and building societies are offering an array of strikingly competitive remortgage deals. With the base rate holding fast for now, borrowers want to lock down market-beating interest rates on their housing debt while they still can.

Remortgaging has become big business for mortgage lenders: in October it surged to 9.2bn, the highest level for nearly a decade, according to UK Finance, the representative body for lenders.

But the remortgaging decision is not always straightforward. Borrowers can choose from myriad options, including fixed-rate deals, trackers, discounted variable rates and offset mortgages. And that is before they have considered how many years to fix for   or the value of  special offers  or  cashbacks , reduced or waived booking fees and other charges.

To help readers find their way through the thicket of choice, FT Money explores the central trends in the remortgage market, how they affect borrowers and what role brokers can play in the process.

Confidence versus cost

Fixed-rate mortgages have come to dominate the market in recent years. Brokers say that when customers now approach them for a mortgage or remortgage, the classic first question  What kind of mortgage do I want?  has increasingly been supplanted by  Which fixed-rate deal do I want? 

Offering the certainty of an agreed interest rate over two, three, five, seven or 10 years, fixed-rate deals give borrowers a measure of predictability over their finances. Economic uncertainty  and the current crop of enticing deals   are driving more people to pay for the privilege of knowing what their monthly outgoings will be over a set period. Another driving factor is the sense that interest rates may rise: the Bank of England has said a  gradual pace  of base rate rises in the medium term may be necessary, depending on the impact of Brexit.

David Hollingworth, director at broker L&C Mortgages, says variable-rate mortgages   commonly known as  trackers    are less attractive in this environment.

 Unless you believe that the base rate is going to drop   and you could construct an argument for that   we are still at a very low point on fixed rates, so the upsides of a variable deal are fairly limited. Therefore it s all been about fixed rates. 

Although average interest rates on new mortgages crept up slightly last year, competition between lenders remains intense and nearly all the major high street banks have cut rates across their fixed-rate deals since the start of this year. Those with a substantial chunk of equity in their homes who are looking to remortgage can get rates as low as 1.39 per cent for a two-year fix, or 1.85 per cent for a five-year deal.

Great lengths

Over the past decade, those borrowers who chose to roll over a succession of two-year fixes have done well, since low rates meant they could move to a similar or lower rate when their fixed rate expired. But the traditional dominance of the two-year deal is now being challenged by demand for longer-term fixes, typically of five years.

Graham Sellar, head of business development at Santander Mortgages, says the proportion of borrowers taking out five-year fixed-rate deals (compared with two-year offers) reached a record high in January.

 We re now seeing over half our business coming in on five-year fixes,  he says.  It could be down to Brexit, interest rates, uncertainty in general, or the fact that five-year rates look attractive against shorter-term fixes. 

The narrowing gap between interest rates on two- and five-year fixed rates is another inducement to fix for longer. Research this week from finance website Moneyfacts found that the rate gap between the two types of fixed-rate deals had fallen to its lowest level in five years.

Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts says:  As it stands, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate of 2.5 per cent is just 0.41 [percentage points] lower than the current average five-year deal of 2.91 per cent, so despite average rates overall rising since the record lows seen in 2017 	. 	. 	. 	the gap is smaller. 

Lenders are responding by introducing more longer term offerings, such as unusual seven-year fixed term deals. Ten-year deals, previously an untapped curiosity, are being snapped up in greater numbers.

Daniel Hegarty, chief executive of online mortgage broker Habito, says the number of 10-year deals the broker handled, though small, doubled between the first and second half of 2018.  We re seeing both a move to fixed-rate deals and an elongation of the rate period. 

There are, nevertheless, a few things for borrowers to bear in mind if they decide to go for a longer fix. If you change your mind about the deal before the fix ends   or need to move home   you risk incurring a penalty for coming out of the contract, known as an early repayment charge (ERC).

On a five-year deal, ERCs are generally structured as 5 per cent of the mortgage debt if you break the deal in the first year, 4 per cent in the second, down to 1 per cent in the fifth. However, some lenders such as Santander charge 5 per cent all the way through the term.

Longer term deals are not without some flexibility, however. It is possible, for example, to reduce the overall size of the debt dramatically (and the interest payable) by making regular overpayments, typically up to 10 per cent of the debt every year.

If a borrower decides to move to another property before paying off the mortgage, it may sometimes be  ported  or transferred to the new home. Mr Hollingworth, however, adds a note of caution over making any assumptions on porting, particularly for longer-term deals.  There can be complications because your affordability will be reassessed at that point. If you re borrowing more, or your circumstances have changed, you could find it s not as straightforward as people think,  he says.

The broker question

When remortgaging, borrowers need to decide whether to use a mortgage broker, and if they do, what kind of broker. Borrowers are under no obligation to seek their advice and many choose to make their own decisions, or go  execution only , in industry parlance.

But in a complex market with multiple variants on offer, brokers can help borrowers sift rates, weigh the value of special offers and provide speedy overall calculations on monthly payments as well as costs across the term of a mortgage.

Andrew Hagger, founder of consumer website MoneyComms, says:  I would always say to people use a broker. You ll see the  best buy  tables, but a lot of the time it will depend on the size and term of your mortgage as to which deal is best for you. Let them do the number crunching for you. 

There are several charging models. Some brokers make their money not from the borrower but the lender, in the form of a so-called  procuration fee . Others charge a fee to the borrower, which could be a flat fee of, say 495, as well as a procuration fee, or ask for a percentage of the total mortgage amount.

Mr Hagger says there may be circumstances in which a fee is fully justified.  In the main you should not be paying a fee for a mainstream residential mortgage. When it comes to more specialist requirements, such as a subprime or non-vanilla mortgage, if it s something quite complex it may be worth paying for that expertise. 

Using a broker may also help if you find yourself nearing the limits of affordability or have other special circumstances, such as being self-employed, since less time is likely to be wasted in approaching lenders with highly conservative lending limits or which are known to recoil from borrowers disclosing anything out of the ordinary.

 It s about making sure you don t apply to a lender who is never going to accommodate you and, worse still, will take two to three weeks to tell you it s a  no ,  says Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol. A string of rejections can also raise questions with subsequent lenders, who may ask about previous refusals.

One question for borrowers to a any potential broker is the extent of their coverage of the market. Some brokers offer mortgages only from a restricted range of lenders. Others will be able to consider the full range of loans on the market.

Another is where the best rates are to be found. In the past, there was often a substantial difference between the rate available via brokers and those offered to borrowers direct, or between those offered to new customers and those staying with their lender. As competition has intensified, these gaps have narrowed or disappeared. However, marginally different rates or fee-related perks may still be offered depending on how a customer has arrived at the lender.

Borrowers may find they get a very different reception from the big banks and smaller building societies. In tricky cases, building societies may be more willing to help, since they often retain manual underwriting processes rather than computer-driven models adopted by large high street banks.

Aaron Strutt, product director at broker Trinity Financial, says:  Smaller building societies are happier to do more complicated things. You ll pay more   but you might get the money.

Leeds Building Society currently offers an attractively low interest rate of 1.39 per cent on its two-year fix, with a booking fee of 1,999 and a free valuation. The costs are as below:

* Monthly payment 592.18

* Total over two years 14,212.32

* Arrangement fee 1,999

* Valuation 0

* Legal work 300 (assumed cost)

* Total 16,511.32

Now look at another two-year deal, this one from Platform, a broker brand of Co-operative Bank. It has a higher interest rate of 1.89 per cent over the fixed term, but charges no booking fee and throws in valuation and basic legal work plus 250 cashback.

* Monthly payment 627.78

* Total over two years 15,066.72

* Arrangement fee 0

* Valuation 0

* Legal work 0

* Cashback (250)

* Total 14,816.72

Over two years, therefore, the Platform loan at the higher interest rate will cost the borrower almost 1,700 less than the Leeds deal, in spite of the latter s lower rate.

 There is some benefit in having a lower interest rate in that the amount owed on the capital balance will be lower than at a higher rate at the end of the two years,  adds Mr Hollingworth,  but that won t be enough to outweigh the difference.

Adecade ago, investors who considered themselves "serious" would smirk into their brandy if you brought up sustainable investing. And that attitude wasn't entirely unreasonable. Back then investing sustainably meant trading returns for values. We lacked the data and analytical frameworks to make such considerations an advantage rather than an obstacle.

Today, sustainability considerations do more than fulfil an investor's values   they can drive successful investment decisions. When measured with data on environmental and social impact, and governance practices (together dubbed ESG), they can have a material impact on investment performance. That is why BlackRock includes ESG data in risk management platforms and promulgates it among investment teams. Any strong manager should do the same. Just as quantitative investors are trying to use big data and machine learning to outperform the market, investors should mine traditional and new ESG data to manage risk and enhance returns. BlackRock's new research shows that sustainable indices   which allow investors to favour higher-rated ESG companies rather than simply exclude sectors or companies   have the same risk and return characteristics as traditional benchmarks. We examined the performance of traditional indices alongside ESG-focused versions that were optimised to increase sustainability scores while adhering closely to their traditional counterparts. The ESG indices' annualised total returns since 2012 matched or exceeded standard benchmarks in both developed and emerging markets, with comparable volatility. In emerging markets, where shareholder protections, natural resources management and labour relations can have a significant effect on performance, we found that ESG indices can outperform the standard ones.

Our research also determined that global companies that have reduced their carbon footprints the most every year have outperformed the carbon laggards. This result held true outside of the energy and utilities sectors. Relative performance and rate of change mattered more for future financial performance than absolute emissions levels. This finding and others about corporate use of resources allow BlackRock to predict which companies are best positioned to capture opportunities and mitigate risks associated with the carbon transition. We can introduce sustainable investing as part of our standard portfolio building blocks. Up until now, the sustainable investing space has been primarily comprised of niche options that cannot be used to build a core investment portfolio.

To do this, we must have reliable data.

While ESG data continues to improve, challenges remain. Different data providers can come to different conclusions on the ESG attributes of the same company. Investors must be educated about data sources and told how and why ESG data affects returns. They would also benefit from agreed global guidelines.

The investment industry must deliver better tools. Institutional investors   pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds   are ahead of asset managers on sustainable investing. European asset owners already ask for detailed information on how managers incorporate ESG analysis into their investment processes. Together we can be a positive catalyst for change.

The demand for sustainable investments is rapidly increasing: assets are moving into these strategies at an annual growth rate of more than 20 per cent. Over the next 15 years, $24tn of wealth will be inherited by millennials. They are more than twice as likely as other generations to invest in companies or funds that target social or environmental outcomes. Sustainable investing has reached an inflection point. The future of the sector   and the world   depends on taking a more sustainable approach.

The writer is vice-chairman of BlackRock.

South Korea start-ups need helping hand to break chaebol grip

Technology. New era Tough regulation and low investment levels hold back innovative young businesses

As South Korea's economy splutters, there is a growing focus on why the country has relatively few successful tech start-ups.

The administration of president Moon Jae-in hopes the development of a start-up ecosystem in and around Seoul can create jobs and power growth as the country's long dominant conglomerates, such as Samsung and Hyundai, gradually lose competitiveness to Chinese rivals.

Officials have already pushed ahead with policies aimed at encouraging funding for new companies, and in 2018, there was a record Won3.4tn ($3.04bn) of venture capital funding for start-ups.

But for many in the tech community, much broader economic reform and deregulation efforts are needed if the plans are to succeed.

"If the start-ups could scale up and grow, they could create a number of quality jobs, which would be beneficial for young people, while improving the nation's broader economic structure as well," said Choi Sung-jin, president of the Korea Start-up Forum.

Start-up has long been a buzz word for South Korean officials, who dream of turning Seoul into an Asian Silicon Valley but have historically been unable or unwilling to wean the nation off its reliance on the big conglomerates, known as the chaebol.

With the country's manufacturing sector facing crisis, however, policymakers are being forced into action. In September, officials rolled out the first tranche of a $9bn-plus investment fund to support start-ups in a range of fields from artificial intelligence to drones.

The move was followed a month later by a proposal for sweeping capital market reforms, aimed at loosening regulations so that Seoul's start-up scene could more easily secure financing.

In South Korea, only about 2 per cent of funds raised by small businesses come from capital markets and the average investment is just Won1.7bn   about 11 per cent of the amount raised on average by US start-ups and less than 8 per cent of what Chinese companies raise, according to the Financial Services Commission.

"Most venture investment funds are led by the government," said Mr Choi. "We need to see more private investment in start-ups. We need to see successful start-ups invest in other startups and conglomerates invest in startups through mergers and acquisitions."

The economic dominance of the large conglomerates has long been a problem for emerging companies in South Korea.

Immensely wealthy and historically backed by government support, the chaebol have a tradition of establishing their own affiliates to compete and undercut start-ups instead of acquiring the new technology through M&A.

"Korean M&A has lagged behind other countries," said Park Tae-geun of the Korea Venture Business Association. "For example, the big US technology companies have acquired hundreds of promising start-ups in recent years, demonstrating how small enterprises can recover their investment through active M&A."

But Korea, Mr Park added, was a different story. "The rate of start-ups recovering their investment through M&A is less than 10 per cent. Even from a social point of view, if Koreans could see that start-ups can receive a fair price, it would be good motivation to develop their own businesses."

The broader issue facing the fledgling start-up scene is South Korea's multitude of highly specific regulatory requirements, which plague the operations of small enterprises.

Mr Choi points to the example of Neofect, a healthcare start-up whose technology allowed patients to practice rehabilitation exercises at home. While Neofect's products won plaudits in the US, the company could not operate in South Korea, where regulation requires patients to undergo rehabilitation under the supervision of a doctor, he added.

"We have many little, detailed regulations in the country, which prevent start-ups from growing and scaling up their businesses," Mr Choi said.

Lim Jung-wook, managing director of Start-up Alliance Korea, added that Korea was known to have very rigid regulations in areas such as ridesharing, healthcare and fintech, which could hamper big global companies from making investments in the local market.

At the end of last year, a regulation "sandbox" was introduced that allowed start-ups to apply for a two-year waiver from the rules to test their products in the market. A specific fintech sandbox will start taking applications from the end of this month.

The challenges facing South Korea's start-ups are borne out in the nation's limited number of unicorns   those private groups with a value of more than $1bn.

According to researchers, South Korea has only a handful of such groups, despite the country's highly educated population and advanced infrastructure.

These are led by Coupang, the ecommerce site, while others include Woowa Brothers, which operates a delivery service app, Crafton, the maker of a battle royale style computer game, and Viva Republica, which runs a money transfer service.

CareerBuilder Says AI Can Cut Piles of Rsums in Half; With reams of jobs-related data collected over more than two decades, CareerBuilder is using AI to help companies find job candidates faster

CareerBuilder is applying artificial intelligence to data gathered by its online employment service, an effort to speed the process of finding promising candidates among piles of rsums.

Hiring is a growing challenge for recruiters amid one of the tightest labor markets in decades, the company's chief executive told WSJ Pro AI.

"We have one of the largest data sets in the world. It was time to start doing something with it," Irina Novoselsky said.

The Chicago-based online employment and human-resources technology company last week acquired Textkernel, a Netherlands-based startup that develops AI and machine-learning tools for recruiting, sourcing, lead generation and labor-market statistics. The terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

By feeding its data into algorithms, CareerBuilder says employers can reduce the number of applications per successful hire to an average of 75, compared with an industry average of 150. It cited an internal study.

The Textkernel acquisition marked the latest move by the 25-year-old venture, owned by Apollo Global Management LLC , to beef up its technology amid rising competition from rival job boards, search engines and other online employment services.

Nearly all Fortune 500 companies now use some form of automation in the recruiting process, including robot avatars to interview job candidates, programs that scan keywords in rsums, and AI and machine-learning tools to assess potential employees.

Sites like Getting Hired or FedEx Careers have deployed Google 's Talent Solution, a machine-learning-based search platform, among other tools.

Some leave no stone unturned. DeepSense, based in San Francisco and India, uses AI to analyze a job candidate's behavior on social media everything from choice of words, to whether they ask questions or express opinions, share links or original posts as a proxy for deducing underlying personality traits. Likewise, Utah-based HireVue offers an AI algorithm that compares job seekers' tone of voice, word choices and facial expressions with top performing employees.

"The HR space is going through a seismic shift," with recruiters becoming technology buyers, Ms. Novoselsky said.

Over the past five years, CareerBuilder has hired more than 200 data scientists, engineers and machine-learning specialists, tasked with creating smart applications that more effectively match candidates with jobs, said Ms. Novoselsky. She joined the company in 2017 as chief operating officer and was named to the top post in September.

Last year, it had 200 million unique visitors and placed 6.6 million jobs globally, and is currently serving 90% of Fortune 1000 companies in 185 markets world-wide, the company said.

Its secret weapon? More than a quarter-century worth of data from online job postings, rsums, applications, wages, benefits and more, Ms. Novoselsky said.

"There's a big misnomer around AI, in that it's really just an engine," she said. "But it needs data to become a smart engine."

The spread of digital technology and online tools, which generate that data, also has made it easier for job seekers to fire off countless applications, while enabling employers to cast an ever wider net for applicants. The recruiting process has been transformed into a massive undertaking.

Ms. Novoselsky said a shortcoming of many automated HR systems is that they filter applications based on single search terms without context such as "graduate," "Java" or "multimedia" and fail to significantly narrow the field of candidates.

They also tend to trip over misleading or unrecognized terms used in rsums or cover letters, she adds. For instance, a rsum may cite a candidate's experience as a greeter at a theme park that refers to its paying guests as "clients." Most systems wouldn't know how to handle that, she said.

Textkernel, coupled with CareerBuilder 's store of candidate and jobs data, is able to search and identify strings of words and phrases to spot entire patterns of employment history, skills and experience, along with location rather than single words or terms. As such, it is able to pare down the list of potential job candidates to a more manageable amount, Ms. Novoselsky said.

CareerBuilder has rolled out the tool for some of its talent acquisition services, but expects it to be fully integrated in all of its tools within the next year, she said.

Wells Fargo Breaks Down Internal Audit Silos to Fend Off Scandals; Changes to the 'third line of defense' are meant to address previous gaps in oversight

Wells Fargo & Co.'s 103-page business-standards report, released this week to address changes the bank has made in response to a string of scandals, revealed nuanced changes to the company's system of internal checks.

The tweaks to the San Francisco company's internal auditing team a unit known as the "third line of defense" in risk parlance led to the creation of several new teams, including one that focuses exclusively on identifying inconsistent consumer practices.

The changes illustrate how the portfolio of risks facing banks is expanding, and how auditors are being organized to manage them.

Alterations within the company's auditing division, in place for months but disclosed Wednesday, are part of a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-is-working-hard-to-rebuild-trust-11548886641" to improve risk management at Wells Fargo.

The lender has been fighting to improve its reputation following a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-to-pay-states-about-575-million-to-settle-customer-harm-claims-11546016757" throughout the bank, including in retail banking, wealth management and foreign exchange.

The company in September 2016 paid $185 million to settle allegations that it created unauthorized customer accounts. Since then, it has disclosed that it previously overcharged auto and mortgage borrowers, among other problems, leading to billions in fines and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargos-chief-administrative-officer-auditor-on-leaves-of-absence-1540414804" of several senior executives.

As a result, the company consolidated its retail-banking auditing team under a centralized group in an effort to break down silos and have a broader view of risk across the business, according to a company spokesman. Auditors in that group previously were assigned to niche areas, such as home lending.

The restructuring shows how the company is addressing gaps in the previous system, said Will Callender, a partner in the financial institutions division at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. "They have organized themselves in a way that directly addresses some of the challenges they have had," he said.

Wells Fargo also created new teams to focus on issues such as board-level governance and capital management. Additionally, it created an audit services division that specializes in testing and data analytics.

"Those functions existed, but they were part of other audit functions," said Mark Folk, a company spokesman. "We broke those out to give them more attention."

Over the past two years, the bank has increased head count within its auditing division by about one-third, to 1,350 employees, Mr. Folk said. And it changed the way it manages risks, including by adding more experienced directors to its board-level risk committee.

Companies that have survived a crisis, such as banks in the aftermath of the mortgage meltdown, often revamp risk-management priorities to account for the challenges they have previously faced, experts said. The challenge facing auditing divisions is finding a way to account for future threats.

"It is not uncommon that companies are always tending to organize to fight the last war," said Richard Chambers, chief executive of the Institute of Internal Auditors, who said the changes at Wells Fargo are in line with industry standards.

It is impossible to know if the changes can stave off future scandals at the bank, said Cliff Rossi, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business and a former risk executive at Citigroup.

"A lot will remain to be seen as to how well they execute," he said.

Private equity-backed U.S. TelePacific Holdings Corp., which operates as TPx Communications, is choosing the blank check company path to the public markets.

The company agreed to combine with special purpose acquisition company Pensare Acquisition Corp., to become publicly traded on the Nasdaq exchange with an implied enterprise value of $1.1 billion, according to a press release. The company will continue to be led by Chief Executive Dick Jalkut and Chief Financial Officer Tim Medina. Pensare Chief Executive Darrell Mays will become vice chairman of the combined company's board of directors.

TPx started in 1998 as a competitive local exchange carrier, providing telephone services to small and midsize businesses. The Los Angeles-based company has since evolved to provide managed services that monitor and deliver information-technology infrastructure for organizations. Today, about 65% of the TPx's revenue comes from managed services, said Mr. Jalkut who has led the company since 2002.

As TPx's conversion to a managed services provider progressed, the company believed it was an opportune time to go public, Mr. Jalkut said. Combining with Pensare is giving it a faster route to the public marketplace.

TPx originally received a $125 million investment from Investcorp back in 2000 and in 2017 had retained investment banks to explore a sale, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-backed-tpx-communications-weighs-sale-1495625401". At that time, Mr. Jalkut said TPx also weighed the option to go public but ultimately decided it wasn't ready.

"It was a  show me' story more than a  tell me' story," Mr. Jalkut said, explaining that the company's strong performance in the second half of 2018 gave the team conviction that the time was finally right for a public listing. Moving forward, TPx plans to fuel growth by expanding its geographic footprint and service offerings.

TPx is projected to generate between $701 million and $711 million of revenue and between $135 million to $140 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2019, according to the release.

TPx's current shareholders, including Investcorp, will remain equity holders in the combined entity. Pensare will pay $248 million in cash and $95 million in stock to the equity holders of TPx upon the closing of the proposed transaction.

TPx isn't the only private-equity portfolio company that has sought to go public by merging with a SPAC this year.

Fed Holds Rates Steady | Central Banks Pivot in Tandem | U.S. Economy Is Slowing | The Fed's Mysterious Pause; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Thursday, January 31, 2019

Good day. The Federal Reserve held rates steady and signaled it may continue to do so for some time, as it concluded its policy meeting Wednesday. The central bank dropped explicit references to future interest-rate increases that have been in its policy statements since it started lifting its benchmark rate in 2015. The Fed's step away from rate increases comes as economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal see the U.S. economy growing slower than the 3% rate posted through much of last year.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged, Signals Possible End to String of Rate Increases

The Federal Reserve indicated Wednesday that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-leaves-rates-unchanged-signals-pause-on-future-increases-11548874931" raising interest rates for now, fueling a market rally. Officials voted to hold their benchmark rate steady and delivered an about-face from their policy stance six weeks earlier. Last month, they raised their benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 2.25% and 2.5% and signaled two more rate rises were likely this year. "The case for raising rates has weakened somewhat," Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the Fed's policy meeting. He declined, when asked, to say whether the Fed's next rate move was more likely to be an increase or a cut. "It's going to depend entirely on the data," he said.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chairman-jerome-powells-postmeeting-press-conference-11548884492"

"http://www.wsj.com/pro/centralbanking/graphics/fed-statement-tracker/?1234565662334&mod=article_inline"

"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/federal-reserve-january-meeting-2019?mod=article_inline&mod=hp_lead_pos1&mod=article_inline"

Analysis: The Fed's Mysterious Pause

The Federal Reserve's monetary tightening hasn't just paused; "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-feds-mysterious-pause-11548893175?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", writes Greg Ip for The Wall Street Journal. That's the most logical conclusion to draw from the statement released after the central bank's meeting Wednesday and Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference. Fed statements often contain a "bias," a hint of whether the next interest rate move will be up or down. Wednesday's had none: The Fed will be "patient as it determines what future adjustments" to make to rates, it said.

Central Banks Pivot in Tandem, Postponing Stimulus Plans

A slowing global economy and low inflation has central banks around the world "https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-banks-pivot-in-tandem-postponing-stimulus-plans-to-fuel-growth-11548930601?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" to gradually pull back financial stimulus from markets and the banking system. The role reversal could support the economy in the months ahead and bolster markets and sectors like housing and autos.

Fed Makes Rate-Control Tool Kit Essentially Permanent

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it official Wednesday that the central bank will continue to use its current monetary policy rate-control tool kit for a long time to come.

"The committee made the fundamental decision today to continue indefinitely using our current operating procedure for implementing monetary policy," Mr. Powell said at the start of his press conference after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

When the Fed first implemented the system that puts a hard high and low end around short-term rates, it was billed as a temporary way to set monetary policy in a world where its crisis-era stimulus policies had left the banking system flooded with reserves. Those actions sidelined the Fed's precrisis method of setting short-term rates, wherein it added or subtracted reserves as necessary to influence a market-set federal-funds rate.

The current system uses a rate that it pays banks to park reserves on its books to determine the high end of the range, and a similar rate it pays to money funds to set the low end. It describes this as its fed-funds target rate range, and it's now set at between 2.25% and 2.5%.

But the implementation has been tricky. Market forces have caused the fed-funds rate to trade at the high end of the target range, so the Fed has been forced to tweak the interest on excess reserves rate paid to banks. The central bank has lowered that IOER rate relative to the top end of the fed-funds range to ensure the funds rate doesn't drift too high.

It's a complicated system, and now it's here to stay.

"Settling this central question clears the way for the FOMC to address a number of further questions regarding the remaining stages of balance-sheet normalization," Mr. Powell said.

The Fed's current system "https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-academics-warn-fed-on-risks-of-current-rate-control-tools-11545162881?mod=searchresults&page=3&pos=6". They see the rates the Fed is paying to banks and money funds as a de facto subsidy to those firms, and they worry that the higher rates go, the bigger the payout.

Others see the system as unwieldy and implemented incorrectly, citing the difficulty the Fed already has had in keeping the fed-funds rate in line. Some critics say the old system was best in part because everyone was experienced with it, it let markets do a lot of the work, and it provided the Fed and banks an insight into the health of other firms that wanted to trade reserves back and forth.

Still, the Fed has made its decision. Now the attention flows to a finalization of its balance-sheet plans.

U.S. Economy Is Slowing, Survey Says

The U.S. economy's brief flirtation with 3% growth "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economy-is-slowing-survey-says-11548855001", economists say, cut short by a dimming global outlook, market tremors and sluggish business investment. Gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S., grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter, economists estimate in a Wall Street Journal survey conducted this week. Output will grow at a 1.8% clip in the first quarter and a 2.5% rate in the second quarter, according to the poll. That would average out to 2.3% growth for the nine-month period through this June not bad, but slower than the 3% growth notched in the year through last September.

Government Updates Timing for Data Releases Delayed by Shutdown

The U.S. Census Bureau"https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-updates-timing-for-data-releases-delayed-by-shutdown-11548863250" for some of its economic-data reports that were halted during the partial government shutdown, and it canceled other scheduled releases. Among the reports rescheduled: Data on November new-home sales will be published Thursday, and the report on November international trade will be released Feb. 6. The bureau canceled its November advance economic indicators report and preliminary steel report, both of which were scheduled for release last month.

Wells Fargo Is  Working Hard' to  Rebuild Trust'

By Emily Glazer

Wells Fargo & Co. on Wednesday "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-is-working-hard-to-rebuild-trust-11548886641?tesla=y" it has taken to address problems following a series of scandals that have resulted in more than $4 billion in fines and settlements since 2016 and tougher scrutiny from regulators.

The company again apologized for the problems that emerged in nearly all of its business lines, some of which resulted in improper customer charges and are still under government investigation.

"While we have made strong progress in our efforts to rebuild trust, our work to improve Wells Fargo will never be done," the bank said in a roughly 100-page report. Wells Fargo said it continues to review areas across the bank "to identify and remedy problems."

The report was in response to shareholder requests about 18 months ago. It addressed problems and resulting changes to the bank's culture, employee structure, risk management and board oversight.

Problems erupted at the San Francisco-based bank in September 2016, when it was disclosed that branch employees opened perhaps millions of fake accounts without customers' knowledge. Since then, problems have emerged in nearly every major business in the bank, from mortgage to foreign exchange to wealth management.

Wells Fargo remains under an unprecedented enforcement action from the Federal Reserve capping the bank's growth. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said in January he expects the bank to remain under the cap through the rest of 2019, much longer than initially anticipated.

Wells Fargo said it is taking steps to improve inconsistencies in how it has handled customer complaints and refunds, which have added up to about $1 billion since the sales scandal. The Wall Street Journal previously reported problems with auto-loan customer refunds.

The bank said it would roll out a new system in the fourth quarter of 2019 to better handle customer complaints. It said it also has strengthened its platform for employees to anonymously report problems. Employees have said they have been retaliated against for reporting problems through that system over the years.

The report also detailed changes in compensation that encompass risk management, including after an executive leaves the bank.

The bank said it would better monitor and respond to regulatory warnings. Its audit group, under new leadership, will play a key role in challenging management on those actions, monitoring progress and other related matters. Wells Fargo received a regulatory knock in recent months focusing on its technology oversight, including concerns over a number of unresolved regulatory warnings.

"We acknowledge that we have not always met the expectations of some of our regulators in recent years and are working hard to address regulatory matters and rebuild trust," the report said.

Goldman Feasts at Expense of Food-Company Client, Suit Claims

By Gretchen Morgenson

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-feasts-at-expense-of-food-company-client-suit-claims-11548884825?tesla=y" ahead of that of a corporate client in advising on a wholesale-food company acquisition last year, a new lawsuit alleges.

The suit, filed by United Natural Foods Inc., accuses Goldman of improperly extracting more than $200 million in advising the Providence, R.I., food distributor on its $3 billion acquisition of grocery chain Supervalu Inc.

At issue is a roughly $2 billion financing loan Goldman arranged for United Natural on the deal. The company alleges that Goldman arranged the financing in a way that hurt United Natural but benefited the financial firm and its hedge-fund clients that had placed bets in the credit-default swap market against Supervalu. The company also accuses Goldman of taking advantage of the deal's provisions to extract more money from United Natural.

In a statement, a Goldman spokeswoman said the firm "believes that these claims are entirely without merit. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these accusations."

The suit mirrors questions raised by Congress and others after the financial crisis about Goldman's duty to clients. Goldman, which paid a $550 million penalty over a specific deal called Abacus, says it has since changed its operations and disclosures. The suit also raises fresh concerns about the potential for manipulation in the $10 trillion market for credit-default swaps, which are contracts designed to reduce the risk of losses when an entity defaults on its debt.

The suit, filed Wednesday in a New York state court, provides a glimpse of the allegedly aggressive tactics Goldman took with United Natural. When the company, which also had legal representation on the deal, objected to changes Goldman made in loan terms related to the deal, for example, it alleges that Stephan J. Feldgoise, Goldman's co-head of mergers for the Americas, warned the company that "things would get ugly."

Through the spokeswoman, Mr. Feldgoise declined to comment.

Goldman currently is embroiled in controversy over outsize fees it generated underwriting bonds issued by 1MDB, a Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund at the center of an international bribery scandal. Last month, prosecutors in Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman, citing securities-law violations.

Goldman has denied the 1MDB allegations and is fighting them.

Goldman's mergers-advisory unit and its bank were hired to work on the United Natural deal. The company initially agreed to pay Goldman's advisory unit $11.4 million and a Goldman bank unit $14.5 million, plus an additional $5.3 million for being lead arranger on the financing loan. If Goldman was unable to syndicate the loan, it and other lenders would have to fund the loan themselves.

Originally, the deal called for United Natural to retire Supervalu's $1.6 billion in debt. To investors who had bet against Supervalu in the credit-default swap market, this was disastrous they stood to lose big if the debt was extinguished. Some $470 million in Supervalu credit-default swaps was outstanding at the time of the deal, the suit said.

Instead of retiring the Supervalu debt, Goldman instead persuaded United Natural to add Supervalu as a co-borrower on the loan, the suit said, keeping Supervalu CDS trades alive.

Only after the deal closed, the suit contended, did United Natural learn that Goldman had hedge-fund clients holding the Supervalu CDS, which doubled in value when the deal terms added Supervalu as a co-borrower.

Some of those same hedge-fund clients also bought into the United Natural financing loan, the suit alleged.

As a result, United Natural said in the suit, those holders now have an incentive to "manufacture" a default on the United Natural debt to win their CDS bets against the company though no hedge-fund holder has done so.

Such so-called manufactured defaults are becoming more common in the CDS market, raising questions about the reliability of these instruments. Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a public statement that intentional defaults, created to generate profits on a CDS trade but unrelated to a company's financial health, could constitute market manipulation.

The suit against Goldman also alleges that the firm used its control over the financing to extract more money from United Natural.

A person familiar with Goldman's thinking said that structuring the financing as it did was necessary to get lenders' participation.

Under the financing provisions, Goldman could hike the loan's interest rate by 1.25 percentage points to make it more attractive to investors.

Another provision allowed Goldman to claim an additional $40.5 million from United Natural if it didn't have a full 15 days to fund the loan and was unsuccessful in raising the money.

Goldman marketed the loan against an Oct. 15 deadline, during a period of turmoil in the stock market. A few days before the deadline, the suit said, Goldman's Mr. Feldgoise told United Natural that Goldman was having difficulty attracting investors and asked for concessions.

When United Natural refused, the suit said, Mr. Feldgoise told United Natural's Chief Executive Steven Spinner that his company had forced Goldman into "full risk-mitigation mode."

Goldman then raised the interest rate on the loan by 1.5 percentage points, adding $183 million in interest costs over the life of the loan. The firm also contended there was a second marketing period on the loan, allowing it to add $40.5 million to the deal's costs, which Goldman withheld from the deal proceeds.

In the suit, United Natural alleged that Goldman "consolidated its command over all aspects of the transaction, enabling it to ensure its own profits to the detriment" of United Natural and its shareholders.

United Natural expected Goldman "to provide ethical counsel and unbiased support" of the deal, said Mr. Spinner, "not leverage their positions to pursue larger profits for themselves and other clients at our expense and ongoing damage."

New York Insurers Can Evaluate Your Social Media Use if They Can Prove Why It's Needed

By Leslie Scism

New York's top financial regulator is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-insurers-can-evaluate-your-social-media-useif-they-can-prove-why-its-needed-11548856802?tesla=y" life insurers to use data from social media and other nontraditional sources when setting premium rates, though the insurers will have to prove the information doesn't unfairly discriminate against certain customers.

New York is the first state to set specific guidance governing how life insurers use algorithms to comb through everything from homeownership records to credit scores and internet use in an effort to size up an applicant's risk. At least a couple dozen insurers are employing these automated programs to speed up the buying process, facilitate online life-insurance issuance and boost stagnant policy sales.

The regulator's goal, according to New York Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo, is to establish ground rules before the use of this information becomes more widespread.

"Because this is a rapidly evolving area in insurance underwriting, it was important for the department to create general principles now," she said in an interview.

Under guidance released earlier this month, life insurers will have to use statistical and actuarial analysis to determine that any algorithms and data are free of bias against racial minorities and other groups protected by law. Insurers can't accept an outside vendor's claim that its process is fair, the department said.

The guidance applies to companies operating in New York, but industry consultants said it could have an impact beyond the state's borders. New York has one of the largest insurance departments in the state-regulated industry. Regulators issue new guidance when they want to clarify how new developments affect existing laws.

"Everybody will pay attention," said Tom Scales, a practice leader for life insurance at Celent, an insurance-technology research and advice firm that is part of Marsh & McLennan Co s.

Trade groups said they are studying the directive. Insurers would "continue to explore ways to help more Americans benefit from financial protection," said Mary Griffin, president of the Life Insurance Council of New York. "Algorithmic underwriting can make it easier and quicker for people to get coverage in place."

New York's guidance follows an 18-month investigation in which regulators queried 160 life insurers about their practices. The department's regulators found a range of data in use: homeownership records, credit information, educational attainment, civil judgments, licensures and other public filings.

Only one insurer out of the 160 said it was using social media, retail purchases or internet activities in underwriting, according to a person familiar with the department's findings.

The department also learned that some vendors are pitching data to insurers that includes "condition or type of an applicant's electronic devices" and "how the consumer appears in a photograph," it said in material posted on its website.

"All have the potential to reflect disguised and illegal race-based underwriting," the department said of the various categories of nontraditional data. New York insurance laws have long prohibited the use of race in underwriting.

Consultants said the use of social media in underwriting decisions is limited so far. "The data exists and is being collected, but the quality and the integrity of that data is not yet demonstrated to be accurate enough to be an underwriting input at this time," said Ari Chester, a partner at McKinsey & Co.

Instead, many insurers are relying on a trove of public information. LexisNexis Risk Solutions said more than 30 insurers are using a model it developed that draws on motor-vehicle records; bankruptcy, criminal and other court documents; professional licenses; college-attendee records, property deeds and tax filings; liens and evictions and other records.

The tool doesn't use anything from social media, said Elliott Wallace, a LexisNexis Risk Solutions vice president. LexisNexis, he added, is "comfortable with the department scrutinizing and looking at our models."

Ms. Vullo's department said information that is directly related to medical conditions such as prescription-drug databases is permissible, as are motor-vehicle reports and some criminal matters. Traffic fatalities are a leading cause of death for younger people.

Other regulators are also keeping an eye on developments with life insurers. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a standards-setting group for state insurance departments, has a "Big Data Working Group" that is in early stages of focusing on life insurers' accelerated underwriting efforts, among other issues.

Malaysia's Securities Commission Fines Deloitte Over Breaches Tied to 1MDB

By Yantoultra Ngui and Samuel Rubenfeld

Malaysia's securities regulator "https://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysias-securities-commission-fines-deloitte-over-breaches-tied-to-1mdb-11548882601?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" on Deloitte PLT for four breaches related to an Islamic bond program issued by a unit of state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB.

The penalties mark the first time action has been taken against an auditing firm over 1MDB in Malaysia. Billions were siphoned from the fund and spread around the world on real estate, art, a superyacht and other assets.

Since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad came into office last May, Malaysia has reopened and accelerated probes related to the financial scandals surrounding 1MDB, which is also under investigation in several other countries, including the U.S. and Switzerland.

The penalties on Deloitte also come amid heightened scrutiny over the quality of audits by the Big Four accounting firms.

Deloitte failed to discharge its statutory obligation despite discovering irregularities when auditing the 2.4 billion-ringgit ($583.8 million) program issued by the unit, called Bandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd., the Securities Commission said. The regulator fined Deloitte 2.2 million ringgit, or about $535,000.

Representatives of Deloitte in Malaysia and the U.S. didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Deloitte was the statutory auditor for Bandar Malaysia and its parent, 1MDB Real Estate Sdn Bhd., now known as TRX City Sdn Bhd., for their fiscal years ending March 31, 2015 and 2016.

Bandar Malaysia was involved in the development of a transportation hub project in Kuala Lumpur for a high-speed rail link with Singapore. The project was subsequently suspended following the change in government.

The U.S. probe of 1MDB has led to criminal charges against fugitive Malaysian businessman Jho Low, the suspected mastermind of the financial frauds at 1MDB, as well as against a former banker at Goldman Sachs. Another former Goldman banker has pleaded guilty. The bank is under a U.S. investigation; it has said it was misled by 1MDB officials and will fight the charges.

Goldman's chief executive has apologized to the people of Malaysia for its role in the scandal, but the country's finance minister rejected the apology and demanded $7.5 billion in penalties to resolve criminal charges against the investment bank filed in Malaysia.

The Big Four accounting firms have come under increasing scrutiny recently over the quality of their audits, despite reporting in 2018 their strongest revenue growth since at least the financial crisis.

U.K. regulators late last year proposed sweeping changes to rules governing British audit firms.

In the U.S., audit regulators said they had found serious deficiencies in nearly half the KPMG LLP audits they scrutinized in their last two years of inspections. KPMG said audit quality "has been and continues to be a top priority across all levels" of the firm.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP last year was ordered to pay $625.3 million in damages for failing to catch a fraud scheme that caused one of the biggest bank failures of the financial crisis. The firm at the time said it was disappointed with the ruling and would file an appeal; litigation in the case is ongoing, according to court records.

And Ernst & Young LLP last week said it was creating an independent panel to advise it on how to improve its audits.

High-Wire Audit Looms as Regulators Scrutinize KPMG and GE

By David Benoit

Accounting giant KPMG LLP has been blessing the books of General Electric Co. for 110 years, but the audit currently under way "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kpmgs-high-wire-ge-audit-11548856801?tesla=y" for both companies.

KPMG is under fire for a string of audit failures and scandals, highlighted again Friday in a set of scathing reports by the nation's top accounting regulator, which is demanding KPMG increase its skepticism and improve the quality of work, particularly at big, complicated clients like GE.

A tough audit is the last thing GE needs right now. Investors have already been concerned about more unknowns bubbling up. The conglomerate is trying to increase cash, pare debt and return to growth. More bad news could hamper those efforts or provide evidence for investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, which are probing GE's accounting decisions.

GE is set to release its fourth-quarter numbers on Thursday. As with most quarterly earnings, those numbers won't be officially audited. But, in one of the biggest and most lucrative audits of any company, hundreds of KPMG partners and staff are poring over GE's books in preparation for the company's annual audited results, likely released in late February.

KPMG hasn't been named in the GE investigations, but the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, released several reports Friday calling into question KPMG's work on similar issues.

The reports said PCAOB found problems in nearly half of the 103 KPMG audits it inspected from 2016 and 2017 and said improvements it ordered in prior years hadn't been made. The regulator also disclosed new details on the impact of leaks from the PCAOB about what audits would be reviewed, which helped KPMG prepare for the annual inspections.

KPMG said in a letter to PCAOB that it has taken significant steps, including management and board changes, to improve its processes.

A spokesman said it couldn't comment on GE specifically but that "We are confident that our audits and reviews were appropriately performed in accordance with applicable professional standards, and we stand behind our work."

The PCAOB reports don't name specific clients of the auditor, and it wasn't clear if the regulator had inspected or found any issues with KPMG's work related to GE, which said it doesn't believe its audit is involved.

But the reports criticize how KPMG policed its clients over the accounting questions that are central to the GE probes: How did GE decide when to book revenue and how to value assets, and why were the assumptions behind those decisions too optimistic?

GE has said it is cooperating with the probes and that it hasn't found evidence of wrongdoing. The company said it would consider new auditors for 2020.

GE has said the government investigators are looking at how it booked revenue from service contracts in its power business, which builds turbines used by electricity generators and sells longtime contracts to service them.

In the PCAOB reports, the most frequent area of trouble was KPMG's work on how clients decided to book revenue, which came up 18 times in 103 audits.

The investigators are also looking at a $22 billion write-down GE took on its 2015 acquisition of French company Alstom 's power business.

The PCAOB four times faulted KPMG for the work it did while checking clients' assumptions when assigning value to acquired assets.

In another thread of the auditing probes, GE is facing scrutiny over a $15 billion increase to its reserves for long-term care insurance policies, which cover care like nursing homes and proved more expensive than much of the industry expected. GE has said the need for more reserves was discovered following a sudden spike in claims that differed from historical trends.

In the 2017 report, the PCAOB cited KPMG for failing to adequately test an insurance client's use of historical data to estimate future insurance claims.

For KPMG, the report was the latest blow to its reputation amid many scandals, including the leak from the PCAOB about audit reviews. Three people, including a former KPMG partner, have pleaded guilty to criminal charges; two other former partners still face charges.

The regulator said that leak led to a review of 10 new KPMG audits from 2016. The inspections turned up problems in nine of those audits.

No matter what happens with the SEC and Justice Department investigations or the current audit, KPMG's bottom line is already likely to take a hit.

GE paid KPMG $142.9 million in 2017, the biggest total audit fee for any company regulated by the SEC, according to Audit Analytics. The fee was higher than in recent years due to work done on GE's efforts to break off assets. GE has been one of the 10 most lucrative audits in each of the past five years, Audit Analytics data said.

The GE audit was so important to KPMG that roughly 400 partners worked on it last year, according to GE's financial disclosures. But the importance of GE to KPMG raised questions among investors about auditor independence, and whether the accounting firm would stand up to GE's aggressive accounting maneuvers.

The pressure was clear inside KPMG, where people who worked there said a well-known phrase among executives was, "you don't want to be the partner who lost the GE account."

Powell Now Owns the Fed's Balance-Sheet Problem

Arguably, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's most significant statement on Wednesday came when he "https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-now-owns-the-feds-balance-sheet-problem-11548881952?tesla=y" on the central bank's balance-sheet normalization, Spencer Jakab writes for The Wall Street Journal. "The signal was that so-called quantitative tightening would continue for now but end sooner than expected. Moreover, he also raised the possibility that the balance sheet could be  an active tool' in the future if warranted in other words, more bond purchases if markets or the economy cry out for help. Until recently, Fed officials had been insisting the balance-sheet shrinkage was on autopilot. The new stance also is a huge shift from Mr. Powell's stance as a Fed governor back in January 2013...He warned at the time...that the policies risked  driving securities above fundamental values' and that  there is every reason to expect a sharp and painful correction.' With stocks nearly entering a bear market following the December meeting, it seems he was right. Now, though, taming the Fed's monster balance sheet is Mr. Powell's problem."

Stock Exchanges to Fire Company Building Stock-Market Supercomputer; Finra to take over the Consolidated Audit Trail from Thesys Technologies

WASHINGTON Stock exchanges intend to fire the contractor they hired to build a data warehouse for all U.S. stock-market activity, the latest sign of trouble for a project designed to detect trading fraud and causes behind wild swings in prices.

People familiar with the matter said the exchanges have lost confidence in Thesys Technologies LLC, a startup "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thesys-to-build-system-tracking-all-stock-and-options-orders-1484678642", known as the Consolidated Audit Trail. The Securities and Exchange Commission told the exchanges to create the database so it would have a complete picture of orders in the stock and options markets, a tool they have never had.

In November, Thesys "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-market-supercomputer-to-launch-with-glitches-1542236446" one year late and without the functionality that was expected.

The exchanges overseeing the contract confirmed Thursday that they are switching to a new vendor. The group said Thesys "is providing necessary services through the transition period." The exchanges are evaluating how the switch will affect coming deadlines, including one that calls for the biggest brokerage firms to report orders to the data warehouse this year.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which regulates U.S. broker-dealers, is expected to take over the project, according to the people familiar with the matter. The committee of exchanges doesn't have a signed agreement with Finra yet, the people said. A Finra spokesman declined to comment.

Thesys said the decision to end the contract was mutual. "The parties have irreconcilable differences," said Silvia Davi, a Thesys spokeswoman.

The SEC mandated in 2012 that stock and options exchanges build the audit trail. The SEC had been embarrassed by its dearth of market data following the May 2010 flash crash. It took the federal regulator over four months to piece together causes of that episode.

The SEC, which declined to comment Thursday, announced earlier this week that it hired a czar to coordinate its oversight of the project. The employee, Manisha Kimmel, is an expert in trading technology who previously led a consortium of Wall Street banks and broker-dealers that implement complex technology solutions.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said several times that he was disappointed in the project's delays. Mr. Clayton said this week that Ms. Kimmel "will further enhance the commission's ability to effectively oversee" the exchanges' work on the audit trail.

New York-based Thesys is a provider of high-speed trading platforms and analytics software. It beat out two other finalists seeking to build the supercomputer. Finra was initially seen as the favorite to win the contract, but the New York Stock Exchange favored Thesys, people familiar with the matter said.

The relationship between the exchanges and Thesys has been strained, with disputes over how much money Thesys was owed for the work it has done. Work also "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trading-database-could-be-delayed-due-to-data-security-hitches-1507248613" by conflict over the technical specifications of the database.

The executives who founded Thesys previously ran a trading company, Tradeworx, that provided the SEC with a data feed capturing most exchange-based activity. The system, known as the Market Information Data Analytics System, doesn't capture orders that occur on private trading venues known as dark pools. Only about 62% of equities trading occurs on fully regulated exchanges.

Finra already operates surveillance programs that are similar to the audit trail, although their databases don't see some activity that occurs away from exchanges and regulated over-the-counter venues.

The data warehouse has also had to contend with concerns it could become a prime target for hackers. The repository will include order data that could allow sophisticated third parties to piece together an institution's trading strategy or portfolio mix. It also will include data about the individual customers behind trades, information that has typically been known only to brokers.

New Details on Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Health Venture Emerge in Court Battle; Health-care venture may build its own solutions, court filings in UnitedHealth's lawsuit against a former executive reveal

BOSTON Health giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. went to court Wednesday to try to stop a former executive from working for a company it sees as a competitor, the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-to-partner-on-health-care-1517315659" by Amazon.com Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The scope of the still-unnamed venture remains hazy beyond stated goals to improve health care and rein in costs for employees. But filings related to the case and court testimony offer some fresh clues about the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/triple-threat-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-rattle-health-care-firm-1517359502", including that it may build its own solutions if what it needs isn't available elsewhere.

In court, the new hire at issue said the venture is focused on serving the three founding companies and isn't competing with UnitedHealth's Optum health-services unit to sell services or products. Court filings indicate the venture is examining third-party vendors' products and combining them in ways to boost value for the founding companies.

Optum filed a lawsuit in Boston federal court this month seeking a temporary restraining order to keep former employee David W. Smith from working at the new venture or sharing trade secrets.

Optum alleged in its lawsuit that Mr. Smith, who spent 2 years working in Optum's corporate strategy and product units before resigning last month, violated a noncompete agreement by joining the new venture. Optum also accused Mr. Smith of improperly accessing confidential documents before departing for the new venture, which filings referred to as ABC.

Mr. Smith denied the allegations in court filings and court testimony, saying he didn't leave Optum with any company files and doesn't want or have any use for that information in his current job at ABC. Mr. Smith has asked the court to order arbitration.

During the daylong hearing, Mr. Smith described his new job, started this month, as focused on analyzing the employee patient pool among the three founding companies, which he said have significant health-care needs.

When U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf asked whether any innovative ideas would be scaled up and sold to the broader market, Mr. Smith said this wasn't on the near-term horizon.

"That's not the near-term goal," Mr. Smith said. He agreed when the judge asked if ABC could be a laboratory for finding new ways to deliver affordable care, but also "it could be the great solutions are already out there and it's about pulling out the right ones together."

The judge didn't rule on the restraining order request Wednesday, and the hearing is set to continue Thursday.

Jack Stoddard, the joint venture's chief operating officer, also offered some details of the new entity's operations in an affidavit filed to support Mr. Smith.

The venture is "currently using data, analytics, and expertise to combine products from third-party vendors," potentially including Optum, Mr. Stoddard said, and "if viable offerings or solutions do not exist in the market, ABC may consider building new solutions" or having vendors create them. He also said the venture isn't "profit-seeking."

The new venture is "evaluating potential health care solutions for the [founding companies'] over 1.2 million employees," said Mr. Stoddard in the filing.

Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan launched their health-care venture a year ago with a high-profile announcement that drove down the share values of a number of large health-care companies, including UnitedHealth, which is also the parent of the biggest U.S. health insurer.

Limited details have emerged about the new venture's potential scope. The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-berkshire-and-jpmorgan-pick-ceo-for-new-health-care-company-1529504379" naming prominent surgeon and researcher Atul Gawande as the venture's chief executive was another clue, but Dr. Gawande and others he has hired have kept their plans under wraps.

Optum, for its part, said in its lawsuit the new venture is a potentially significant rival. The startup is immediately poised to win health-services business from JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway, both current Optum clients, Optum said. The venture could become a major competitor in the longer run, the UnitedHealth unit claimed, by seeking business from other companies.

A lawyer for Mr. Smith argued during the court hearing that Optum's lawsuit aimed to intimidate its own workers and a perceived business threat.

Banking & Finance: New York Insurers to Comb Social Media

By Leslie Scism

New York's top financial regulator is going to allow life insurers to use data from social media and other nontraditional sources when setting premium rates, though the insurers will have to prove the information doesn't unfairly discriminate against certain customers.

New York is the first state to set specific guidance governing how life insurers use algorithms to comb through everything from homeownership records to credit scores and internet use in an effort to size up an applicant's risk. At least a couple dozen insurers are employing these automated programs to speed up the buying process, facilitate online life-insurance issuance and boost stagnant policy sales.

The regulator's goal, according to New York Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo, is to establish ground rules before the use of this information becomes more widespread.

"Because this is a rapidly evolving area in insurance underwriting, it was important for the department to create general principles now," she said in an interview.

Under guidance released this month, life insurers will have to use statistical and actuarial analysis to determine that any algorithms and data are free of bias against racial minorities and other groups protected by law. Insurers can't accept an outside vendor's claim that its process is fair, the department said.

The guidance applies to companies operating in New York, but industry consultants said it could have an impact beyond the state's borders. New York has one of the largest insurance departments in the state-regulated industry. Regulators issue new guidance when they want to clarify how new developments affect existing laws.

"Everybody will pay attention," said Tom Scales, a practice leader for life insurance at Celent, an insurance-technology research and advice firm that is part of Marsh & McLennan Cos.

Trade groups said they are studying the directive. Insurers would "continue to explore ways to help more Americans benefit from financial protection," said Mary Griffin, president of the Life Insurance Council of New York. "Algorithmic underwriting can make it easier and quicker for people to get coverage in place."

New York's guidance follows an 18-month investigation in which regulators queried 160 life insurers about their practices. The department's regulators found a range of data in use: homeownership records, credit information, educational attainment, civil judgments, licensures and other public filings.

Only one insurer out of the 160 said it was using social media, retail purchases or internet activities in underwriting, according to a person familiar with the department's findings.

The department also learned that some vendors are pitching data to insurers that includes "condition or type of an applicant's electronic devices" and "how the consumer appears in a photograph," it said in material posted on its website.

"All have the potential to reflect disguised and illegal race-based underwriting," the department said of the various categories of nontraditional data.

Consultants said the use of social media in underwriting decisions is limited so far. "The data exists and is being collected, but the quality and the integrity of that data is not yet demonstrated to be accurate enough to be an underwriting input at this time," said Ari Chester, a partner at McKinsey & Co.

Instead, many insurers are relying on a trove of public information. LexisNexis Risk Solutions said more than 30 insurers are using a model it developed that draws on motor-vehicle records; bankruptcy, criminal and other court documents; professional licenses; college-attendee records, property deeds and tax filings; liens and evictions and other records.

Ms. Vullo's department said information that is directly related to medical conditions -- such as prescription-drug databases -- is permissible, as are motor-vehicle reports and some criminal matters. Traffic fatalities are a leading cause of death for younger people.

Other regulators are also keeping an eye on developments with life insurers. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a standards-setting group for state insurance departments, has a "Big Data Working Group" that is in early stages of focusing on life insurers' accelerated underwriting efforts, among other issues.

Apple teams with insurer Aetna to build health app

Technology

Apple will gain access to a huge trove of health data as part of an Apple Watch tie-up with US insurer Aetna.

CVS-owned Aetna and Apple have jointly developed an app called Attain, set to launch in the coming months. Attain will use the Apple Watch to provide personalised recommendations to users, based on their health history and live data generated by the watch, which offers heart-rate monitoring and workout tracking.

To comply with US data protection rules, Apple and Aetna have entered into a "business associate agreement" that includes assurances that no personally identifiable information will be shared with the iPhone maker and that it will not be sold, revealed to employers or used for making coverage decisions by Aetna.

The health information will be collected on a voluntary basis and only used to support the Attain programme, the companies added.

The deal marks the latest incursion by Silicon Valley into the healthcare sector, while insurance companies look to technology to improve preventive care that can ultimately reduce their payouts.

Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, said this month he believed Apple's "greatest contribution to mankind" would come from its work in healthcare.

Other tech companies share that ambition. Last year, Amazon acquired online pharmacy PillPack and partnered with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to create a not-forprofit healthcare company for employees. Earlier this month, Alphabet's life sciences unit Verily raised $1bn from investors including Silver Lake to expand its work in healthcare.

Using Attain will be voluntary for Aetna members but they will be provided incentives to join, including earning back the cost of the Apple Watch that is required to participate. Spurring sales of wearable devices including Apple Watch and AirPods is becoming more important for Apple at a time when iPhone revenues are slowing.

Users will be able to opt in to sharing Attain data and their broader health history with Apple, providing fuel for analytics and machine learning that the companies need to improve the service. The companies said that users' health data will be encrypted and will not be used for underwriting or calculating premiums.

"We believe that people should be able to play a more active role in managing wellbeing," said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer.

Insurance companies are hoping to use technology more broadly as a way to prevent losses from occurring.

For example, they aim to use "internet of things" technology in the home such as leak detectors that can alert homeowners at the first sign of a problem. And motor insurers have for some years installed so-called black boxes in cars to analyse how well the driver is performing.

They hope that such schemes will not only cut payouts but also lead to improved customer loyalty, which is a big problem in an industry where many people choose their insurer based only on price.

Cyber Daily: Angry Shareholders to Seek Proof of Prudent Cyber Tactics

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. Senior executives, along with members of the board, are more vulnerable to charges of shirking fiduciary responsibilities now that top leaders at the former Yahoo Inc. agreed to pay $29 million to settle claims from shareholders who accused them of such violations, reports WSJ Pro Cybersecurity's Adam Janofsky.

Shareholders, in a lawsuit filed a year ago, alleged that Yahoo leaders knew about data breaches at the company far earlier than they let on and didn't take steps to mitigate or stop harm. The monetary settlement is a first for this kind of lawsuit, Mr. Janofsky reports, and could open the way for similar lawsuits against companies after they report breaches. Top corporate leaders should be able to prove they have taken the right cybersecurity precautions at their companies and stay involved in cyber planning and response.

Directors, Top Executives Vulnerable to Cyber Lawsuits after Yahoo Settlement

By Adam Janofsky

The Jan. 4 settlement of a shareholder lawsuit against Yahoo Inc. related to large data breaches makes way for lawsuits against corporate executives and directors at firms that experience significant cyberattacks, according to Nathan Owens, a partner at Newmeyer & Dillion LLP.

Former directors and officers at Yahoo earlier this month agreed to pay $29 million to a group of shareholders to settle claims that they mishandled a series of data breaches that occurred mainly in 2013 and 2014 and were disclosed in 2016 and 2017. The shareholders charged that Yahoo directors and leaders shrugged off their fiduciary duties and knew of at least some of the breaches in 2015.

Verizon Communications Inc. bought some of Yahoo for $4.48 billion in June 2017. The remainder of the company is known as Altaba Inc.

Shareholder lawsuits following data breaches at other companies have resulted in changes to corporate governance and cybersecurity policies. The Yahoo settlement is the first time such a lawsuit has brought about a monetary payment, said Mr. Owens.

"What's different here is that there's money changing hands, and in this case it was pretty sizable," he said. "It sends a message that it's no longer going to be a slap on the wrist, and that there is real exposure here." Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a $35 million penalty against Altaba related to the handling of the Yahoo breaches, saying that Yahoo knew of at least one serious intrusion in 2014.

Mr. Owens discussed with WSJ Pro Cybersecurity why companies should expect to see more such lawsuits and how directors and executives can protect themselves. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Q:

How surprising is this settlement?

A:

These types of cases -- called derivative suits -- happen with some regularity. With situations like Enron, shareholders say:  You guys lied on your Securities and Exchange Commission filings, so when we were buying your stock it wasn't as valuable as you made it sound.' That's often what you see at the start of a derivative claim.

But we haven't seen a whole lot of these following a cyberattack, and we haven't seen any of those result in a cash settlement. The floodgates have opened now.

Q:

What are the lessons here for directors and executives?

A:

The biggest takeaway is that you need to protect yourself. This settlement is going to encourage lawsuits even when the leadership has done what they need to do. They need to have a good defense against claims that they didn't act prudently. So directors and officers must have a good cybersecurity protection plan in place, be aware of what's going on in the cybersecurity program, and involve themselves in that process.

Companies typically have directors and officers liability insurance, which protects against claims that they did not act prudently. But depending on how it's written, D&O policies may not provide coverage for this kind of claim. When you get into a new area like cybersecurity, you sometimes find out the hard way that you don't always have coverage. You're going to see companies ensure that their D&O policy covers this kind of situation. Fortunately for the directors and officers at Yahoo, theirs did. But if there isn't insurance, these people are going to have to write a check.

U.S. Authorities Unveil Sweeping Set of Charges Against China's Huawei

The Trump administration unveiled a sweeping set of criminal charges against China's Huawei Technologies Co. in its latest salvo against the telecom giant, with authorities unsealing a pair of indictments just days before U.S.-China trade talks are set to resume, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The U.S. says: Federal prosecutors accused Huawei of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and of stealing trade secrets from a U.S. company. The move includes charges against Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is being held in Vancouver after Canadian authorities arrested the executive because of a U.S. extradition request.

Chinese retaliation? The U.S.'s escalating, global campaign against Huawei has drawn in allies and enraged Beijing, which has detained a series of foreign citizens in recent weeks on suspicion of endangering China's national security in what analysts view as retaliatory measures. Chinese officials have denied any links between these actions and the pressure on Huawei, and the Chinese embassy in Washington didn't provide comment on the latest charges against the company. Huawei didn't provide comment and in the past denied accusations of spying and violating laws.

Bonuses for theft. In one indictment, the U.S. accused Huawei of stealing information from T-Mobile US Inc. about a phone-testing robot, "Tappy." Huawei offered bonuses to employees who were successful in stealing confidential information from other companies, U.S. prosecutors alleged.

Your essential weekly fintech briefing

Amid all the warm words about the benefits of fintechs and big banks co-operating more closely, in reality such happy harmony remains hard to achieve, as highlighted by the delays plaguing efforts to introduce a modern, real-time payments system in the US.

There was another Kumbaya moment for fintech and big banks at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, as leading execs from PayPal and Mastercard espoused the benefits of everyone coming together to work for a greater payments system.

 The role banks play I think is really critically important,  gushed PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready, describing the  massive amount of interest  companies like his have in partnering with banks so they can collectively  move much more quickly .

 There s a much greater objective here than saying let s split the pie that s here today,  he added, to the  absolute  agreement of his fellow panellist, Mastercard vice-chairman Ann Cairns.

Companies like Mr Ready s PayPal and Ms Cairn s Mastercard, which also owns Vocalink   which is behind the UK's real-time Faster Payments system   are growing much much faster than banks. In the US, for example, the top four banks increased revenues by an average of 3 per cent last year while the top four payments companies, led by Mastercard and PayPal, increased revenues by an average of 15 per cent.

But in the past few years, non-banks have become increasingly attuned to the virtues of their regulated competitors.

 (It s) that trust thing,  as Ms Cairns put it to delegates at the Alpine resort.  Who do you ultimately want to leave your money with? And that s the big question, regardless of how you re moving it around. 

Unlike fintechs, banks in many parts of the world offer the comfort of state-backed deposit guarantees.

From a consumer perspective, deeper co-operation between banks and fintechs would be welcome if it can speed up the pace of innovation, especially in the US where it still takes days for cheques and wire transfers to clear, payments shut down at the weekend and technologies like contactless card transactions are still in their infancy.

But the talk of common purpose has so far not been matched by action.

The Federal Reserve s payments gurus are currently reviewing an avalanche of suggestions from banks, fintechs, card companies, consumer groups and anyone else with an interest in overhauling the US s antiquated payments system.

The Fed s objective is to dramatically reduce how long it takes for workers to cash their pay cheques and for businesses to reap the rewards for their sales. The suggested fix is a real-time 24/7 payments system rather than the current one that operates only during business hours.

It is a laudable goal, and one which both banks and fintechs embrace, but the path ahead is a fraught one.

Banks, fintechs and just about everyone else agrees that universal adoption of a new faster payments infrastructure is key.  If you don t have ubiquity, you don t have a solution,  says a senior payments banker at one of America s biggest banks.

The problem?  There s a lot of confusion over who the dominant network should be,  says one fintech executive, lamenting the Fed s failure to take a  leadership role  and tell everyone in the payments ecosystem to back a single horse.

The Fed is still considering whether it should create faster payments infrastructure itself, or if a new system should be built around a private sector solution.

Craig Maurer, analyst at Autonomous, points out that The Clearing House launched the ACH faster payments network in 2017, but the system is still not used for retail payments   its market is interbank transfers, bill payments and other banking functions.

Since The Clearing House is owned by just 26 banks, Mr Maurer says  clearly the preference would be to see the Fed build something ubiquitous, that all banks have to use, and that they can influence .

Meanwhile back in Davos, on the same panel as Mr Ready and Ms Cairns, FundingCircle co-founder and CEO Samir Desai offered a contrarian argument to the folksy notion of bank and fintechs having their ebony and ivory moment.

 We re not as big as PayPal or Mastercard so a partnership between Funding Circle and a large bank is not necessarily a partnership of equals,  he said.

Funding Circle listed its shares in London last year and has a market cap north of 1bn. If even Mr Desai is wary of getting a raw deal from a big banks, where does that leave the average fintech?

One to watch: Thought Machine

The back-end plumbing powering banks  products is hardly the flashiest area of fintech, but it is one that is attracting growing amounts of interest. Lloyds Banking Group s ambitious plans for Thought Machine   a start-up it recently invested in   help show why, writes Nicholas Megaw.

Thought Machine s  Vault  core banking platform promises to be cheaper and easier to scale than the decades-old systems currently in use at most big banks, while stronger data analytics and smart contracts will let banks offer new, more tailored products.

It is one of several new companies in the space   rivals include Germany s Mambu, Ireland s Leveris and in the UK 10x Future Technologies, led by ex-Barclays chief Antony Jenkins.

Lloyds is planning to start small with the Vault platform, testing it by moving data on 500,000 customers from one of its discontinued brands, according to documents seen by the FT. But if all goes well it could be rolled out across Lloyds  business, a move the bank reckons could save it upwards of 750m a year   not a bad return from a 10m investment.

Still, if Thought Machine provides a good example of the potential opportunities in the sector, it also shows that the journey for new providers will not necessarily be plain sailing. The original company went into administration in 2017, and the group spent more than a year battling legal action from Capco, the consultancy. Capco, which was then owned by established banking technology provider FIS, had accused a former employee of stealing technology that it said was eventually used by Thought Machine. The lawsuit was settled out of court last September.

Number of the week: $20.5bn value of fintech investment in China last year according to new research from Fintech Global

Further fintech fascination

Regulators advance As bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies languish close to all-time lows, the UK s financial watchdog has decided that now is a good time to consult on how to protect consumers from the  substantial risks  of unauthorised sellers. The Financial Conduct Authority is worried that ads for crypto products are too glowing, and don t make the risks clear enough, and so the regulator plans to consult on further protections later in the year. Whether bitcoin will be worth anything at all by then remains to be seen.

Fundraising UK online wealth management pioneer Nutmeg has won another 45m from investors including Goldman Sachs and Hong Kong-based financial advisory group Convoy, paving the way for its Hong Kong launch later this year. Nutmeg has raised 116m since its 2012 launch, but has yet to turn a profit, despite growing to become the eight-largest wealth manager in the UK. This isn t the only online wealth bet Goldman is making of course   the Wall Street giant said in October that it would merge its online bank Marcus with its investment management arm, triggering speculation Goldman would launch its own robo adviser.

Trend watch Chinese peer-to-peer lenders listing in the US seem to be getting the cold shoulder from Wall Street. Bloomberg reports that big US banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have walked away from US initial public offerings for Chinese peer-to-peer markets, citing concerns about the uncertain outlook for peer-to-peer lenders and the depressing impact of a slump equity markets on valuations.

Frontier fintech Digital banking is finally coming to South Africa, as online upstarts stake their claim in a market that has traditionally been characterised by its high fees, writes the FT s Joseph Cotterill. One of them   the insurer Discovery   is even planning what its chief executive describes as  the world s first behavioural bank .

AOB Non-human traders are an easy scapegoat for volatile markets, but it s not all their fault, writes David Siegel, co-chairman of quantitative investment group Two Sigma in the FT. Algorithms aren t as mysterious as they might seem, and they don t deserve a reputation as bogeymen, he says. In fact, they can be better than humans in some circumstances, he argues, as stress never clouds their performance, and they never act on a hunch.

CHART TO START THE WEEK

One of the thorniest decisions facing an investment manager is whether to axe an uneconomic fund in which they have devoted time, resources and money.

Severe pressure on fund fees is forcing many managers to consider which products will stay viable. JPMorgan Asset Management said last year that it would reduce its range by about a quarter as part of a "simplify for growth" strategy.

Chris Willcox, chief executive of asset management at JPMorgan AM, predicted that other investment managers would be forced to shrink their ranges.

"High profit margins have cushioned managers from making tough decisions. Managers rarely shut funds, regardless of underperformance or obsolescence. This has led to a proliferation of mediocre products," said Mr Willcox.

Flowspring, a Denver analytics group, has developed a framework to help investment managers assess whether to shut an unprofitable fund or let it soldier on. About $5m a year in fee revenues is required for most mutual funds to remain viable, according to an industry rule of thumb.

Flowspring assessed the viability of 14,885 mutual funds globally, based on expense ratios, fee revenues, expected fee growth and the investment performance of the fund.

Flowspring recommended that no action be taken for most funds (10,084) as they were judged to be healthy. But 1,752 funds that have a question mark on profitability were tipped for merger or closure.

Backtested data found that close to half (47 per cent) of funds where Flowspring had recommended closure or merger fell below the $5m fees mark within a year.

On Flowspring's metrics, BlackRock, State Street, UBS, Invesco, Nuveen, Principal, Columbia Threadneedle, John Hancock and Natixis all have funds that could be axed.

Only Vanguard can avoid taking action due to its industry-leading low-cost base. Chris Flood

Tenfold increase in ETF sales for JPMorgan

JPMorgan's bid to join the top tier of exchange traded fundmanagers was boosted last year as the New Yorklisted groupincreased sales tenfold. The bank, which had some of the best-selling newly launched funds in 2018," has increased its efforts to regain assets lost to BlackRock and Vanguardover the past decade.

year intoETFs runbyJPMorgan Asset Management , up fromjust $1.6bn in 2017, according t

The emergence of yet another heavyweight was anunwelcomechallenge formanyETFproviders already ferociously battling to win investors' cash.

Investors ploughed $16.8bn last o ETFGI, a London consultancy.

Last year's inflows exceeded new ETF business in 2018 for both State Street ($6.6bn) and Invesco ($6.8bn), the third and fourth largest players globally. JPMorgan was the fifth-best seller of ETFs last year, behind Vanguard, BlackRock, Nomura and Charles Schwab.

JPMorgan historically lacked a significant presence in theETFindustry, preferring to focus on active managementandits alternativesarm. This strategy had puzzled observers given that JPMorgan's $2tn asset and wealth management business provides services to an army of US financial advisers and retail investors, who have increased their continued on page2 continued from page 1 appetite for ETFs since the 2007/08 financial crisis. The ETF unit sits inside the beta strategies arm, led by Michael Camacho in New York.

Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, said: "JPMorgan has allowed its rivals to build a lead that will require intensive efforts to recover."

Company executives insist they have not left their ETF push too late.

"We expect to see substantial growth for ETFs. We have spent a lot of time building the right teams, infrastructure and processes," said Bryon Lake, head of international ETFs at JPMAM.

About $9.7bn of last year's inflows were gathered by BetaBuilders, a new range of ETFs that track equity markets in Japan, Europe, Canada and Asia. They were prominent among the best-selling launches of 2018. A further $5.3bn went into actively managed ETFs last year.

Warren Miller, founder of Flowspring, a Denver analytics company, said JPMorgan was focusing on sophisticated, niche ETF strategies. "It is not going for vanilla ETFs. This allows it to retain some pricing power. Their model is different from Charles Schwab, which offers simple ETFs at bargain basement fees," he said.

Mr Miller expected JPMorgan's ETF business to maintain momentum: "Our forecast is for organic ETF asset growth, excluding product launches, of around 24 per cent this year."

WSJ Pro
AI Deployed as Defense in Cyber Arsenal of Companies Large and Small; Businesses from community banks to financial services firms are finding ways to deploy AI to quickly spot malicious actors and staunch breaches

The use of artificial intelligence to aid in cybersecurity efforts was once primarily the domain of larger companies with deep pockets and substantial information technology infrastructure.

But now adoption of the technology is expanding and includes smaller enterprises as well, with both using AI to quickly spot malicious actors and staunch breaches.

Kennebunk Savings Bank , with 19 branches across Maine and New Hampshire, in recent years was spending increasing amounts of time asking customers phoning the bank various security questions to verify their identity, said Kennebunk Chief Executive Bradford Paige.

"We would spend half the call verifying the customer," and often couldn't fulfill the customer's request over the phone, he said.

Since November, the bank has used AI-enabled voice biometric technology to help identify fraudsters and impersonators who attempt to access customer accounts. AI advancements benefit biometric authentication tools, which use unique body measurements to identify employees, customers and other individuals and grant them access to corporate systems and services.

The bank's voice biometric technology, developed by Nuance Communications Inc ., analyzes about two to three seconds of audio to verify a caller's identity. The technology uses deep neural networks to analyze voice patterns that aren't discernible to the human ear, such as the spacing between words and phonemes, said Brett Beranek, vice president of security at Nuance.

The Wyndham New Yorker, a 1,050-room hotel that is part of the international chain Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc ., also has been using AI-based cybersecurity tools for about a year and a half, said William Reid, the hotel's director of information technology.

The technology, developed by cybersecurity firm Darktrace Ltd ., has helped him identify a few notable incidents. In one, Mr. Reid was alerted an administrator at the hotel was moving an unusually large number of corporate files containing messages, calendar events and other data to personal accounts.

"It was information that should not have been going out of the network," said Mr. Reid. He said he reported the incident to human resources, but declined to say whether or how the individual was disciplined.

In a similar case, Mr. Reid said the technology predicted a salesperson at the hotel was about to leave the firm based on an unusual attempt to transfer business contacts to a personal account.

Max Heinemeyer, director of threat hunting at Darktrace , said the AI used by the hotel works by tracking real-time data from hundreds of sources, such as the time zone the user is typically in, the IP addresses and browsers they use, the applications and websites they access and the time of day these actions usually take place.

If the algorithms detect irregular behavior, such as a user accessing parts of the network they've never visited before or transferring unusually large amounts of data out of network, the system can cut off access pending a review.

"AI is good at analyzing all these subtle deviations &[and] it gets better over time," said Mr. Heinemeyer. "The more data it sees and the longer it's on, the better it gets."

Guillermo Guerra, chief information security officer at Prudential PLC, a London-based insurance and financial services firm, said AI's ability to intelligently pinpoint signs of malicious behavior can help companies focus their remediation efforts on real incidents and not false alarms.

Prudential's 350-person security team investigates about 1,000 security alerts each week, said Mr. Guerra. His team is developing and implementing AI tools to improve the accuracy of these alert systems, and help identify anomalies that are likely associated with malicious actors. Prudential isn't affiliated with the U.S. financial services firm Prudential Financial Inc .

"With some of the [AI-enabled tools] we've built, you really don't want to have an alert," he said. "Some systems should be used only in case of an emergency the moment it's used and there's not an alert, it's an issue."

Companies should not depend on AI to replace traditional safeguards, however, said Wyndham's Mr. Reid. He also deploys firewalls, antivirus and network security tools in addition to his AI cyber defenses.

Nonetheless, having this weapon in a company's arsenal can serve as an extra layer of protection, said Mr. Reid.

The Take: Private Equity Takes Baby Steps Toward Diversity

By Laura Cooper

The private-equity industry has long been known for its overwhelming preponderance of white males. But new data has shown the asset class is making strides, albeit slow ones, toward adding more funds run by women and minorities to its ranks.

The 2018 Diverse Asset Management Firm Assessment report by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and advisory firm Bella Private Markets examined diversity as measured by fund managers in hedge funds, real estate, venture capital and private equity.

For private-equity sponsors, the news is somewhat hopeful, according to Professor Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School and co-founder of Bella Private Markets. He noted the report, the group's second in about 18 months, has shown an uptick in the number of funds raised by minority and female-owned firms, though the total assets they manage remained modest.

VC Daily: Getting a Stake in  Ghost' Kitchens | $1 Billion Stolen in Crypto Hacking

Good day. Washington is back at work. That doesn't mean the entire bureacracy will instantly snap to attention, but investors are hoping that regulators will at least start to catch up with the backlog of IPO filings and follow-ups.

We have a busy lineup for Monday, including exclusive news about startups attempting a new model for the food-delivery market, and a look at Sapphire Ventures fielding a team to tackle the intersection of sports and technology, so let's get to it.

Today's Top Stories

Stake in the kitchen: Online food-delivery services were hot when they burst onto the scene a few years back, but the craze has since led to a growing list of failures. Now, a new crop of startups are taking a swing at the rapidly evolving urban food-service industry by homing in on one layer of business the cooking facilities.

Startups like Kitchen United, Kitopi and Eatsa hope their kitchen-only model will prove more durable in a market where the likes of just-shuttered Munchery and others have failed.

Sometimes called "ghost" or "cloud" kitchens, the new players either prepare food for off-site dining or provide commercial kitchen space, leaving the distribution to others. Even Travis Kalanick, the Uber co-founder, has a stake in the new model.

Still to be proven: How these kitchen-only food-service plays will hold up compared to other restaurant ventures. WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian has the story.

Fielding dreams: Sapphire Ventures' newly launched sports-technology fund is introducing a new cast of characters to the venture world. In seeking limited partners to back the $115 million fund, Sapphire Sport Parallel Fund LP, Sapphire Ventures tapped an array of professional sports organizations, team owners and media groups, most of which had never invested in venture-capital funds before, said Sapphire Chief Executive Nino Marakovic. He said that to seal the commitment of the fund's lead investor, he shook hands with Ferran Soriano, owner of Manchester City Football Club parent City Football Group Ltd. while overlooking the reigning English Premier League champion's home field. Mr. Vartabedian has the story.

Crytpo hacking funds: Two groups of highly sophisticated cyber criminals likely have stolen some $1 billion in cryptocurrency hacks, a sum that accounts for the majority of the money lost in such scams, according to a new report from Chainalysis. Moreover, the two entities are probably sill active, said Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a maker of software that tracks cryptocurrency transactions. Chainalysis, which plans to release its findings publicly on Monday morning, spent about three months tracking the funds stolen in known hacks. The WSJ's Paul Vigna has the scoop.

Roof's Take: Get Ready for More  Cord-Cutter' Acquisitions

By Katie Roof

Investors expect more acquisitions in the cord-cutting industry following Viacom Inc.'s $340 million purchase of streaming startup Pluto TV.

"Consolidation will have to happen," said Joanne Chen, a partner at Foundation Capital who sits on the board of Tubi Inc., a competitor to Pluto TV. Her firm also was an early investor in Netflix Inc.

Venture investment activity in the cord-cutting category peaked in 2014 and has declined since, according to PitchBook Data. Eleven such startups received funding last year, down from 37 four years earlier. The amount of money invested in the sector in each of those years was about $200 million.

These businesses provide an alternative to cable television, and consumers increasingly are ditching cable subscriptions in favor of unbundled options. Investors noticed the shift and placed their bets on the future of video content.

Video startups like Tastemade Inc. and Philo Inc. are among the most well-funded in the sector. But there have been few exits in recent years, with Roku Inc.'s 2017 initial public offering being the largest to date.

More in Roof's Take.

Exits

Medtronic PLC agreed to buy EPIX Therapeutics Inc., the maker of a catheter-based system to treat irregular heartbeats, for an undisclosed amount. EPIX, which changed its name from Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics Inc. last year, was backed by investors including Ajax Health, New Enterprise Associates and Questa Capital Management.

Artificial intelligence-based analytics company Guavus Inc. acquired SQLstream Inc., a real-time streaming analytics provider, for an undisclosed amount. SQLstream, of San Francisco, was backed by Fontinalis Partners. France's Thales SA bought Guavus in 2017.

VC Funds

Early-stage investor Firebolt Ventures is raising up to $50 million for a third fund, according to a regulatory filing. No commitments have been received yet. The firm's portfolio includes cybersecurity startup Fortanix Inc., hospital workflow manager Qventus Inc. and logistics software provider Turvo Inc.

Bace Ltd. is raising a venture fund of up to $120 million, the firm disclosed in a regulatory filing. Yan Chen is listed as the director of Bace Fund LP, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The fund had yet to secure any committed capital, according to the filing. Bace didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

JPMorgan makes late push to become ETF heavyweight

JPMorgan s bid to join the top tier of exchange traded fund managers was boosted last year as the New York-listed group increased sales tenfold.

The bank, which had some of the best-selling newly launched funds in 2018, has increased its efforts to regain assets lost to BlackRock and Vanguard over the past decade.

The emergence of yet another heavyweight was an unwelcome challenge for many ETF providers already ferociously battling to win investors  cash.

Investors ploughed $16.8bn last year into ETFs run by JPMorgan Asset Management, up from just $1.6bn in 2017, according to ETFGI, a London consultancy.

Last year s inflows exceeded new ETF business in 2018 for both State Street ($6.6bn) and Invesco ($6.8bn), the third and fourth largest players globally. JPMorgan was the fifth-best seller of ETFs last year, behind Vanguard, BlackRock, Nomura and Charles Schwab.

JPMorgan historically lacked a significant presence in the ETF industry, preferring to focus on active management and its alternatives arm.

This strategy had puzzled observers given that JPMorgan s $2tn asset and wealth management business provides services to an army of US financial advisers and retail investors, who have increased their appetite for ETFs since the 2007/08 financial crisis.

The ETF unit sits inside a longer-established beta strategies arm, led by global head Michael Camacho in New York.

Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, said:  JPMorgan has the resources and expertise to be a significant competitor in the ETF industry but it has allowed its rivals to build a lead that will require intensive efforts to recover. 

Executives at JPMorgan insist they have not left their ETF push too late.

 We expect to see substantial growth for ETFs over the next decade. We have spent a lot of time building the right teams, infrastructure and processes to compete in this space,  said Bryon Lake, head of international ETFs at JPMAM.

About $9.7bn of last year s inflows were gathered by BetaBuilders, a new range of ETFs that track equity markets in Japan, Europe, Canada and Asia. They featured prominently among the industry s best-selling launches of 2018. A further $5.3bn went into actively managed ETFs last year.

Warren Miller, founder of Flowspring, a Denver-based asset management analytics company, said JPMorgan was focusing on sophisticated, niche ETF strategies.

 It is not going for vanilla ETFs. This allows JPMorgan to retain some pricing power. Their model is different from Charles Schwab, which offers simple ETFs at bargain basement fees to compete with BlackRock and Vanguard,  he said.

JPMorgan did not disclose the breakdown of the ETF inflows that were attributed to new cash, money cannibalised from existing funds or reallocations from rival products held by clients on the bank s platform.

An analysis of regulatory filings by Flowspring indicated that about $4.2bn of the 2018 ETF inflows were reallocations from BlackRock ETFs, with a further $1.1bn shifted from State Street ETFs by current JPMorgan clients.

 There was also some modest cannibalisation from existing JPMorgan funds in 2018 but it was not meaningful,  said Mr Miller.

Even after its strong showing in 2018, JPMorgan still ranks as only the 19th-largest ETF player globally with assets of just over $21bn. BlackRock, the biggest player, controls close to $1.8tn in ETF assets.

Mr Miller said he expected JPMorgan s ETF business to maintain momentum in 2019.  Our forecast is for organic ETF asset growth, excluding new product launches, of around 24 per cent this year,  he said.

Billionaire who rebuilt Citadel from ruins of financial crisis

Ken Griffin

Corporate person in the news During the 2008 financial crisis, the television network CNBC parked a van outside the Chicago headquarters of Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel, expecting the company to fail. The producers' precaution was understandable. Citadel was losing "hundreds of millions of dollars" each week, Mr Griffin later told the Financial Times.

More than a decade on and Citadel has rebounded, becoming a $28bn behemoth, majority-owned by Mr Griffin. He also controls Citadel Securities, a market maker, which helps other investors buy and sell assets and now accounts for about a fifth of all stock trades in the US. In turn, the 50-year-old Mr Griffin has amassed a personal fortune close to $10bn, according to Forbes.

That fortune was on display as Mr Griffin agreed the purchase of a $238m New York penthouse spanning 24,000 sq ft across the top four floors of a new skyscraper being built on 220 Central Park South, which has stunning views across the leafy part of Manhattan. It marks the most expensive home purchase in the US.

It came the same week as the FT revealed that Mr Griffin had bought a 95m home near Buckingham Palace in London. His previous property purchases include one floor of the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago and he separately set the record for the most expensive home in the city when he bought a $59m four-level penthouse. He has also spent roughly $200m on land and property in Florida, where he was born.

As an undergraduate, Mr Griffin had more humble digs. It was from his Harvard dorm room that he developed a passion for trading, installing a satellite dish to receive upto-the-second price information. "That was 1987," he said at a conference in November last year. "I have to explain to my son that the internet didn't exist back then."

He said he built basic predictive analytics tools using economic theory straight from his textbooks. That process, of marrying mathematics and technology to trade, has been integral to Citadel   launched in 1990, shortly after he graduated   and Citadel Securities, which together have been at the forefront of overhauling the way markets operate.

Mr Griffin first went into contract on his latest New York purchase in 2015, shortly before finalising a heated divorce with his second wife Anne Dias, founder of the hedge fund Aragon Global Management.

The public scrutiny of their separation and lurid details exposed through a lengthy court battle stood in contrast to Mr Griffin's attempts to keep much of his personal and business dealings hidden from view.

He is described by former and current employees at Citadel as methodical, self-motivated and rooted in quantitative analysis.

Some say he is intense, but others see his intensity as part of a relentless, almost military desire for continual improvement that is instilled in the organisation.

Although he is not known for basking in the limelight, Mr Griffin does maintain a public image. It was while he was with Ms Dias that he entrenched himself in Chicago's cultural and political scene.

An avid art collector, his name adorns one section of the city's Art Institute after a $19m donation. In 2016, he paid $500m to buy two paintings   a Jackson Pollock and a Willem de Kooning   in one of the largest private art deals.

Mr Griffin's grandparents' name was given to the Gratz Center at the Fourth Presbyterian Church after an $11m donation. He is in the last of a five-year term on the University of Chicago's board of trustees, where he has previously donated $125m. According to Citadel, Mr Griffin has given more than $700m in charitable donations.

In politics, Mr Griffin has supported Democrats and Republicans and maintains that he is not ideologically committed to either party, despite once describing himself as a "Reagan Republican".

He backed Chicago resident Barack Obama for president in 2008, as well as aiding another Democrat   Rahm Emanuel   to re-election as the city's mayor. But more recently, he has tended towards Republican candidates, backing Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio in their presidential bids.

Mr Griffin also backed Bruce Rauner when he was elected as Illinois state governor in 2014, endorsing a policy of tax cuts and business freedom. Despite an injection of $22.5m from Mr Griffin leading up to his 2018 attempt at reelection, Mr Rauner was beaten by the Democrat JB Pritzker.

But the setback has not dissuaded Mr Griffin from remaining involved in politics, just as the financial crisis did not spell the end for Citadel. As for his real estate purchases, Mr Griffin is confident that his market instincts are sound.

"In the US as a whole we still have a growing population," he said at a conference in July last year. "That's going to underpin home prices in years to come." Joe Rennison

Google 's Effort to Prevent Blindness Shows AI Challenges; Company's AI can detect a condition that causes blindness in diabetes patients, but in rural India it doesn't always work

Corrections & Amplifications

Google's ARDA tool can look for signs of diabetic retinopathy. An earlier version of this article said it could look for symptoms.

MADURAI, India Alphabet Inc .'s Google has developed artificial intelligence that can detect a condition that causes blindness in diabetic patients, though tests in India demonstrate the challenges of transferring such technology from the lab to the doctor's office.

The technology giant's Automated Retinal Disease Assessment tool is trained to diagnose diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes, by reading images of patients' retinas. Studies show that the artificial intelligence can be as effective as a doctor at identifying signs of the condition.

Google is testing ARDA in India where at least 60 million people have diabetes and often don't know they should be screened for the eye condition. A shortage of ophthalmologists means reaching patients is difficult, and doctors say the technology could help to fill the gap.

Google is the latest tech firm to explore using AI in health care. Amazon.com Inc ., International Business Machines Corp . and UnitedHealth Group Inc . sell "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-starts-selling-software-to-mine-patient-health-records-1543352136", and IBM developed AI that detects melanoma on images of skin.

By using technology similar to algorithms that recognize people or dogs in photos, ARDA detects signs of the illness lesions, burst blood vessels and patches of yellow on the retina and grades their severity.

"This is a technology that can make a really big difference," said Lily Peng, a Google product manager and trained medical doctor who helps lead the team developing ARDA at the company's California offices.

While ARDA is effective working with sample data, according to three studies including one published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , a recent visit to a hospital in India where it is being tested showed it can struggle with images taken in field clinics. Often they are of such poor quality that the Google tool stops short of producing a diagnosis an obstacle that ARDA researchers are trying to overcome.

The stakes are high. If diabetic retinopathy is caught early it can be kept at bay through monitoring and management of the diabetes, said R. Kim, an Indian ophthalmologist who runs the Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, where Google is testing ARDA. More advanced stages need laser surgery that can stop progression. If it isn't treated, the condition can cause blindness.

For Google , diabetic retinopathy was an ideal case study because experts agree on its signs and symptoms. With skyrocketing rates of diabetes, India provided the right testing ground. As incomes have grown, so have citizens' waistlines. The prevalence of the condition in India increased 64% from 1990 to 2016, according to government data.

"I am not proud to say, but India is becoming the diabetic capital of the world," Dr. Kim said.

Yet the country has just 11 ophthalmologists for every million people, compared with 59 in the U.S., according to the International Council of Ophthalmologists. Training the number needed is "a race you can't win," he said.

In many cases, diabetic patients in India visit a doctor only when they have already lost some vision, Dr. Kim said. He hopes ARDA will reach more patients through doctors' offices or pharmacies, pre-empting the need for his ophthalmologists to run screening camps in rural areas.

To create ARDA, Dr. Peng's team obtained more than 1.6 million images of retinas that were each evaluated by ophthalmologists. Google used those graded images to train the algorithm. Now the team is grappling with how to make it work with low-quality images produced by the sort of equipment affordable in developing countries such as India.

On a November day in a telemedicine center at Dr. Kim's hospital, ophthalmologists wearing headsets waited for 73 local eye clinics to connect patients in rural areas via webcam.

Ophthalmologist Anusha Arunachalan got a call from a clinic an hour from Madurai. A 39-year-old diabetic homemaker was having trouble seeing. 

### picture data found, picture dimensions are 640 by 427, depth 1
pict077.jpg

Six images sent by a clinic technician showed the patient's retinas covered by pools of blood. Dr. Arunachalan diagnosed proliferative diabetic retinopathy an advanced stage of the condition. Then Google gave it a try. It graded two of the six images as proliferative though one was deemed of poor quality and two others as severe. The tool was unable to grade two of the photos accurately because they were unclear.

While Dr. Arunchalan said it also was hard for her to read some of the images, "One [clear] image is enough for me. I don't need three images" for each eye to make a diagnosis, she said.

Doctors at the telemedicine center said they often look at the clear parts of faulty images to make a diagnosis, while the algorithm sometimes can't.

It isn't a unique problem, said John Quackenbush, professor of computational biology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health . Algorithms can be trained on sample images but real-world photos can be different.

"I don't think it is insurmountable," he said, on hearing about Google 's challenges.

Google is also testing the algorithm with another partner in India and one in Thailand and is working on making ARDA work with different-quality images, Dr. Peng said. But the challenge is also ethical.

If Google allowed the algorithm to make a diagnosis from blurred images, it could miss small lesions that appear in the early stages of the condition, she said. Google must decide how bad an image can be before ARDA refuses to grade it.

"It's a trade-off. We want them to be able to use cameras that are a little harder to use but at some point it should move into something where it is ungradable," Dr. Peng said.

Nonetheless, when ARDA gets a good image, it can identify early signs of the condition that doctors may have missed, Dr. Kim said.

Whereas ARDA does it in seconds, a human can take three minutes to grade an image plus the time taken to open it on a computer, Dr. Kim said. A busy doctor, he said, could very well miss tiny red lesions in a patient's eye.

Developer of Ace and NoMad Hotels Buys Parker New York

The developer behind trendsetting hotels in Manhattan's NoMad neighborhood has acquired the Parker New York hotel, looking to bring some of its downtown success to a midtown strip known more for opulent residences than hip lodging.

Real-estate firm GFI Capital Resources Group and Elliott Management Corp., a hedge fund and activist investor, closed Wednesday on the purchase of the 729-room hotel for about $420 million, GFI Capital said.

The joint venture purchased the hotel from the family of the late Jack Parker, a hotel and property developer.

The venture plans to spend an additional $100 million to make over the 37-year-old hotel and convert many of the rooms into private residences.

The hotel has entrances on West 56th and West 57th streets, so-called Billionaires' Row because of the ultrahigh end condominiums built along the street and around the southern end of Central Park.

The partners expect to revamp the underground retail space, but their plans are still evolving, said Allen Gross, chief executive of GFI Capital. The popular Burger Joint, located in the hotel, will remain, he said.

The hotel will stay open during the renovation, which is expected to begin in 2020. It will be relaunched as a flagship of Hyatt Hotels Corp.'s Thompson Hotel brand in 2021.

The new owners have tapped New York-based architect Thomas Juul-Hansen to create about 67 residential apartments at the top of the building. The condos will have floor-to-ceiling windows and offer hotel services and amenities, GFI Capital said.

The project won't be competing with its surrounding ultraluxury neighbors, Mr. Gross said. Most of the condos will be one-bedroom units with pricing possibly in the $2 million range, not $20 million or $30 million.

"The location is something to die for," Mr. Gross said. "It's Billionaires' Row, and this piece of real estate is right smack in the middle of it."

The Parker Hotel was part of the Le Meridien brand, originally a Paris-based hotel line that has struggled at times in the U.S. It was part of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which was acquired by Marriott International Inc. in 2016. The Parker stopped operating under that flag about a year ago.

Bjorn Hanson, a hotel-industry consultant, described the Parker as a "quiet hotel" of less prominence and name recognition than other hotels of similar size and in similarly well-located addresses.

Hyatt can bring "a reservation system, loyalty program, group sales and international sales to a hotel that has not had those types of supports," Mr. Hanson said.

GFI Capital's affiliate developed the Ace Hotel New York and the NoMad Hotel more than a decade ago. Their open lobbies, public spaces and free Wi-Fi helped accelerate the trend of hotels evolving into popular spots for freelancers and other locals to work, much like co-working spaces.

The hotels also helped spur condo, trendy restaurants and other development in the previously shaggy NoMad neighborhood, which primarily had been populated with wholesale stores.

GFI Capital later applied a similar approach when it joined forces with Elliott Management to revamp a long-vacant 19th-century, lower Manhattan building into what is now the posh Beekman hotel.

While Elliott Management has a reputation for buying shares in companies such as eBay Inc. and pushing for change, the $34 billion hedge fund also has invested in the real-estate sector. Since 2009, the firm has made about $9 billion in direct commercial real-estate investments in the U.S., Europe and Asia in addition to investments in real-estate securities.

The team's new project comes at a time when average daily hotel rates in Manhattan have begun to rise after several years of declines, as construction continues to increase the supply. Last year, the average daily rate rose to $281.09, up 2.6% from the previous year's $274.08, according to analytics firm STR.

Cyber Daily: Corporate Cybersecurity Awareness, By The Numbers

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. As the new year takes shape, let's take stock of the cybersecurity situation before us. Threats are intensifying, including from China and Russia, which U.S. intelligence officials warn continue to launch organized, methodical and deep attacks on corporate and government networks.

The Securities and Exchange Commission a year ago issued its most detailed guidance to date for how companies should disclose how they view and manage cybersecurity risks. Adherence to the SEC's, shall we say, aggressive encouragement of disclosure has been uneven. Reading the proxy statements of some firms in the S&P 500, one might surmise that cyber threats simply don't exist. They have said nothing about the risk in their filings.

Oversight by boards and senior leaders has improved in the past year or so, with directors educating themselves about cybersecurity. Some executives have also gotten schooled watching the fallout from some very large, very serious attacks. You've read about these incidents and subsequent financial and reputational damage here: Facebook Inc., Yahoo Inc., Marriott International Inc., Equifax Inc., FedEx Corp. -- we could go on.

Today, we let numbers tell the story. We've collected some of the best data out there to provide snapshots on where large companies stand as they prepare defenses against unseen attackers. Things are better than they were a year ago but there's still a long way to go. How does your company measure up?

**********

Serious Cyber Incidents

5.9

Average number of cybersecurity incidents experienced per year at a company with more than $40 billion in annual revenue, according to research firm International Data Corp.

2.2 of these incidents, on average, meet thresholds for severity for reporting to regulators, says IDC in a survey of the 201 U.S. companies.

**********

Breach Costs

$3.9 Million

Average cost of a data breach in 2018, according to Ponemon Institute and International Business Machines Corp. That is up 6.4% compared to 2017's $3.6 million.

The average cost for each stolen record rose nearly 5%, from $141 in 2017 to $148 last year. The research examined breaches at 477 organizations globally.

**********

Board Concern

42%

Percentage of directors who said growing cybersecurity threats will have the greatest effect on their company in 2019, after regulatory changes (49%) and economic slowdown (48%), according to the National Association of Corporate Directors.

52% of directors say they understand cyber risks enough to provide effective oversight, NACD says, based on a survey of 500 members.

**********

Board Expertise

35

Number of companies among the 100 biggest public U.S. firms by revenue and market capitalization that identified directors with cybersecurity or data experience in 2018 financial filings, according to Shearman & Sterling LLP. That's up from 29 in 2017.

In the wider pool of the S&P 500, just 24% of companies disclosed in their latest proxy filings that they have at least one director with cybersecurity skill, says researcher MyLogIQ LLC.

**********

Board Committees

3

Number of companies in the S&P 500 that operate a standalone board committee dedicated to cybersecurity, according to researcher MyLogIQ LLC.

**********

CISO Power Structure

43%

Percentage of chief information security officers who report to the CEO, according to ISC(2), an association for cybersecurity professionals. That compares to 35% who report to the CIO and 14% who report to the board of directors, ISC(2) found in a survey of professionals with some cyber responsibilities at 250 companies.

14% of those surveyed said their company doesn't have a CISO.

Inside Google's Team Battling Hackers

Google's in-house counterespionage group, the Threat Analysis Group, tracks more than 200 hacker groups that pose a threat to Google and its users, analyzing hacking techniques and clues to the groups' identities to head off attacks, The Wall Street Journal reports. The 27-person team leverages access to data across widely used Google products like Gmail, with more than 1.5 billion accounts world-wide, and to a database of attack code called VirusTotal managed by another arm of Google's parent Alphabet Inc.

Tons of data: "Google probably has the most useful data set available to any private company for tracking state adversaries and intelligence services," said Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook Inc. and now an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He likens Google's efforts to those of a small intelligence agency. "You put that all together, and they are probably second only to the intelligence community" in terms of useful data, he said. The team issues about 4,000 warnings a month to Gmail users with accounts where it detects government-backed hackers trying to break in.

Iran, elections: Last summer, the team stopped an allegedly Iranian-backed disinformation campaign by pulling dozens of YouTube channels that were using fake accounts to push misleading political stories primarily about the Middle East. Disinformation, especially around elections, is a new focus.

Sovereign corporate states? Such corporate counterintelligence teams can have more impact in the private sector than in government. "These companies are sovereign authorities inside their products," said Sergio Caltagirone, a former NSA analyst hired by Microsoft Corp. in 2013. Many of his peers felt the same way, he said. "There were a lot of people who had spent close to a decade in government, and everyone was recognizing, 'Yeah, we can't really do much,' " he said.

Former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said the Trump administration failed to take appropriate cybersecurity measures to protect 5G mobile networks, in an opinion column for The New York Times. He criticized his FCC successor for removing an Obama-era cybersecurity requirement for 5G networks and withdrawing a white paper from the same period about reducing cyber threats. "The Trump administration has been told that cybersecurity is an  existential risk,'" Mr. Wheeler wrote. "The new Congress should use its oversight power to explore just why the administration has failed to protect against that risk, especially when it comes to the next generation of networks."

Verizon To Lay Off 7% of Media Group Staff; Cuts, which will slash about 800 jobs, follow a monthslong review of a unit that has failed to meet revenue targets

Verizon Communications Inc.'s beleaguered media group is laying off 7% of its staff and is focusing on fewer areas to revive its fortunes, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The moves follow a monthslong review of the business by K. Guru Gowrappan, a 38-year-old former Yahoo and Alibaba Group executive who joined Verizon last spring. He "https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizons-internet-boss-in-talks-to-leave-1536321413" former AOL executive Tim Armstrong, who departed late last year. 

Mr. Gowrappan said in an email to staff Wednesday that the business would focus on mobile and video-focused products. Yahoo-branded entertainment and news platforms are particularly important to the unit's strategy, the people said. 

Other priorities include creating more video content for its own media properties such as Yahoo Finance and those run by third parties like Roku, as well as generating more revenue from its ad platforms and a streaming video and content delivery system. That system, called Verizon Digital Media Services, works with companies like Hulu, ESPN and Walt Disney Co. 

Verizon Media Group had 11,385 employees at the end of 2018 and the planned cuts will impact staff globally, one of the people said. The unit had 12,845 employees after Verizon bought Yahoo in 2017. 

The moves are "a strategic step toward better execution of our plans for growth and innovation into the future," a spokeswoman for the unit said. 

Mr. Gowrappan's plans highlight the balance Verizon is trying to strike between creating video content that draws users and showcases its network and avoiding pricey large-scale content acquisitions. 

Hans Vestberg, Verizon's chief executive, has said the carrier is focused on its network "https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizons-5g-game-plan-1536673535". 

Mr. Gowrappan's plans are the latest attempt to breathe new life into a media business that aimed to become a powerful force in digital advertising. 

Formed after Verizon's purchases of AOL in 2015 and Yahoo two years later, the business was initially called Oath and has since been rebranded Verizon Media Group as part of a carrier-wide reorganization. 

Despite its ambitions of becoming an advertising giant, the unit has failed to meet revenue targets by selling digital ads. The carrier said in December that it is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-takes-4-6-billion-charge-related-to-digital-media-business-11544538587" related to the business and executives acknowledged that core parts of the business search and desktop usage "https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-adds-phone-customers-but-oath-revenue-weakens-1540297875". 

Mr. Gowrappan told staff in the email that his new plans were made after an "exhaustive review" in which "we honestly assessed where we are and outlined ambitious but achievable goals that poise us for growth." 

He and other Verizon Media Group executives in recent months have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/paywall-for-huffpost-verizon-hunt-for-web-revenue-goes-beyond-ads-1543752001" to encourage users to spend more time on its properties, the Journal has reported 

They identified Yahoo as one of the strongest brands within the business. 

Teams working on Yahoo Mail and Yahoo's home page were merged and charged with creating a more cohesive user experience. Meanwhile, staff members are working to channel more content produced by Makers, a feminist media brand, and Build, a brand that conducts live celebrity interviews, into the media group's news and entertainment platforms. 

Mr. Gowrappan has halted some efforts to sell brands within the media business, opting instead to shutter flagging brands or services. One app that will close is its WakingNews alarm. 

He viewed the process of selling photo-sharing service Flickr last year, for example, as too pricey and time-consuming, people familiar with the matter said. 

Despite the layoffs, Verizon plans to hire new engineering and content-development staff. Those new workers will focus on building new services that showcase Verizon's faster, 5G network. 

Some of the media group's artificial intelligence and machine-learning staff will work more closely with Verizon's own teams focused on those areas. The carrier is looking for ways to make its media assets showcase the benefits of its wireless network because upgrading to a 5G network sits the center of Mr. Vestberg's corporate strategy.

U2's Bono and TPG Launch Company to Measure 'Impact Investments'; Method relies on research from academics and others to assess investments

Bono and TPG are teaming up to try to prove that investments meant to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-firm-abraaj-raised-billions-pledging-to-do-goodthen-it-fell-apart-1539706575" do what they purport to do.

The U2 frontman and his business partners at the U.S. private-equity firm announced a new company called Y Analytics, which will use a method they developed to measure social and environmental change created by investments.

It's the latest effort in a race with dozens of participants to measure so-called impact investing, a new asset class private-equity firms are developing to try to produce social and environmental change as well as profit. Y Analytics grew out of Rise, a $2 billion investment fund TPG and Bono co-founded.

"Math is music here," Bono said in an interview. "If capitalism is to be a force for good we have to be able to measure when it's doing good and when it's doing harm," he said. "Fuzzy thinking just won't cut it. We need cold hard facts."

Skeptics say impact investing is little more than an attempt to put private-equity firms in a positive light. For years, the firms have had to fend off criticism of asset-stripping, tax avoidance, burdening companies with debt and firing workers. TPG is raising $3 billion for its second Rise fund. It manages about $103 billion in total.

"I do believe it's marketing," Anand Giridharadas, a former analyst at U.S. management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and author of "Winners Take All, The Elite Charade of Changing the World," said in an interview. "The public hear 'TPG, impact fund, Bono' and that sounds good. It sells us on the idea that finance people are vital to help solving the problems of inequality, which obscures the way in which finance people are a big part of the cause of inequality and the social problems they are trying to solve."

"I understand the cynicism," Bono said. "There is banana skin all over the floor, I think. I am very conscious of it. We have had green-washing or purpose-washing with all manner of halos being offered up as fig leaves for companies who do bad things but then give money away and make up for it. I get that," he said.

Y Analytics measures investments with a number it calls the impact multiple of money. TPG created the method to measure investments in its Rise fund. The number is generated by tapping independent research related to each investment. For example, TPG assessed an investment in an Indian dairy based on whether it boosts incomes for the thousands of smallholder farmers who provide the milk.

The nonprofit Global Impact Investing Network identified $228 billion of such investments globally in 2017. Nick O'Donohoe, chief executive of U.K. investment firm CDC Group, told a conference in October that there are 150 ways to measure social and environmental improvement and the inability to agree on a definition for the new industry is "the elephant in the room." CDC has its own approach to screening investments.

Agreement on a reliable approach to measurement could help attract trillions of dollars of private capital to these funds, according to Bill McGlashan, the head of TPG's growth investing arm and co-founder of the Rise fund. He said the money is needed to reach the United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals by 2030. The U.N.'s goals include eliminating global poverty and improving education and health care.

"If we achieve our mission, we help catalyze a bunch of really effective, credible competitors coming into the market, because that's the scale of capital that's ultimately needed," Mr. McGlashan said in an interview.

The method uses research from academics, independent companies and institutions to assess investments. Rise's investments "https://hbr.org/2019/01/calculating-the-value-of-impact-investing"worth $26 billion 13 times the size of the $2 billion fund, Mr. McGlashan said.

Maryanne Hancock, a former McKinsey executive, will lead Y Analytics. The company has seven staff as well as advisers including Robert Zimmer, president of the University of Chicago. TPG declined to say how much it has spent on Y Analytics.

Ms. Hancock said Y Analytics will make it easier to compare investments in different sectors such as education and energy. "This is a discipline that can evolve over time into a benchmark," she said.

The attempt to make investments capable of creating social benefits was developed by executives in the $3.4 trillion global private-equity industry including Ronald Cohen, co-founder of London-based Apax Partners, who Bono described as a "hero" who "opened us up to a different way of thinking."

"Eventually we will get to a parallel impact accounting system to the financial system," Mr. Cohen said in an interview. "We are making progress all the time."

Good day. In the ever-fiercer fight for talent, company-rating website Glassdoor has become a key PR battleground.

A must-read Wall Street Journal investigation examines unusual spikes in the number of five-star ratings posted on Glassdoor, which was acquired by Japan's Recruit Holdings Co. for $1.2 billion last year. It may come as no surprise to some observers, but a number of companies have been encouraging and in some cases pressuring their employees to post positive reviews.

What isn't clear is how effective such gamesmanship can be in attracting talent in a tight job market.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Accel is fundraising: The firm is back in the market with a plan to raise $2.5 billion for three new funds, according to a person familiar with the situation. Founded in 1983 and one of Silicon Valley's oldest venture firms, Accel is aiming to stick to its existing strategy, raising about as much as it did in the 2016 fundraising cycle. It plans to collect $500 million for a new venture fund and $1.5 billion for a growth fund, the person said. Accel also plans to raise $500 million for its second Leaders fund, which will be invested in follow-on rounds of existing portfolio companies. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the scoop.

Paying for streaming: Viacom Inc. said it bought the ad-supported video streaming service Pluto TV for $340 million in cash, a move that gives the pay-TV giant another entre to the realm of online video. Pluto TV previously raised more than $50 million from investors including U.S. Venture Partners and Chicago Ventures. The WSJ's Benjamin Mullin has more.

Good dog: One Health Co. has brought together veterinarians and research institutions to develop cancer testing and treatment plans for dogs based on human-grade protocols such as genomic sequencing and targeted therapy. The San Francisco-based company has raised $5 million in seed funding to expand access and awareness of the service. Andreessen Horowitz led the round, with participation from Lerer Hippeau and Y Combinator. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

Chernova's Take: Megafunds Not on the Menu as Top Firms Refuel

By Yuliya Chernova

At least two major venture firms, Accel and Andreessen Horowitz, are back in the market raising their new series of funds.

Accel is looking for $2.5 billion for three funds, as WSJ Pro Venture Capital has reported. Andreessen is also in the market, reportedly looking to raise at least $2.75 billion for a pair of funds.

There was some speculation last year, when Sequoia Capital collected $8 billion with ease, for its third global growth fund, whether this was the new normal. So far, however, the big firms aren't following suit.

And SoftBank, which set the ultimate mega precedent with its $98 billion Vision Fund, had been working on raising a second Vision Fund, but that has yet to materialize.

The venture market has been ballooning last year U.S. firms raised $54.46 billion, up 43% over 2017, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones & Co. And there have been outliers. What we are seeing now is that they do remain outliers.

More in Chernova's Take.

Good day. New York Fed leader John Williams cast his lot with colleagues who favor a pause on rate rises, saying the central bank should show "prudence, patience and good judgment." Meanwhile, Fed governor Lael Brainard raised concerns that political uncertainty could end up hitting economic growth. Globally, many central banks are finding it hard to move back to monetary policy settings that were considered normal before the financial crisis. And the IMF has cut its global growth forecast for 2019, while China posted its worst annual growth figures in nearly three decades.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Williams: Now Is Time for Fed to Show  Prudence, Patience and Good Judgment'

New York Fed President John Williams said Friday what happens with short-term interest rates and the central bank's balance-sheet drawdown "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-williams-interest-rate-balance-sheet-adjustments-will-depend-on-economys-performance-11547820503?tesla=y" this year by how the economy performs. "The economy is strong, the outlook is healthy, and my number one priority is using monetary policy to keep it that way," Mr. Williams said in a speech to a banker's group in New Jersey. For the Fed, "the approach we need is one of prudence, patience and good judgment. The motto of  data dependence' is more relevant than ever," the policy maker said.

Brainard Says Prolonged Political Uncertainty Could Weigh on Economic Activity

Federal governor Lael Brainard said "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-brainard-says-prolonged-political-uncertainty-could-weigh-on-economic-activity-11547851734?tesla=y" growing political uncertainty could weigh on consumer and business confidence, eventually crimping U.S. economic growth, in an interview that aired Friday evening. Ms. Brainard described the U.S. labor market as healthy but said political uncertainties ranging from the federal government's partial shutdown to the potential for a messy divorce between the U.K. and the European Union to trade tensions with China are negative threats to growth.

Central Banks Struggle With Policy Settings

The eurozone's economic slowdown has taken European Central Bank officials by surprise, potentially disrupting their plans to lift short-term interest rates this year. The shift underlines the difficulties central banks face getting back to growth rates and policy settings that were considered normal before the global financial crisis.

Fed's Bostic Downplays Impact of Balance-Sheet Drawdown

Federal Reserve officials may have "https://centralbanking.cmail20.com/t/d-l-nhkjttt-jlohthuq-x/" to changing the path of their balance-sheet drawdown if necessary, but so far they are showing no signs they think that's a step they will have to take.

For one thing, while financial markets have deemed the drawdown in the Fed's holdings of bonds a quantitative tightening meaning reduced Fed holdings are affecting financial conditions much like interest-rate rises Fed officials don't seem to share the market's assessment.

The Fed's balance-sheet drawdown began in late 2017. As part of the process of moving its monetary policy stance back to a more normal footing after years of crisis measures, it started allowing some Treasury and mortgage bonds in its then $4.5 trillion to mature and not be replaced. With the drawdown on a fixed schedule and essentially on autopilot, the Fed hoped changes in interest rates would be its main tool for influencing economy.

But as market volatility rose late last year, some traders and investors have said the Fed's balance-sheet shift is a big reason why the financial sector has become so unsettled. In a blog posting last week, Atlanta Fed leader Raphael Bostic took issue with that view.

He did so by looking at the returns investors demand to take on risk in bonds, the so-called term premia.

"Although estimating term premia is as much art as science, I don't think the evidence supports the argument that these premia have been materially rising as a result of our normalization process," Mr. Bostic wrote. "If the term premia channel is a critical piece of what makes balance-sheet policy work, I'm hard pressed to see much evidence of financial tightening via rising term premia in the data so far."

Getting a handle on what's going on with the balance sheet is difficult to do in the best of times, and the impact of the buying that took the Fed's balance sheet from a precrisis level of just above $800 billion to its $4.5 trillion peak is still debated. But Mr. Bostic's view that the drawdown isn't doing much to the market has supporters among private-sector analysts.

"There is little reason to think that actions emanating from the asset side of the Fed balance sheet are contributing to a meaningful tightening of financial conditions," J.P. Morgan's Michael Feroli said in a research note. And for that reason, he believes the Fed will continue to reduce its holdings, despite the market's concern over the outlook.

IMF Lowers 2019 Global Growth Forecast

The International Monetary Fund"https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-lowers-2019-global-growth-forecast-11548075601?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" for 2019 to 3.5%, down from 3.7% in October. A global recession isn't around the corner, "but the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased," IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.

Government Shutdown, Trade Tensions Weigh on U.S. Households

Fears over the global economy "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-sentiment-falls-11547825356?tesla=y" on American households even though demand for factory goods remains solid. An index of U.S. consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than two years in January, the University of Michigan said Friday. Richard Curtin, the survey's economist, said the decline reflected worries about the government shutdown, trade tensions, volatile markets, a cooling global economy and uncertainty over what the Fed will do next. January's preliminary reading of 90.7 was the lowest since October 2016 and well below the forecast of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal who had expected a reading of 96.4.

China Moves Cautiously in Face of Economic Slowdown

As Beijing confronts China's slowdown, it is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-moves-cautiously-in-face-of-economic-slowdown-11547994330?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=5&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" to monetary and fiscal easing, while swearing off what it calls "flood-irrigation stimulus" a reference to the aggressive pro-growth policies of the past.

Trillion Schmillion: Japan Isn't Even Trying to Hit Bond-Buying Target

Since October 2014, the Bank of Japan has pledged to buy about 80 trillion ($732 billion) in Japanese government bonds annually, a pledge it is expected to repeat Wednesday. But at the current pace, the BOJ is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/numbers-game-for-the-bank-of-japan-80-trillion-means-about-20-trillion-11548072005?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" to buy only about 20 trillion of bonds this year, after buying 38 trillion last year.

U.S. Manufacturers Ramp Up Production Despite Flagging Exports

Factory production "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-industrial-production-rose-at-the-end-of-2018-11547821173?tesla=y" amid broad-based gains in output, signaling U.S. consumer demand may be making up for a pullback in exports. Industrial production, a measure of overall factory, mining and utility output, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in December from the prior month, the Fed said Friday. Output at U.S. factories, which accounts for the bulk of the nation's total industrial output, grew 1.1% last month, the biggest gain since February 2018.

Your Bowie Is No Good Here, But He'll Pay for a Zumba Class in Brixton

One vending machine stands out in Brixton Market, a fast-gentrifying spot in south London. The prices are unusually high, 10 on the top row and 5 beneath. But then the goods for sale are unusual too: neatly rolled "Brixton pounds," with peace signs in place of zeros and singer David Bowie in place of the Queen. Brixton is one of several British communities, from the city of Bristol to the sleepy Lake District national park, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-bowie-is-no-good-here-but-hell-pay-for-a-zumba-class-in-brixton-11547814606?tesla=y". Their goal: to provide a means of supporting local businesses and build a sense of community. If it helps reduce dependence on traditional banks and cuts down on the carbon emissions that come with trading long distances, all the better.

Shutdown Hits Industries Nationwide

By Gabriel T. Rubin

The partial government shutdown is affecting a wide range of business and financial concerns nationwide.

Shuttered government offices are stalling the approval of new loans, initial public offerings, the processing of tax documents, and the approval of new products such as prescription drugs, among other effects. While some programs are reopening on a temporary basis or providing workarounds for affected companies, most services won't return to normal until the government fully reopens and 800,000 federal workers sift through the backlog. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shutdown-hits-industries-nationwide-11548075600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb":

 "The partial closure of the Securities and Exchange Commission is delaying the ability of companies to open the IPO market. Companies that were seeking to list shares in January are delaying plans since the regulator has stopped reviewing and approving new and pending corporate registration statements. Publicly traded companies also could have to put shareholder proposals they oppose to a vote if the shutdown doesn't end before many U.S. companies hold annual meetings at the end of winter. Banking regulators remain open, operating on fees collecting from the companies they oversee.

 "Airlines expect to have sluggish revenue growth in the first quarter in part because of revenue lost from government travel cancellations. Delta Air Lines Inc. Chief Executive Ed Bastian, for instance, said the shutdown would cost his airline $25 million in lost revenue from government travel. Delta also can't start service on its new Airbus A220 airplanes until it gets approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.

 "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has dramatically curtailed inspections of domestic facilities at food-processing companies during the shutdown, though unpaid inspectors have resumed work inspecting higher-risk products such as fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, seafood and dairy products. Meanwhile, businesses seeking to launch new alcoholic beverage products can't get needed approvals in the tightly regulated industry. The FDA is set to run out of money in early February for evaluating new prescription drugs if the shutdown continues, potentially slowing the release of new therapies including cancer treatments.

 "At the Internal Revenue Service, the shutdown has created delays in getting some employer identification numbers, holding up some routine business deals. Many IRS auditors and collection workers are on furlough, making it difficult for tax practitioners to know if the government has received paperwork in business and individual cases. The IRS called workers back after mortgage lenders complained the government wasn't processing forms that lenders use to verify borrowers' incomes for loans.

 "Some small-business loans are also stuck in limbo. The Small Business Administration has stopped approving routine loans that the agency backs to ensure entrepreneurs have access to funds, halting their plans for expansion and repairs and forcing some owners to consider costlier sources of cash. The Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency reopened on Thursday to help process loans and tax documents, but did so only for three days. The agency also wasn't processing new loans, just renewals of existing ones. The delay has also slowed regulations on an incentive for investing in low-income areas.

 "The government process for reviewing proposed mergers has been slowed by the shutdown, but it is still operating. Sizable mergers must be reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. Because the agencies don't want companies to be able to consummate problematic mergers without government scrutiny, they have concluded such matters are an essential function that can continue during the shutdown, but staff levels are limited and deadlines are slipping. The government also isn't processing streamlined approval for straightforward deals.

 "Businesses that have government contracts are feeling the strain across a variety of industries, including the building of highways and bridges. The nine major federal departments affected by the shutdown committed to spend $61 billion for contracted services in fiscal year 2018, according to public data, roughly 11% of the total $544 billion allocated for such work. Most government contractors are defense and military companies that are shielded from the shutdown. But some defense contractors are still feeling the strain.

 "The shutdown is having an effect on cryptocurrency markets. Bakkt, a bitcoin futures trading platform, cannot launch its contracts until the Commodity Futures Trading Commission weighs in on its business plan.

 "The shutdown has spread into space. Lockheed Martin warned in a regulatory filing that furloughs threaten the launch of a commercial satellite for a Saudi Arabian customer, as well as some other SpaceX launches. Lockheed needs government approval for a giant, Russian-owned cargo jet to fly satellites from California to Florida, and cautions that the timetable for some planned military launches later this year could slip.

Why Europeans Won't Catch Wall Street's Bandwagon

"Investors in European banks "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-europeans-wont-catch-wall-streets-bandwagon-11547814261?mod=article_inline" about eye-catching results on Wall Street," writes The Wall Street Journal's Paul J. Davies. "Most big European lenders are more exposed to areas in which U.S. peers did badly and less to those that shone. Only Barclays could enjoy a U.S.-style bounce. Investors were negative on banks all last year, and particularly in December. Upbeat earnings reports from the U.S. this week therefore helped spark a broad rally. But there is a catch: The big U.S. groups made gains mostly in traditional domestic lending, equities trading and mergers and acquisitions. Only Barclays among European banks can claim to have a finger in all these pies, and even it may have lost market share in global deal making, according to data from Refinitiv."

Utah has had the fastest-growing labor force of any U.S. state since January 2010 a key ingredient for economic growth and one that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/utah-shows-how-labor-force-growth-fuels-economic-growth-11547809200?tesla=y" for the nation as a whole as it seeks to fuel a more rapid expansion.

The European Union"https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-fires-opening-salvo-in-u-s-trade-talks-by-targeting-industrial-goods-11547820421?tesla=y" in trade talks with the U.S., outlining a narrow goal of slashing tariffs on industrial goods, including motor vehicles, that sets the bloc on a collision course with Washington's broader agenda.

South Korea's economic growth in 2018 was the slowest in six years, despite an unexpectedly strong pickup in the final quarter.

The riskiest sectors in the municipal bond market "https://www.wsj.com/articles/risk-rises-in-municipal-bonds-11548086400?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" of total bond sales in 2018, up from 17.4% the prior year, according to Municipal Market Analytics data.

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said that more than doubling the federal minimum wage "https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-secretary-says-15-minimum-wage-would-kill-jobs-11547831488?tesla=y" in the U.S.

The dollar's pre-eminence looks "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dominant-dollar-bests-challengers-11547994049?mod=searchresults&page=2&pos=4" in many ways, after a drawn-out eurozone crisis and the recent slowdown in China.

The overall rate of union membership in the U.S. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-union-membership-rate-declined-in-2018-11547837708", largely reflecting a decline in the rate of state employees' unionization, according to the latest Labor Department data.

Inflation in Canada "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-inflation-unexpectedly-accelerated-in-december-11547820577?tesla=y" in December as steeper costs for phone services and food offset lower gasoline prices, pushing up the average inflation rate for all of 2018 to the highest level in seven years.

Malaysia's central bank is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysias-central-bank-expected-to-stand-pat-11548149840?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" interest rate unchanged on Thursday, despite economist forecasts that growth will slow.

Boyne Capital Partners and Grindstone Partners have agreed to sell information technology and government consulting company Fulcrum IT Services LLC to publicly traded Huntington Ingalls Industries.

The sale allows the two firms to exit a portfolio company that they acquired back in 2010. Fulcrum provides software and consulting services that help health-care organizations, businesses and government agencies with tasks that include big data analytics, cybersecurity, data management, software development, advanced engineering and other services, according to its website.

Under private-equity ownership, the Centreville, Va.-based company completed at least two add-on acquisitions, including PTR Group, a Herndon, Va.-based software engineering services company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-add-on-deal-roundup-feb-7-1518033363?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" in February 2018.

Huntington Ingalls said in a press release the company will become part of its technical solutions division.

Miami-based Boyne Capital targets investments in companies with between $10 million and $100 million in revenue, according to the firm's website.

Meanwhile, Grindstone Partners, of Alexandria, Va., and its network of investors typically invest $2 million to $20 million in growth equity and buyouts, according to its website.

The Take: A Sneak Peek Into Consumer Investing in 2019

By Jaewon Kang

Thousands of consumer-focused private-equity professionals, advisers and executives gathered for a 2019 preview at the ICR Conference in Orlando, Fla., this week. The consensus from panels, presentations and meetings? Many investors are kicking off the year with both caution about their pipeline and a conviction that activity levels should still hold up at the midmarket level and below.

As the economic cycle continues onto its ninth year of expansion, private-equity investors are looking at the deal landscape with much more wariness about when the tide could turn. Firms subsequently are paying more attention to macro factors: market volatility, a tight labor market, increasing packaging costs and other types of inflationary pressure. Read Kang's Take.

Deals

BDT Capital, the private investment firm founded by ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Byron Trott, is betting on consumer demand for craft spirits will continue with the purchase of a minority stake in WhistlePig, Liz Hoffman reports for the Wall Street Journal.

WASHINGTON Parents have a new item to add to their financial to-do list: check their child's credit history.

A new federal law going into effect in September will make it easier for families to combat the growing problem of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/identity-fraud-hits-record-number-of-people-1517922001" of minors, allowing them to make inquiries about credit files in their child's name and freeze a file at no cost.

Data-security experts say children are increasingly targeted by thieves who steal their Social Security numbers to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-id-theft-thousands-of-credit-applicants-who-dont-exist-1520350404", then open credit cards, take out loans or apply for public assistance. One credit-reporting company, Experian, estimates such identity theft will affect one in four children before they become an adult.

The ability to check children's credit reports is part of a broader banking law that also allowed unlimited, free credit freezes for adults, a response to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765" at Equifax Inc. last September.

Steps for Parents

* Go to "https://identitytheft.gov/Steps", scroll down and click on the Child Identity Theft section, under Special Forms of Identity Theft.

* That section has instructions on how to find out if your child has a credit report. Most young children shouldn't have credit files.

* The webpage includes contact information for credit agencies and how to freeze credit.

* Some experts recommend parents create a credit file for their children and freeze it, because the system is built on the idea that the first person to create a file is that person.

* Keep the record of freezes in a safe place, so the child or a guardian can find it when needed.

Criminals see the clean credit histories of children as particularly attractive, in part because parents rarely check on them. That often allows theft to go unnoticed for years, until the victims reach college age and start applying for credit cards and student loans. Also, a 2011 change in how the government assigns Social Security numbers to babies and new immigrants made it easier to steal numbers without being discovered, experts said.

Young children don't have credit files unless parents or guardians have opened them or someone committing fraud did so.

Last year, the Federal Trade Commission received 14,000 complaints involving identity theft targeting people 19 and younger, about 3.7% of complaints for all age groups. But experts say those numbers may understate the problem because parents are often unaware of children being targeted, and don't report it.

"We have found children are increasingly victims of identity theft," said Suzanne Barber, director of the Center for Identity at the University of Texas at Austin. "If I were going to patchwork an identity, whose would I want to use? I'd probably use the identity that is checked least often."

Al Pascual, an analyst specializing in fraud and security at Javelin Strategy & Research, said a child's personal information is more valuable on the dark web than an adult's, with a full set of personal information known as "fullz" name, date of birth, address and Social Security number "going for 10 times, 20 times more" than an adult file, which typically fetches $5 per person.

ID Analytics, an identity-fraud prevention unit of Symantec Corp., estimates 2.2% or one in every 50 of credit applications filed under newly issued Social Security numbers carried fake identities last year, up from 1.2% in 2013. Many of those numbers are believed to belong to young children.

Once a child's personal information is stolen, cleaning up the aftermath can be difficult.

Jill Carlon, a Peoria, Ariz., mother of three, said she spent seven years fixing her daughter's credit file after receiving a call in 2011 about a new J.C. Penney Co. credit card opened using her then 7-year-old daughter's Social Security number. More accounts followed, including at Dillards Inc., Macy's Inc. and Fry's Electronics Inc. Then collection notices came from a local hotel.

"As a mother, I am supposed to be there to protect her and do everything I can," said Ms. Carlon, a 46-year-old nurse. "It was out of my control."

Ms. Carlon tried to close the accounts, but was turned away because the name on the accounts didn't match her daughter's, Avery.

She called banks, credit-reporting companies, the police and lawyers, then turned to local city council members and U.S. senators for help. Ms. Carlon said the effort required stressful trips with her daughter to court and Social Security offices.

The Carlons changed their daughter's first and middle names in an attempt to get her a new Social Security number. The issue was finally resolved earlier this year when a new Social Security number was issued to Avery just before she started high school.

Once the provision in the new law goes into effect on Sept. 21, parents should contact the three main credit-reporting companies Experian, Equifax and TransUnion to check on their children's credit files, experts say. Most young children shouldn't have credit files. If that is confirmed, parents should either check back with the companies on a regular basis, or create a new file and freeze it, the option some experts recommend.

Ken Meiser, chief compliance officer at ID Analytics, recommends parents create a credit file for their children, because the credit-reporting system is built on the idea the first person to claim an identity is that person.

"It makes sense for a parent to make sure that they have created that file and protected it," Mr. Meiser said.

The FTC has a new page on its "https://identitytheft.gov/" website with a detailed guide on how to freeze credit files for adults and children. The page includes contact information for the credit-reporting companies and how to freeze credit.

Shut out of the boom

Since its return to economic growth, Spain has seen a steady rise in private equity investments. But some fear these deals will kill jobs in a country where unemployment is the second highest in the EU. By Javier Espinoza

L ike his father before him, Josep Bayod Cueto worked at one of Spain's oldest companies for decades. It never occurred to the 59-year-old that he might lose his job at the sparkling winemaker Codornu even as the company prepared to sell the familyowned business to a US buyout fund. So when his redundancy notice arrived just over a year ago "it felt like a divorce", says Mr Bayod Cueto, sitting in a caf in the town of Sant Sadurn d'Anoia in Catalonia where Codornu has had its headquarters for almost 500 years. "I fear I won't be the last."

His position was one of 100   a sixth of the total workforce   axed in 2017 as Codornu began negotiating a  ¬390m sale, prompted by falling sales and shareholder disquiet, to the US-based Carlyle Group. Although the job losses predate completion of the Carlyle deal it has fuelled fears of further cuts in the town, whose 13,000 inhabitants rely on cava production to make a living.

The fallout from the job losses has also cast an uncomfortable light on the rising role of private equity in Spanish dealmaking. In the first nine months of 2018, foreign private equity funds invested a record  ¬4.35bn in Spain   according to an analysis by the Spanish Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (ASCRI).

In some quarters that investment is prompting anxiety over the expansion of what critics view as a ruthless form of capitalism.

According to ASCRI, the number of international funds   some of them with billions of dollars under management   operating in Spain has grown, from 157 in 2016 to 184 in 2017. Permira, BC Partners, Cinven and KKR have all struck deals in Spain recently against a backdrop of economic recovery.

"Spain is an attractive place to invest," says Lionel Assant, European head of private equity for the US buyout group Blackstone, which recently took control of the gaming group Cirsa. "It has grown above most other eurozone countries for the last few years on the back of the structural reforms the country undertook and we expect that healthy rate of growth to continue."

Last year, Luxembourg-based CVC, one of Europe's largest buyout funds, bought a 20 per cent stake in Gas Natural Fenosa from Spanish energy company Repsol in a  ¬3.82bn deal. The company was already planning to cut 1,400 jobs globally as part of a wider restructuring to save  ¬538m. But since the deal was struck the company, rebranded Naturgy, has axed 800 posts through voluntary redundancies, more than the 300 planned for 2018. Naturgy is now minority owned by a Spanish holding company, Criteria Caixa, which owns 24 per cent. Global Infrastructure Partners, a New York-based private equity fund, owns another 20 per cent.

It is not just at Naturgy that there are concerns. Across Spain, workers fear the impact these groups might have on their jobs. Private equity groups tend to make money by buying companies, improving their efficiency through job cuts and acquiring smaller businesses to merge with them with the view to selling the company for a profit two or three years down the line.

"These cuts are a way of generating more value for shareholders," says Toi Prieto, general secretary of the 117,000-member Unin Sindical Obrera and a longtime employee at Naturgy. "But we are slowly losing our culture. Following the voluntary redundancies the loyalty to the company has been diluted."

Acute scepticism Spain is not the first country to display ambivalence to private equity funds. Industry observers have likened the hostile reaction in Spain to that in Germany more than a decade ago when the chairman of the then ruling Social Democrat party likened financial investors to "a plague of locusts" descending only to strip firms of assets and shred jobs to make a quick buck.

Such scepticism is acute in Spain, a country battered by the financial crisis. At the height of the recession, in 2013, Spain had one of the worst unemployment rates in the EU, with nearly half of all young people without a job. The deep downturn was mainly a result of the crash of the local property market and disarray in the financial system.

The country is now enjoying some of the healthiest growth rates in the EU. Unemployment is expected to fall to 13.3 per cent by next year   still high at almost double the EU average, but down from 16 per cent in 2017 and close to the rate in 2008 before the crisis hit.

Labour reforms dating back to 2012 and an overhaul of the banking system have acted as catalysts for dealmaking, according to multiple private equity executives in the country.

"For many years Spain was a place to avoid for investors because we didn't enjoy a recovery as others in Europe did," says Miguel Zurita, chairman of ASCRI. "At some point there was even talk of Spain leaving the euro and unemployment figures were quite alarming. It was almost impossible to justify an investment in [the country]."

While there are domestic private equity players, it is overseas funds that are making inroads. It is now "an attractive destination", says Mr Zurita, who is also a managing partner at Altamar Capital Partners.

The relaxation of labour laws, making it easier to hire and fire, has been particularly attractive to buyout funds, adds Mr Zurita. "As an investor you prefer to invest where you have the ability to adjust to the market and labour is a key component." He stresses that buyout groups do not, however, "buy with the idea of cutting jobs" but they do want "to have the option".

Iaki Echave, former head of Spain for Blackstone, believes increased financing by local and global banks has been critical to foreign investors.

"For years banks were either unable or unwilling to lend. The reform of the financial system in Spain has been more extensive and deeper than anywhere else in the continent," he says. It means more loans are being made available to fund transactions. S&P Global Markets Intelligence says  ¬4.36bn was lent in 2017, up from just  ¬700m two years earlier, according to data from LCD.

Cash piles A growing economy   gross domestic product increased by 3 per cent in 2017   is not the only factor driving private equity investment. Concerns over Brexit have diverted attention to businesses in Spain, while groups including CVC, Carlyle and Apollo have also raised their largest ever funds.

Armed with that cash, private equity is thriving across Europe and in the US, where the largest transactions since the financial crisis took place last year. Private equity groups have in recent times influenced the shape of some of the largest businesses in the world   from Unilever to Thomson Reuters   deploying billions in loans and employing millions of people around the globe.

But this frenetic activity is triggering a backlash in Spain, with some characterising buyout groups as little more than rapacious, greedy financiers looking to ride the recent economic boom without thinking about the long-term future of these companies and their employees.

This image of the finance sector in Spain was cast during the country's financial crisis when distressed investors   mainly hedge funds   bet against the battered Spanish economy. Some of these made quick profits by buying companies low and selling assets high after the collapse of the property sector.

"We are not in distress any more but their actions created some noise," says Mr Echave. "Those investors have moved elsewhere but private equity is about the long term."

Negative headlines about private equity deals outside the country have dogged the sector in Spain, says Ludovic Phalippou, professor of finance at Oxford university's Sad Business School and author of Private Equity Laid Bare. "There is a sense of emergency that private equity funds bring with them. People know this and it worries them at the start of an investment."

He highlights a recent Washington Post article that accused Carlyle, the purchaser of Codornu, of putting financial considerations ahead of patient care at a nursing home it took over in Pennsylvania. Carlyle has said the quality of care at HCR ManorCare was not compromised by financial considerations. "Open any newspaper and you will find evidence of a bad image for private equity," says Prof Phalippou. "It is the purest version of capitalism on steroids and their ultimate goal is to make money. They don't care about many other things and that's where the tension with the rest of society comes in."

Rising opposition Mr Zurita points to a study commissioned by ASCRI showing that private equity-owned businesses in Spain added 7.6 per cent more jobs annually three years after acquisition. This compares with a 2.3 per cent rise in jobs for those that did not receive private equity backing, according to the report by Spain's Universidad Complutense de Madrid, based on 186 companies.

A survey conducted by Consumer Science &Analytics, a polling group, shows public opinion towards private equity funds in Spain is roughly split down the middle. The reaction to the influx of foreign buyers in parts of the Spanish media has been more partisan, with some employing nationalist or protectionist language.

Gonzalo Baratech, a newspaper columnist for Crnica Global in Barcelona, described the Codornu sale as being "positive to the shareholders" but "calamitous for the country because we are losing control of a company from these lands, one of the oldest in Spain and Europe".

The political debate in Spain has not reached the high pitch it hit in Germany or even in the UK when buyout funds were under public scrutiny over the little tax they paid. But on a local level Rafa Berlanga, a politician in Sant Sadurn, sums up the fears of many in his community: "Private equity groups are like a virus, they suck in as much juice and then leave the carcass behind."

ASCRI's Mr Zurita insists that private equity funds add value to society. "It is not only good for us to have a healthy private equity industry but it is good for the Spanish economy as well."

At the time of the purchase, Carlyle sought to reassure the Codornu workers by highlighting its record of buying family-owned businesses. Alex Wagenberg, managing director at the US buyout group, said: "We hope to build on this successful trajectory by supporting the company with growing its global footprint, both organically and through acquisitions."

But in Sant Sadurn workers are wary. Codornu's head of marketing and other executives lost their jobs at the end of last year. Some expect Carlyle to identify further cuts in administrative roles. "There will be some fat to trim," says a longtime Codornu employee.

Antonio Cruces, a longtime worker at the company and a prominent union leader, sums up the view of many in his town: "These funds move like the lion in the savannah: they prey on the weak."

Deals Tourism and finance seen as attractive sectors Target Cirsa Gaming Corporation Buyer Blackstone Price  ¬2bn Year 2018 Spain's largest casino operator, pictured, also manages thousands of slot machines and many bingo halls. Long regarded as a good barometer of Spanish consumer confidence, its revenues took a big hit at the height of the financial crisis but have since recovered.

Blackstone, which bought 100 per cent of Cirsa, fought off some of the largest names in private equity, including Apollo Global Management, to secure the deal.

Target Allfunds Bank Buyer Hellman & Friedman and Singapore's GIC Price  ¬1.8bn Year 2017 As in other recent large deals, competition for Allfunds Bank was subject to an intense bidding battle with a string of foreign buyers vying to buy an asset that was once part controlled by Spanish banking group Santander.

Among the bidders were the Chinese investor group Legend, Advent International and Permira. Hellman & Friedman and the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC won out against a backdrop of opposition to Chinese ownership.

Target Hotelbeds Buyer Cinven and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Price  ¬1.2bn Year 2016 This deal was a bet on growing tourism demand in Spain. Individual tourist spending has been increasing every year since 2012 and, according to multiple analysts, it is likely to grow further thanks partly to troubles in holiday destinations in the Middle East and Africa.

The acquisition of Hotelbeds, which sells rooms to travel agents and tour operators, is an example of how private equity buyers have spotted this opportunity. Swedish fund EQT was reportedly also interested in the business.

Boom time In the first nine months of 2018, foreign private equity funds invested a record  ¬4.35bn in Spain Green shoots The country's economic recovery and post-crisis reforms have attracted the buyout industry Cash rich Having raised some of their biggest ever funds, private equity firms are thriving in Europe and the US

Brands Seek Deeper Insights From AI; Marketers want to understand what their machines are seeing

Marketers increasingly are using AI tools to try to show the right people the right messages at the right time. For many, the next step is to learn something deeper from the results.

"I can answer specifically why a particular decision was made," said Steve Nowlan, senior vice president of decision sciences at Conversant LLC, which uses machine learning to help brands recognize and engage consumers. Machine learning is the subset of AI in which systems are trained to "learn" complex tasks without being fed every rule.

Conversant can explain, for example, that an algorithm decided to serve a particular impression to a certain consumer at a given time because it was most likely generate a purchase, Mr. Nowlan said. "That's an absolutely true statement," he said, "but it's also a really uninformative statement for the marketer because they're looking for something that can guide their strategy."

Conversant and a client, the vitamins and supplements marketer Swanson Health Products Inc., had to figure out what was going on during a campaign when they realized that Swanson's revenue was starting to decline even though the number of its customers was increasing.

It turned out that Swanson was winning new buyers among a desirable, younger demographic but was getting them through online shopping platforms that didn't encourage brand loyalty as much as Swanson's own home page. Conversant and Swanson responded by creating campaigns designed to find such new customers and steer them toward the company site.

AI "isn't just,  turn it on and let it run,'" said Corey Bergstrom, chief marketing and merchandising officer at Swanson.

Human Vision

Advance Auto Parts Inc. uses machine learning in part to predict whether customers are likely to keep spending or drop off. "Our model predicted really well who was going to reduce spending," said Yogi Jashnani, chief marketing officer at the company. "But we needed to build intuition into that."

In some ways, marketing AI is nothing but making significantly better predictions about what people will do, Mr. Jashnani said. "Better prediction is not as valuable an additive if you don't combine that with judgment."

Advance Auto Parts built a lot of its AI-based predictive spending models in-house, according to Mr. Jashnani. "It also forced me to be a better customer of data scientists and a better student of AI," he said. "CMOs need to have that skill set going forward."

The good news is that it isn't that hard to understand the reasoning behind the machines, or at least not yet, said Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. "Right now, you're just making your existing campaign management more efficient &through an attribute-based campaign process that you can understand," she said.

Gaining useful strategic insights already takes effort, others argued.

"Tools don't provide insights," said Lauren Radcliffe, head of media and acquisition strategy at E*Trade Financial Corp. "They provide incredible platforms for us to do quantitative testing so that we can analyze the data and understand what's happening. The tool will never tell you the why."

Sometimes not knowing exactly why is fine, Ms. Radcliffe added. Brands can set AI loose to chase relatively straightforward goals like finding qualified prospects to open an account at certain levels, she said. "All they're doing is finding people in the universe who are most likely to convert on the goal they're giving them. The brilliance of AI and big data is I don't know why anyone would even try to understand it."

In other instances, it's important to interrogate an unexpected or disappointing result. "That's where the people come in," Ms. Radcliffe said. "I would never trust a machine to analyze that level of data ever."

AI "certainly might say,  Change tactics here or change audiences or pricing or some kind of element,' but it doesn't necessarily say why,'" said Hannah Mirza, former global head of media partnerships at MediaCom, a media planning and buying agency within WPP PLC's GroupM.

As AI becomes more complex, moreover, it will be more important to bring the right kind of talent into marketing to help understand it. "In my experience, it's the biggest gap in terms of mathematicians and data analysts coming into the sector in the volume we need them," Ms. Mirza said.

Pro Tips

* Have the right talent in-house and at your vendors. Without experts who understand AI, gleaning insights will be next to impossible.

* Don't be overly reliant on an AI-vendor-driven decisions. Marketers often have the most telling picture of their own customers and businesses.

* Don't dive deep into every AI result. Interrogating the "black box" isn't always worth the effort.

The Take: Highlights from JP Morgan's Health-Care Conference

By Laura Cooper

The start of the year for health-care investors officially kicked off at the 37th annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco last week. The weeklong conference brought tens of thousands of health-care professionals, including chief executives and health-care investors, to the City by the Bay for networking, deal making and general intelligence gathering.

Between meetings and cocktail receptions, private-equity professionals shared some of their thoughts about what lies in store for health-care investors this year. Read Cooper's Take.

Apollo Global Management LLC is nearing a deal to buy aerospace-parts maker Arconic Inc. for more than $10 billion, a transaction that, if successful, promises to ease investor fears over a potential deep freeze in the credit markets. It may be a bit early to pop the champagne just yet, however, given that the recent credit-market thaw is still in its infancy. But if lenders step up and the deal proceeds, it would be one of the biggest buyouts in recent memory.

Good day!

In other news, Resurgens Technology Partners has rounded up $212 million for its debut fund and Partners Group deployed nearly $20 billion across all of its investment strategies.

Why Fink's heir is not yet apparent

BlackRock boasts a 'deep bench' of executives from which to choose a successor if and when founder retires

Last week, Larry Fink promoted Mark Wiedman, the head of BlackRock's sprawling index investing business, to a new enlarged role that thrusts him to the top of the list of executives likely to take up the reins of the $6.4tn asset management group if its founder decides to step down.

However, Mr Fink likes to brag about BlackRock's "deep bench" of senior executives and in his memo announcing Mr Wiedman's promotion he hinted at a broader reshuffle later this year. Insiders say that no one senior is expected to leave, but new frontrunners could still emerge as roles are rejigged.

While there are no hints that Black-Rock's founder plans to step down, about half a dozen people are broadly considered by observers to be in the running to succeed Mr Fink when he does retire: three Marks, two Robs and one Rich.

Mark Wiedman

Until this week, Mr Wiedman was head of BlackRock's $4.1tn index investing group, which includes the asset manager's crown jewel   iShares, the rapidly growing exchange-traded fund business acquired from Barclays following the financial crisis.

Mr Wiedman is a gregarious Long Island native who joined BlackRock in 2004 after stints at McKinsey and as an adviser to the US Treasury. His first job was at an advisory group that counselled BlackRock clients such as central banks on market issues, but he rose to head corporate strategy and in 2011 was put in charge of the iShares business and tasked with integrating it fully into BlackRock.

When he took over iShares, it had about $600bn in assets. Today, it manages $1.8tn, and accounted for almost a third of BlackRock's revenue in the third quarter. Mr Wiedman is now overseeing all international operations, corporate strategy and marketing. "The future is all about creating new markets," Mr Wiedman said in a 2012 interview with the FT. "The idea that giant insurance companies that are accustomed to buying individual bonds or derivatives are now beginning to use ETFs as core parts of their portfolios, that is totally new and we are starting to see it globally."

Mark McCombe

Mr McCombe, the San Francisco-based head of Americas at BlackRock, is a more recent arrival, having been poached from HSBC in 2011. At HSBC, he ran the asset management arm and ultimately its Hong Kong operations before jumping ship for BlackRock.

About 40 per cent of BlackRock's client assets are managed out of San Francisco, where Barclays Global Investors was based before Mr Fink swooped for the group in 2009. The location allows Mr McCombe to be BlackRock's main liaison when it comes to California's big pension funds as well as the growing Asian customer base, a priority for the investment group in the coming years.

His ties to Asia and Hong Kong especially are extensive, and in 2006 he was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Year honours list.

As a point person for BlackRock's US pension business, he has focused on retirement as a live wire subject. "We want to take a lead in addressing what we believe is one of the most significant and important societal issues we face today," he said at BlackRock's investor day last year.

Mark Wiseman

Another relatively new arrival at Black-Rock, Mr Wiseman was chief executive at the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board   one of the biggest and most sophisticated pension schemes in the world   before Mr Fink brought him to BlackRock in 2016 (where his wife Marcia Moffat already worked). The hockey-loving Canadian chairs BlackRock Alternative Investors, where he is working on building up its private equity and debt investing business. But his main job is to run the asset manager's $366bn global active equities business.

This unit is a profitable but long under-performing corner of the investment group. Mr Wiseman is an advocate of integrating more advanced analytics, systematic investing techniques, big data and technology broadly into the traditional stockpicking process. He is trying to use BlackRock's Systematic Active Equities, its San Francisco-based quant arm, to modernise the rest of its stockpicking operations.

"If you're a traditional portfolio manager it's a challenging time because there's so much change happening around you," Mr Wiseman told the FT last year. "If you're unwilling to evolve you're likely going to get eaten alive."

Rob Goldstein

Mr Goldstein is the youngest member of BlackRock's global executive committee, but the only one to have spent his entire professional career there.

He joined BlackRock in 1994 as a 20-year-old analyst in its portfolio analytics group and has been instrumental in building up Aladdin, the famed analytics and risk management platform that underpins all of the group's operations and has been sold to other asset managers around the world.

Short for Asset Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment Network, Aladdin is now used by 25,000 other investment managers that manage more than $18tn. It is the centrepiece of Black-Rock's technology services sales, which were a bright spot in the third quarter.

Mr Goldstein is now chief operating officer, in charge of the BlackRock Solutions unit that houses Aladdin, and oversees all technology at the investment group. Last year, he championed a new "BlackRock Lab for Artificial Intelligence" in Palo Alto, California, on the view that machine learning can enhance its operations across the board.

"AI may be in a big hype cycle but there's no doubt the technology is real and changing the world already," Mr Goldstein said in an interview with the FT at the time. "This is about increasing the efficiency of what we do across the board. Every part of our business is already being augmented by these new capabilities."

Rob Kapito

Mr Kapito is one of the co-founders of BlackRock, its president since 2007 and Mr Fink's right-hand man. He is in charge of all day-to-day operations of its major units. Before becoming president, he was in charge of all of BlackRock's portfolio management across equities, bonds and alternative investments.

As a co-founder and top executive who worked with Mr Fink at First Boston (later Credit Suisse First Boston) as a mortgage trader in the 1980s, Mr Kapito was long considered the favourite to take over as BlackRock's chief executive if the top man had snagged the Treasury Secretary job he has long wanted.

But observers expect that Mr Kapito's age   he is just five years younger than BlackRock's chief executive and turns 62 on February 8   means that he could now lose out to one of the younger guns.

Mr Kapito has warned that many financial services companies were too complacent about the threat of disruptive technology and new entrants. "Apple was not in the music industry, Google was not in the mobile phone industry and Amazon was not in the groceries business   until they were," he said at Davos last year. "Tech companies are going to enter the financial services market in a very, very aggressive way."

Rich Kushel

Mr Kushel is not as well-known as some of the other members of "Larry's bench". But insiders say the BlackRock veteran   he joined the group in 1991   is well-regarded and among the top half-dozen candidates to succeed Mr Fink.

After a series of senior positions, Mr Kushel took charge of BlackRock's global fixed income investing in February 2018, in addition to leading multi-asset strategies. BlackRock's bond group manages almost a third of its overall assets and accounted for about $2bn of revenues in 2017, or roughly one-sixth of all that year's income.

At BlackRock's investor day in 2018, Mr Kushel argued that the typical investor approach to portfolio construction had not evolved much since the theories put forward by Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz in the 1950s   and was thus a big opportunity for a big, broad financial supermarket like BlackRock. "We believe that BlackRock could and should do better and set the objective to raise the bar, update current practice and apply a more modern and rigorous process to build better portfolios for our clients," he said. "I believe that portfolio construction is one of the fastestgrowing opportunities in the industry and an area where we can really differentiate BlackRock."

Bombshell: Top dealmaker chooses money over dream job

Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT s daily deals briefing

FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.

September s news that UBS s uber dealmaker Andrea Orcel was jumping ship to lead Santander sent shockwaves through the European banking world. But there were even bigger ricochets on Tuesday when it emerged that the Italian would in fact not be joining the Spanish bank.

The passionate banker, who told the FT back in 2015 that he d quite like to be chief executiveof a bank some day, originally hoped to start his new role as early as January after stepping down as head of UBS s investment bank in September.

Then came a delay. Forced to serve his full six months gardening leave at UBS, Orcel couldn t start until around April   followed by Tuesday s bombshell that Santander and Orcel had failed to reach a deal on giving him  ¬50m of Santander stock to make up for what he was forfeiting at UBS.

The news was greeted with disbelief by finance folks on both sides of the Atlantic. How could one of Europe s most eminent bankers have got the biggest deal of his own career so wrong, agreeing to go to Santander without a watertight agreement on pay?

And, from Santander s side, how could it so publicly name a new CEO without doing the basic maths   and negotiation   on what it would take to get him to sign on the dotted line and show up for work in Madrid?

To be more exact, according to people informed about the matter, Orcel did have a letter of guarantee from Ana Botn, Santander s executive chair,and she tried her hardest to get his pay deal approved.But the board simply overruled her.

Santander had hoped UBS wouldn t claw back all of the compensation, which would have left the Spanish bank with a smaller bill to pay. But UBS wouldn t budge, Santander s board balked at the 10-digit sum, and the marriage was off.

Which leaves us with a lot of speculation over Orcel s next steps.

His departure from UBS is well and truly final   he s already been replaced there with two co-heads of the investment bank, and the Swiss lender is reportedly courting former Orcel rival Christian Meissner for a senior leadership role.

Is it time for the Orcel & Co boutique? Will he try his hand at running a bank in his native Italyor give Wall Street another shot? Or have a few months of life s more leisurely pursuits given him a taste for actual retirement?

There s a side issue too:can UBS keep Santander as one of its biggest financial institutions group clients after playing hardball and depriving the Spanish bank of its would-be CEO? Let the pitching begin 	. 	. 	. 	

Below is the Santander letter announcing the board s decision to kill Orcel s appointment:

Gold miners join the deal frenzy

Activity is finally stirring in mining. Resources bankers have emerged from their bunkers and are gearing up for a year of deals in the gold mining sector, following a multiyear drought.

The action was kicked off by Barrick Gold s John Thornton, a Goldman Sachsveteran, who paid $6bn to acquire Randgold and its (big game hunting)South African boss Mark Bristow last year. The union, struck in September, led the two sides toproclaimthey had created the world s largest gold company.

Not so fast. This week US gold miner Newmont Mining, which was founded in 1916, said it would acquire struggling Canadian miner Goldcorp for $12.5bn including debt   creating an even bigger gold company. However, the market reaction has been poor and investors are grumbling.

Bankers predict that every gold company will consider similar moves in a sector that s in dire need of consolidation. Gold miners have barely made investors any money over the past five years, despite a rising gold price. Instead they ve spent a lot on executive compensation and in ill-timed acquisitions. Investors will now be pressing companies to act.

There are a handful of mid-tier gold companies with depressed share prices thatcould be next, bankers say. These include Canada s Kinross Gold and Yamana Gold. Shares in Kinross have fallen by 28 per cent over the past year while Yamana is off by 27 per cent.

South African gold miner AngloGold Ashanti could be one company looking for assets. AngloGold s new chief executive is Kelvin Dushnisky, an ambitious executive who was previously at Barrick. He s keen to build the company s international operations and list in London, according to people familiar with his thinking.

Shares in AngloGold have risen by 24 per cent over the past year in Johannesburg, a rare bright spot in the sector.

Watch this space.

John Malone s complex empire is tripping up credit default swaps traders. Again.

Regular DD readers will be well versed in recent shenanigans in credit derivatives, after we took you behind the scenes of the  manufactured default  furore last year, which saw Blackstone face off against Goldman Sachs in a bitter spat over a money spinning trick many thought was tantamount to manipulation.

But this time, it s not devious schemes that are causing headaches for banks. Instead it s a consequence of collective incompetence: read Robert Smith s story about how Dutch telecoms groupVodafoneZiggo s CDS contracts might become worthless to get up to speed.

The basic problem is this: CDS traders didn t notice that the company   which is jointly owned by Vodafone and John Malone s Liberty Global   moved its bonds to a new entity in March, meaning the CDS references a now non-existent special purpose vehicle. Even worse: it might now be too late to fix it.

The thing is, the most famous example of this phenomenon happening in the past was also with Liberty Global: avery similar glitchhappened with Malone s German cable company Unitymedia back in 2012.

The uncharitable view is that CDS traders are paid vast sums of money to track the companies they buy and sell derivatives on, and they shouldn t miss a major change for the best part of the year.

The more sympathetic view is that Malone s shifting web of companies is so difficult to track that even people with vast sums of money on the line make mistakes.

 Thanks Jamie 

Spare a thought for Mike Gaito and Michele Colocci, JPMorgan Chase s co-heads of healthcare investment banking, who had to listen to their chief executive Jamie Dimon publicly hypinga competitor on Tuesday.

Asked about the bank s latest quarterly earnings by Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin, Dimon launched into an ode to some of Gaito and Colocci s rivals.

 I just want to give a shout out to Jefferies,  Dimon said. You guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare last year. 

Kind words, given that JPMorgan was top of the healthcare investment banking leagues for both US and global fees last year, while Jefferies was fourth in both league tables, according to Dealogic.

Jefferies has been on the rise though   in 2017 it was seventh in both the global and US healthcare leagues.

 Thanks Jamie,  Jefferies healthcare banker Michael Brinkman tweeted.

Apax Buys $200 Million Stake in AI Technology Company

Apax Partners has bought a significant minority stake in artificial-intelligence technology company Fractal Analytics for $200 million.

A person familiar with the deal said the transaction valued Fractal at $500 million.

The London private-equity firm injected fresh capital in Fractal Analytics, and bought stakes from investors including U.S. firm TA Associates and Khazanah Nasional Bhd., a Malaysian government investment fund, according to a statement released by Fractal Analytics.

Fractal Analytics' sales totaled $100 million in 2018, the person familiar with the matter said.

The Indian company sells products including Qure, a health-care imaging tool that is used for interpreting X-rays, and Cuddle, a system for detecting anomalies in business data. The company said Apax's investment will help fund its growth projects.

Its clients have included Google Inc. and Visa Inc., the statement said. Founded in 2000 in India and now based in New York, the company employs more than 1,200 people in 16 offices world-wide, it said.

TA acquired a minority stake in Fractal Analytics for $25 million in 2013, Private Equity News previously reported.

AI is expanding fast. About half of 2,135 managers surveyed by McKinsey & Co. for a report published in November said they already deployed an AI-based system, and nearly three-quarters said they expect AI investments to increase.

Apax made the investment from the $9 billion global buyout fund it closed in 2016, a second person familiar with the matter said.

Resurgens Technology Partners, a private-equity firm focused on lower midmarket software and technology-enabled services companies, has secured $212 million in total commitments for its first fund.

The vehicle, Resurgens Technology Partners LP, exceeded its target, according to a news release.

Late last year, the Atlanta firm had raised at least $206 million, according to a Dec. 21 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Fred Sturgis, a managing director at Resurgens, said the firm has made two platform investments and two add-on acquisitions from the fund so far.

The firm's portfolio includes Investment Metrics LLC, a provider of investment-performance analytics and reporting software for the institutional investment industry; and Assurance Software Inc., which provides business-continuity and disaster-recovery software and services.

Mr. Sturgis said he expects the new vehicle to help fund eight to 10 platform companies.

Resurgens focuses on majority recapitalizations of founder-owned businesses, specifically those with $5 million to $30 million in recurring revenue, said Mr. Sturgis.

He said John Baumstark, a managing director at the firm, formed Resurgens in 2016 along with Mr. Sturgis and Adi Filipovic, a principal.

The Property Report
Blackstone Property Fund to Set Record

By Peter Grant

Blackstone Group LP is about to finish raising the largest-ever real-estate fund, which at $20 billion will amplify the investment firm's influence over prices paid for major office towers, shopping centers and hotels around the world.

The $20 billion that Blackstone has raised from U.S. and overseas pension funds, foreign governments and wealthy individuals is more than twice as large as any fund ever raised by a competitor, according to data firm Preqin.

The fund is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 for all but some of its smaller individual investors, according to people familiar with the matter.

The record size reflects both the New York firm's history of double-digit returns and a herd effect, where pension-fund managers and other big investors tend to favor the same brand names with established track records.

Blackstone's actual buying power with the new fund is closer to $60 billion. That is because its real-estate funds typically uses $2 of debt for every dollar of equity, say people familiar with firm's strategy. That $60 billion is more than the total value of all the commercial property purchased in New York, Chicago and San Francisco in the first 11 months of 2018, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Blackstone's so-called "opportunistic" real-estate funds, which take higher risks to go after higher returns, have delivered annual average net returns of 16% putting them in the top quadrant compared with their peers over the past 27 years, according to filings by the firm.

It may be more difficult for Blackstone to repeat its past heady performance with its new fund, many property analysts say.

After a decadelong bull market, there is growing concern that property prices might fall, especially if interest rates rise. Real estate is interest-rate sensitive, partly because buyers typically use a lot of leverage.

Not all Blackstone's investments have been big hits. In 2015, for one, it purchased office buildings and other properties in Brazil, hoping to take advantage of low prices resulting from political and economic upheaval in that country. The Brazil property market has yet to rebound.

Still, Blackstone's fundraising success comes as peers struggled to raise funds. Last year, real-estate funds world-wide raised only $118 billion, the smallest amount since 2013, according to Preqin.

Even before its latest fund, Blackstone had the record for raising the four largest funds, according to Preqin. Its previous real-estate fund, at $15.8 billion, currently holds the record.

Giant firms like Blackstone and Brookfield Property Group typically have an easier time raising money than smaller firms. Investment officers working for pension funds, endowments and other institutional investors prefer firms with marquee names and long track records because they have less explaining to do if things go wrong.

Blackstone had $119.9 billion in real-estate assets under management at the end of the third quarter of 2018, more than five times the $23 billion it managed when Blackstone did its initial public offering in 2007.

Despite Mark Wiedman s promotion, observers say other executives remain in the running

Last week, Larry Fink promoted Mark Wiedman, the head of BlackRock s sprawling index investing business, to a new enlarged role that thrusts him to the top of the list of executives likely to take up the reins of the $6.4tn asset management group if its founder decides to step down.

However, Mr Fink likes to brag about BlackRock s  deep bench  of senior executives, and in his memo announcing Mr Wiedman s promotion he hinted at a broader reshuffle later this year. Insiders say that no one senior is expected to leave, but new frontrunners could still emerge as roles are rejigged.

While there are no hints of the BlackRock founder planning to step down, about a half-dozen people are broadly considered by internal and external observers to be in the running to succeed Mr Fink when he does retire: three Marks, two Robs, and one Rich.

Mark Wiedman

Until this week, Mr Wiedman was head of BlackRock s $4.1tn index investing group, which includes asset manager s crown jewel   iShares, the rapidly growing exchange-traded fund business acquired from Barclays in the wake of the financial crisis.

Mr Wiedman is a gregarious Long Island native, who joined BlackRock in 2004 after stints at McKinsey and as an adviser to the US Treasury. His first job was at an advisory group that counselled BlackRock clients such as central banks on market issues, but rose to head corporate strategy and in 2011 was put in charge of the iShares business and tasked with integrating it fully into BlackRock.

When he took over iShares, it had about $600bn in assets. Today, it manages $1.8tn, and accounted for almost a third of BlackRock s revenue in the third quarter. Mr Wiedman is now overseeing all international operations, corporate strategy and marketing.

 The future is all about creating new markets,  Mr Wiedman said in a 2012 interview with the FT.  The idea that giant insurance companies that are accustomed to buying individual bonds or derivatives are now beginning to use ETFs as core parts of their portfolios, that is totally new and we are starting to see it globally. 

Age: 48

Born: Long Island, New York

Marital Status: Married, two boys

Education: Harvard, Yale Law School

Hobbies: reading history, science fiction and spy novels; running (slowly); learning to sail

Mark McCombe

Mr McCombe, the San Francisco-based head of Americas at BlackRock, is a more recent arrival at the asset manager, having been poached from HSBC in 2011. At HSBC, he ran the British bank s asset management arm and ultimately its Hong Kong operations before jumping ship for BlackRock, and was considered a frontrunner to replace Stephen Hester as chief executive of RBS in 2013.

About 40 per cent of BlackRock s client assets are managed out of San Francisco, where Barclays Global Investors was based before Mr Fink swooped for the group in 2009. The location also allows Mr McCombe to be BlackRock s main liaison when it comes to California s big pension funds as well as the growing Asian customer base, a major priority for the investment group in the coming years.

His ties to Asia and Hong Kong especially are extensive, and in 2006 he was awarded an OBE in the Queen s New Year honours List. As a point person for BlackRock s US pension business, he has focused on retirement as a live wire subject for the coming years.

 We want to take a lead in addressing what we believe is one of the most significant and important societal issues we face today and every individual faces today,  he said at BlackRock s investor day last year.

Age: 52

Born: UK

Marital Status: Married, one girl, two boys

Education: Aberdeen University, Wharton Business School,

Hobbies: Cycling, skiing, family and travel

Mark Wiseman

Another relatively new arrival at BlackRock, Mr Wiseman was chief executive at the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board   one of the biggest and most sophisticated pension schemes in the world   before Mr Fink brought him to BlackRock in 2016 (where his wife Marcia Moffat already worked).

The hockey-loving Canadian chairs BlackRock Alternative Investors, where he is working on building up its private equity and debt investing business, a big priority in the coming years. But his main job is to run the asset manager s $366bn global active equities business.

This unit is a profitable but long under-performing corner of the investment group. Mr Wiseman is an advocate of integrating more advanced analytics, systematic investing techniques, big data and technology broadly into the traditional stockpicking process. He is trying to use BlackRock s Systematic Active Equities, its San Francisco-based quant arm, to modernise the rest of its stockpicking operations.

 If you re a traditional portfolio manager it s a challenging time because there s so much change happening around you,  Mr Wiseman told the FT last year.  If you re unwilling to evolve you re likely going to get eaten alive. 

Age: 48

Born: Niagara Falls, Canada

Marital Status: Married, two boys

Education: Queen s University, University of Toronto, Yale University,

Hobbies: Ice hockey, skiing, running

Rob Goldstein

Mr Goldstein is the youngest member of BlackRock s global executive committee, but the only one to have spent his entire professional career at the asset manager.

Mr Goldstein joined BlackRock in 1994 as a 20-year-old analyst in its portfolio analytics group, and has been instrumental in building up Aladdin, the famed analytics and risk management platform that underpins all of the group s operations and has been sold to other asset managers around the world.

Short for Asset Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment Network, Aladdin is now used by 25,000 other investment managers that manage more than $18tn. Aladdin is the centrepiece of BlackRock s technology services sales, which were a bright spot in the third quarter.

Mr Goldstein is now chief operating officer, in charge of the BlackRock Solutions unit that houses Aladdin, and oversees all technology at the investment group. Last year, he championed a new  BlackRock Lab for Artificial Intelligence  in Palo Alto, California, on the view that machine learning can enhance its operations across the board.

 AI may be in a big hype cycle but there s no doubt the technology is real and changing the world already,  Mr Goldstein said in an interview with the FT at the time.  This is about increasing the efficiency of what we do across the board. Every part of our business is already being augmented by these new capabilities. 

Age: 45

Born: Brooklyn, New York

Marital status: Married, one boy, one girl

Education: Binghamton University

Hobbies: New York Rangers and Brooklyn Nets, fishing, travelling with his family, birdwatching, the Grateful Dead

Rob Kapito

Mr Kapito is one of the co-founders of BlackRock, its president since 2007 and Larry Fink s right-hand man. The second-highest paid person at the asset manager is in charge of all day-to-day operations of its major units. Before becoming president he was in charge of all of BlackRock s portfolio management across equities, bonds and alternative investments.

As a co-founder and top executive who has worked with Mr Fink at First Boston (later Credit Suisse First Boston) as a mortgage trader in the 1980s, Mr Kapito was long considered the favourite to take over as BlackRock s chief executive if the top man had snagged the Treasury Secretary job he has long wanted.

However, as Mr Fink s departure has been put off, observers expect that Mr Kapito s age   he is just five years younger than BlackRock s chief executive and turns 62 on February 8   means that he could now lose out to one of the younger guns on the asset manager s senior management group.

The former mortgage trader has warned that many financial services companies were too complacent about the threat of disruptive technology and new entrants.  Apple was not in the music industry, Google was not in the mobile phone industry and Amazon was not in the groceries business   until they were,  Mr Kapito said at Davos last year.  Tech companies are going to enter the financial services market in a very, very aggressive way. 

Age: 61

Born: Monticello, New York

Marital status: Married, four children, three grandchildren

Education: Wharton, Harvard Business School

Hobbies: Golfing, skiing, driving restored vintage cars

Rich Kushel

Mr Kushel is not as well-known as some of the other members of  Larry s bench . But insiders say the BlackRock veteran   he joined the investment group in 1991 from Prudential Securities and has held a wide variety of jobs since then   is well-regarded internally and among the top half-dozen or so candidates to succeed Mr Fink.

After a series of senior positions, Mr Kushel took charge of BlackRock s global fixed income investing in February 2018, in addition to his job leading multi-asset strategies. BlackRock s bond group manages almost a third of its overall assets, and accounted for about $2bn of revenues in 2017, or roughly one-sixth of all that year s income.

At BlackRock s investor day in 2018, Mr Kushel argued that the typical investor approach to portfolio construction had not evolved much since the theories first put forward by Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz in the 1950s   and was thus a big opportunity for a big, broad financial supermarket like BlackRock.

 We believe that BlackRock could and should do better and set the objective to raise the bar, update current practice and apply a more modern and rigorous process to build better portfolios for our clients,  he said.  I believe that portfolio construction is one of the fastest-growing opportunities in the industry and an area where we can really differentiate BlackRock. 

Age: 52

The Take: A Debt-Market Sigh of Relief

By Chris Cumming

The monthslong exodus of investors from junk bonds abruptly reversed last week, which may help ease concerns that a bearish debt market could slow private-equity buyout activity.

Credit markets, in a swoon since October, may be rallying. Last week, the energy company Targa Resources Partners LP sold $1.5 billion of subinvestment-grade debt, the first junk-bond sale in 40 days. That had been the longest period without a junk-bond sale since 1995, a reflection of how tight credit markets have been since late 2018. Meanwhile, the market for leveraged loans rebounded in the early days of 2019, and last week junk bonds had their first week of positive flows in nearly two months. Read Cumming's Take.

Partners Group: Competition, Speedy Auctions Will Pose Challenge This Year; A more selective investing strategy saw the Swiss firm screen 1,000 fewer assets last year, even as it invested more money

More competition, higher prices and speedier auctions will make life difficult for buyout firms this year, according to David Layton, co-chief executive officer of Partners Group Holding AG.

"The level of competition we see is significant. If I look back over the last number of years, we've seen asset prices increase pretty significantly," Mr. Layton said on a conference call after the Swiss alternative investment firm reported its updated assets under management.

Meanwhile, changes in how companies present their accounts is making it harder to assess their earnings, Mr. Layton said an issue that is compounded by faster, more competitive sale processes.

"The percentage of marketed earnings that are attributable to add backs or [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization] adjustments have increased," Mr. Layton said. "Sale process timelines have also contracted meaningfully. We've seen them as short as 60 days recently," he added.

Add-backs are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cummings-take-add-backs-fill-deals-with-hot-air-1538170508?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2" such as difficult-to-predict estimates of the cost savings that would result from a merger.

Partners is taking a more selective approach to deal-making in an effort to mitigate the effects of the current investment climate. The firm has narrowed its focus to certain sectors that it believes to be resilient, such as big data, health-and-wellness and software.

The firm said it screened more than 2,800 potential direct investments last year across asset classes, more than 1,000 fewer than in 2017. From that reduced pool, the firm made 77 investments, meaning it rejected around 97% of the assets it looked at, down fractionally from 98% in 2017.

Despite increasing competition and the drop in the number of direct investments, the firm deployed a record total of nearly $20 billion across its strategies a sign of its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/partners-group-makes-a-splash-with-deal-spree-1530617401?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1". Among the notable investments Partners completed last year was the  ¬4.6 billion acquisition of German smart metering business Techem GmbH by a consortium it led.

Partners, like private-equity firms in general, has benefited from the rising tide of asset prices in recent years. Mr. Layton said the firm will have to work harder to grow the businesses it backs in the years ahead.

"In an environment like this where I think we can all expect to get less and less from the market itself, we have to be focused on building value asset by asset," he said.

The firm said growing its industry value-creation team is a key priority for this year, part of a wider hiring spree that is expected to add 300 more executives to its books in the next two years.

Partners said its assets under management rose to  ¬72.8 billion as of Dec. 31, an increase of  ¬10.9 billion year-over-year.

On the fundraising front, Partners said it expects client demand of between  ¬13 billion and  ¬16 billion, putting it on course to least match the  ¬13 billion raised last year.

Former Executives of Engie Seek  ¬300 Million for Clean Energy Fund

The three co-founders of TiLT Capital Partners have more than altruism on their mind as they pitch a debut impact fund focused on clean energy: Their share of the firm's profits is directly tied to the social and environmental impact of its investments.

The Paris firm is seeking as much as  ¬300 million ($344.3 million) to invest in U.S. and European businesses that stand to benefit from a shift toward cleaner, more environmentally-friendly energy sources, according to documents sent to investors that were reviewed by WSJ Pro. The fund will focus on areas that include energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy generation and storage, data analytics as well as electric vehicles and related technologies.

The fledgling firm was launched by Nicolas Piau, Nathanael Krivine and Nicolas Lepareur, former deal makers of French utility company Engie SA. TiLT Capital plans to take minority stakes in companies that it could hold for as long as 10 years, a somewhat unconventional strategy. Typically, private-equity firms seek controlling stakes in their assets and sell them within a five- to seven-year period.

Despite strong investor appetite for the wider private-equity asset class, first-time funds had a difficult time on the fundraising trail in Europe last year. Signs of an overheating market prompted some investors to concentrate their relationships with a smaller group of experienced managers.

Last year saw the total volume of cash raised by first-time buyout and growth funds fall for the second consecutive year, with 23 funds closing on  ¬4.4 billion in 2018, according to data provider Preqin Ltd. That is down from the  ¬4.8 billion raised by 21 funds in 2017.

TiLT Capital's founders collectively have more than 40 years of experience working in senior positions at Engie, including Mr. Piau's role as global head of mergers and acquisitions at the company. During their time at Engie, the trio helped manage 40 greenfield developments worth about  ¬5 billion and led 37 acquisitions, according to the documents.

Alongside its commitment to investing in environmentally friendly energy technology, the firm is tying its founders' compensation to whether its investments have a positive social impact. The carried interest the slice of the profits buyout executives take from successful investments will be tied to the environmental, social and governance performance of its investments as well as financial performance, according to the documents.

Impact funds, which seek both strong financial returns as well as some social or environmental benefits, have become more popular with investors in recent years. Some of the world's largest investment firms have launched impact funds or are in the midst of pitching them. Swiss private-equity firm Partners Group, for example, is seeking to raise $1 billion for a new impact fund, while TPG Capital is seeking $3.5 billion for its second TPG Rise Fund.

Blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp. on Monday said it agreed to merge with Clarivate Analytics, a subscription-based analytics provider carved out of Thomson Reuters Corp. in 2016, with private equity-backed Clarivate becoming a publicly traded company.

Churchill said Clarivate's owners will hold roughly 73.8% of the combined company upon completion of the transaction, which implies an initial enterprise value of about $4.2 billion.

Private-equity firms Onex Corp. and Baring Private Equity Asia bought Clarivate in 2016 from Thomson Reuters for $3.55 billion. Churchill said Onex, Baring and Clarivate management are retaining 100% of their equity, with Onex the majority owner.

Churchill, a special purpose acquisition company formed by former Citigroup Inc. investment-banking chief Michael Klein and former IHS Markit Ltd. Chairman and Chief Executive Jerre Stead, raised $690 million in an initial public offering in September.

Mr. Stead will serve as executive chairman of the combined company, while Clarivate's existing management team, led by Chief Executive Jay Nadler and Chief Financial Officer Richard Hanks, will continue to lead the business, Churchill said.

The company said it expects to complete the transaction in the second quarter.
