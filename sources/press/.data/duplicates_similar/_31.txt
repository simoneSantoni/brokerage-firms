Hannah Kuchler puts the latest hiring software to the test and asks if computers can really overcome bias

Would you want to be hired by artificial intelligence? As recruiters embrace such technologies to sift candidates, I took a test that is given to entry-level bank analysts. I wanted to discover whether AI would be better at selecting women than an interviewer used to hiring young, male graduates from Oxford and Harvard - or would it replicate the bias against women and minorities?

Koru, which counts Deutsche Bank and Citigroup among its clients, surveys employees to discover their strengths and weaknesses. The software asks questions for which there is no obvious answer, such as "Which sounds more like you? - 'I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I have set for myself', or 'In uncertain times, I usually expect the best' ".

The AI hiring company then asks applicants to take similar tests to see if they fit the organisation. Koru says these qualities can vary significantly between organisations, with most investment bankers in the same company having more skills in common than they would share with those in other banks.

Josh Jarrett , co-founder and chief product officer of Koru, believes AI can help employers to find candidates that have skills that go unrecognised because of the current hiring process.

"What I was excited to see is that women outperformed on several of those sub-competencies, [such as] emotional intelligence and teamwork, which is a notoriously hard thing to measure," says Mr Jarrett. Employers are more likely to interview those with a "high fit" score, so women may gain points for skills that do not come across as easily on a CV.

A new generation of AI recruitment technologies have been invented by companies from start-ups to Google. The latter says it built its machine-learning model using 17m job postings. Many sell their software as a way to bypass human bias, but they are also aware they need to keep an eye on their algorithms in case they, too, are biased.

AI is like a child imitating its parents' behaviour rather than doing what they say. It sucks in data, finds patterns and copies them. Although employers may say they want diversity, a recruitment programcould instead follow the pattern of employers' human systems.

For example, if an AI tool examines data about a company's workforce - their experience, skills and performance - it could increase the number of white men if that is the trend, rather than considering more diverse candidates. If the people behind the AI have those same biases, that could also perpetuate them.

"We know that AI is not neutral," says Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of a start-up called ReadySet , which is dev-oted to increasing diversity in technology companies. "AI is designed by people and those people have their own biases, and sometimes those biases get embedded into the tools and the platforms they use."

AI already has its first cautionary tale, she says. Some US courts started using predictive software to decide when to give prisoners parole, by calculating their risk of reoffending in a more consistent way. An investigation by ProPublica , the non-profit journalism organisation, found it was biased against African Americans, wrongly labelling them as future criminals at almost twice the rate of white defendants.

"What was supposed to be a bias mitigation tool ended up being a bias exacerbation tool. We risk seeing that happening in the hiring space as well," Ms Hutchinson says.

A Toronto start-up called Ideal uses AI to find thousands of candidates for entry-level positions. The start-up employs psychologist Ji-A Min as its head data scientist to monitor the decisions made by the software. The aim is to try to ensure that clients can comply with diversity rules, such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 's regulations.

"Telling humans to ignore their unconscious bias is virtually impossible," she says. "Because the AI is training on historical data about human decision-making, it can start to replicate human bias if you are not monitoring the system. So if there is some kind of . . . bias, we go in and correct the principles we use."

As an African-American woman from a poor background, Stephanie Lampkin, chief executive of Blendoor , says she understands the potential negative effect of using historical data. She says there can be "accountability" problems and no real "quality assurance".

Her start-up is using data and AI to check the bias of human recruiters. Individual hiring managers are told if and when they tend to favour a certain type of candidate so they can be held accountable for their choices. "They can dig deeper and show [that] you favour white men between 25 and 30 who graduated from Stanford and have this degree," she says. Blendoor can recommend steps to correct the bias, such as attending a careers fair at a women's college or sponsoring an event at a conference focused on diversity.

On completing the Koru test, I was not convinced it had uncovered hidden skills to help an employer make an unbiased decision, matching me to the qualities it values rather than the white, male faces they see in the corridor.

I scored most highly on "polish", otherwise known as communication skills, "curiosity" and "grit". I did badly on rigour - I sometimes make decisions based on gut feeling - and ownership (I apparently may be focused on my own success ahead of the team).

Luckily, my current team did not agree, so I will not have to submit to an AI recruiter any time soon.

Gambling on leverage; FT BIG READ: US ENTERTAINMENT

With Las Vegas booming again, Caesars casino group will soon emerge from bankruptcy, but only after a legal battle between private equity and creditors that became one of the nastiest corporate brawls ever. By Sujeet Indap

It was a throwaway line in an early 2009 speech from the newly inaugurated President Barack Obama. Under pressure to convey populist anger about Wall Street bailouts, he offered a glib admonition towards the banking sector: "You can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer's dime."

For America's biggest gaming empire, Harrah's Entertainment, the rebuke could not have come at a worse time. A year earlier, Harrah's had been taken over in a bold $31bn leveraged buyout by Apollo Global Management and TPG, two private equity pioneers. They paid a 31 per cent premium for the later renamed Caesars Entertainment - honouring its best-known property, Las Vegas' Caesars Palace. The high price reflected the belief that casinos had stood resilient in earlier recessions.

But by 2015, Caesars filed for bankruptcy protection , weighed down by $24bn of debt. Convention business, the lifeblood of Las Vegas, dried up as the financial sector steered clear of Nevada. Casino owners never forgot Mr Obama's dig and partially blamed their subsequent financial woes on it.

The Caesars bankruptcy has been one of the nastiest corporate brawls in recent memory. Caesars debtholders - led by Elliott Management, Appaloosa Management and Oaktree Capital - accused the private equity firms of "unimaginably brazen looting" in the years after the 2008 buyout.

The creditors, described by one member of the buyout group as the "smartest debt investors in the world", alleged that the private equity owners had methodically siphoned Caesars' crown jewel properties to other entities they owned to salvage what ever value remained for themselves. Apollo and TPG insisted that they had battled to keep Caesars alive so it could fight another day.

The allegations of impropriety gained enough legal traction that Apollo's co-founder Marc Rowan and TPG co-founder David Bonderman were ordered by a court last year to produce personal financial documents showing their ability to meet billions of dollars of potential personal judgments against them. Jim Millstein, the company's banker, said in a 2015 court hearing that the fight could degenerate into "one of the great messes of our time".

But while the Masters of the Universe were busy swapping accusations, Las Vegas quietly recovered. With a former casino owner now occupying the White House , finance and tech gatherings regularly roll into town, attracting thousands who want to eat, party, gamble, take in a show and forget the real world.

A Sin City renaissance had injected so much life into the core Caesars business - operating profit is up by half in three years - that the only reasonable choice for the warring factions was to settle the costly legal fight.

A slimmer, revitalised Caesars emerges from bankruptcy in the next week valued at perhaps $25bn, not far from its sale price in 2008.

In the end, the debtholders held all the aces, although the private equity firms will be allowed to keep a piece of the action. But, for all the wrangling and lawsuits, the fortuitous outcome is a result of the less flashy work of repairing an underlying business.

Protecting the equity

"The casino business has this mathematical beauty to it. But nobody was using it," explained Gary Loveman , who went from a Harvard Business School professor who consulted for Caesars in the 1990s to being the company's chief executive.

Mr Loveman's insights from collecting the gambling, dining and lodging habits of Caesars customers led to the creation of a loyalty programme called Total Rewards. Gamblers could rack up points by betting at Caesars' small-time casinos in Illinois or Mississippi, then use those points at glitzier resorts in Las Vegas or Atlantic City.

His analytics initiative was a smash. By 2007, Caesars, which had started out 70 years earlier as a single bingo hall in Reno, Nevada, had accumulated more than 50 properties in the US. Annual group revenue exceeded $12bn.

In 2006, the chain attracted the interest of Apollo and TPG, which were involved in the push by private equity firms to do once inconceivable leveraged buyouts of large, listed companies. At $31bn, Caesars ranks as the seventh-biggest LBO in American history.

"We thought we had the ability to use more leverage than public companies were comfortable with so the overall cost of capital was lower. In retrospect, this [arbitrage] should not be what PE is all about," says an executive at one prominent financial investor, explaining the 2004-08 LBO binge.

Led by Apollo and TPG, the equity investors would contribute $6bn of equity towards Caesars. Smaller members of the group included the industrialist James Packer , Robert Kraft , the owner of the New England Patriots, and even Steven Mnuchin, now the US Treasury secretary.

Apollo and TPG have consistently denied any charges of wrongdoing, maintaining they acted consistent with their duties. The creditor groups declined to comment for this story.

The deal's closing in 2008 was just in time for the onset of the financial crisis. The collapse of tourism and conventions contributed to annual revenue falling at Caesars by a fifth between 2007 and 2009. The company faced nearly $2bn in annual interest payments, which alone exceeded its cash generation. With Apollo effectively calling the shots, Caesars tried different tactics which led to the subsequent legal free-for-all.

"Apollo founders are famously difficult people," says one long-time executive who had worked closely with Apollo for years, referring to Leon Black , Joshua Harris , Marc Rowan and others who met at Michael Milken's Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank in the 1980s. "Their duty is to the equity and they will do anything legally they can do to defend that equity."

Between 2011 and 2014, Caesars - at the behest of Apollo - began selling off portions of its intellectual property and Las Vegas properties including Planet Hollywood, Bally's, Linq/Octavius, the Quad and the Cromwell. The buyers of all those assets: none other than entities controlled by Apollo and TPG.

For Caesars' private equity owners, the billions in proceeds kept Caesars afloat. While Mr Rowan was the most senior Apollo executive involved at Caesars, the day-to-day management was left to a young Apollo investor, David Sambur, who had joined the firm in 2004 in his mid-20s. While considered analytically brilliant, his bare-knuckle negotiating tactics wore thin on others.

"Sambur is one of the most difficult human beings I have ever dealt with," says one veteran restructuring specialist about the Apollo executive's negotiating tactics over Caesars. "He was like the cat with the cheese. He would make an offer one day and retract it the next." One creditor said that it was not uncommon for Mr Sambur to storm out of negotiating sessions, leaving the others in the room confused about the status of the talks. Apollo declined to comment.

Creditors of the primary Caesars operating company saw the parade of asset sales not as life-saving manoeuvres but as craven asset stripping: a "Good Caesars" had been created that seized the best properties on behalf of Apollo and TPG, leaving the loan and bondholders the weakest assets that could not satisfy debts.

Lawsuits amid restructuring

Lawsuits began in 2014 over the asset sales and accompanying terminations of bond guarantees made by the Caesars parent company. In early 2015, Caesars filed for Chapter 11 protection in Illinois, where it had casinos.

That meant that Caesars was fighting a creditor war on two fronts: on the one hand, it was contesting the spiralling litigation in multiple venues and, on the other, working to strike a consensual restructuring to take advantage of the recovering Las Vegas. By 2016, Caesars had rallied support with debtholders that represented $14bn of the operating company's $18bn in debt.

The key remaining adversaries: David Tepper's Appaloosa and Howard Marks' Oaktree, formidable hedge funds that had accumulated stakes in Caesars' junior "second-lien bonds" and had clashed before with Apollo at other companies.

Caesars' initial offer to this group in 2015 was a recovery of 9 cents on the dollar, each cent representing roughly $50m. In American law, the concept of "cramdown" allows a bankruptcy judge to overrule holdout creditors blocking an otherwise reasonable deal.

But Apollo's plan to isolate and cram down the junior bondholder group flopped. Richard Davis, a former Watergate counsel and federal prosecutor, had been appointed as an independent examiner to investigate the claims of fraudulent asset sales at Caesars after its LBO. Mr Davis concluded in 2016 that there was significant evidence of as much as $5bn worth of fraudulent transfers executed by Caesars' management and board. Liability for these transfers flowed up as far as board members including Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan.

While the fraud lawsuits were automatically paused because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the separate lawsuits against the parent Caesars company over bond guarantee terminations continued with more than $10bn in possible liability. Apollo had been successful in getting Benjamin Goldgar, the Illinois bankruptcy judge, to pause those trials in order to let the parties strike a restructuring deal.

By late summer, Judge Goldgar lost his patience with the private equity firms and allowed the bond guarantee trials to proceed. He noted that the offer on the table from Apollo and TPG allowed the two to contribute virtually no money of their own to the new Caesars while getting complete releases in liability from fraud and other wrongdoing claims.

"Particularly disturbing is that [neither TPG nor Apollo] is making any financial contribution to the reorganisation although the proposed plan would release all claims against them," he said.

In September, he ordered Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan to begin providing personal financial statements. The ownership group capitulated last autumn . The parent Caesars entity controlled by the equity sponsor group agreed to put $6bn into the restructured company, including handing back most of their equity ownership in Caesars to the overall creditor group.

"Maybe they could have gotten away with two or three of these asset sales," says one creditor. "But if you rob a bank nine times, on the tenth time the cops will probably show up."

The initial 9 cents on the dollar offer to the junior bond group was increased to 66 cents, comprised of cash and a stake in the new Caesars. That debt has now traded up to above 90 cents. The Caesars stock that trades publicly has almost doubled this year. Both securities demonstrate the enthusiasm for the sleeker Caesars in a revitalised Las Vegas. The sliver of equity, just under 20 per cent, which Apollo and TPG were allowed to keep is worth nearly $2bn.

TPG's Caesars headache has been replaced by another at Uber. Mr Bonderman was forced to resign from the board after an insensitive remark to fellow director, Arianna Huffington .

Times are better for Apollo, which this year raised a $25bn buyout fund, the largest in history. Its shares are the best performing among listed US private equity firms in the past two years. Several rivals are increasingly willing to replicate its hardball tactics in their own creditor negotiations.

By 2016, most of the key indicators of Las Vegas tourism, such as visitors and rooms occupied, were ahead of their pre-crisis peaks. But now, gambling accounts for less than half of casino revenue with tourists and convention goers clamouring for entertainment and high-end dining. Britney Spears first and now Jennifer Lopez have had successful residencies at Caesars properties; chefs including Gordon Ramsay, Nobu and Mr Chow have franchises.

Since the January 2015 bankruptcy filing, the company has not made any interest payments and has ploughed that cash into refreshing its properties, with virtually all of its 25,000 rooms set to be renovated by 2020.

Perhaps the biggest sign of the city's revival came from the Obama administration itself. In May, the annual hedge fund conference put on in the city by Anthony Scaramucci, the Wall Street provocateur and shortlived White House official , was full of investors giddy about the presidency of Donald Trump, the erstwhile casino tycoon. Giving a keynote speech was none other than Joe Biden, Mr Obama's vice-president.

Tech
Ford and Lyft Sign Driverless-Car Agreement; Companies to design software that lets Ford vehicles communicate with Lyft's app-based services

Ford Motor Co. and Lyft Inc. said Wednesday they would develop self-driving vehicles for the ride-hailing service, adding to a growing number of alliances between auto makers and tech companies jockeying for control of the road.

The two companies plan to design software that lets Ford vehicles communicate with Lyft's app-based services. Lyft, based in San Francisco, is playing catch-up in some respects to its larger crosstown rival, Uber Technologies Inc., which has been testing robot cars in Pittsburgh, Tempe, Ariz., and parts of California beginning a year ago.

Lyft has struck a series of partnerships with companies developing the technology, including Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., Tata Motors Ltd.'s Jaguar Land Rover and startups Drive.ai and NuTonomy Inc. And it is forming its own autonomous-car development division, which will be staffed by hundreds of engineers and technicians at a new office in Palo Alto, Calif. Lyft plans to develop its own software and hardware to enable vehicles to maneuver without a human at the wheel.

Lyft also has a partnership with Ford rival General Motors Co., which invested about $500 million in the company and added a board member. Last year, GM said it planned to work with Lyft to put self-driving taxis on the road sometime this year using technology acquired from startup Cruise Automation in a $1 billion deal.

A Lyft spokeswoman said the GM agreement wasn't exclusive.

Last month, new Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ford-ceo-hints-at-changes-in-auto-makers-self-driving-plans-1503004177" how it could deploy fully autonomous vehicles within the next four years. The Dearborn, Mich., company aims to have vehicles with no steering wheels or pedals and no need for a human driver.

And Ford plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years into Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company, in which it acquired a majority stake in February.

Lyft, meanwhile, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabet-said-to-be-in-talks-to-invest-about-1-billion-in-lyft-1505435109", people familiar with the matter have said. It points to the complicated web of relationships in ride hailing, as Google is also an investor in Uber.

Lyft was last valued at about $7.5 billion and has raised about $2.6 billion from investors.

Chubb Loss Estimates for Harvey/Irma Exceed $1.45B

Chubb is the latest insurance company to release loss estimates in the wake of recent natural disasters. The company says insured losses for Hurricane Harvey are currently estimated at about $650 million pre-tax. Losses for Hurricane Irma are expected to range from $800 million to $950 million pre-tax. The estimates are net of reinsurance, include reinstatement premiums and losses from the company's commercial, personal and casualty-insurance businesses and its reinsurance operations. (Austen.Hufford@wsj.com; @austenhufford)

Impact Investments With Liquidity Still Scarce

More millennial clients are asking about impact investing, investing with the intention of generating social and environmental impact while still generating a competitive return. But opportunities to invest, particularly in liquid investments, remain scarce, says Ernest Dawal Jr., chief investment officer, private wealth management and institutional investment solutions, at SunTrust. The area is still developing and many of the companies involved which include businesses involved with creating housing for the poor, solar wind technology, green energy technology, water technology and education are smaller, privately held companies that need capital, he says. As a result, many of the investments available now are private-capital or private-equity investments for qualified purchasers only, he says. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

Insurance Startup Offers No-Deductible Policies

Renters-insurance startup Lemonade launches policies in Texas, California and Illinois that offer no deductibles and no price increases after filing claims. Those policies will cost about $10/month more than a typical Lemonade policy, a spokeswoman says. The startup is small but closely watched within the insurance industry. In its announcement, Lemonade says that other insurers try to discourage policyholders from filing small claims, but Lemonade doesn't incur the same costs processing those claims because it uses artificial intelligence to handle some of them. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

PayPal May Be on the Hunt For Acquisitions

PayPal will likely make a strategic acquisition in the coming months, and the top candidates include US payments firms Square and Stripe and European payments startups Adyen BV and Klarna AB, analysts at Bernstein write. They say the recent merger announcement of payments processors Vantiv and Worldpay as well as a strategic investment that Visa made into Klarna this summer have made a PayPal acquisition "more urgent." Expanding PayPal's geographic footprint deeper into continental Europe will likely be a focus of any deal but would come with a price tag of more than $5 billion for Adyen or more than $2.5 billion for Klarna, the analysts write. They also say there's a low likelihood PayPal would be acquired by Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Alphabet's Google because of an "unclear deal rationale." (peter.rudegeair@wsj.com; @rudegeair)

JPM Ordered to Pay More Than $4B in Case To Be Appealed

A Dallas jury ordered J.P. Morgan Chase to pay more than $4 billion in damages for mishandling the estate of a former American Airlines executive, but it's possible the verdict will be knocked down on appeal. Jo Hopper and two stepchildren won the probate court verdict over claims that J.P. Morgan Chase mismanaged the administration of the more than $19 million estate of Max Hopper. The estate had no last will and testament. Large punitive damages verdicts are often scaled back since they can't be disproportionate to actual damages. In this case, the jury awarded less than $5 million in actual damages. J.P. Morgan Chase says it's "highly confident the verdict will not stand under Texas law," because it "far exceeds any possible interpretation of Texas tort reform statutes." It also says it acted in a "professional manner and in good faith in administering this estate." (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)

No Follow-Up Credit Line For Greece Next Year

The Greek government is highly likely to exit its bailout program next August without a follow-up credit line, says Mujtaba Rahman, European head of political-risk consulting firm Eurasia Group in a note. "The most probable post-bailout framework will be  enhanced surveillance' under the Eurozone's so-called two pack; neither an enhanced nor a precautionary European stability mechanism credit line is likely," he says. According to Eurasia, elections in Greece are not expected to take place before the bailout program is completed, as the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will use the country's successful exit as his narrative to recover in the polls and win re-election. However it adds there is a risk of "another high-profile spat" between the country's European creditors and the International Monetary Fund. (nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com)

Pick Hong Kong Banks Over Their Regional Peers

Hong Kong lenders remain the preferred banking picks in the region, says J.P. Morgan, on the back of their margin expansion, benign asset quality and growth acceleration amidst an improving economic outlook. Top picks are Hang Seng Bank and BOC Hong Kong, given that they are most sensitive to a pickup in Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates. Meanwhile, the broker is more neutral on names with more regional exposure, such as HSBC and Standard Chartered. Hitting an all-time high again on Wednesday, Hang Seng Bank is up 0.6% in late trading, while other banks are slightly lower. (john.wu@wsj.com)

Management: Directors Are Told: Don't Go 'Overboard'

Giant money managers voted against the re-election of Ronald Havner Jr. in May to the board of a real-estate company. Their reason: He runs a different company and sits on two other boards.

After about 56% of voting shares were cast against Mr. Havner remaining an AvalonBay Communities Inc. director, he said he would resign, an offer rejected by the rest of the AvalonBay board. BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp.'s money-management unit were among the large investors that voted against his re-election.

Mr. Havner, who is chief executive of Public Storage, also decided not to stand for re-election at California Resources Corp.'s 2018 annual meeting "due to concerns raised by investors relating to the time commitment required" for those roles, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Mr. Havner "has taken steps to reduce the number of boards upon which he serves," said a lawyer for Public Storage and PS Business Parks Inc., a related company.

Major institutional investors, governance advisers and boards themselves are cracking down on so-called overboarding, trying to ensure that directors don't spread themselves too thin. Overstretched directors lack time to adequately monitor management, these critics contend.

"There is no good reason for having an overboarded director," said Charles Elson, head of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. He expects institutional-investor pressure will make S&P 500 board members with at least five seats a dying breed.

Many directors who serve multiple boards contend that they adequately manage their time and can handle their board responsibilities.

A new analysis of S&P 500 chief executives for The Wall Street Journal by Equilar, a research firm, suggests that leaders with multiple outside corporate board seats and their employers make more money, but their shareholders see lower returns than those with one or zero outside directorships.

Money managers such as BlackRock and State Street, with large index-tracking fund businesses, are gaining more power over shareholder votes because they own growing stakes in so many publicly held corporations. Both voted against Mr. Havner's Avalon Bay re-election in each of the past two years.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, cast 168 votes against directors this year because of overboarding concerns. It fought the re-election of directors at companies such as Charter Communications Inc., Pfizer Inc. and PayPal Holdings, Inc., according to filings and a spokesman for the money manager.

"The directors that serve on many boards tend to be very strong directors," said Zach Oleksiuk, head of BlackRock's Americas corporate governance and responsible investment team. "The issue is not necessarily their performance, but rather the time that it takes to serve."

Being a director is lucrative, time-consuming and often comes with a high profile. Median total compensation for U.S. public board members was $191,440 last year, according to the National Association of Corporate Directors and pay consultants Pearl Meyer & Partners LLC, up about 3% from the prior year.

Board members at public companies spend an average of 245 hours a year for each position, up from 191 hours in 2005, according to surveys by the NACD.

Influential proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co. now recommend investors vote against or withhold support from directors who sit on more than five public-company boards. ISS lowered that threshold to five in February from six. Each firm also favors limits on the number of outside directorships CEOs can hold.

American corporations increasingly have imposed their own restrictions. About 77% of S&P 500 companies now curb board members' outside directorships in some fashion, up from 71% in 2010, according to Spencer Stuart, an executive-search firm. Among those with limits for all directors, 36% now impose a cap of three seats -- up from 29% in 2010.

Overall, 63 S&P 500 directors now serve on five or more public boards, as of Sept. 10, down from 83 in 2012, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of Institutional Shareholder Services.

Some directors were re-elected this year despite opposition from some large shareholders. For example, BlackRock withheld support for the re-election of Ann Mather at Shutterfly Inc. and Alphabet Inc., but she was re-elected at both companies.

Ms. Mather also serves on the board of three other West Coast public companies: Arista Networks Inc.; Netflix Inc.; and Glu Mobile Inc. She deliberately chose businesses in the same or related industries with headquarters near each other, one person familiar with the matter said.

The person said this week that the businesses are "all connected and relevant," which means Ms. Mather "can easily add value and [has] a strategic understanding of what's going on."

Another big index-fund manager, Vanguard Group, doesn't explicitly put a limit on the number of boards on which someone can serve but looks at factors such as board members' "attendance, engagement and effectiveness," a spokeswoman said.

Online content creation platform Playbuzz has raised an additional $35 million, the company announced Wednesday, bringing its total funding to $66 million.

The Series C investment round was led by Viola Growth with participation from existing Playbuzz investors including The Walt Disney Company, Saban Ventures, 83North, Carmel Ventures, Firstime and Oded Vardi. The round values the company "in the hundreds of millions", according to a person familiar with the matter, who would not be more specific.

Founded in 2012 by Shaul Olmert, the son of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Playbuzz began life as an online publishing platform allowing users to create their own lists and quizzes, typically designed to be shared across social media.

The company has since built a more robust suite of digital content creation and analytics tools designed to help professional publishers and marketers create more interactive and engaging content, such as polls, quizzes, "swipeable" slideshows, videos and more.

Those tools are typically offered free as long as they aren't used to create sponsored content, and are now being used by 13,000 publishers and brands, including Time Inc, ABC, HuffPost, BBC, MailOnline and Wall Street Journal-parent News Corp., the company said.

Playbuzz is using those publisher relationships to generate revenue through a branded content ad network, through which it has created and distributed sponsored posts for companies such as American Express, Netflix, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Ford and others. Publishers receive a share of revenue from sponsored posts they run.

According to Mr. Olmert, Playbuzz's software is attractive to publishers and editors because it gives them presentation capabilities their own content management systems may not. Editors can create content using Playbuzz tools and easily embed it on their own properties, the company says.

For marketers, Playbuzz says, its content can offer greater engagement than other online ad offerings such as banners, and has an average "interaction time" of over two minutes.

"Publishers talk about this a lot, but they're not always doing it," Mr. Olmert said, referring to publishers developing in-house tools similar to those offered by Playbuzz. "They have some toolsets, but generally speaking I think there's a big need in the market, which we're trying to address."

Mr. Olmert said the new round of investment will be used to invest in three main areas: video creation tools, machine learning systems to help publishers create content more efficiently, and ways to use the data it collects to better target content and advertising to readers.

Playbuzz said it also plans to use the new investment to broaden its global footprint. The company currently employs 150 people in 7 offices across 6 countries including in New York, London, Tel Aviv, Hamburg, Sao Paulo, Moscow and Los Angeles.

The company previously announced a $15M round of strategic funding in 2016 led by Saban Ventures with participation from The Walt Disney Company and existing investors 83North, Carmel Ventures and Firstime.

Prior to that it raised $16 million in a 2015 round led by 83North.

Ackerman's Take: Herding the CAT, With No Time-Out

Departure of PepsiCo Lawyer Is Focus of SEC Probe

Lawmakers Criticize SEC Chairman Over Handling of Hack

Equifax CEO Richard Smith to Leave After Breach

FBI, SEC Look Into Business Practices of Country's Largest  Green' Lender

Herding the CAT, With No Time-Out

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton on Tuesday "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-criticize-sec-chairman-over-handling-of-hack-1506437491", dashing Wall Street's hopes that the hack of the commission's corporate-filing system might kill it. Still, he left the door open to tweaks that might give brokers a partial victory in their efforts to scale back "https://www.wsj.com/articles/flash-crash-overhaul-is-snarled-in-red-tape-1430868811", known as the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-to-vote-on-consolidated-audit-trail-to-detect-market-manipulation-1479240411".

"I don't think a full time-out on the CAT makes sense," the SEC chief said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. "There is a lot of data that already exists, can be collected, that will further our oversight and regulatory mission."

To be fair, Mr. Clayton didn't rule out the possibility of scaling back aspects of the system, such as reducing the amount of personal information it will collect. The issue is bound to resurface when the SEC chief appears before the House Financial Services Committee next week.

The CAT would keep track of every trade and order in U.S. stock and option markets. It is designed to help the SEC "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303919504577520723010703272" as well as detect manipulation and insider trading. The database will begin receiving data from stock exchanges in November following a multiyear push by the SEC, which approved the plan last year. The system will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as Social Security numbers and dates of birth.

Critics have argued that if the detailed information reported to the database "https://www.wsj.com/articles/exchanges-cite-hacking-risk-of-secs-planned-market-data-repository-1505508831", it could be used to reconstruct the most lucrative and closely guarded trades of hedge funds and other big investors. The very existence of a central repository of all trades will be an extremely juicy target for hackers, they say.

"Let's not line all of our battleships up in a row in Pearl Harbor and make our exposure much worse," Curt Bradbury, chief operating officer and director of financial-services firm Stephens Inc., said in an emailed statement.

Though Mr. Clayton pledged to move ahead with the project, he said repeatedly Tuesday that regulators must be careful to collect only the data they need and only if they are able to protect it.

The remarks aren't what the brokerage industry had likely hoped for, but they do signal the SEC is listening to industry concerns about the system's potential vulnerabilities.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Departure of PepsiCo Lawyer Is Focus of SEC Probe

By Andrew Ackerman, Joe Palazzolo and Jennifer Maloney

Federal securities regulators are investigating an allegation by PepsiCo Inc.'s former top lawyer that the company fired her in retaliation for the way she handled an internal probe into potential wrongdoing in Russia, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents.

Maura Smith, who was PepsiCo's general counsel from May 2011 to June 2012, oversaw outside lawyers hired by the company to dig into business practices at Wimm-Bill-Dann, a big Russian maker of dairy products and juices that PepsiCo spent about $5 billion to acquire in 2011, the documents show.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at allegations that Ms. Smith was ousted because her work on the probe rankled others at PepsiCo, people familiar with the matter said. The inquiry is at an early stage and is focused on the circumstances of Ms. Smith's dismissal, the people said, and may not lead to any enforcement action.

"PepsiCo did not engage in any retaliatory conduct and any allegations to the contrary are untrue," the company said in a statement. "The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation." PepsiCo said Ms. Smith's departure was not related to "any dispute or disagreement" over the internal investigation.

PepsiCo said it looked into allegations of misconduct at the Russian company believed to have taken place before it bought the firm. "As soon as PepsiCo became aware of the conduct, it fully investigated and remediated the issues, none of which were material to PepsiCo's financial statements," PepsiCo said.

When PepsiCo announced Ms. Smith's departure in 2012, the company said she was resigning to pursue other opportunities. Her separation agreement, signed four months after her exit, entitled her to nearly $6 million in cash payments, regulatory filings show. The agreement prevents the company and Ms. Smith from disparaging one another.

Some people familiar with Ms. Smith's tenure at PepsiCo described it as stormy and marked by conflicts with other executives. They said that Ms. Smith's employment had been in question for months leading up to her exit.

Others familiar with Ms. Smith's time at the firm said she was an experienced general counsel who quickly endeared herself to PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi. But executives turned on her as the Russia investigation wore on, they said. Before joining the Purchase, N.Y., company, Ms. Smith served as general counsel for eight years at International Paper Co. and for five years at Owens Corning.

PepsiCo has assembled a team of high-profile lawyers to represent the company in the SEC investigation. The team includes Mary Jo White, who stepped down as the chairman of the SEC in January and is now a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. It also includes partners at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, known as WilmerHale.

Ms. Smith, 61, now in private practice, was subpoenaed this year by the SEC and met with government lawyers as part of an agency investigation of whether employment contracts at major U.S. firms discouraged employees from reporting wrongdoing, according to a memo prepared by WilmerHale and the people familiar with the matter.

The memo, which was dated Aug. 31, and other documents were mistakenly sent by a WilmerHale attorney to a Wall Street Journal reporter as part of communication to other attorneys working on the matter. The memo said the SEC "now appears to be focused on allegations by Ms. Smith that she was retaliated against in violation of the SEC's whistleblower rules."

PepsiCo bought a majority stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann in February 2011 and took full control in September of that year.

In August 2011, a Wimm-Bill-Dann employee used a PepsiCo tip line to report an allegation that senior managers at the Russian company concealed a $3 million shortfall in forecast quarterly financial results by shifting expenses and improperly capitalizing about 1,700 tons of skim milk, the documents show.

PepsiCo's regional staff began investigating, but the company's headquarters didn't learn of the matter for months, people familiar with the matter said. The tip raised concerns among PepsiCo's auditors about whether Wimm-Bill-Dann results before the takeover needed to be restated, internal documents show. The auditors concluded no restatement was necessary, one person familiar with the matter said.

Following the episode, PepsiCo engaged law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP to "tip over every rock" at Wimm-Bill-Dann, one of the people said. The investigation unearthed evidence of theft, improper land deals and millions of dollars in questionable consulting contracts and gratuities, including a company-owned Audi A8 sedan that was provided to a regional governor of Russia to use for free, according to internal documents. These practices had started when Wimm-Bill-Dann was an independent company, and some had continued after the PepsiCo takeover.

Gibson Dunn concluded that the car and the consulting contracts "likely constitute potential violations" of accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a law that bars U.S.-listed companies from paying bribes to foreign officials and requires firms to maintain strong internal controls. The investigation found no conclusive evidence of more serious violations of the law's antibribery provisions, according to the documents.

PepsiCo took measures to address the findings, including removing employees involved in alleged wrongdoing and updating Wimm-Bill-Dann's financial controls and business practices to conform with PepsiCo's compliance program, the documents show.

While the investigation was ongoing, Ms. Smith asked lawyers at Gibson Dunn to help her prepare a detailed memo for the PepsiCo board that would present the major findings, according to internal documents. One of those lawyers felt uncomfortable with the request, according to one of the documents mistakenly sent to the Journal that summarized a recent conversation with her. To the lawyer, it appeared that Ms. Smith wanted to "call out names of former and current employees and place blame," while protecting her own position at the company, according to the document.

Ms. Smith had prepared a memo with the help of Gibson Dunn, and a 33-page draft dated June 7, 2012, was among the documents mistakenly sent to the Journal. Among its assertions: PepsiCo executives in Europe didn't do enough due diligence after the Wimm-Bill-Dann deal, and the company's system for escalating potential problems to headquarters had malfunctioned at times.

After the Gibson Dunn attorney reached out around that time to Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's chief financial officer, about her concerns, Mr. Johnston told Ms. Smith to stop work on the memo, according to the people familiar with the matter and internal documents. It was never sent to the board, according to others familiar with the matter, and Ms. Smith's employment ended June 15, 2012.

Lawmakers Criticize SEC Chairman Over Handling of Hack

By Dave Michaels and Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON U.S. senators, already facing distress calls from constituents over the Equifax Inc. hack, criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission's new leader for how the agency handled a 2016 breach of its cornerstone system for storing market-moving information.

"I was disturbed to learn that the SEC suffered a cyberbreach of its Edgar system in 2016, but did not notify the public, or even all of its commissioners, until it was discovered during your recent review," Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said at a hearing Tuesday. "It is critical that the SEC safeguards the data it collects and maintains."

Facing his first crisis as the SEC's chairman, Jay Claytonsuggested that his agency may have mishandled how it initially responded to the breach. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) was even more critical of Mr. Clayton, saying "it raises questions about why the SEC seems to have swept this under the rug."

"This breach took place under your predecessor, but the disclosure, or lack thereof, is all yours," Mr. Brown said. "How are Main Street investors expected to have confidence that the SEC can hold big companies accountable when the SEC is not forthcoming?"

The corporate-filing system that was breached, known as Edgar, is the SEC's cornerstone system for storing and disseminating earnings announcements and other news that often moves stock prices. Edgar stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System.

The SEC has invested tens of millions of dollars in recent years to upgrade Edgar, which was introduced in the early 1990s to equalize access to information between Wall Street and Main Street.

Mr. Clayton, a former Wall Street lawyer who kept a low profile in the private sector, faced a series of tough questions over the SEC's cybersecurity, including the agency's plans for a massive database that will keep track of billions of daily trades and orders in U.S. stock and option markets. The SEC's general counsel, Robert Stebbins, sat behind him at a hearing packed with lobbyists for exchanges and securities dealers.

Mr. Clayton, a former partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, took office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. A barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for how the commission and companies will keep up with sophisticated traders and hackers in the age of Big Data.

"Companies should be providing sooner disclosure about intrusions that may affect shareholder investment decisions," Mr. Clayton said under questioning from Mr. Brown. "Across the landscape of our markets, there should be better disclosure as to the cyberrisks we face."

The SEC chairman disclosed the Edgar breach last week in a single paragraph within a five-page statement on the agency's approach to cybersecurity. Facing stern questions from Mr. Brown about the Equifax breach and whether shareholders were told soon enough after the company knew, Mr. Clayton said he decided to disclose the SEC's own breach as soon as he had enough information to accurately inform market participants and investors. He said the SEC has hired outside consultants to test the vulnerability of its systems.

"One of the worries in a situation like this is that when you make a disclosure, other people try to test and probe," Mr. Clayton said. "We are under constant attack from nefarious actors."

Mr. Clayton, who took over in May under the Trump administration, said the government needs more resources to gird against cyberattacks and must do more to defend its systems. The SEC late Monday announced the formation of a cyber unit within its enforcement division that will investigate a variety of schemes enabled by technology, including market manipulation and hackers' attempts to steal inside information.

Although the breach was reported in 2016 to the Department of Homeland Security and the security gaps were patched, for months SEC commissioners and a former chief operating officer were unaware of the hack. Mr. Clayton said Tuesday that he couldn't "say for sure" when the breach occurred in 2016. He also said he didn't believe his predecessor, Mary Jo White, knew about the incident.

"This matter involving our Edgar system concerns me deeply," Mr. Clayton said. "Rightfully, it will cause this committee and others to increase their focus on whether the commission's approach to cybersecurity appropriately addresses our cyberrisk profile."

Mr. Clayton said an ongoing enforcement probe prevents him from revealing much about the cyber break-in. He did disclose that the investigation, which he learned about in August, spurred a second look at the breach.

"Our division of enforcement had an ongoing investigation," Mr. Clayton said in response to a question from Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.). "Information they gained in connection with that investigation caused them to question whether there was a data breach of our system."

Mr. Clayton didn't reveal the type of information accessed by hackers in 2016 or what stocks were affected. He said SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker is probing the source of the hack, the type of information obtained and how the SEC responded internally to the breach.

The hackers exploited a vulnerability in a part of Edgar that allows companies to test the accuracy of data transmitted in new forms, Mr. Clayton said last week. On Tuesday, he said hackers targeted "a defect in a custom piece of software in our Edgar system."

"My understanding of this landscape is that, the more custom software, the more likely it is to be vulnerable," Mr. Clayton said.

Hackers didn't obtain any personal information belonging to investors or create "systemic risk" for the financial system, according to Mr. Clayton.

He said Tuesday that the SEC's own breach doesn't mean it should delay the launch of the Consolidated Audit Trail, the repository of orders and trades that is due to begin receiving data from exchanges in November. The system will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as Social Security numbers and dates of birth.

"I don't think full timeout on the CAT makes sense," he said. "There is a lot of data that already exists, can be collected, that will further our oversight and regulatory mission."

Equifax CEO Richard Smith to Leave After Breach

By AnnaMaria Andriotis and Emily Glazer

Equifax Inc. EFX 0.91% moved to take concrete action over its massive hack ahead of congressional hearings next week, announcing Tuesday that Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Smith would step aside while leaving the door open to compensation clawbacks.

The credit-reporting company's board looked to show Equifax and its leadership were being held accountable for the breach, according to people familiar with the matter. Equifax on Sept. 7 disclosed that the cyberattack compromised vital personal information names, addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth of potentially 143 million Americans.

The attack led to a public and political outcry. It also called into question Equifax's overall security practices and when and whether it patched a publicly identified security vulnerability. That vulnerability was later identified as being exploited by the hackers to ransack Equifax's systems.

In a statement, Mr. Smith said that he believed "it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward."

In acting before hearings, Equifax's board had in mind the experience of former Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive John Stumpf, the people familiar with the matter said. That executive appeared almost exactly a year earlier before two congressional committees to answer for his bank's sales-practices scandal.

Mr. Stumpf was grilled by legislators and repeatedly refused to say whether his position or compensation would be affected by the bank's problems. Both Mr. Stumpf and the bank were attacked during and after the hearings for what many perceived as a lack of accountability. Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired soon afterward.

The Equifax board was also mindful that there were already calls among some legislators for both Mr. Smith and directors to be taken to task, a person familiar with the matter said. Although Equifax's chief information and security officers retired a week after the hack was disclosed, those departures weren't viewed as significant enough, the person added.

Mr. Smith, CEO since 2005, is being succeeded as chairman by current director, Mark Feidler, who will serve as nonexecutive chairman, Equifax's board said. It added that Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who was most recently Equifax's president for the Asia-Pacific region, has been appointed interim CEO.

Mr. Barros was one of a handful of senior executives that Mr. Smith had been grooming as a possible successor in recent years, according to people familiar with the matter.

In a statement, Mr. Feidler said, "The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident. We are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimize the risk that something like this happens again.

"Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize." He added that the board has formed a special committee to focus on "the issues arising from the incident and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken."

This could include further action related to Mr. Smith. An agreement with the departing executive said that while he will retire as of Tuesday, "all decisions relating to the characterization" of his departure will be deferred until the board completes a review. The agreement also stated Mr. Smith won't receive an annual bonus opportunity for 2017 and that he "irrevocably" gives up any claims to such a payout.

The agreement is unusual due to its open-ended nature. That, in turn, leaves open the possibility of compensation clawbacks.

An Equifax spokesman said that certain of Mr. Smith's pay awards "are still outstanding," and the disposition of those awards will await the outcome of the investigation. He did say that no matter how Mr. Smith's departure was characterized the executive wouldn't receive $5.2 million in severance he could otherwise have been entitled to.

Mr. Smith's 2016 pay package totaled nearly $15 million, and he has made about $127 million in combined total compensation since he joined Equifax as CEO in 2005.

No matter how Mr. Smith's departure is ultimately characterized, he is likely to receive an estimated $18.4 million due him under Equifax's pension and retirement plan. The CEO also owns more than 285,000 Equifax shares, of which around 62,000 are restricted stock units that have yet to vest. Altogether these are worth more than $29 million at the stock's current market price.

In the wake of the Wells Fargo scandal, the bank's board clawed back around $69 million in equity compensation previously awarded or paid to Mr. Stumpf.

Mr. Smith's compensation is likely to be a topic of discussion at the upcoming congressional hearings. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said in a statement Tuesday, "It's not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions."

Mr. Smith is expected still to attend the hearings next week, one before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the other with the Senate Banking Committee. Ironically, Mr. Stumpf's successor, Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan, is due before the Banking Committee the same day Mr. Smith is in the House.

Aside from hearings, Equifax faces other legal issues. The company is being investigated by regulators and faces a slew of legal action, including civil suits from the Massachusetts Attorney General and the City Attorney of San Francisco. The breach itself is being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton appeared to indicate during his own congressional testimony Tuesday that his agency was investigating the sales of stock by three Equifax executives just days after the company had first spotted the breach.

Equifax is also contending with investors who have shaved about $4.5 billion, or about a quarter, from its market value since the breach was announced. Analysts said that Mr. Smith's departure wasn't surprising given the extent of the hack and that the company had set the right tone for its dealings with Washington.

"Our view has been that the political pressure for Smith's departure was going to be overwhelming so that it would be better for the company to do this in advance of the hearings next week so it could get credit for the action rather than be perceived as bowing to congressional pressure," Cowen Inc.'s Washington research group wrote in a note Tuesday.

Mr. Smith leaves Equifax 12 years after taking over as CEO. During his tenure, Equifax expanded its data offerings and grew rapidly through acquisitions. The company's market value rose to a peak of nearly $18 billion from about $4 billion when he started. The hack upended all that.

WSJ Pro Short: Warren Hints She Will Seek Equifax Executive-Pay Clawback

Top Democrats demanded that Richard Smith, who is resigning as Equifax's CEO, appear before the Senate Banking Committee as scheduled next week, and pressed for further actions from company executives. "It's not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) says, hinting she would seek the clawback of pay from executives. She demanded that Mr. Smith, along with the new chairman and the new interim CEO of Equifax, testify before the Banking Committee scheduled for Oct. 4. Ms. Warren, a leading critic of the financial industry, had led lawmakers' successful push to get Wells Fargo to claw back top executives' compensation following its phony-accounts scandal. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), the committee's top Democrat, echoed Ms. Warren's sentiment. "Equifax executives cannot be allowed to wash their hands of this while millions of Americans are left to deal with the consequences," he said. Meanwhile, California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, called for Congress to enact comprehensive overhauls of the credit-reporting industry. "There will be consequences," she said.

FBI, SEC Look Into Business Practices of Country's Largest  Green' Lender

By Kirsten Grind

Investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into business practices at Renovate America Inc., the largest provider of energy-saving home-improvement loans, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Scott McKinlay, Renovate America's chief legal officer, said in a statement that "we have been assured that Renovate America is not a target of an FBI investigation. We believe from our discussions with the FBI about its investigation of a contractor with whom we have done business that it is likely our company has come up in the context of those FBI interviews."

Renovate America is the largest lender in one of the U.S.'s fastest-growing loan programs known as Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE. Private lenders in the PACE program team up with local governments to make loans to purchase solar panels and energy-efficient appliances.

FBI agents are seeking documents that show how Renovate America marketed its financing to homeowners, trained its sales force and outside contractors, and communicated with investors, according to a document reviewed by the Journal. The FBI also is conducting interviews of people familiar with the company, according to the people who have been interviewed.

The information gathered by the FBI may be presented to a grand jury, according to the document.

The purpose of the FBI inquiry couldn't be determined.

An FBI spokeswoman said the agency "would not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation to an individual or company."

The SEC's investigation includes questions about loan payments Renovate America made for some borrowers who were struggling with their debt, according to information the company has provided to rating firms and people familiar with the matter.

A Renovate America spokeswoman said in a statement that "we have received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are fully cooperating with their information request and believe it is unlikely to have a material effect on the business."

An SEC spokesman declined to comment.

San Diego-based Renovate America was founded in 2008 and originated $1 billion in loans in 2016, the company has said.

Renovate America is backed by venture-capital firm DFJ Growth and private-equity firm Silver Lake Kraftwerk and was valued at about $500 million in a 2015 financing round. A spokeswoman for Silver Lake Kraftwerk declined to comment. A representative for DFJ Growth didn't respond to a request for comment.

Lenders in the PACE program have made about $3.7 billion in loans through June 2017, with the average loan size being $25,000. The loans, which are placed on a homeowner's tax bill alongside property taxes, have been packaged into a series of bond deals and sold to asset managers and pension funds.

The program relies on contractors such as plumbers and air-conditioning repairmen to broker loans. Homeowners typically find out about the program when their contractor mentions it to them, or they are paired with a contractor through a lender. Renovate America, for example, uses thousands of contractors to sell its financing.

The loan program has sparked controversy as homeowners have complained about lack of underwriting guidelines and misrepresentation of their loan terms, the Journal has reported. Some cities and counties have recently pulled out of the program.

Some lenders have taken steps to strengthen underwriting practices, make loan documents more transparent and boost contractor oversight, the Journal reported. Renovate America, for example, has worked with others in the industry on a national standard for lending and has ramped up training of contractors who broker the loans.

Mr. McKinlay said in a statement that, "Renovate America has instituted a number of specific business processes over the past year to give homeowners even more transparency about our financing and to tighten standards for contractors with whom we do business," noting that the company "severed ties with over 10% of our active contractor base after implementing a rigorous, data-driven contractor quality rating system earlier this year."

In Kroll Bond Rating Agency documents related to one of Renovate America's bond deals, the company disclosed in April that it had received an informal SEC request for information "relating to certain practices involving customer service payment assistance for homeowners."

The Journal has reported that Renovate America has made payments for some borrowers who have struggled to pay their loans without telling Wall Street investors who buy bonds packaged with the company's loans. Securities laws require companies to disclose all information that investors would consider to be material.

Renovate America has said it made payments for only a small number of borrowers between 2014 and 2016, and that the number wasn't big enough to be material for purposes of disclosure.

Former employees said the company engaged in lending to senior citizens who didn't understand their loan terms, the Journal has reported. The company encouraged sales staff to tell borrowers that the loans would generate tax rebates that would essentially cancel out the loans' costs, according to former employees and homeowners. Some homeowners said the savings didn't materialize.

JP McNeill, Renovate America's chief executive, has said in a statement that it doesn't "advocate targeting any protected class." A company spokeswoman has said Renovate America's percentage of elderly borrowers is less than the percentage of homeowners who are 65 and older in California, the company's largest market. Mr. McNeill also has said tax benefits are a relevant data point for homeowners.

WSJ Pro: ECB Brings Forward Stress Tests for Greek Banks

By Nektaria Stamouli

ATHENS Greek banking shares dropped sharply Tuesday on news that the lenders will undergo stress tests early next year, sooner than their European rivals.

The European Central Bank has decided to bring forward European stress tests for the biggest Greek banks, holding them months earlier than the Europe-wide review that is scheduled for fall 2018.

Investors are concerned the review could find that Greece's biggest banks will need fresh capital before the end of the country's bailout deal in August 2018.

During a European parliamentary hearing late Monday, ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank sent a letter in June to the International Monetary Fund one of Greece's creditors in its  83 billion ($98.4 billion) bailout informing it that the ECB is considering "frontloading the stress test."

Greek banks were originally slated to undergo the European stress tests along with their European rivals.

Instead, Greece's four systemic banks will start sending data to the Bank of Greece as early as February, with the results of the stress tests likely coming in May or June, according to several people familiar with the matter.

The news sent shares in Piraeus Bank SA down 11% in Tuesday trading in Athens. Alpha Bank AE was trading 10% lower, National Bank of Greece SA was down 6% and Eurobank Ergasias SA was 5.2% lower.

Shares in Greek banks have been falling since the summer, when the IMF repeated its call for a new asset-quality review of the lenders to ascertain whether their capital cushions are sufficiently robust. The IMF says that a  10 billion capital buffer should be set aside to cover the banks' future needs.

Greek and EU officials instead say the Greek banks' capital position is strong.

Bringing the tests forward is seen as a compromise. The results of the tests could unlock some of the  20 billion that has been earmarked for a previous bank recapitalization but wasn't used.

Shares in Piraeus Bank have also been hit recently by news that a probe by the Bank of Greece revealed violations of capital controls and irregularities in loan issuance between 2014 and 2016. Piraeus's shares have fallen by half in the past month. The central bank's findings have been handed over to Greece's anti-money-laundering authorities.

The bank acknowledged the probe, saying it "does not expect any substantive impact on its financial and capital situation," and that it had overhauled its senior management and corporate governance structure during the past six months.

The issue has alarmed some Greek officials, who have expressed worry that it could damage investor confidence in Greece just as the country is starting to emerge from a decadelong recession.

SEC Accuses Analyst of Trading on His Reports

By Austen Hufford

Federal authorities have accused an equity analyst of trading on penny stocks before releasing his related equity-research reports.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago said Jason Napodano, who headed a division within Zacks Investment Research, generated about $143,000 in profit from trades on nonpublic information.

Mr. Napodano, 43 years old, didn't respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Napodano, who typically covered the biotechnology sector as an analyst, bought shares in companies before releasing positive research reports and then turned a profit when share prices would increase, according to a SEC complaint filed Tuesday. The SEC said he also wrote reports containing a false disclaimer that he wasn't trading on the companies he covered.

Analysts are required to disclose when they own affected shares or intend to trade in the near future. Many covered companies pay an annual fee to Zacks in exchange for the issuance of research reports by analysts.

Mr. Napodano has reached a settlement with the SEC, agreeing to a permanent ban on trading penny stocks and to pay about $305,000, which includes paying back the improper gains and a penalty.

Two investment bankers Bilal Basrai and Bryce Stirton also named in the SEC complaint reached settlements and agreed to disgorge profit earned from trades and pay a penalty. Messrs. Basrai and Sirton of Chicago-based LBMZ Securities were accused of using nonpublic information from Mr. Napodano to make trades. Messrs. Basrai, 43 years old, and Sirton, 29 years old, didn't respond to a request seeking comment.

Separately Messrs. Napodano and Basrai are facing one count of securities fraud.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Mr. Basrai's lawyer said his client has cooperated with the investigation and intends to plead guilty.

Chinese Developers Face Debt Reckoning After Boom

By Dominique Fong

BEIJING A wave of local-currency debt coming due next year alongside new stricter lending rules are bearing down on China's developers and posing a risk to the country's economy.

The twin threats combined with a widely expected property market slowdown portend a shift in fortunes for many home developers after they rode a housing boom and strong profits in this year's first half.

The volume of maturing yuan bonds will jump 64% in 2018 for home builders to at least 230 billion yuan ($35 billion), and rise another 87% the year after that, according to data provider Wind Information Co.

Meanwhile, many yuan bondholders have the option to demand early repayment starting next year and increasingly in 2019 and 2020. The scenario could force a wave of asset sales and deprive developers of cash to build new projects, leading to a further potential deterioration in their finances, credit analysts say.

How the real estate scenario plays out has major implications for China's economy, which investors watch closely for signs of the direction of global growth. The sector contributes to nearly one-third of China's overall growth, according to Moody's Investors Service.

The trends reflect in part Beijing's efforts in the past year to restrict home sales as it feared that an overheated market fueled by a surge of mortgage lending could burst and ripple across the economy. Now, worries are growing that the market may be slowing even more in parts of China than policy makers had hoped.

"This year's very strong sales in tier three cities is unlikely to be sustained," said Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Group . "For next year, they're going to enter a down cycle."

Developers also are likely to pay more dearly for debt after home prices slowed for three straight months this summer, save a few small cities. Last year, only about 25% of developers paid 6% or higher for their yuan bonds, according to Wind. This year the ratio is more than 33%. Credit analysts expect that to climb further.

Since many loans use property as collateral, declines in value could exacerbate any chain of defaults for yuan bonds, bank loans and China's informal, lightly-regulated lending sector, potentially infecting China's financial system.

"The wall of bonds is just one symptom of the whole problem," said Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder of J Capital Research.

Large developers such as China Evergrande Group, Sunac China Holdings and Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. prospered through China's property boom in recent years. But they also racked up debt to fund land purchases while monetary policy was looser and credit was cheaper. Five large developers hold nearly half the bonds and options coming due next year, according to Moody's.

However, as the economy continues to slow the government targets about 6.5% GDP grow this year some analysts wonder how vulnerable developers are.

The recent rules aimed at cooling the market are also constraining developers' ways of raising money. That, in turn, could discourage smaller ones from investing in new projects.

Regulations include property-buying controls in big Chinese cities, such as caps on new-home sales prices and higher down-payment ratios. Other rules limit yuan bond sales on mainland exchanges and ban private asset managers from engaging in certain types of debt financing for real estate. The likely result: slower home sales and a higher risk of defaults.

Smaller developers are particularly vulnerable because of their high debt loads, experts say. For example, the net debt of state-backed Yunnan Metropolitan Real Estate Development Co. is 57 times earnings before interest and taxes, according to research firm Granite Peak Advisory. The ratio is 37 times for Fuzhou-based commercial real-estate developer Tahoe Group Co., and more than 23 times for Shanghai-based Yango Group Co.

In comparison, the leverage for all mainland-listed developers is 6.4 times, and 4 times for all Chinese companies excluding financial institutions, according to Granite Peak Advisory.

Most developers have adequate liquidity if they can't refinance debt and must repay bonds in full with cash next year, Moody's says. But their ability to do so is weakening. Rated developers' cash was 1.6 times short-term debt coverage, compared with 2 times last year, S&P Global Ratings says.

Some moves are afoot to address the concerns. Evergrande pledged to cut its net debt ratio to 70% from 270% by 2020 after reporting a ninefold jump in half-year earnings. In central Hubei province, a state-assets regulator ordered state-owned enterprises to speed up construction and sales to quickly book the revenue and lower financial leverage.

Despite the risks to China's real-estate market, global investors have continued to pile into dollar-denominated bonds of Chinese developers. Those developers issued $58 billion offshore over the year through late August, the highest volume for the period since 2014, according to Dealogic.

Other investors however are avoiding the market altogether, concerned they aren't getting paid enough for the risk.

"Coupons have to be much higher than where we are now," said Jennifer James, head of corporate research for emerging market credit at Janus Henderson Investors, which holds the offshore debt of one Chinese developer. "Headwinds are too strong to warrant this kind of return."

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

Insurer Downgrade Risks Grow With Estimated Catastrophe Losses

With early estimates from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Marie and Mexico quakes putting 2017 insured catastrophe losses at $125 billion or higher, Fitch says losses on the upper end "could weaken capital at some (re)insurers and increase the risk of rating downgrades." It now believes the losses "will constitute a capital event for a number of (re)insurance companies, as opposed to just an earnings event. However, the industry's very strong capital levels going into this year greatly limit any risks to solvency." Total statutory capital of the US property casualty industry is more than $700 billion and total global reinsurance capital is about $600 billion. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

Worst Year For Insured Catastrophes Since 2011

Based on early estimates, 2017 could be the biggest year for global catastrophe insured losses since 2011, says Barclays. In 2011, earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and floods in Thailand caused $137 billion in insured losses. Early estimates from recent hurricanes and earthquakes put 2017 catastrophe insured losses at $125 billion or higher. "It now appears all but certain that the Bermuda reinsurance industry (with Arch likely being a notable exception) will generate an operating loss in 2017 due to significant catastrophe losses." (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

Insurance Industry Headed for Historic Quarterly Loss

Insurers "could see one of the largest quarterly insured losses in history," Morgan Stanley says. Harvey caused the global insurance industry an estimated $10 billion to $25 billion loss; Irma followed with $32 billion to $52 billion; two Mexico earthquakes added $1 billion to $3 billion; and Maria could add $40 billion to $85 billion, the firm says. That adds up to $83 billion to $165 billion. The U.S. property-casualty industry is well-positioned to handle its share, with $700 billion-plus of capital, the bank notes, and global reinsurance capital stands at $300 billion-plus. "But the losses will significantly impact (re)insurers' earnings and excess capital positions." (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

Wells Fargo Still Doesn't See Broad Rate Rises On Hurricanes

On the heels of the latest estimate from AIR Worldwide on insured Caribbean damages of $40 billion to $85 billion, Wells Fargo Securities does the math on how close the reinsurance industry is to a turning point in higher rates for their clients. Its calculation: about $20 billion in estimated insured damage from Harvey, $25 billion to $55 billion from Irma, then $40 billion to $85 billion from Maria, totaling $85 billion to $160 billion. "Given our expectations that Caribbean loss falls to the low-end of the AIR range," Wells is "still not expecting a broad based turn in the catastrophe reinsurance market and instead would expect price increases to be location-specific," to hard-hit areas.

Insurers Face Exposure to Maria Through Pharma Firms

Puerto Rico's insurance market is heavy with local players. Credit Suisse estimates that more than 50% of direct premium is written by local carriers while big international insurers Chubb, AIG, QBE and CNA have relatively small market-share positions. But for those giants, "hidden exposure beyond local market shares could originate from global accounts." One risk: "business interruption" coverage related to pharmaceutical manufacturing, a major export industry for Puerto Rico. "These are complicated exposures and we would expect some losses but we are given some comfort by early press reports that seem to suggest that many of the pharma companies were prepared for an event like this through backup sources of electricity and supply chain management."

Law Professor: Equifax Breach Response  Too Little, Too Late'

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, says Equifax let consumer fury reach a point where CEO Richard Smith clearly had to go. The outcry centered around a lack of communication, both in promptly reporting the breach itself and in clearly outlining plans to protect or reimburse impacted customers, he says. "Everything they've done seems too little, too late," Tobias says. The interim chief executive and board members will have to manage the repair of public relations, the fallout of the massive data breach and deal with lawsuits and pending investigations from state and federal authorities. Shares in Equifax are down roughly 1% in afternoon trading. (cara.lombardo@wsj.com; @CaraRLombardo)

End of ATM Fees May be Double-Edged Sword for Aussie Consumers

Australian banks eliminating fees for use of their cash machines may be a double-edged sword for consumers, says Deutsche Bank. Usage of ATMs has been declining over the past few years, as other cashless forms of payment become more popular. On a 12-month rolling basis the 252 million transactions in July was 5% lower than a year earlier. "There are possibly lesser incentives for the owners of ATMs to continue to invest in and maintain their networks, given that a large proprietary network is now no longer a point of competitive advantage," Deutsche says.

Cash Shells Aim to Reinvent Initial Public Offerings

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-modern-ipo-is-useless-lets-reinvent-it-1506361770" comes from a shell company set up by Chamath Palihapitiya, a tech-to-private-equity executive, and Ian Osborne, a British political-PR man turned technology adviser.

Their new special purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blank-check-ipo-raises-600-million-search-begins-for-tech-unicorn-1505426516" in an offering meant to help tech entrepreneurs bypass the IPO process. Also known as a blank-check company, the vehicle will now take a minority position in a big private technology company. The end result is gaining a stock-market listing without all of the regulation and kerfuffle of an IPO.

The SPAC boom comes as the technology IPO market remains sluggish. So far this year, $7.6 billion has been raised for cash shells, according to Dealogic, the most since the record $12 billion raised in 2007.

How Flood-Risk Beliefs Affect Coastal Housing Markets

People's opinions on how flood risks affect coastal housing markets are varied, meaning standard approaches that assume homogeneous beliefs potentially underestimate the home-price implications of climate risks, according to a "http://bit.ly/2yrIGtd" published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. "In a world with homogeneous and rational expectations, home values should adjust smoothly to incorporate the present value of future flood risk increases due to sea level rise," researchers Laura Bakkensen and Lint Barrage write. But accounting for differing beliefs "increases the projected home price declines due to sea level rise by a factor of four," they found.

SEC Hack Raises Flags for Other Agencies

The breach of the Securities and Exchange Commission's electronic-filing system is a warning for other regulatory agencies, Gina Chon "http://reut.rs/2hwTSBD". Several other agencies, including the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, also deal with market-moving information and enforcement actions, but some haven't received sufficient funding from Congress to address security risks, she writes.

Startup Cardinal Analytx Leans on AI to Predict Health Costs; Company identifies future high-cost individuals

Lots of venture investors are taking bets on machine-learning tools that aim to improve health care. Cardinal Partners is taking things a step further.

The firm joined with Stanford researchers to launch Cardinal Analytx Inc. The startup, which just closed a $6.1 million Series A round led by Cardinal Partners, has developed an analytics platform that uses AI to predict future health-care costs.

Beyond the obvious cases, predicting who will be high-cost patients isn't always a clear-cut exercise. But doing so could potentially yield cost savings across the health-care system.

Co-founders Dr. Nigam Shah and Dr. Arnold Milstein developed algorithms to identify people who may currently be considered average-cost patients, but could quickly become some of the most expensive.

"This is finding a new population that other analytics tools missed because they were only looking at claims data, when it's too late," said Cardinal Analytx interim Chief Executive Thomas McKinley.

The company ran a study of 1.4 million Premera Blue Cross members and identified almost 70% more future high-cost patients than those noticed by existing analytics tools.

Those results led Premera Blue Cross to invest in the Series A as a strategic partner.

Over the next year, Cardinal will work to secure customers in large health insurance plans and physician networks. Additionally, the company will use the funding to hire more data scientists and engineers.

At a time of heightened debate about the future of health-care policy, new tools that can drive down costs that otherwise wouldn't be on an insurer's radar is worth trying, said Cardinal Analytx Chairman John Clarke.

"Our whole goal," he said, "regardless of which way the national health care delivery services and reimbursement models evolve, is to deliver more care for less money."

Senators Lace Into SEC Chief On Hack

WASHINGTON -- U.S. senators, already facing distress calls from constituents over the Equifax Inc. hack, criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission's new leader for how the agency handled a 2016 breach of its cornerstone system for storing market-moving information.

"I was disturbed to learn that the SEC suffered a cyberbreach of its Edgar system in 2016, but did not notify the public, or even all of its commissioners, until it was discovered during your recent review," Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said at a hearing Tuesday. "It is critical that the SEC safeguards the data it collects and maintains."

Facing his first crisis as the SEC's chairman, Jay Clayton suggested that his agency may have mishandled how it initially responded to the breach. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) was even more critical of Mr. Clayton, saying "it raises questions about why the SEC seems to have swept this under the rug."

"This breach took place under your predecessor, but the disclosure, or lack thereof, is all yours," Mr. Brown said. "How are Main Street investors expected to have confidence that the SEC can hold big companies accountable when the SEC is not forthcoming?"

The corporate-filing system that was breached, known as Edgar, is the SEC's cornerstone system for storing and disseminating earnings announcements and other news that often moves stock prices. Edgar stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System.

The SEC has invested tens of millions of dollars in recent years to upgrade Edgar, which was introduced in the early 1990s to equalize access to information between Wall Street and Main Street.

Mr. Clayton faced a series of tough questions over the SEC's cybersecurity, including the agency's plans for a massive database that will keep track of billions of daily trades and orders in U.S. stock and option markets. The SEC's general counsel, Robert Stebbins, sat behind him at a hearing packed with lobbyists for exchanges and securities dealers.

Mr. Clayton, a former partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, took office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. A barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for how the commission and companies will keep up with sophisticated traders and hackers in the age of Big Data.

"Companies should be providing sooner disclosure about intrusions that may affect shareholder investment decisions," Mr. Clayton said under questioning from Mr. Brown. "Across the landscape of our markets, there should be better disclosure as to the cyberrisks we face."

The SEC chairman disclosed the Edgar breach last week in a single paragraph within a five-page statement on the agency's approach to cybersecurity. Facing stern questions from Mr. Brown about the Equifax breach and whether shareholders were told soon enough after the company knew, Mr. Clayton said he decided to disclose the SEC's own breach as soon as he had enough information to accurately inform market participants and investors. He said the SEC has hired outside consultants to test the vulnerability of its systems.

"One of the worries in a situation like this is that when you make a disclosure, other people try to test and probe," Mr. Clayton said. "We are under constant attack from nefarious actors."

Mr. Clayton, who took over in May under the Trump administration, said the government needs more resources to gird against cyberattacks and must do more to defend its systems. The SEC late Monday announced the formation of a cyber unit within its enforcement division that will investigate a variety of schemes enabled by technology, including market manipulation and hackers' attempts to steal inside information.

Although the breach was reported in 2016 to the Department of Homeland Security and the security gaps were patched, for months SEC commissioners and a former chief operating officer were unaware of the hack. Mr. Clayton said Tuesday that he couldn't "say for sure" when the breach occurred in 2016. He also said he didn't believe his predecessor, Mary Jo White, knew about the incident.

"This matter involving our Edgar system concerns me deeply," Mr. Clayton said. "Rightfully, it will cause this committee and others to increase their focus on whether the commission's approach to cybersecurity appropriately addresses our cyberrisk profile."

Mr. Clayton said a continuing enforcement probe prevents him from revealing much about the cyber break-in. He did disclose that the investigation, which he learned about in August, spurred a second look at the breach.

"Our division of enforcement had an ongoing investigation," Mr. Clayton said in response to a question from Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.). "Information they gained in connection with that investigation caused them to question whether there was a data breach of our system."

Mr. Clayton didn't reveal the type of information accessed by hackers in 2016 or what stocks were affected. He said SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker is probing the source of the hack, the type of information obtained and how the SEC responded internally.

Equifax CEO to Step Down In Wake of Big Data  Breach

Equifax Inc. moved to take concrete action over its far-reaching hack ahead of congressional hearings next week, announcing that Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Smith would step aside while leaving the door open to clawbacks of compensation.

The credit-reporting company's board looked to show that Equifax and its leadership were being held accountable for the breach, according to people familiar with the matter. Equifax on Sept. 7 disclosed that the cyberattack compromised vital personal information -- names, addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth -- of potentially 143 million Americans.

The attack led to a public and political outcry. It also called into question Equifax's overall security practices and when and whether it patched a publicly identified security vulnerability. That vulnerability was later identified as being exploited by the hackers to ransack Equifax's systems.

In a statement, Mr. Smith said that he believed "it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward."

In acting before hearings, Equifax's board had in mind the experience of former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf, the people familiar with the matter said. That executive appeared almost exactly a year earlier before two congressional committees to answer for his bank's sales-practices scandal.

Mr. Stumpf was grilled by legislators and repeatedly refused to say whether his position or compensation would be affected by the bank's problems. Both Mr. Stumpf and the bank were attacked during and after the hearings for what many perceived as a lack of accountability. Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired soon afterward.

The Equifax board was also mindful that there were calls among some legislators for both Mr. Smith and directors to be taken to task, a person familiar with the matter said. Although Equifax's chief information and security officers retired a week after the hack was disclosed, those departures weren't viewed as significant enough, the person added.

Mr. Smith, CEO since 2005, is being succeeded as chairman by a current director, Mark Feidler, who will serve as nonexecutive chairman, Equifax's board said. It added that Paulino do Rego Barros, Jr., who was most recently Equifax's president for the Asia-Pacific region, has been appointed interim CEO.

In a statement, Mr. Feidler said, "The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident. We are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimize the risk that something like this happens again.

"Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize." He added that the board has formed a special committee to focus on "the issues arising from the incident and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken."

This could include further action related to Mr. Smith. An agreement with the departing executive said that while he would retire as of Tuesday, "all decisions relating to the characterization" of his departure will be deferred until the board completes a review. The agreement also stated Mr. Smith won't receive an annual bonus opportunity for 2017 and that he "irrevocably" gives up any claims to such a payout.

The agreement is unusual due to its open-ended nature. That, in turn, leaves open the possibility of compensation clawbacks.

An Equifax spokesman said that certain of Mr. Smith's pay awards "are still outstanding," and the disposition of those awards will await the outcome of the investigation. He did say that no matter how Mr. Smith's departure was characterized the executive wouldn't receive $5.2 million in severance he could otherwise have been entitled to.

Mr. Smith's 2016 pay package totaled nearly $15 million, and he has made about $127 million in combined total compensation since he joined Equifax as CEO in 2005.

No matter how Mr. Smith's departure is ultimately characterized, he is likely to receive an estimated $18.4 million due him under Equifax's pension and retirement plan.

Mr. Smith's compensation is likely to be a topic of discussion at the coming hearings. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D. Mass.) said in a statement Tuesday, "It's not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions."

Mr. Smith is expected to attend the hearings next week, one before the House Energy Committee, the other with the Senate Banking Committee.

Aside from hearings, Equifax faces other legal issues. The company is being investigated by regulators and faces legal action, including civil suits from the Massachusetts Attorney General and the City Attorney of San Francisco. The breach itself is being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Equifax is also contending with investors who have shaved about $4.5 billion, or about a quarter, from its market value since the breach was announced.

The group is bouncing back but only after a corporate brawl between private equity and creditors

It was a throwaway line in an early 2009 speech from the newly inaugurated President Barack Obama. Under pressure to convey populist anger about Wall Street bailouts, he offered a glib admonition towards the banking sector:  You can t go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer s dime. 

For America s biggest gaming empire, Harrah s Entertainment, the rebuke could not have come at a worse time. A year earlier, Harrah s had been taken over in a bold $31bn leveraged buyout by Apollo Global Management and TPG, two private equity pioneers. They paid a 31 per cent premium for the later renamed Caesars Entertainment   honouring its best-known property, Las Vegas  Caesars Palace. The high price reflected the belief that casinos had stood resilient in earlier recessions.

But by 2015, Caesars filed for bankruptcy protection , weighed down by $24bn of debt. Convention business, the lifeblood of Las Vegas, dried up as the financial sector steered clear of Nevada. Casino owners never forgot Mr Obama s dig and partially blamed their subsequent financial woes on it.

The Caesars bankruptcy has been one of the nastiest corporate brawls in recent memory. Caesars debtholders   led by Elliott Management, Appaloosa Management and Oaktree Capital   accused the private equity firms of  unimaginably brazen looting  in the years after the 2008 buyout.

The creditors, described by one member of the buyout group as the  smartest debt investors in the world , alleged that the private equity owners had methodically siphoned Caesars  crown jewel properties to other entities they owned to salvage what ever value remained for themselves. Apollo and TPG insisted that they had battled to keep Caesars alive so it could fight another day.

The allegations of impropriety gained enough legal traction that Apollo s co-founder Marc Rowan and TPG co-founder David Bonderman were ordered by a court last year to produce personal financial documents showing their ability to meet billions of dollars of potential personal judgments against them. Jim Millstein, the company s banker, said in a 2015 court hearing that the fight could degenerate into  one of the great messes of our time .

But while the Masters of the Universe were busy swapping accusations, Las Vegas quietly recovered. With a former casino owner now occupying the White House, finance and tech gatherings regularly roll into town, attracting thousands who want to eat, party, gamble, take in a show and forget the real world.

A Sin City renaissance had injected so much life into the core Caesars business   operating profit is up by half in three years   that the only reasonable choice for the warring factions was to settle the costly legal fight.

A slimmer, revitalised Caesars emerges from bankruptcy in the next week valued at perhaps $25bn, not far from its sale price in 2008.

In the end, the debtholders held all the aces, although the private equity firms will be allowed to keep a piece of the action. But, for all the wrangling and lawsuits, the fortuitous outcome is a result of the less flashy work of repairing an underlying business.

 The casino business has this mathematical beauty to it. But nobody was using it,  explained Gary Loveman, who went from a Harvard Business School professor who consulted for Caesars in the 1990s to being the company s chief executive.

Mr Loveman s insights from collecting the gambling, dining and lodging habits of Caesars customers led to the creation of a loyalty programme called Total Rewards. Gamblers could rack up points by betting at Caesars  small-time casinos in Illinois or Mississippi, then use those points at glitzier resorts in Las Vegas or Atlantic City.

His analytics initiative was a smash. By 2007, Caesars, which had started out 70 years earlier as a single bingo hall in Reno, Nevada, had accumulated more than 50 properties in the US. Annual group revenue exceeded $12bn.

In 2006, the chain attracted the interest of Apollo and TPG, which were involved in the push by private equity firms to do once inconceivable leveraged buyouts of large, listed companies. At $31bn, Caesars ranks as the seventh-biggest LBO in American history.

 We thought we had the ability to use more leverage than public companies were comfortable with so the overall cost of capital was lower. In retrospect, this [arbitrage] should not be what PE is all about,  says an executive at one prominent financial investor, explaining the 2004-08 LBO binge.

Led by Apollo and TPG, the equity investors would contribute $6bn of equity towards Caesars. Smaller members of the group included the industrialist James Packer, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, and even Steven Mnuchin, now the US Treasury secretary.

Apollo and TPG have consistently denied any charges of wrongdoing, maintaining they acted consistent with their duties. The creditor groups declined to comment for this story.

The deal s closing in 2008 was just in time for the onset of the financial crisis. The collapse of tourism and conventions contributed to annual revenue falling at Caesars by a fifth between 2007 and 2009. The company faced nearly $2bn in annual interest payments, which alone exceeded its cash generation. With Apollo effectively calling the shots, Caesars tried different tactics which led to the subsequent legal free-for-all.

 Apollo founders are famously difficult people,  says one long-time executive who had worked closely with Apollo for years, referring to Leon Black, Joshua Harris, Marc Rowan and others who met at Michael Milken s Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank in the 1980s.  Their duty is to the equity and they will do anything legally they can do to defend that equity. 

Between 2011 and 2014, Caesars   at the behest of Apollo   began selling off portions of its intellectual property and Las Vegas properties including Planet Hollywood, Bally s, Linq/Octavius, the Quad and the Cromwell. The buyers of all those assets: none other than entities controlled by Apollo and TPG.

For Caesars  private equity owners, the billions in proceeds kept Caesars afloat. While Mr Rowan was the most senior Apollo executive involved at Caesars, the day-to-day management was left to a young Apollo investor, David Sambur, who had joined the firm in 2004 in his mid-20s. While considered analytically brilliant, his bare-knuckle negotiating tactics wore thin on others.

 Sambur is one of the most difficult human beings I have ever dealt with,  says one veteran restructuring specialist about the Apollo executive s negotiating tactics over Caesars.  He was like the cat with the cheese. He would make an offer one day and retract it the next.  One creditor said that it was not uncommon for Mr Sambur to storm out of negotiating sessions, leaving the others in the room confused about the status of the talks.

Jeffrey Saferstein, a lawyer at Paul Weiss who represented the parent Caesars company controlled by Apollo and TPG and who is the longtime outside counsel to Apollo, responded:  I have been a restructuring and bankruptcy lawyer for 28 years and I do not believe David Sambur was more difficult in the Caesars case than anyone else nor in any other transaction I have worked on. David was completely fair and responsible. 

Creditors of the primary Caesars operating company saw the parade of asset sales not as life-saving manoeuvres but as craven asset stripping: a  Good Caesars  had been created that seized the best properties on behalf of Apollo and TPG, leaving the loan and bondholders the weakest assets that could not satisfy debts.

Lawsuits began in 2014 over the asset sales and accompanying terminations of bond guarantees made by the Caesars parent company. In early 2015, Caesars filed for Chapter 11 protection in Illinois, where it had casinos.

That meant that Caesars was fighting a creditor war on two fronts: on the one hand, it was contesting the spiralling litigation in multiple venues and, on the other, working to strike a consensual restructuring to take advantage of the recovering Las Vegas. By 2016, Caesars had rallied support with debtholders that represented $14bn of the operating company s $18bn in debt.

The key remaining adversaries: David Tepper s Appaloosa and Howard Marks  Oaktree, formidable hedge funds that had accumulated stakes in Caesars  junior  second-lien bonds  and had clashed before with Apollo at other companies.

Caesars  initial offer to this group in 2015 was a recovery of 9 cents on the dollar, each cent representing roughly $50m. In American law, the concept of  cramdown  allows a bankruptcy judge to overrule holdout creditors blocking an otherwise reasonable deal.

But Apollo s plan to isolate and cram down the junior bondholder group flopped. Richard Davis, a former Watergate counsel and federal prosecutor, had been appointed as an independent examiner to investigate the claims of fraudulent asset sales at Caesars after its LBO. Mr Davis concluded in 2016 that there was significant evidence of as much as $5bn worth of fraudulent transfers executed by Caesars  management and board. Liability for these transfers flowed up as far as board members including Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan.

While the fraud lawsuits were automatically paused because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the separate lawsuits against the parent Caesars company over bond guarantee terminations continued with more than $10bn in possible liability. Apollo had been successful in getting Benjamin Goldgar, the Illinois bankruptcy judge, to pause those trials in order to let the parties strike a restructuring deal.

By late summer, Judge Goldgar lost his patience with the private equity firms and allowed the bond guarantee trials to proceed. He noted that the offer on the table from Apollo and TPG allowed the two to contribute virtually no money of their own to the new Caesars while getting complete releases in liability from fraud and other wrongdoing claims.

 Particularly disturbing is that [neither TPG nor Apollo] is making any financial contribution to the reorganisation although the proposed plan would release all claims against them,  he said.

In September, he ordered Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan to begin providing personal financial statements. The ownership group capitulated last autumn. The parent Caesars entity controlled by the equity sponsor group agreed to put $6bn into the restructured company, including handing back most of their equity ownership in Caesars to the overall creditor group.

 Maybe they could have gotten away with two or three of these asset sales,  says one creditor.  But if you rob a bank nine times, on the tenth time the cops will probably show up. 

The initial 9 cents on the dollar offer to the junior bond group was increased to 66 cents, comprised of cash and a stake in the new Caesars. That debt has now traded up to above 90 cents. The Caesars stock that trades publicly has almost doubled this year. Both securities demonstrate the enthusiasm for the sleeker Caesars in a revitalised Las Vegas. The sliver of equity, just under 20 per cent, which Apollo and TPG were allowed to keep is worth nearly $2bn.

TPG s Caesars headache has been replaced by another at Uber. Mr Bonderman was forced to resign from the board after an insensitive remark to fellow director, Arianna Huffington.

Times are better for Apollo, which this year raised a $25bn buyout fund, the largest in history. Its shares are the best performing among listed US private equity firms in the past two years. Several rivals are increasingly willing to replicate its hardball tactics in their own creditor negotiations.

By 2016, most of the key indicators of Las Vegas tourism, such as visitors and rooms occupied, were ahead of their pre-crisis peaks. But now, gambling accounts for less than half of casino revenue with tourists and convention goers clamouring for entertainment and high-end dining. Britney Spears first and now Jennifer Lopez have had successful residencies at Caesars properties; chefs including Gordon Ramsay, Nobu and Mr Chow have franchises.

Since the January 2015 bankruptcy filing, the company has not made any interest payments and has ploughed that cash into refreshing its properties, with virtually all of its 25,000 rooms set to be renovated by 2020.

Perhaps the biggest sign of the city s revival came from the Obama administration itself. In May, the annual hedge fund conference put on in the city by Anthony Scaramucci, the Wall Street provocateur and shortlived White House official, was full of investors giddy about the presidency of Donald Trump, the erstwhile casino tycoon. Giving a keynote speech was none other than Joe Biden, Mr Obama s vice-president.

This article was amended on September 27 to include a response from Apollo.

Private equity remains  golden goose  for bankers

The bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment was billed as a fight waged between private equity and hedge funds. But investment banks and law firms took a central role as well. An investigation by an independent examiner concluded that there may have been as much as $5.1bn in fraudulent transfer claims from controversial asset sales that Caesars undertook between 2009 and 2014 before its bankruptcy filing.

Those transactions faced scrutiny because the investigation first determined that the key subsidiary holding Caesars debt was insolvent and should have had directors and advisers independent of Apollo Global and TPG, the private equity firms that owned the Caesars parent company.

The Wall Street law firm Paul Weiss, one of whose largest clients is Apollo, has faced criticism for both not warning Caesars about the risks of insolvency and then representing both sides of Caesars in related party transactions. The investigator determined that while any legal claims against the firm were weak, Paul Weiss displayed a meaningful conflict of interest. The firm denies any wrongdoing.

Three boutique investment banks   Perella Weinberg, Evercore and Centerview Partners   provided  fairness opinions  (a professional evaluation of a deal s terms by a third party) in three large, challenged asset sales. All three transactions include allegations of the banker s analysis relying on flawed or incomplete financial assumptions. Evercore, for example, did not include the positive impact of Britney Spears  new residency at Caesars  Planet Hollywood property in Las Vegas. The examiner s report showed various degrees of resistance by the banks against the private equity firms, which appeared to have tried to steer the results of the opinions. All three still issued fairness opinions and collected millions in fees. The potential legal liability in those transactions added up to $3bn. The three banks declined to comment.

In a filing, Apollo and TPG wrote:  The independence and expertise of these legal and financial advisers likewise cannot be questioned.  But private equity firms and their portfolio companies represent large fee opportunities with their serial financings and acquisitions. One hedge fund investor wondered, then, if the advice of bankers was intrinsically tainted.  Private equity firms cut a wide swath,  the investor said.  You do not want to cross them and risk the golden goose.

SEC Sees Neglect on Hack --- Chairman to testify that the agency, under predecessor, did too little after 2016 breach

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to say Tuesday that his agency may have mishandled a breach of its system for disclosing market-moving news and promise to intensify how it defends itself against hackers.

Facing his first crisis as the SEC's chairman, Jay Clayton suggested in testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday that not enough was done under his predecessor, former chairman Mary Jo White, to size up a 2016 breach that might have provided the basis for insider trading.

Ms. White, through a spokesman, declined to comment.

The SEC's handling of the hack -- which was disclosed in an unusual and lengthy evening statement last Wednesday -- is likely to generate tough questions from senators who already face distress calls from constituents over the hacker attack on Equifax Inc., from which intruders ransacked vast troves of personal information, including social security numbers.

Mr. Clayton, who took over in May under the Trump administration, is expected to say that the regulator must do more to defend against cyberattacks, according to prepared testimony. The SEC late Monday announced the formation of a cyber unit within its enforcement division that will investigate a variety of schemes enabled by technology, including market manipulation and hackers' attempts to steal inside information.

Although the breach was reported in 2016 to the Department of Homeland Security and the security gaps were patched, for months SEC commissioners and a former chief operating officer were unaware of the 2016 hack.

The corporate-filing system that was breached, known as Edgar, is the SEC's cornerstone system for storing and disseminating earnings announcements and other news that often moves stock prices.

"This matter involving our Edgar system concerns me deeply," said Mr. Clayton's prepared testimony, released Monday by the Senate Banking Committee. "Rightfully, it will cause this committee and others to increase their focus on whether the commission's approach to cybersecurity appropriately addresses our cyberrisk profile."

Mr. Clayton's testimony says an ongoing enforcement probe prevents him from revealing much about the cyber break-in. He did disclose that the investigation, which he learned about in August, spurred a second look at the breach.

Mr. Clayton first disclosed the hack last week in a five-page statement in which he spelled out his approach to cybersecurity, an issue that is fast becoming an Achilles' heel of the financial industry. In addition to Equifax, accounting firm Deloitte said on Monday that it suffered a cyberattack in which an intruder accessed data affecting a "very few" of Deloitte's clients.

Democratic senators are expected to question whether Mr. Clayton's statement last week went far enough to inform investors and other SEC watchers about the scope of the hack, leaving corporate finance chiefs to wonder whether it was their firm's confidential information that was compromised.

Mr. Clayton's planned Senate comments don't reveal the type of information accessed by hackers in 2016 or what stocks were affected. His statement says SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker is probing the source of the hack, the type of information obtained, and how the SEC responded internally to the breach.

The hackers exploited a vulnerability in a part of Edgar that allows companies to test the accuracy of data transmitted in new forms, Mr. Clayton said last week.

Hackers didn't obtain any personal information belonging to investors or create "systemic risk" for the financial system, according to Mr. Clayton's Senate testimony.

Mr. Hoecker's office is separately scheduled to issue an audit in coming weeks after digging into the SEC's history of attempts to upgrade and improve the decades-old Edgar system. The SEC has spent about $69 million since 2013 on Edgar upgrades, according to reports provided to Congress. The SEC funded the projects with a special $50 million annual technology fund that the White House has since proposed eliminating.

The SEC has for years been on notice about problems with the Edgar system. In 2014, for instance, academic researchers found that hedge funds and other rapid-fire investors got earlier access to market-moving documents from Edgar than other users of the standard, web-based system, an issue that the SEC later said it fixed. In 2015, a Bulgarian man filed a fake takeover offer for Avon Products Inc., which succeeded in sending the company's shares soaring.

The SEC's response to the 2016 hack is likely to drive questions on Tuesday about whether it can safeguard a vast database of trades that it points to as a way to probe market manipulation.

The Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, is due to begin receiving data from stock exchanges in November following a multiyear push by the SEC to finish the plan. It would keep track of every trade and order in U.S. stock and option markets and will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as social security numbers and dates of birth.

An array of market participants and industry groups have said it is likely to become a major target of hackers seeking to steal trading data and identity thieves.

Mr. Clayton entered office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. But a barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for keeping up with market participants and cybercriminals in the age of Big Data, said Andy Green, a former Senate aide and SEC lawyer.

A bipartisan group of 19 banking committee lawmakers on Monday urged Mr. Clayton to consider updating the SEC's six-year-old guidelines for how companies disclose hacks. The senators urged Mr. Clayton to consider whether new regulations are needed.

Mr. Clayton has said in previous speeches that more coordination among government agencies was essential to defend against a sophisticated array of hackers.

ProsperWorks Gets $53 Million for Google-Based CRM; Company is expanding to accommodate larger customers

ProsperWorks Inc, developer of customer relationship management software that was built around Google's G Suite Marketplace, has raised $53 million in Series C funding.

The San Francisco startup entered the CRM scene in 2013 on a mission to unseat Salesforce.com Inc. and other dominant players that still required users to manually enter data, or had other aspects that could be unwieldy and complicated.

Customers include Lyft Inc., Zendesk Inc and Google, which officially recommends the ProsperWorks platform. GV, the company's venture arm, also joined the Series C round, which was led by Norwest Venture Partners.

Designed in the Google mold and featuring direct integration with apps like Gmail, Calendar and Sheets, ProsperWorks functions like another Google product. The company counts some 25,000 customers. Chief Executive and co-founder Jon Lee said the company tripled its revenue in 2016.

To keep up with that growth, ProsperWorks has significantly expanded its workforce in the past year, going from around 90 employees in 2016 to 140 today. Mr. Lee said those numbers should keep growing, as the company hires more engineers and builds out third party integration platforms to accommodate larger enterprise clients.

"We're kind of like David, with backing from Goliath," said Mr. Jon Lee. "We started out automatically syncing with the best sources, and as we move forward, our broader vision is to use AI to recommend and assist the user and really change the notion of what this software can do for you."

ProsperWorks isn't the only startup working to siphon off some of Salesforce's massive customer base. SugarCRM Inc and Nimble Inc. also offer CRM alternatives, while others like Guru Technologies Inc. have developed platforms that offer automated assistance to users by pulling together commonly used apps including Gmail, Slack and Salesforce.

But Mr. Lee said ProsperWorks is different in that it started from a native app exchange with Google so nothing felt like an add-on. Now, with an established customer base and around $87 million in total funding to date, the company will explore third-party app integration and invest deeper in machine learning categories.

"CRM is used around the world. Google is everywhere. There are a lot of international expansion opportunities," said Norwest Senior Managing Partner Promod Haque, who led the investment and will take a board position at ProsperWorks. "They aren't limited to Google, but as the G Suite moves upstream to larger and larger customers, the market opportunity will be huge."

Clayton in Senate Hot Seat Over Breach

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-enforcement-probe-led-to-renewed-look-at-2016-hack-1506364518" for Tuesday's Senate Banking Committee hearing sheds some more light on the hack of the SEC's corporate-filing system, but it leaves many unresolved questions about the incident and the commission's response to it.

Mr. Clayton discloses in his written testimony that the commission began reviewing the 2016 breach in August due to "an ongoing enforcement investigation." The SEC hadn't previously specified that it looked into the hack because of a probe into possible illegal trading.

However, SEC officials so far haven't provided information about the filings in question, nor have they said which companies might have been affected by the breach.

It remains unclear why the SEC waited until last Wednesday evening to publicly disclose the hack which Mr. Clayton learned about in August or why the disclosure of the incident was buried in a "https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-09-20" on cybersecurity issues.

Also unanswered is why the SEC didn't inform its senior officials of the hack earlier. Mr. Clayton's two colleagues on the commission, Michael Piwowar and Kara Stein, both found out about the security breach only recently, The Wall Street Journal "https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-sec-officials-only-recently-learned-of-2016-company-database-hack-1506017614". At least one former senior staffer said he knew nothing about the hack.

To his credit, Mr. Clayton does imply that the SEC's internal system for notifying its own personnel about hacks was lacking. He is expected to tell lawmakers he has asked staff to "enhance" the commission's "escalation protocols" for future cybersecurity incidents, according to the written testimony.

Still, the SEC's response has come under much criticism. Public companies typically require their boards of directors to oversee cybersecurity issues, while the SEC appears to have diverted from this practice. The most senior levels of the SEC seem to have been informed about the Edgar hack shortly before Mr. Clayton publicly disclosed the incident, which indicates they had little or no role in handling the response to it.

Mr. Clayton's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee is his first since he was confirmed in May. He's bound to face significant pressure to share more details about the hacking episode. His initial efforts have raised almost as many questions as they have answered.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

SEC Chairman Says Agency Didn't Do Enough to Size Up 2016 Hack

In 2014, for instance, academic researchers found that hedge funds and other rapid-fire investors got earlier access to market-moving documents from Edgar than other users of the standard, web-based system, an issue that the SEC later said it fixed. In 2015, a Bulgarian man filed a fake takeover offer for Avon Products Inc., which succeeded in sending the beauty-product company's shares soaring.

The SEC's response to the 2016 hack is likely to drive questions on Tuesday about whether it can safeguard a vast database of trades that it points to as a way to probe market manipulation and volatile trading sessions like the 2010 "Flash Crash."

The Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, is due to begin receiving data from stock exchanges in November following a multiyear push by the SEC to finish the plan. It would keep track of every trade and order in U.S. stock and option markets and will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as social security numbers and dates of birth.

An array of market participants and industry groups have said it is likely to become a major target of hackers seeking to steal trading data and identity thieves.

Mr. Clayton entered office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. But a barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for keeping up with market participants and cybercriminals in the age of Big Data, said Andy Green, a former Senate aide and SEC lawyer.

"Our markets are more electronic and market participants are more dependent than ever on computerized and algorithmic trading," said Mr. Green, now managing director of economic policy at the liberal Center for American Progress. "The SEC needs to focus on getting fully up to speed on data-driven markets, and cyber has to be at the center of that."

A bipartisan group of 19 banking committee lawmakers on Monday urged Mr. Clayton to consider updating the SEC's six-year-old guidelines for how companies disclose hacks. The senators urged Mr. Clayton, who as a private lawyer helped lead Sullivan & Cromwell LLP's cybersecurity practice, to consider whether new regulations are needed.

Mr. Clayton, for his part, has said in previous speeches that more coordination among government agencies was essential to defend against a sophisticated array of hackers, including identity thieves, inside traders, terrorists and state-sponsored groups.

CFTC Wants More Firms to Self-Report Wrongdoing

By Gabriel T. Rubin

A top U.S. markets regulator unveiled a new enforcement framework that relies more heavily on firms to self-report wrongdoing and gives them new incentives to cooperate with probes.

James McDonald, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement director, announced the strategy during a speech at New York University on Monday. Though the agency already has incentives to encourage firms to cooperate with investigations, the new framework says that penalties will be reduced by a "substantial" amount in cases where the firm fully cooperates.

"No matter how much corporate leaders may want to foster compliance within the company, when they detect misconduct their decision whether to voluntarily report it often comes down to their perception of whether they'll be treated fairly," Mr. McDonald said, according to his prepared remarks.

The emphasis on rewarding cooperation was already evident toward the end of the Obama administration. In January, the CFTC adopted a set of policies for nonprosecution agreements to clarify what type of cooperation from individuals and companies the regulator could reward as part of an enforcement investigation.

"The CFTC, like the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, has long made incentivizing self-reporting by companies, and cooperation by individuals and companies, a priority," said Aitan Goelman, Mr. McDonald's predecessor as the CFTC's director of enforcement who is now a partner at the Washington law firm Zuckerman Spaeder. "I actually don't think that it's that big of a change substantively."

The CFTC's move comes as Trump regulatory appointees take a more industry-friendly approach. Mr. Trump has appointed several top regulators with Wall Street pedigrees, including J. Christopher Giancarlo, the CFTC chairman, who has said he wants to simplify existing rules and reassess whether regulators went too far in their implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

"It's always a fairly fine line between relying on self-regulated entities and on the government's own enforcement staff, but puny budgets have made that choice easier," said Bart Chilton, a former Democratic CFTC commissioner. "That's not ideal, as we have witnessed with the hundreds of violations of financial laws, but it is the rude reality of today."

Perhaps anticipating the criticism that the guidelines could be seen in line with a more industry-friendly approach, Mr. McDonald said the policy change "should not be interpreted as giving a pass to companies or individuals."

Mr. McDonald, who took over the enforcement division in April following a stint as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said cooperation agreements were an invaluable law-enforcement tool.

Using South Bronx criminal gangs as a metaphor, Mr. McDonald said that prosecutions alone "couldn't fix everything." Rather, cooperation from the broader community was necessary to self-report unlawful activity, with law enforcement serving as a "backstop." The vast majority of businesses and market participants want to obey the law, he said.

To qualify for the incentives that accompany self-reporting, the company must voluntarily report wrongdoing to the CFTC, and not be under the threat of investigation. The disclosure of wrongdoing must also be explicit and not "tucked away in the depths of some compliance report," Mr. McDonald added.

If the firm follows CFTC guidelines for self-reporting, it can expect "concrete benefits" that include substantial penalty reductions and in some circumstances, a recommendation from the agency that the case not be prosecuted.

More Company Boards Add Oversight of Political Spending

By Theo Francis

More large companies are disclosing how they spend to influence government, and company boards are taking on a more direct role in overseeing that spending, a new study finds.

Together, the changes underscore the pressure companies face to limit political involvement even after winning the legal right to spend more on elections.

Nearly 40% of S&P 500 companies have put political spending and contributions under direct review of a board committee, up from about a third in 2015, according to an annual study by the nonpartisan Center for Political Accountability and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research.

Meantime, board committees at 31% of the companies review payments to trade associations, which often serve as a conduit for campaign and other political spending, up from 24% in 2015, the study found.

The CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, in its seventh year, scores companies on how thoroughly they disclose their policies governing a variety of political spending, including state and federal campaign spending, political advertising and payments to trade associations or other entities that engage in political spending. The index doesn't include lobbying spending.

Public debate over the role of companies in U.S. elections has simmered since the Supreme Court relaxed restrictions on corporate political spending in 2010. Companies, especially publicly traded ones, continue to account for a relatively small portion of overall spending on federal elections. An analysis by the Conference Board found companies and trade associations accounted for less than 2% of the $7.5 billion spent in the 2016 election cycle; individuals accounted for two thirds of the total.

Still, during the most recent proxy season, 49 companies in the S&P 500, including Emerson Electric Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., faced shareholder proposals seeking political-spending reports from companies, Ernst & Young reported in June. On average, 26% of shares were voted in favor of the proposals.

In the end, accountability efforts like the index, along with shareholder resolutions seeking greater disclosure and the risk of consumer backlash, serve as a kind of nongovernmental check on corporate spending, said Robert Yablon, a University of Wisconsin law professor who has written on the subject and wasn't involved in the project.

"There are some private forces at work that are resulting in much less corporate money being put into elections than many would have expected," Prof. Yablon said.

In this year's index, utilities and companies in the health-care and materials sectors tended to receive the best scores, while real-estate, consumer-discretionary, industrial and technology companies fared worst. Larger companies tended to score higher.

The trend toward greater disclosure reflects a growing sense that good corporate governance requires it but it also provides companies some cover, says Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, which seeks to increase such disclosure.

"They recognize that having disclosed, and having policies, lets them better manage their political spending," Mr. Freed said. "It's much easier to say no then when you say no, it's not personal, it's policy-based."

Becton, Dickinson & Co., a maker of medical equipment and supplies, topped this year's rankings. The company sees political disclosures much like those surrounding any other activity, said Elizabeth Woody, vice president of public policy and government relations. "We're proud and confident of what we do, and we're happy to share that with others."

The number of S&P 500 companies disclosing at least some dollar figures for political spending fell slightly, to 295 from 305, in part because of turnover in the S&P 500. In addition, more companies are simply prohibiting some or all political expenditures, the group found.

About a third of companies in the index forbid at least one type of political spending, most commonly independent expenditures such as company-paid advertising supporting or criticizing candidates.

Eight companies spent no corporate assets on elections and requested trade associations and other groups not to use the company's payments to influence elections: Accenture PLC, Automatic Data Processing Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., International Business Machines Corp. , Nielsen Holdings NV, Praxair Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd.

Big Investors Want Directors to Stop Sitting On So Many Boards

By Sarah Krouse and Joann S. Lublin

Giant money managers voted against the re-election of Ronald Havner, Jr. in May to the board of a real-estate company. Their reason: He runs a different company and sits on two other boards.

After about 56% of voting shares were cast against Mr. Havner remaining an AvalonBay Communities Inc. AVB 0.44% director, he said he would resign, an offer rejected by the rest of the AvalonBay board. BlackRock Inc. BLK 0.49% and State Street Corp.'s STT -1.15% money-management unit were among the large investors that voted against his re-election.

Mr. Havner, who is chief executive of Public Storage , also decided not to stand for re-election at California Resources Corp.'s CRC 2.65% 2018 annual meeting "due to concerns raised by investors relating to the time commitment required" for those roles, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Mr. Havner "has taken steps to reduce the number of boards upon which he serves," said a lawyer for Public Storage and PS Business Parks Inc., PSB 0.70% a related company.

Major institutional investors, governance advisers and boards themselves are cracking down on so-called overboarding, trying to ensure that directors don't spread themselves too thin. Overstretched directors lack time to adequately monitor management, these critics contend.

"There is no good reason for having an overboarded director,'' said Charles Elson, head of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at University of Delaware. He expects institutional-investor pressure will make S&P 500 board members with at least five seats a dying breed.

Many directors who serve multiple boards contend that they adequately manage their time and can handle their board responsibilities.

A new analysis of S&P 500 chief executives for The Wall Street Journal by Equilar, a research firm, suggests that leaders with multiple outside corporate board seats and their employers make more money, but their shareholders see lower returns than those with one or zero outside directorships.

Money managers such as BlackRock and State Street with large index-tracking fund businesses are gaining more power over shareholder votes because they own growing stakes in so many publicly held corporations. Both voted against Mr. Havner's AvalonBay re-election in each of the last two years.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, cast 168 votes against directors this year due to overboarding concerns. It fought the reelection of directors at companies such as Charter Communications Inc., Pfizer Inc. and PayPal Holdings , Inc., according to filings and a spokesman for the money manager.

"The directors that serve on many boards tend to be very strong directors," said Zach Oleksiuk, head of BlackRock's Americas corporate governance and responsible investment team. "The issue is not necessarily their performance, but rather the time that it takes to serve."

Being a director is lucrative, time-consuming and often comes with a high profile. Median total compensation for U.S. public board members was $191,440 last year, according to the National Association of Corporate Directors and pay consultants Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, up about 3% from the prior year.

Board members at public companies spend an average of 245 hours a year for each position, up from 191 hours in 2005, according to surveys by the National Association of Corporate Directors.

Influential proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co. now recommend investors vote against or withhold support from directors who sit on more than five public-company boards. ISS lowered that threshold to five in February from six. Each firm also favors limits on the number of outside directorships chief executives can hold.

American corporations increasingly have imposed their own restrictions. About 77% of S&P 500 companies now curb board members' outside directorships in some fashion, up from 71% in 2010, according to Spencer Stuart, an executive-search firm. Among those with limits for all directors, 36% now impose a cap of three seats up from 29% in 2010.

Overall, 63 S&P 500 directors now serve on five or more public boards, as of Sept. 10, down from 83 in 2012,  according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of Institutional Shareholder Services.

Some directors were re-elected this year despite opposition from some large shareholders. For example, BlackRock withheld support for the re-election of Ann Mather at Shutterfly , Inc. and Alphabet Inc., but she was re-elected at both companies.

Ms. Mather also serves on the board of three other West Coast public companies: Arista Networks Inc. ; Netflix Inc. ; and Glu Mobile Inc. She deliberately chose businesses in the same or related industries with headquarters near each other, one person familiar with the matter said.

The person said this week that the businesses are "all connected and relevant,'' which means Ms. Mather "can easily add value and (has) a strategic understanding of what's going on.''

 Another big index-fund manager, Vanguard Group, doesn't explicitly put a limit on the number of boards on which someone can serve but looks at factors such as board members' "attendance, engagement, and effectiveness," a spokeswoman said.

 Rival State Street Global Advisors in 2016 cast votes against 69 chief executives who served on more than three boards and against 22 non-CEO directors who each sat on more than six public boards. Despite setting overboarding limits it wants firms to "do more than manage to a number," Rakhi Kumar, head of environmental, social and governance and asset stewardship at the firm said in an email.

WSJ Pro: Senate GOP Aims to Vote on CFPB Rule as Early as Tuesday

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON Republican leaders in the Senate aim to hold a vote as early as Tuesday on killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration rule, according to Senate aides.

GOP opponents of the rule, which bans financial-services firms from requiring arbitration to resolve customer disputes, hope to overturn it using a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act.

It remains unclear if the rule's opponents in the Senate have enough votes for the simple majority needed to pass the resolution in question, according to aides. Work on the measure may be delayed as the Senate continues to debate a last-ditch effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act, they said.

At issue is a CFPB rule approved in July barring fine-print requirements that consumers use arbitration to resolve disputes over financial services. The rule, fiercely fought by the financial industry, would make it easier for consumers to join class-action lawsuits against banks and credit-card companies. It is set to go into effect in March.

The Congressional Review Act allows lawmakers to overturn a newly issued regulation on an expedited schedule with a simple majority vote in Congress. The House voted 231-190 to overturn the rule in July.

To date, the Senate hasn't mustered the votes necessary to kill the rule. Democrats are likely to back the CFPB regulation, and the Republicans' slim majority means they likely can't afford to lose more than two GOP votes. Several Republican senators have expressed reservations about voting to overturn the regulation, worried they might be portrayed as siding with banks and against consumers.

The Senate Banking Committee has hearings scheduled for next week featuring executives from Wells Fargo & Co. and Equifax Inc., both under fire from Senate Democrats for contractual language restricting the use of class-action lawsuits.

WSJ Pro Short: Full Senate Poised to Consider Quarles for Top Fed Post

Top Senate lawmakers are preparing to set aside floor time to debate and then vote on the nomination of Federal Reserve nominee Randal Quarles, according to Senate aides. Mr. Quarles was tapped by the Trump administration to become the Fed's point man on financial regulation. Republican leaders are said to be laying the groundwork to approve Mr. Quarles, a former Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration, later this month, though it was unclear precisely when the nomination would come to a floor vote. The Senate Banking Committee approved his nomination this month.

Morgan Stanley to Pay $13 Million Over Supervision of Trades

By Dick Streuly

Wall Street's self-regulator ordered Morgan Stanley to pay $13 million in fines and restitution to clients for failing to properly supervise trades that increased charges and fees to customers of certain investment funds.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Monday that the investment bank provided insufficient guidance to its staff on how to detect unsuitable short-term trades of unit investment trusts, or UITs.

From January 2012 through June 2015, Morgan Stanley representatives advised thousands of customers to sell their UITs before their maturity date and roll their investment into a new trust, according to the regulator.

A representative from the bank said it is pleased to have resolved this matter and to have been recognized by Finra for its cooperation.

By selling their UIT position before the maturity date and then rolling the funds over into a new trust, clients may pay higher sale charges over time, Finra said.

UITs are a type of investment fund that offers units in a portfolio of securities. At the end of the trust's life, investors can receive cash equal to the net asset value of the units or they can roll the current value of their investments into another trust.

Finra fined Morgan Stanley $3.25 million, while the bank will have to pay about $9.78 million in restitution to more than 3,000 customers.

"Due to the long-term nature of UITs, their structure, and upfront costs, short-term trading of UITs may be improper and raises suitability concerns," said Susan Schroeder, Finra executive vice president and head of enforcement.

In settling the investigation, Morgan Stanley neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of Finra's findings.

Brexit Conundrum: What To Do With Thousands of Derivatives Contracts

By Max Colchester

The Bank of England said Monday that the U.K. and the European Union need to reach an agreement to protect the validity of trillions of dollars' worth of derivatives contracts after Brexit.

Without authorization to do business in the EU, British-based banks likely will seek to write European derivatives contracts from an EU entity. That would mean redrafting thousands of contracts, a task the central bank's Financial Policy Committee said would be unprecedented and difficult to execute.

Big banks have derivative contracts with up to 4,000 other institutions, who themselves have contracts with several entities. Hunting them all down and getting them to approve the changes could take a long time.

Rather, the Bank of England says a deal between the U.K. and the EU to protect the validity of existing contracts would be the most straightforward solution. That would be "likely to require the development and passage of legislation in both jurisdictions," the Bank of England said.

Some bankers point to Switzerland as a potential model. Switzerland isn't in the EU, but it has signed bilateral agreements with the trading bloc on issues including trade and transportation, but not financial services.

Without a solution on the existing derivatives contracts, European clients of British-based banks may find themselves unable to do things like exercising their option to buy or sell securities. The Bank of England says tens of thousands of institutions, or a about a quarter of both U.K. and EU uncleared derivative contracts, could be affected.

The U.K.'s central bank has consulted the International Swaps and Derivatives Association as it looks to better understand the problem. The association has been providing information including a look at what different rules allow in six European jurisdictions. One key question: What flexibility so local laws allow to change the terms of contracts already issued out of the U.K.

Trying to maintain the huge pool of derivatives contracts in London is a key battleground for British authorities. The business of clearing these contracts has attracted huge amounts of liquidity and expertise to London, helping underpin its position as a global financial hub.

Earlier this year the European Union's executive arm proposed plans that could force clearinghouses that do a large of chunk of business in euros to move into the EU. Moving the approximately EUR83 trillion ($98 trillion) of euro-denominated interest rate contracts out of the U.K. would force European banks to hold an extra EUR30 to EUR40 billion of collateral, according to a recent study by Boston Consulting Group.

Analysis: The Modern IPO is Useless. Let's Reinvent It

By James Mackintosh

A golden age of financial innovation is with us, so it's time to reinvent the IPO. Again.

The latest attempt comes from a $690 million shell company set up by Chamath Palihapitiya, a tech-to-private-equity executive, and Ian Osborne, a British political-PR man turned technology adviser.

The project has ambitions so grand that the pair have trademarked "IPO 2.0," and picked IPOA as the ticker symbol for what they plan to be the first of many blank-check companies, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. They hope to work their way up toward IPOZ.

The project is perfectly plausible, and might well work out. But we should be wary of what is another sign of the willingness of investors to put their trust and their money into financial experiments. As bull markets run on, financial innovation becomes more acceptable and trust more widespread.

The idea of reinventing the initial public offering last appeared as the dot-com boom was nearing its zenith. In Europe and the U.S., technology-focused IPO specialists started selling shares directly to retail customers by linking up with online brokerages. Not surprisingly, many of the companies and in Germany, the Neuer Markt on which they were usually listed vanished when the boom turned to bust.

The same is true of cash shells. So far this year, $7.6 billion has been raised, according to Dealogic, the most since the record $12 billion raised in 2007. Handing over money to strangers is easier when the market is booming and trust is high.

Yet, critics then and now of the IPO process are right. Companies planning an IPO pick underwriters among the Wall Street banks. Because the banks are on the hook to buy the shares if investors don't subscribe enough, they have an incentive to underprice the issue to reduce their potential losses.

The too-low price creates excess demand for the shares, since they are artificially cheap, so banks have to ration the supply. Rationing is typically done by giving bigger allocations to their best clients, who do well from the usual first-day pop in price that results from the underpricing.

On top of that, preparing for an IPO involves stressful months of form-filling. An IPO brings an influx of new investors unknown to the company's founders. Plus employees typically are restricted from selling shares for a six-month lockup period.

Messrs. Palihapitiya and Osborne aim to fix this process. They want tech "unicorns" worth above $1 billion to use a reverse takeover of the cash shell to gain a stock-market listing without all of the regulation and kerfuffle of an IPO.

The 25 big shareholders who hold almost all of the SCHH stock would get to know the target company first, the price would be set by negotiation between the company's board, its big shareholders and the target, and if they were right there would be no first-day pop. Lockups would be smarter, with some employees able to cash in right away, while founders and late-stage venture capitalists might still be locked in.

The system is both beautiful and silly. There are drawbacks for shareholders: They have to commit their cash upfront, with no way to know how long it will be until a target company is found. When the target is found, they have the choice to pull out and get their money back, under the rules governing blank-check companies. But if they opt out, they might not be allowed into IPOB, C or D.

They are also expected to stick with the company after the deal, so they can't rely on a quick profit from what is known as "stagging" the deal by selling out as soon as the shares leap.

Companies get a quicker listing with less administrative hassle, are likely to get a more stable stock price after the deal, and end up with a relatively small number of committed shareholders.

If it were purely a matter of matching investors willing to commit for the long term against a management eager to have long-term investors, it would be fine, if wildly overpriced (more on that later). But here the tension between investors and issuers comes back. Investors are giving up flexibility by handing over their cash now, without even knowing what company might be the SCHH target, and should expect to pay a lower price in return for such a long-term view.

Yet, a big part of the appeal from the company's point of view is that they don't have to offer the stock-price discount that the investment banks impose in a traditional IPO.

If the price comes in about the same, the promise of stock stability and less regulation might satisfy both sides although the high fees that SCHH is charging hardly seem worth it. After a deal, it gets 20% of the cash raised, paid in equity, against a typical 7% Wall Street underwriting fee, although post-listing advice from Mr. Palihapitiya's private-equity group, Social Capital, is thrown in.

There are other alternatives. WR Hambrecht & Co. offers an auction where investors bid for stock and say what they are willing to pay. The process was used by Google for its 2004 IPO, underwritten by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, but hasn't caught on.

The best option would be to fix the existing IPO. Lockup periods on shareholders could easily be smarter. Investment banks could bring a variant of the auction process into their price-setting to reduce the first-day pop. And the company coming to market could get more say over the type of investor who gets stock, reducing the banks' ability to help their clients.

The willingness of investors to back SCHH shows how fed up they are with the traditional IPO. But it also shows how ready they are to put their trust, and $690 million, in a financial experiment. It is one more sign that the bull market is growing old.

WSJ Pro Short: CFTC's Bowen Urges Rule Completion in Farewell Address

Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Sharon Bowen urges the regulator to finish several outstanding rules in a farewell address at Georgetown University. Bowen, a Democrat, will step down from the agency this week after serving since 2014. She encouraged the CFTC to finalize its governance standards for clearinghouses and trading platforms, along with improving its data collection. She also issued a final plea for more funding for the agency, which has had flat appropriations for the past three years. Bowen's departure will leave the CFTC with three commissioners two Republicans, including Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, and one Democrat.

Nonprofits, Law Schools Protest Bank of America Settlement

Bank of America's agreement to pay more than $6 million to a California couple over a mortgage dispute faces opposition from consumer advocacy groups and several law schools. In court papers, the groups said the exact terms of the deal should be made public so they can find out what steps bank officials have taken "to remediate the system failures," documented by the dispute. The proposed settlement means that the nonprofits and law schools will no longer collect the $40 million awarded to them in a March court ruling, which was nixed by the homeowner deal. The settlement would end the homeowners' eight-year-old dispute with the bank, which illegally foreclosed on them. (katy.stech@wsj.com; @katystech)

Fidelity Given Indefinite Exemption from Loan Rule

The Securities and Exchange Commission again assures Fidelity Management & Research that it won't take any action against it over a potential conflict of interest that could have forced some mutual funds to change their outside audit firms. Fidelity had run afoul of an SEC provision known as the Loan Rule, which says it's a conflict for an audit firm to serve a client that's at least 10%-owned by a bank while the auditor borrows money from the same bank. That could cause problems for some Fidelity funds and their auditors "omnibus" accounts at some brokerages can nominally give the bank a large stake in a particular fund even though the fund shares in the account are actually owned by many individual investors. SEC had given Fidelity an 18-month exemption from the rule in 2016, and now indicates it will extend the exemption indefinitely. (michael.rapoport@wsj.com; @rapoportwsj)

Hurricane Creates New Risks for Puerto Rico Investors

Hurricane Maria has created a host of risks for investors in Puerto Rico bonds, Moody's says in a report. University closures and widespread power outages at the state-run electricity company will deprive the government of revenue, leaving less money to pay bondholders. It remains unclear how much insurance money and federal-aid dollars will flow to the island and how many residents will move to the continental U.S. instead of staying and trying to rebuild. "A weaker economic outlook could support arguments in favor of lower bondholder recoveries," Moody's says. (heather.gillers@wsj.com)

Hurricane Maria Caused Estimated $40B-$85B in Insured Losses

Hurricane Maria caused an estimated $40 billion to $85 billion in insured losses, catastrophe-modeling firm AIR Worldwide says. More than 85% of the insured loss is in Puerto Rico, AIR says. The firm's preliminary damage estimate is higher than its estimates for Hurricane Harvey (more than $10 billion in insured losses) and Hurricane Irma ($32 billion to $50 billion in insured losses). The Maria estimate does not include losses to infrastructure or boats, or damage to uninsured properties. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

Florida's  Hurricane Deductibles' Apply Statewide

To the dismay of Florida homeowners where Irma's winds were strong but not hurricane fierce: "Hurricane" deductibles "apply statewide for all windstorm damage," Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation says. They typically saddle policyholders with repair costs of 1% to 5% of a house's value before insurance kicks in. Irma hit the Keys as Category 4, was Cat 3 upon re-entering the state at Marco Island, and moved on to Georgia as a tropical storm. The deductibles are governed by Florida statute: They are in effect beginning when a hurricane watch or warning is issued by the National Hurricane Center "for any part of Florida," continue as hurricane conditions "exist anywhere in Florida," and end 72 hours after termination of watches or warnings.

Small Portion of Mexico Quake Damage Is Insured

Risk modeling firm RMS estimates on a preliminary basis that the Sept. 19 Puebla Earthquake will have economic losses of $4 billion to $8 billion.

Venezuela Can't Afford More Debt-Payment Delays

When it was a few days late making a $185 million bond payment earlier this month, Venezuela's government blamed it on "operational delays." Giving the benefit of the doubt, Nomura says it's possible that there were administrative hurdles as the payment was Venezuela's first since recent financial sanctions leveled by the US. But "if this is a valid excuse, then there wouldn't be any other operational delays for the next coupon payment on September 30," Nomura says. Cash-strapped Venezuela has nearly $4 billion in bond payments due in the remainder of 2017. Nomura expects the government to make good on the payments thanks to supportive oil prices and allies like Russia being more flexible with debt-repayment terms. (kejal.vyas@wsj.com; @kejalvyas)

Chinese Bankers Criticize S&P's Ratings Cut

A group of Chinese bankers, including a top industry representative, decry S&P's sovereign downgrade last week, calling it "simple, biased and unfair." It was "as good as missing the forest for the trees," added Pan Guangwei, party secretary of the China Banking Association. The bankers, speaking at a press conference hosted by the State Council Information Office, offered their own argument for why Chinese credit is healthy: Economic growth has been better than expected this year and corporate profits margins are at 5-year highs. Meanwhile, banks' average nonperforming-loan ratio has stabilized. Pan added S&P overlooked the government's determination to deleverage and concluded that when compared to GDP, China's debt level is in line with that of Japan, Germany and the UK.

Greek Piraeus Bank Says It Received BoG Audit, Shares Drop

Greece's Piraeus Bank says it received a draft report for an audit conducted by Greece's central bank on Sept. 19. "The audit... focused on a review of the bank's procedures for the implementation of the regulatory framework, as well as risk management procedures and special credit issues," the bank's statement says. Bank of Greece's audit has been transferred to a Greek prosecutor, according to Greek officials. They concerned violations in capital controls and irregularities in loans issuance by several bank officials. The bank considers that the issues covered by the BoG audit are adequately reflected in its financial statements and does not anticipate any material financial or capital impact to arise. It also notes that over the past six months, it has proceeded to a significant overhaul of its senior management and corporate governance structures, including a thorough review and reinforcement of its internal control framework and internal processes. The bank's shares are down 5.26%. (nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com)

Federal Tech Projects Struggle to Succeed

The Trump administration has promised to modernize the federal government's operations, aiming to run it more like a Silicon Valley technology giant.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a market regulator, is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-looks-to-blockchain-to-transform-how-it-monitors-markets-1506304800". The regulator hopes to use blockchain the ledger technology that underpins the digital currency bitcoin and increasingly is being used by financial institutions and others to record and track transactions to help it better analyze immense amounts of data.

But procurement challenges make technology investments a gamble, and IT projects at government agencies have been slowed by cost overruns and faulty rollouts or canceled altogether. A study of federal IT projects between 2007 and 2016 by Standish Group International, a research firm, found that only 3% of large-scale federal IT projects were successful, which the report defines as on schedule, meeting user expectations and remaining within budget.

Still, federal spending on technology projects is slated to inch higher. The Trump administration has allocated $96 billion for federal IT projects in its 2018 budget, up from $94 billion in 2017.

How Credit Spreads Predict Crises

Credit growth is a predictor of financial crises. The transition into a crisis begins with a large change in credit spreads, according to "http://www.nber.org/papers/w23850" published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Studying more than 40 financial crises, researchers found the severity of a crisis can be forecast by the size of credit losses, or the change in spreads, and the fragility of the financial sector, as measured by precrisis credit growth. The researchers also found that spreads fall before a crisis and appear "too low," even as credit grows ahead of a crisis, largely because spreads don't price in the increase in credit growth.

Financial Markets Might Underestimate Risk

The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), the so-called fear index that measures financial markets' sensitivity to uncertainty, might be sending the wrong signals to investors about global risks, Jeffrey Frankel "https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/financial-markets-crisis-risk-by-jeffrey-frankel-2017-09". Mr. Frankel, a director at the National Bureau of Economic Research, points to potential risks in the stock and bond markets, as well as geopolitical risks, including foreign-policy missteps by President Donald Trump. "While each of those risks will probably remain low in a given month, the unusually large number of them implies a reasonably strong chance that at least one will materialize over the next few years," he says.

The European Union decided to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-says-greece-finances-are-stabilized-1506349989" over its excessive deficit, a sign of the progress the country has made in bringing order to its public finances.

ZhongAn launches insurtech concept to world

ZhongAn Online Property and Casualty Insurance begins trading in Hong Kong this week, launching into public markets a hot emerging asset: the insurance technology, or insurtech, company.

The Shanghai-based group, which made a splash in China in 2014 selling quirky insurance products, raised $1.5bn last week, valuing the group at up to $10bn. The issuer, the first of its kind to go to initial public offering, is expected to start trading on Thursday.

ZhongAn uses artificial intelligence and big data to simplify insurance, price risk more finely and distribute cheaply to a mass market via the internet. The business concept is resonating with investors, propelling a batch of start-up insurers to rapid expansion thanks to generous private-equity funding.

ZhongAn s peers are not exactly household names but private equity players definitely know who they are. Start-ups such as Lemonade Insurance in the US and Gryphon in the UK have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from this market. US-based Oscar Health last year raised $400m from private investors, valuing it at $2.7bn.

The funding has set up some of the groups for the obvious next step   a chunky IPO at a rich valuation, from which private equity money can profitably exit.

ZhongAn is backed by some of China s largest online financial services groups and its public debut has attracted prominent cornerstone investors such as Japan s SoftBank.

ZhongAn s business model chimes with investors: it sells high volumes of online-only insurance products by partnering with a number of China s biggest internet groups.

The company has sold 5.8bn policies to 460m customers over a three-year period, an almost unfathomable sales record for a traditional insurance group. It said that on a single day in November it sold 100m shipping return policies during an online shopping holiday.

The company s biggest sellers are connected to industries that have had the most growth in China in recent years, such as travel and health, says Linda Sun-Mattison, an analyst at Bernstein.

 There has been growth in travel insurance. There is demand for flight delay insurance because a lot of flights are delayed,  she says.  There has also been a lot of growth in health   their health insurance is much cheaper than competitors . It is in very high demand. 

ZhongAn has excellent backers: Ant Financial, Tencent and Ping An Insurance. Ant, an affiliate of Alibaba, operates China s largest retail payments platform, and Tencent runs the country s top mobile messaging service. Ping An is one of China s largest insurers.

The internet companies give ZhongAn access to hundreds of millions of consumers.

For example, its top-selling product, a shipping return policy, is sold directly on Alibaba s shopping platform Taobao and allows shoppers to insure the cost of returning products to vendors. Ctrip, China s largest online travel group, has helped ZhongAn market  flight delay  insurance, which allows customers to insure against late flights. Customers can buy  cracked screen  insurance when they buy a phone from the website of Xiaomi, a Chinese phonemaker.

 It has advantaged access to customers where other insurtech doesn t,  says Richard Hatherall, a partner at Bain & Co in Hong Kong.  It actually has many of the characteristics of big tech. 

The company uses artificial intelligence and big data to assess the risk of the short-maturity products. Flight-delay insurance can price in weather factors in real time for policies sold just hours before departure time.

ZhongAn straddles the lines of tech start-up and large insurer, and that is a hard act for its peers to follow.

Lemonade, for example, has broken ground with its use of artificial intelligence in the insurance industry, Mr Hatherall says. Yet it does not yet know how to reach large numbers of customers.

The same applies to many other insurtech groups: Oscar Health has simplified how customers access health insurance; Clover Health uses data analytics to get senior citizens better healthcare services; Ladder Life has streamlined signing up for life insurance.

Many of these companies may eventually be pushed to partner with traditional insurance groups to access new customers.

ZhongAn s business model has its drawbacks too. The company expects to post a loss in 2017. In the first three months of the year, it posted a net loss of Rmb202m, according to its prospectus.

Ms Sun-Mattison says ZhongAn s costs are inflated by payments to partners   its cost ratio is almost double that at some other insurers. That depresses profits. And, she points out, ZhongAn relies on those partners to generate top-line growth.

 The question is who needs who more,  she says.

As Hartford Mulls Bankruptcy, Bond Insurer Offers to Help Postpone Payments; Assured Guaranty says Connecticut's capital could delay payment on as much as $300 million in debt

Hartford's biggest bond insurer said it had offered to help the city postpone payments on as much as $300 million in outstanding debt, in a move designed to help prevent a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hartford-warns-it-will-file-for-bankruptcy-unless-state-provides-a-bailout-1504800558".

The insurer, Assured Guaranty Ltd., made the announcement before a Monday conference call between Hartford and its bondholders.

During the call Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said postponement of the city's debt would be inadequate without other fixes such as more revenue from the state, according to a statement released by the city after the call.

"I appreciate Assured's willingness to have constructive discussions," the mayor said, according to the statement, but "this administration is not interested in pushing off this challenge for another mayor or another generation to fix."

Under Assured Guaranty's proposal, debt payments due in the next 15 years would instead be spread out over the next 30 years without bankruptcy or default. The city would issue new longer-dated bonds and use the proceeds to make the near-term debt payments.

Assured Guaranty and another insurer, Build America Mutual, would insure the new bonds, said an Assured Guaranty spokesman.

Assured Guaranty backs 57% of Hartford's roughly $550 million in outstanding general obligation debt and would be on the hook for any shortfall in payments should the city enter bankruptcy. Build America Mutual backs $103 million in Hartford debt. About $163 million in Hartford bonds are held by U.S. mutual funds.

Hartford is in the middle of a fiscal emergency because of a weak tax base and a budget deficit of nearly $50 million. It also has one of the lowest credit ratings in the nation. Making matters worse, Connecticut lawmakers have been unable to reach agreement on a state budget "https://www.wsj.com/articles/connecticut-municipalities-press-state-lawmakers-on-budget-plan-1504121103", leaving Hartford short of state funding.

City officials have warned that the city would likely file for bankruptcy this fall unless the state provides more help. Mayor Luke Bronin has said the city cannot afford to make its bond payments on time and will need to restructure its debt even if Hartford does receive state assistance.

The offer from Assured Guaranty would provide Hartford with short-term budgetary relief but wouldn't reduce the city's total liabilities. In fact, it would add to them because delaying when the debt comes due would increase interest costs.

The city's debt payments are scheduled to jump from $6.6 million to $56 million in the next four years, according to city financial disclosures. Assured Guaranty's plan would lower those payments by pushing some of the debt out as far as 2047.

It is common for states to issue bonds as a way of refunding old debt, both to take advantage of low interest rates and to put off debt payments. But Hartford, which is rated deep in junk status and has hired restructuring advisers, would likely be unable to complete such a deal without insurance.

"Once you hire restructuring advisers, investors steer clear," said Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics, a municipal bond research firm.

Of cities rated by Moody's Investors Service, only Stockton, Calif., which emerged from bankruptcy protection two years ago, and Atlantic City, N.J., which narrowly avoided it, have lower ratings than Hartford.

Assured Guaranty's proposal takes advantage of state legislation passed in July that for the next five years allows cities to refinance debt with 30-year bonds instead of restricting them to 20-year bonds.

Hartford could receive more than $40 million in aid under one version of Connecticut's fiscal 2018 budget, which state lawmakers are still debating. But that alone wouldn't be enough to keep Hartford out of bankruptcy, the city said in a notice about Monday's conference call.

Assured Guaranty's proposal wouldn't help Hartford solve all its problems. A continued delay in the budget could strain the city's ability to make payment on a $20 million short-term loan due on Oct. 31.

The insurer's proposal could be "a part of the solution," said the Assured Guaranty spokesman. "It's not the solution in itself."

Hack Upends Equifax's CEO

Equifax Inc. Chief Executive Richard Smith told a breakfast meeting in mid-August that data fraud is a "huge opportunity" for the credit-reporting company, allowing it to sell consumers more offerings.

Mr. Smith, who goes by Rick, said young people should sign up for the company's credit-monitoring offerings, according to a video recording of the meeting at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. Mr. Smith was responding to an audience question and said protecting consumer data was "a huge priority" for the company.

What the audience didn't know, and Mr. Smith didn't mention: Less than three weeks earlier, Equifax had discovered a systems breach and called in Mandiant, the cyber-investigations division of FireEye Inc., to investigate. That inquiry uncovered a massive attack that exposed vital personal information of potentially 143 million Americans, something Equifax didn't announce until Sept. 7.

Mr. Smith's remarks add to questions from consumers, regulators and politicians about what Equifax knew, when it knew and whether it took sufficient steps to safeguard its data. They also underscore how focused Mr. Smith has been on getting and selling more data.

Mr. Smith and Equifax declined to comment.

Until the hack was announced, the drive for data had helped both Mr. Smith and Equifax prosper. After taking the helm of the company 12 years ago this week, Mr. Smith transformed Equifax from what he once described as a staid, slow-growing credit-reporting company into a data giant.

He bought companies with databases that contained information about consumers' employment histories, salaries and savings while also expanding internationally to places such as Australia and India.

The result: by 2016, credit-reporting activities accounted for less than a third of revenues versus about 80% a decade earlier.Equifax's market value soared to nearly $18 billion, more than quadruple its value when Mr. Smith started.

Mr. Smith also has done well financially: Over his time as CEO, he has taken home about $127 million in total compensation, according to securities filings.

The breach upended it all. Equifax has faced heated criticism from angry consumers, politicians and its own customers. The company is under investigation by regulators even as the Federal Bureau of Investigation probes the hack. The shares have lost over a quarter of their value since Equifax disclosed the incident, though they rose 6.9% Friday.

Mr. Smith, meanwhile, will testify before Congress in coming weeks. He hasn't spoken publicly since the hack was disclosed, except for a video Equifax released at that time. In an article he wrote for USA Today, Mr. Smith said the incident was the"most humbling moment in our 118-year history."

Equifax decided to hold off on immediately informing the public of its breach until the company had more clarity on the number of people affected and the types of information that were compromised, according to people familiar with the matter.

People who worked with Mr. Smith describe him as being in constant motion, always focused on an objective and looking to move on.

He was the same outside the office. "He plays speed golf," said a person who knows him. "I never had a three-putt with Rick. You putt once, and he gives you the second one because he's ready to go to the next hole."

When Mr. Smith came to Equifax he looked to change the company and its culture, he said in his University of Georgia remarks.

He added he wanted to turn Equifax into a "global data-analytics company." To do so, Mr. Smith acquired and monetized countless pieces ofdata on consumers' financial lives, allowing lenders, landlords and insurance companies, among others, to make decisions ranging from extending credit to hiring job seekers to renting an apartment.

While Equifax grew quickly, competitors privately criticized the company's technological abilities, saying it was more focused on growing data sets. Equifax "came to the software party very late," said an industry executive.

After the breach, questions have arisen in information-security communities about whether and when Equifax patched a software vulnerability that gave hackers entry to the company's servers. Equifax, while saying it "took efforts" to patch systems when the vulnerability was reported in early March, acknowledged the questions and said its review "is ongoing."

Accounting Firm Deloitte Says It Suffered Cyberattack; Deloitte says hacker accessed data from email platform, but 'very few' clients were affected

Accounting firm Deloitte said Monday it had suffered a cyberattack in which a hacker accessed data affecting a "very few" of Deloitte's clients.

In a statement, Deloitte said it had contacted all of the affected clients and that "no disruption has occurred to client businesses, to Deloitte's ability to continue to serve clients, or to consumers" as a result of the incident, The firm said it notified government authorities immediately after it became aware of the breach.

Deloitte said the hacker accessed data from an email platform. The firm said it has conducted "an intensive and thorough review" of the incident, using cybersecurity and confidentiality specialists both inside of Deloitte and outside the firm.

Much isn't known about the hack, though, and a Deloitte spokeswoman declined to comment beyond a statement from the firm. Deloitte didn't say what kind of information was compromised, how the hacking was accomplished, or in what country it took place. While Deloitte is a global organization, it is comprised of individual partnerships in each country where it does business.

Deloitte also didn't specify to which governmental authorities it had reported the breach. A spokeswoman for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, Deloitte's U.S. regulator, said the board was "monitoring the situation carefully" and that auditors "have a professional responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of their client's information."

The Financial Reporting Council, Deloitte's regulator in the U.K., declined to comment on the hack. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also declined to comment.

News of the Deloitte hack follows two other major data breaches reported in recent weeks. Credit-reporting company Equifax Inc. said Sept. 7 that hackers had "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617" to personal data the company held on potentially 143 million Americans. The Securities and Exchange Commission said last Wednesday that its Edgar corporate-filing system "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hack-response-opens-sec-to-criticism-1506024730" last year and that the thieves could have benefited from access to nonpublic information.

The cyberbreach at Deloitte was first reported by the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper. The Guardian said Deloitte discovered the hack in March, and that it compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of the firm's blue-chip clients.

Krebs on Security, a security-news website run by cyber expert Brian Krebs, quoted a source close to the investigation as saying that the Deloitte hack compromised the company's entire internal email system and all administrator accounts. The Deloitte spokeswoman couldn't immediately be reached for comment on the Krebs assertions.

Deloitte is one of the world's largest professional-services firms, with $38.8 billion in revenue in the fiscal year that ended May 31. It audits hundreds of public companies in the U.S. alone, including about 20% of the companies in the S&P 500, according to data and research firm Audit Analytics.

The firm also provides tax services, as well as consulting services that assist companies in areas like mergers and acquisitions, coping with global economic change, and risk. The latter includes consulting on cyberrisk, which Deloitte called "a high growth area" earlier this month

According to Deloitte's U.S. website, its cyberrisk services help customers "get ahead of cyberrisk so your business can keep moving forward." The firm offers services like helping clients protect sensitive data and reduce the risk of data breaches; monitoring and detection capabilities to identify malicious cyberactivity; customized research to help companies identify emerging cyberthreats and take pre-emptive action; "war gaming" and simulations to help prepare a company to cope with a hack; and response and recovery services if an attack should occur.

Deloitte and other major accounting firms have long been concerned about the possibility that they themselves could be targets of a cyberattack. Their businesses result in them holding large amounts of confidential financial data on many of the world's largest companies, making them attractive potential targets for hackers.

A 2017 audit transparency report issued by Deloitte's U.K. firm said the risk of a cyberattack is "an area of considerable focus" for the firm, and protection of its clients' data is of "paramount importance." The firm "invests heavily" in cyberdefenses, the report said, and conducts annual cyber-crisis management exercises while reviewing its readiness for a cyberattack on a continuing basis.

"We're in the business of trust and that's something we don't take lightly," Jon Raphael, chief innovation officer at Deloitte & Touche LLP in the U.S., told The Wall Street Journal in a 2015 interview.

(The following is a roundup of selected companies that have revealed securities sales in recent Form D regulatory filings. These companies are required to file a Form D notification within 15 days after the first sale of securities in an offering, which could indicate fundraising, acquisitions or other securities activity. The filings don't list the recipients of the securities being offered. However, they do list board members, so in cases where new investors have surfaced, we'll report them below.)

Mercury Is Rising at HgCapital

In the decade since senior partner Nic Humphries took the helm of HgCapital, the U.K. buyout firm has established itself as a sector expert and earned a reputation among investors as a "machine &for making money," according to private-equity advisory Rede Partners LLP.

In 2016, the firm posted 690 million (about $727 million at the time) of earnings before interest, taxes, deduction and amortization, 20% more than a year earlier and has generated returns of about 30% for its last buyout fund.

Mr. Humphries, who replaced Ian Armitage as chief executive in 2007 and who today is known as the firm's senior partner, fine-tuned its strategy, ending HgCapital's generalist investment approach. Today it targets deals in the services, industrials and technology, media and telecommunications sectors, having left the health-care, consumer and leisure, and renewable energy sectors in recent years.

Adam Turtle, co-founder of placement agent Rede Partners LLP which worked on HgCapital's more than 3.1 billion round of fundraising for two separate funds in February said: "He has got a very clear view of the sorts of companies he wants to buy &it feels like you're investing in a rigorous and very predictable system for money."

He said HgCapital's latest buyout fund, which closed on 2.5 billion in February, could have easily have raised more than 3 billion alone, putting that down to the firm's change of tack. He said Mr. Humphries' technology background he has long led HgCapital's technology, media and telecommunications team and worked ahead of Barclays Private Equity's IT and telecoms team before joining HgCapital in 2001 has had a significant impact on the firm's strategy.

"[Technology] was considered a dangerous word from a fundraising perspective because it brought back memories of the dot-com crash," he said. "What he's brought to HgCapital is this wealth of technology expertise and really a focus on technology, which now puts them in an extremely good position &they have had a huge head-start on everyone else."

Parallel to its latest buyout fund, HgCapital raised 575 million for its second Mercury growth fund within three months, according to a statement. Its first Mercury fund returned about 80% of its invested capital to date and is valued at a 2.1 times gross multiple with a 41% gross IRR, according to the firm.

One investor said: "The knowledge they [the firm] can take from one experience and apply to another is quite significant."

Fundraising

The firm's eighth buyout fund and second technology growth fund were oversubscribed, according to Steven Batchelor, a partner who heads client services at HgCapital.

The buyout fund was more than three times oversubscribed in just one month and succeeded the seventh vehicle's 2 billion final close in April 2013, raising 2.5 billion by February 2017, according to the firm.

Mr. Batchelor said: "We're not always going to be this lucky. The market is very positive at the moment and we will definitely be in another fundraising market when it is difficult."

He said the private-equity firm's seventh fund is valued at 1.5-times more than the cost of its investments.

Not far from his mind is HgCapital's sixth fund, which despite launching the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy raised 1.9 billion within 18 months in the market.

HgCapital's latest buyout fund, which had a reuptake rate of 90%, received a 350 million from its cornerstone investor HgCapital Trust, compared with 200 million for its seventh vehicle.

When Mr. Batchelor joined the firm 14 years ago, its investor base was entirely U.K.-based. Today, 40% of its clients are from North America and 40% from Europe, with the remainder from regions including Asia and the Middle East.

The fundraising follows respectable returns for the firm's previous funds.

Its seventh fund is valued at 1.5 times cost, he said, "but it's very early in its life" so could generate higher returns. It currently has a gross net internal rate of return an annualized measure of performance of almost 30%, according to Mr. Batchelor. The fund has exited one investment ahead of schedule Personal & Informatik, a German payroll and HR-related software provider that generated a 2.3-times return and a 36% IRR when HgCapital sold the business to buyout firm Permira in September last year.

Meanwhile, its 2009-vintage sixth fund is currently marked at just more than two-times cost and is expected to generate an IRR in the midteens, according to Mr. Batchelor.

Mercury, led by Matthew Brockman, a managing partner and chairman of the firm's investment committee, reflects HgCapital's attempts to hone its sector focus. In addition to leaving the consumer and health-care sectors, HgCapital said in April last year that it would support its incumbent renewable energy team in its spinout as Asper Investment Management.

Deals

HgCapital plans to do more exits in future and is taking a cautious stance on investments, according to Mr. Brockman. So far this year, HgCapital has sold six of its investments and expects more in the coming months as it focuses on returning capital to investors.

It already has returned about 1.4 billion of capital to investors from those exits and three refinancings this year about four times the sum it's invested since the start of the year.

In August, the firm's first Mercury fund sold software company Sequel Business Solutions to U.S. analytics provider Verisk Analytics. The deal took Mercury One's returns to three-times invested cost and a gross IRR on realized investments of about 44%, according to a statement at the time.

In June, HgCapital sold Danish hosting provider Zitcom Group to trade buyer Intelligent for a 3.3 times return and an approximately 145% gross IRR after 18 months of ownership, according to a statement from HgCapital at the time. The same month it sold U.K. automotive parts distributor Parts Alliance to Canadian auto products distributor Uni-Select for 205 million.

It has also sold German meter reading systems maker Qundis, software company E-conomic and U.K. vehicle leasing company Zenith. Its investments this year include Visma Group, in which HgCapital has reinvested twice.

The firm initially invested 101 million in the software provider through its fifth fund in 2006 it owned 100% of the company after a take-private that valued Visma at 382 million.

The firm then sold two-thirds of its stake to buyout firm KKR & Co. in 2010 and reinvested in the company in 2014 with its seventh fund through a consortium with KKR and buyout firm Cinven.

In June, HgCapital invested a further 238 million in Visma in another club deal, giving the company an enterprise value of NOK 45 billion ($5.3 billion at the time). HgCapital led the deal, which gave it 41% of the company's equity. Consortium members Cinven, sovereign-wealth fund GIC, buyout firm Montagu Private Equity and debt investor Intermediate Capital Group took minority positions in the company.

Mr. Humphries said HgCapital wants to give its investors longer-term exposure to more high-growth businesses such as Visma.

Mr. Humphries said: "The benefit is [that] although they [businesses like Visma] generate great cash, they're businesses that systemically grow. They grow revenues of three to four times GDP every year and they do that through good cycles and bad &When we do manage to find them and they perform well, we've got a bias toward continued exposure to the great returns they generate."

Also in June, HgCapital bought Esendex Ltd. a business messaging service company, from Darwin Private Equity in the last deal from its first Mercury fund. Meanwhile, in April it led a deal for software company Mitratech alongside private-equity house TA Associates.

An investor in HgCapital who declined to be named was attracted to the style of HgCapital's deals increasingly technology with a particular focus on software, stable revenues and large customer bases.

Succession

The firm's 15 partners range in age from their mid-30s to mid-50s, meaning retirement for some is expected in the next five years. However, further generational change is likely to be far down the road for HgCapital, as Mr. Humphries was just 39 when he took charge a decade ago. Most members of the firm's senior bench are in their 40s.

He said: "Over the last three or four years we've tried to spread management at the firm across a number of people and we have Matthew [Brockman], Matthew Rourke [head of services investments], Justin Von Simson [head of the Munich office], Stephen Bough [chief operating officer] and all of those people share different management responsibilities.

"You can take one or two people and give them 100% management responsibility [but] you stop them from making investments and realizations."

Khosla Backs AI Startup Creating New Class of Genetic Drugs; Toronto-based Deep Genomics crunches data on diseases that can be manipulated

It was the mid-1990s when Brendan Frey first started publishing some of the earliest research on deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence meant to mimic the brain's network of information.

But it wasn't until recently that Mr. Frey could finally put some of those decades-old algorithms to use beyond academic research.

With the advent of faster, more powerful computers alongside the ability to map the human genome, Mr. Frey's work as a professor at the University of Toronto evolved into a startup called Deep Genomics Inc., which just landed a $13 million Series A led by Khosla Ventures.

Deep Genomics, which Mr. Frey founded in 2015, is building a machine learning platform that maps genetic pathways of disease to inform drug development. The Toronto-based startup's technology pulls from sources including public biological data repositories and patient genetic data to identify variants of disease that could be manipulated through medicine.

"From a huge data set of 69 trillion molecules, we've been able to create these experimentally valid compounds that act as a control knob, or tool kit, that will guide us in developing new therapies," Mr. Frey said.

In the next 24 months, Mr. Frey said Deep Genomics expects to be able to generate a library of 1,000 molecule compounds that can be used in different ways, from in-house development of the company's own drugs to research collaborations and preclinical testing with pharmaceutical companies.

The 22-employee startup is packed with Ph.D.s from Cambridge, MIT, Stanford and Waterloo. Mr. Frey no longer teaches at the University of Toronto, but research on deep learning and genetics under his leadership has been published in journals like Nature, Cell and Science.

Other companies using artificial intelligence to accelerate drug development include Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Notable Labs Inc.

Vinod Khosla, whose firm led the Series A with a $9.8 million contribution, said Deep Genomics is notable for its level of expertise in artificial intelligence and for the type of drugs it is seeking to create.

"There are other AI companies out there trying to accelerate drug development, but Deep Genomics has the potential to open up an entirely new class of compounds not yet available," said Khosla. "This is an area of medicine the pharmaceutical industry really needs help with."

True Ventures, which led the company's seed round in 2015, also returned to invest in this round, bringing Deep Genomics' total funding to date to nearly $17 million. The company plans to use the capital to continue building out the platform and explore strategic partnerships.

Equifax Hack Upends CEO's Drive to Be a Data Powerhouse; Under Richard Smith, Equifax's value had more than quadrupled before a systems breach raised questions about the company and its leader

Equifax Inc. Chief Executive Richard Smith told a breakfast meeting in mid-August that data fraud is a "huge opportunity" for the credit-reporting company, allowing it to sell consumers more offerings.

Mr. Smith, who goes by Rick, said young people should sign up for the company's credit-monitoring offerings, according to a "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZzqUnQg-Us" at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. Mr. Smith was responding to an audience question about data fraud and said protecting consumer data was "a huge priority" for the company.

What the audience didn't know, and Mr. Smith didn't mention: less than three weeks earlier, Equifax had discovered a systems breach and called in Mandiant, the cyber-investigations division of FireEye Inc., to investigate. That inquiry uncovered a massive attack that exposed vital personal information of potentially 143 million Americans, something Equifax didn't "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765".

Mr. Smith's remarks add to "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/09/11/questions-about-equifax-breach-pile-up/" about what Equifax knew, when it knew and whether it took sufficient steps to safeguard its data. They also underscore how focused Mr. Smith has been on getting and selling more data.

Mr. Smith and Equifax declined to comment.

Until the hack was announced, the drive for data had helped both Mr. Smith and Equifax prosper. After taking the helm of the company 12 years ago this week, Mr. Smith transformed Equifax from what he once described as a staid, slow-growing credit-reporting company into a data giant.

He bought companies with databases that contained information about consumers' employment histories, salaries and savings while also expanding internationally to places like Australia and India.

The result: by 2016, credit-reporting activities accounted for less than a third of revenues versus about 80% a decade earlier. Equifax's market value soared to nearly $18 billion, more than quadruple its value when Mr. Smith started.

And the executive became a business celebrity in Equifax's hometown of Atlanta, co-chairing the city's successful bid to host the 2019 Super Bowl and being inducted into Georgia State University's Business Hall of Fame in 2010. Mr. Smith also did well financially: Over his time as CEO, he took home around $127 million in combined total compensation, according to securities filings.

The breach upended it all. Equifax has faced heated criticism from angry consumers, politicians and its own customers. The company is under investigation by regulators even as the Federal Bureau of Investigation has faced heated criticism from angry consumers, politicians and its own customers. The company is under investigation by regulators even as the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-looking-into-equifax-data-breach-1504902745". The stock market has cut its market value by $5.5 billion, or nearly a third.

Mr. Smith, meanwhile, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-ceo-to-testify-at-senate-hearing-on-data-breach-1506017076" in coming weeks. He hasn't spoken publicly since the hack was disclosed, except for a video Equifax released at that time. In an "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/09/12/equifax-ceo-we-make-changes-editorials-debates/659738001/", Mr. Smith said the incident was the "most humbling moment in our 118-year history."

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday night disclosed that it, too, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-discloses-edgar-corporate-filing-system-was-hacked-in-2016-1505956552" last year, underscoring the vulnerability of a wide range of institutions. It also shows the gaps that often exist between when institutions discover an intrusion and when they disclose it.

Equifax decided to hold off on immediately informing the public of its breach until the company had more clarity on the number of people affected and the types of information that were compromised, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Smith grew up in the Midwest. During high school summers, he built silos on farms. He graduated from Purdue University and was a varsity wrestler.

In the early 1980s, Mr. Smith landed at General Electric where he spent more than two decades moving up the ranks. Jack Welch, that company's well-known CEO, was a mentor.

People who worked with Mr. Smith describe him as being in constant motion, always focused on an objective and looking to move on.

He was the same outside the office. "He plays speed golf," said one person who knows him. "I never had a three putt with Rick. You putt once, and he gives you the second one because he's ready to go to the next hole."

When Mr. Smith came to Equifax he looked to change the company and its culture, he said in his University of Georgia remarks. "A lesson I always tell people is you have to take a risk in life," Mr. Smith said.

At the time, Equifax was focused primarily on selling credit data to lenders and "probably growing 1% or 2% organically a year," Mr. Smith said. "It wasn't a culture I wanted for the future, it was a culture of entitlement."

He added that he wanted to turn Equifax into a "global data-analytics company." To do so, Mr. Smith acquired and monetized countless pieces of data on consumers' financial lives, allowing lenders, landlords and insurance companies, among others, to make decisions ranging from extending credit to hiring job seekers to renting an apartment. Equifax got that new data in part by buying other companies.

The company's biggest acquisition, in 2016, was the $1.9 billion "https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumer-credit-agency-equifax-makes-move-on-australias-veda-1442546222", an Australian credit information and analytics company.

The push into wider data sets turned Equifax into a business that housed "$12 trillion of consumer wealth data," Mr. Smith said in an interview with his alma mater around six years ago. "Without us, you wouldn't have global commerce as you know it today."

Besides work, Mr. Smith also was involved in outside boards and committees, several of which were focused on bettering the Atlanta region. "Rick wasn't a 12-hour a day, 7-day a week guy in the office," said a person who knows him.

While Equifax grew quickly, competitors privately criticized the company's technological abilities, saying it was more focused on growing data sets. Equifax "came to the software party very late," said an industry executive.

Following the breach, questions have arisen in information-security communities about whether and when Equifax patched a software vulnerability that gave hackers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617". Equifax, while saying its staff "took efforts" to patch systems when the vulnerability was reported in early March, acknowledged the questions and said its review "is ongoing."

The view that Equifax lagged behind peers technologically wasn't shared by Mr. Smith. We're a "world-class state-of-the art technology" company, he said at last month's University of Georgia event.

Toys R Us investors in play for safety; Capital markets

Debtor-in-possession financing brings hope of bankruptcy cushioning

Investors in Toys R Us bonds and term loans are seeking stakes in the retailer's debtor-in-possession financing, which offers the greatest protection as a messy bankruptcy process looms.

The New Jersey-based company plans to raise about $1bn of new money as part of its $3.1bn debtor-in-possession financing, according to court filings. Investors may be better positioned to safeguard their investments by participating in the loan.

Bain Capital, KKR and Vornado Realty Trust took Toys R Us private in a leveraged buyout in 2005 that left the company spending more than $400m a year to meet its debt burden while facing fierce competition from the likes of Walmart, Target and Amazon.

The debtor-in-possession financing is a type of funding used by companies in severe financial distress, typically ranking as the most senior obligation in a bankruptcy. It is also designed to help the retailer keep its 1,600 stores open as it restructures its debts after filing for bankruptcy protection on Monday.

The retailer's outstanding bonds and loans have plunged in value, highlighting how many investors expected it to stay afloat. Now owners of the bonds and loans are nursing losses, and based on current debt prices, will receive a hefty haircut on their holdings if the company emerges from Chapter 11 protection.

Bonds worth $400m that mature in 2018 briefly fell to 16 cents on the dollar this week before rebounding to trade at 28 cents yesterday. At the start of the month, the October 2018 notes were quoted just a few cents below par.

"This is a sign of where we are in the cycle," said Thomas Graff, the head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. "Folks are so desperate for interesting yield ideas. They were willing to assume that the 2018 bonds would be refinanced and you could get out at par, despite the really obvious challenges around the business."

Investors are paying close attention to a $1bn term loan, which included Angelo Gordon, Franklin Templeton, HPS Investment Partners and Marathon Asset Management, according to court documents. That loan, which is due in 2020, was quoted at 68 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, down from 78 cents earlier this month. Another term loan that matures in 2018, currently trades at 54 cents on the dollar.

Stephen Hazelton, the founder of the credit document analytics group Street Diligence, characterised the toy retailer's capital structure as "extremely complicated". Guarantees between its US and foreign operations have muddied the water of who has first claim on any eventual payments Toys R Us can make to its creditors.

The Gordian knot of inter-creditor agreements and intercompany loans has made "the actual pecking order . . . a bit of a mess," Mr Hazelton said. "The guarantee relationships, the intercompany debt outstanding, all of that is extremely complicated and will have a material effect on who gets what."

Despite the risk of owning Toys R Us obligations, which rating agencies had flagged as speculative for years, the bonds and loans had mostly traded above distress territory. News that the company was considering plans to file for bankruptcy protection earlier this month set off a "dangerous game of dominoes" that quickly squeezed the group's liquidity, chief executive David Brandon claimed.

Hack Response Opens SEC to Criticism; Agency, which has pushed companies on disclose cyberattacks, provided few details of its own

By Tatyana Shumsky

The Securities and Exchange Commission's disclosure Wednesday of a 2016 cyberattack on its Edgar database drew criticism for both its timing and lack of detail, an awkward twist for a regulator that has been pushing public companies to both gird against attacks and to promptly disclose them.

The SEC said late Wednesday that Edgar, an electronic database of filings made by thousands of public companies, money managers and brokerage firms, was hacked last year. The SEC said it learned last month there may have been unspecified illegal trading related to the hack. The agency didn't disclose when the hack occurred, when it was detected and what information hackers accessed.

The response could undermine the agency's own efforts to push public companies to educate investors on cyberrisks and more swiftly disclose cyberbreaches to the public, said lawyers, investors and disclosure experts. 

"A federal governmental agency has a particular responsibility to be transparent," said former SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar, who now works for a private-equity firm, Falcon Cyber Investments LLC., which invests in cybersecurity. "Particularly an agency that expects "full and fair disclosure" from publicly traded companies."

The delayed disclosure is also likely to tarnish the relationship between the regulator and the companies it oversees.

"Corporate America is going to be concerned. They have a deep-trust relationship with the SEC," said Rob Blake, vice president of product management at Certent Inc., a Pleasanton, Calif. provider of disclosure management technologies. "They're going to ask some tough questions."

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee who joined the Commission in May, brought up the severity of cyberrisk in his first major speech in July.

"Public companies have a clear obligation to disclose material information about cyberrisks and cyberevents," he said at the time. "I expect them to take this requirement seriously."

Information about the SEC hack was buried in a lengthy statement by Mr. Clayton on the agency's cybersecurity efforts and released just after 8 p.m. on Wednesday evening.

There have been at least 123 breaches disclosed to the regulator by companies that file with the SEC since 2008, according to Audit Analytics. Many more hacks are made public directly to consumers each year through media reports and direct company outreach to affected parties.

Companies must report a cyberbreach to the SEC only if they judge it to be "material," meaning it is significant enough to influence an investor's decision to buy a company's stock. The rules for disclosing a hack are stricter for broker-dealers and investment advisers than they are for public companies.

The SEC has yet to bring a case against a company that was deemed to have failed to disclose a cyberincident, but officials haven't ruled out doing so.

"Can I envision circumstances where we would bring an action? Sure," said Stephanie Avakian, the SEC's deputy director of enforcement, at a February 2016 conference. "But it would have to be a significant disclosure failure to warrant that."

An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the news release and chairman's statement.

SEC staff also have pushed companies in recent years to loop in the regulator early in the discovery of any hack and to keep regional officers apprised of the internal investigation efforts to ensure any disclosures are made in a timely fashion.

The SEC's own cyber vulnerability has been part of regulatory discussion in recent years, including multiple remarks by Mr. Aguilar, the former SEC Commissioner.

"I saw the cybersecurity issues percolating on various fronts," said Mr. Aguilar in a Thursday email to The Wall Street Journal. "It's better to take precautionary measures sooner, rather than later."

The regulator also faces a different set of cyberrisks than public companies. The SEC has no public investors who could be harmed by the delayed disclosure. But the breach of Edgar could have led to hackers making illicit gains from insider trading, the SEC said.

The Edgar hack occurred two years after Congress slashed half of the $50 million the SEC set aside for technology initiatives. The agency relies on Congress for its funding.

"The federal government is facing the same security challenges that corporations are facing in an environment where they are trying to compete for scarce security talent on a federal government budget," said Heather Sussman, co-lead of the privacy and cybersecurity practice at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP.

Puerto Rico Bond Prices Decline

It could take weeks to determine the full extent of the hurricane damage to Puerto Rico, but bondholders are already anticipating losses.

Prices have fallen as much as 4% since Monday on some bonds issued by the commonwealth, its public power company, and its water and sewer authority. Investors were already expecting deep haircuts as the commonwealth makes its way through a federally supervised restructuring process.

"How long will they be missing revenues because of people not getting power?" said Dan Solender, director of municipals at Lord Abbett & Co., which holds more than $100 million of Puerto Rico bonds.

Even before Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico on Wednesday, thousands of people had been without electricity for two weeks, since Hurricane Irma passed by the island's northern coast.

Puerto Rico owes roughly $70 billion to investors. Depending on the extent of the damage, the hurricane could factor into decisions by the federal control board on just how much investors will get paid, said Matt Fabian, a partner with Municipal Market Analytics.

Is It Fintech Or Is It Insurance?

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The latest frontier in Chinese insurance: the internet. But investors are perhaps giving it too much faith.

ZhongAn Online Property & Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, is getting ready to raise as much as $1.5 billion in a Hong Kong public offering, valuing the company at a heady $11 billion. That makes it look more like the rare fintech "decacorn" from Silicon Valley, rather than a Chinese insurance company that sells drone-accident policies, among other products.

The lofty tech-like valuation is more a hat tip to ZhongAn's big backers than its own business. Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba's Ant Financial and Tencent own nearly 30% of the company and will end up with just more than 20% after it goes public. The latest entrant is Japan's SoftBank, coming in as a cornerstone investor to take up more than 36% of the offered shares at the top end of the price range. Meanwhile, Chinese insurance behemoth Ping An holds about 12%. Only a thin slice will be given out to the public.

ZhongAn brings little to the table except the novelty value of an online-only insurer. For one, almost 70% of insurance is already sold online in China. It boasts a cloud-based system that can process up to 13,000 policies a second and an artificial-intelligence-based customer service chatbot. It sells policies like a Shipping Return Policy -- its top product -- which covers the shipping cost on returns of purchases. Buyers pay a premium of 0.20 to 9.9 yuan (US$0.03 to US$1.50) per purchase.

Other products include travel insurance, along with policies for diabetes patients, cracked phone screens and damaged furniture. Last year, ZhongAn sold just more than 10 policies per customer. So it is essentially a bet on high volume in the everyday insurance-bundling business, with more than 90% of sales generated from its partner platforms -- such as Ant Financial, China's largest travel site, Ctrip, and Uber rival Didi Chuxing.

But these partnerships come at a cost: ZhongAn posted net written premium income of 886 million yuan in the first quarter, up 55% from a year earlier. But given substantial expenses including fees to its partners -- more than a third of net premiums -- it ended up posting a loss of 202 million yuan for the first quarter of this year. The company said it expects to post a big loss for the full year.

At the top of its IPO pricing range, ZhongAn would be valued at more than 4 times book value, meaning all upside seems to have been priced in. Classic property-and-casualty insurers like PICC trade closer to 1.4 times book value.

This trip to the frontier is already looking expensive.

Even before Hurricane "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-maria-slams-into-puerto-rico-1505907575"early Wednesday, thousands of people had been without electricity for two weeks, since Hurricane Irma passed by the island's northern coast. But the damage from Maria, the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928, is likely to be much more widespread on the island, which is already reeling from a decade of economic distress.

Puerto Rico owes roughly $70 billion to investors, including individuals on both the island and the mainland, to major U.S. mutual funds and, increasingly, to hedge funds. OppenheimerFunds Inc. and Franklin Resources Inc. are the biggest mutual fund holders of Puerto Rico bonds, according to Morningstar Direct.

Depending on the extent of the damage, the hurricane could factor into future decisions by the federal control board on just how much those investors will get paid, said Matt Fabian, a partner with Municipal Market Analytics.

In the aftermath of a natural disaster, "why would a court decide 'yes, investors, you should take more money off the island?'" Mr. Fabian asked.

But some analysts and advisers to Puerto Rico bondholders also said Wednesday that a massive hurricane recovery effort could help stimulate economic growth on the island. Federal disaster relief funds and insurance money flowing into Puerto Rico could replace outdated infrastructure, and rebuilding could help put people to work, these people said.

Toys R Us bondholders braced for messy bankruptcy process

Investors in Toys R Us bonds and term loans are seeking stakes in the retailer s debtor-in-possession financing, which offers the greatest protection as a messy bankruptcy process looms.

The New Jersey-based company plans to raise about $1bn of new money as part of its $3.1bn debtor-in-possession financing, according to court filings. Investors may be better positioned to safeguard their investments by participating in the loan.

Bain Capital, KKR and Vornado Realty Trust took Toys R Us private in a leveraged buyout in 2005, which left the company spending more than $400m a year meeting its debt burden while facing fierce competition from the likes of Walmart, Target and Amazon.

The debtor-in-possession financing is a type of funding used by companies in severe financial distress, typically ranking as the most senior obligation in a bankruptcy.

It is also designed to help the retailer keep its 1,600 stores open as it restructures its debts following its filing for bankruptcy protection on Monday.

The retailer s outstanding bonds and loans have plunged in value, highlighting how many investors expected the embattled vendor of toys to stay afloat.

Now owners of the bonds and loans are nursing losses, and based on current debt prices, will receive a hefty haircut on their holdings if the company emerges from Chapter 11 protection.

Bonds worth $400m that mature in 2018 briefly fell to 16 cents on the dollar earlier this week before rebounding to trade at 28 cents on Wednesday. At the start of the month, the October 2018 notes were quoted just a few cents below par.

 This is a sign of where we are in the cycle,  said Thomas Graff, the head of fixed income at Brown Advisory.  Folks are so desperate for interesting yield ideas. They were willing to assume that the 2018 bonds would be refinanced and you could get out at par, despite the really obvious challenges around the business. 

Investors are paying close attention to a $1bn term loan, which included Angelo Gordon, Franklin Templeton, HPS Investment Partners and Marathon Asset Management as investors, according to court documents.

That loan, which is due in 2020, was quoted at 68 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, down from 78 cents earlier this month. Another term loan that matures in 2018, currently trades at 54 cents on the dollar.

Stephen Hazelton, the founder of the credit document analytics group Street Diligence, characterised the toy retailer s capital structure as  extremely complicated .

Guarantees between its US and foreign operations have muddied the water of who has first claim on any eventual payments Toys R Us is able to make to its creditors.

The Gordian knot of inter-creditor agreements and intercompany loans has made  the actual pecking order 	. 	. 	. 	a bit of a mess , Mr Hazelton said.  The guarantee relationships, the intercompany debt outstanding, all of that is extremely complicated and will have a material effect on who gets what. 

The backstory

Highlights of the FT s coverage of how online shopping is disrupting the US retail sector

* FT Series: Retail s clearance sale

* Charting the US retail revolution

* FT View: Bricks and mortar over straw

* Retailers to Amazon: pick me, pick me

* Will the death of retail be the next big short?

Despite the risk of owning Toys R Us obligations, which rating agencies had flagged as speculative for years, the bonds and loans had mostly traded above distress territory.

News that the company was considering plans to file for bankruptcy protection earlier this month set off a  dangerous game of dominoes  that quickly squeezed the group s liquidity, chief executive David Brandon claimed.

Fitch, S&P Global and Moody s have since downgraded Toys R Us to reflect the bankruptcy filing, and distressed investors are likely to spend the coming days parsing through credit documents to decide if the loans have dropped below expected recovery values.

But not all investors are convinced that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is the right course for the retailer that brought the jingle  I don t want to grow up, I m a Toys R Us kid  and Geoffrey the Giraffe into homes across the US.

John Lekas, chief executive and senior portfolio manager of Leader Capital, said he believed liquidation was more prudent and that the value of the company would continue to erode if executives tried to invest further in the business.

 The [Toys R Us] structure is complicated because they have been screwing around [with] this for 10 years. It is not working and it hasn t worked for a long time,  Mr Lekas said.  I just don t understand why they are doing Chapter 11 to try and revive a dead business? Why? It s dead. Why are you putting the electric shocker on it?

A Taiwanese electric scooter maker has attracted $300m in funding from a basket of new investors including Al Gore s Generation Investment Management, as the company shifts focus from making vehicles to expanding its battery swapping technology.

Taipei-based Gogoro, which has sold more than 34,000 electric scooters since launching in 2015, also added Japan s Sumitomo, French electricity firm Engie and Singapore s state-owned investment fund Temasek as new investors in its series-C funding round, the company s co-founder and chief executive Horace Luke told the Financial Times.

Those companies join Panasonic, HTC chair Cher Wang and Dr Samuel Yin, who were among the investors in the prior two funding rounds, which totalled about $180m. Dr Yin, one of Taiwan s richest men, remains Gogoro s biggest shareholder. Mr Luke would not disclose the level of specific equity holdings.

Much of the new capital raised will be targeted at expanding the battery network and developing the technology in the back-end system, which uses artificial intelligence to respond to battery usage and demand as well as electricity pricing in real-time.

Mr Luke, who had a close hand in developing Microsoft s Xbox and HTC s smartphones, said that Gogoro built the first two models of its scooter  out of necessity  to prove the cost-effectiveness of making vehicles that can use its batteries and charging system.

The company now sees itself becoming more of an energy utility, offering city-wide battery storage and feeding back into the power grid if needed, rather than a scooter manufacturer.

Gogoro is already in talks with vehicle manufacturers outside of Taiwan about making  smart scooters  that can use the company s battery and  refuelling infrastructure , Mr Luke said.

Since 2015, Gogoro has installed more than 400 battery swapping stations, mostly in Taipei, but also other Taiwanese cities, and via scooter-sharing in Berlin and Paris. While growth has to-date been targeted on its home turf as well as higher-end European cities, its longer-term focus will likely be in large Asian cities, like Taipei, which face macro issues of high fuel prices, pollution, congestion, constrained or defunct public transport, and existing two-wheel vehicle density.

Gogoro s raising of $300m is significant for Taiwan s fledgling startup scene, which at times struggles to gain attention in the shadow of the Chinese market.

Yuanta Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who is based in Taipei, says despite short-term pressure on tech stocks, in the longer-term Taiwan should be an attractive area for foreign institutional investors with higher yields and cheaper valuations than China, US and South Korea.

The inflation enigma; FT BIG READ: US ECONOMY

With unemployment low and the economic recovery entering its ninth year, inflation has been sluggish. As the Federal Reserve meets this week, officials are flummoxed by low levels of price growth. By Sam Fleming

Ron Paul, at least, has no regrets. The former Texas congressman is one of the most prominent voices among those Americans who have long been deeply suspicious of the US central bank and its power to print money. When he ran for president in 2012, he assailed then Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke for debasing the currency and risking an inflationary upsurge by pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.

"We don't have prices in the consumer market going up like in the 1970s but we should not be surprised if that happens," says Mr Paul, who once brandished a silver coin as he lectured the former Fed chair on Capitol Hill.

Elsewhere, certainty is harder to come by. As the Fed meets in Washington tomorrow, US central bankers, and their counterparts across the world, are genuinely flummoxed by recent low inflation readings.

Despite a recovery that is now the third-longest on record, America is trapped not in a 1970s-style, double-digit inflationary upsurge, but a slow-inflation quandary. Price growth jumped in August , driven by energy and accommodation prices, yet investors still doubt inflation will be strong enough to merit more than a couple of interest-rate rises before the end of 2018.

The uncertain outlook has confounded Fed policymakers just as the central bank prepares for a leadership overhaul in the new year. President Donald Trump, who will decide shortly on the replacement for current Fed chair Janet Yellen , has managed to be on both sides of the question - slamming low rates last year during the election but welcoming them this year.

"It is a puzzle and raises a real question what the Fed should do next; I would have thought we would have been seeing more inflation pressures by now," says Jon Faust, a former adviser to Ms Yellen at the Fed now at Johns Hopkins University. "At a time when there is a confusing economic picture we don't know who will be judging that picture in a few months' time at the Fed. That added uncertainty is not a good thing."

Having lifted rates twice this year in the face of this dreary inflation, the Fed is expected to keep the target range for its key rate at 1-1.25 per cent on Wednesday, even as it announces the gradual unwinding of its quantitative easing programme . Ms Yellen is likely to leave open the prospect of a further rate rise in December, as she banks on diminishing slack in the economy driving up prices amid a global growth rebound.

Yet the Fed's 2 per cent inflation target still appears out of reach - stripping out food and energy costs, it has not attained that rate for half a decade. It has been a quarter of a century since the Fed's favoured measure of inflation - personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy - last punched up above the still relatively sedate level of 3 per cent. It was just 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Wage growth , meanwhile, remains well below its pre-crisis pace at just 2.5 per cent.

Tools for the next downturn

In 2015 Ms Yellen set out a clear road map to higher goods and services inflation, making the traditional central bankers' argument that diminishing spare capacity would ultimately stoke up price and wage pressures. The trouble is that even as the economy grows steadily and joblessness falls to 4.4 per cent , inflation has this year undershot the levels suggested by her model.

Part of the problem is that the link between low unemployment and higher price growth embodied in the so-called Phillips curve has looked fragile for decades. Some officials suspect the Fed can afford an even stronger labour market without worrying about excessive price growth.

On one level, sluggish inflation combined with respectable growth is far from a bad thing - central bankers in the 1970s would have looked on the current paradigm with envy. But if inflation hovers too low it leaves the economy uncomfortably close to deflation and could damage the credibility of an institution that is meant to target 2 per cent inflation. Low rates and low inflation leave little rate-cutting firepower when the next downturn strikes.

Weak inflation may also prompt the central bank to leave policy so loose that it inadvertently stokes up a cycle of boom and bust - something the Fed has repeatedly been accused of doing in recent decades. That worry has reasserted itself thanks to soaring asset valuations . "The risk is that you are going to end up with interest rates that are too low relative to what is consistent with financial and macroeconomic stability," says Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements. "If inflation doesn't show up, it will be hard to move interest rates up at the right speed to address this issue."

A five-month-long string of weak figures this year has prompted some Fed policymakers, including Bill Dudley of the New York Fed and Rob Kaplan of the Dallas Fed, to start asking searching questions. Are globalisation and technological advances restraining inflation at a time when a cyclical pick-up might otherwise drive it higher?

"These two forces are colliding," Mr Kaplan told the Financial Times last month. "The cyclical forces we have understood historically; the structural forces are somewhat new, particularly technology-enabled disruption."

Some policymakers cite the increased ease with which shoppers can compare prices on the internet and the impact these changes have on brand loyalty and pricing power. Amazon is entering grocery retail via Whole Foods , while the hotel sector is being overturned by Airbnb. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock, sees more price disruption to come, as artificial intelligence promises to further transform some industries.

Research from Adobe Analytics shows what online competition is doing in some fields. Online prices of furniture and bedding are down 8.3 per cent over the past two years, whereas the equivalent category in the consumer price index, which includes offline sales, has dropped less than half that amount. Sporting goods prices online are down 10 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in the CPI. Online clothing prices are down 6.5 per cent in the same period, compared with a 4.1 per cent offline drop.

Goods price deflation is not new in the US, and Pete Klenow of Stanford University says comparisons between online and offline prices baskets can be tricky because of their different constructions. While some Fed officials argue that technology is eroding companies' ability to lift prices, Goldman Sachs analysts recently found an increase in corporate pricing power over the past 20 years, consistent with a rise in profit margins and industry concentration.

Goldman economists also question arguments that ecommerce, which accounts for around 8 per cent of retail sales - is having an appreciable impact on broader inflation. The effects of online competition on traditional retailers' pricing may be no larger than those seen during the rise of "big box" superstore chains like Walmart.

Other analysts have been looking closely at the labour market, linking paltry wage growth to the soggy inflation readings. Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations, says higher job insecurity and lower labour force mobility in the US may be stifling calls for higher wages. "Workers and producers are unsure that the market is actually going to be robust enough to support higher wage and price demands."

While goods price inflation has been negative for much of the post-crisis period, Ms Mann highlights a weakening in services price inflation from 3 per cent before the crisis to closer to 2 per cent now. She is examining the growing role of services jobs held disproportionately by women who are paid less than men. "It is really tough to get inflation up if wages are not rising," she says.

Official confusion

At the Fed, some officials struggle to see why big structural factors would have intervened to crush inflation numbers. Instead, the Fed has suggested this year's dull outcomes are being driven by a series of coincidental, one-off drags, including a fall in wireless data prices.

If they are right, the jump in inflation last month could herald further gains - with an extra lift potentially from the recent dollar depreciation. Yet Fed rate-setters are split over the outlook, and market confidence in Fed forecasts has ebbed. Charles Plosser, a former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, says: "I do think economists need to work harder on understanding the inflation process."

The shortfalls are by no means confined to the US. In the euro area, a sharp drop in unemployment across the region is yet to be matched by a strong pick-up in wages - without which officials fear inflation will fail to hit its goal of just under 2 per cent.

Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said this year that "backward-looking" negotiation of nominal wages that reference low inflation rates may be restraining prices. Many of the new jobs are also in temporary or part-time employment, which may slow the growth of nominal wages as well. At the Bank of Japan, meanwhile, officials' struggles with achieving inflation targets are well documented.

In the US, whose monetary policy has global reach, questions about inflation are compounded by the uncertainty over who will call the shots from February. Mr Trump will have the opportunity to appoint up to five new Fed board members by next year, but attempting to predict his choices seems futile given the capricious nature of his personnel decisions.

Some analysts argue that the central bank could end up drifting in a hawkish direction - which would worry economists with a firm eye on low inflation. Mr Trump may not reappoint Ms Yellen, who inhabits the dovish end of the policy spectrum. A number of the alternative candidates for chair have shown signs of more hawkish leanings - among them the Stanford academics Kevin Warsh and John Taylor.

On the other hand, Mr Trump has called himself a " low-rates person " and there are precedents for presidents leaning on Fed leadership to keep policy loose - even when inflation threatens to start to pick up. Richard Nixon pressured Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the early 1970s, for example. While an inflationary upsurge may currently seem unlikely, economists have such a thin grasp on what drives inflation that it is far from impossible - as observers including Mr Paul continue to warn.

If inflation fails to reassert itself, the Fed and other central banks will find it harder to balance the need for low rates against the hazardous side-effects loose policy engenders in markets. Mr Faust says: "If the central bank keeps pushing it can make inflation go up - but the question is whether some other excess bubbles up first."

The low-inflation enigma looks set to continue bedevilling policy not only in the US but across the world.

Brexit effect

Pound's depreciation feeds into rising prices

Unlike the US, the UK is witnessing a burst of inflation that is causing a dilemma for the Bank of England . But the reasons have little to do with low interest rates and quantitative easing and much more to do with Brexit .

Inflation in the UK, like that in the US and across the eurozone, had been firmly stuck below the BoE's 2 per cent target until the British public voted to leave the EU in June 2016; inflation hit a low of -0.1 per cent in September 2015. But the depreciation of the pound since the vote last year has pushed up the price of imported products, which has fed through into consumer prices. The trade-weighted sterling exchange rate has fallen by 11 per cent since the referendum and had dropped by as much as 16 per cent at its lowest point in mid-October last year.

This helped push inflation to a five-year high of 2.9 per cent in August, with many analysts predicting it will continue to move higher over the next few months and peak somewhere at or above 3 per cent towards the end of the year.

Many businesses had taken out currency hedges to cushion the impact of a fall in the value of sterling last year. But most of these hedges were for no more than 12 months, meaning the fall in the pound has gradually been felt by companies in the cost of imported goods and passed on to consumers. A pick-up in oil and other commodity prices has also boosted inflation.

But there is little sign that the depreciation-driven inflation is leading to any pick-up in domestically generated price rises.

Wage growth has remained subdued and the rate of growth of prices for services has not accelerated over the past year. And with sterling rising in recent weeks, some of the inflationary pressure from the currency could also dissipate.

Nvidia's Gains Are Real, Not Virtual; Fading hype over cryptocurrency brings focus back to more real opportunities for chipmaker

Virtual money got real enough for Nvidia of late. But investors are right to focus on the chip maker's more tangible opportunities.

Nvidia's graphics processor chips, already widely used in gaming PCs, have also proven popular for "mining" cryptocurrencies such as ethereum. Surging prices for ethereum and bitcoin over the summer led to a jump in orders for graphic chip cards that gave a $150 million boost to Nvidia's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidias-cloud-still-has-a-big-silver-lining-1502471482" ended July 30 amounting to nearly 7% of total sales for the period.

But cryptocurrency is a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-wild-ride-shows-the-truth-it-is-probably-worth-zero-1505760623". And recent "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-widens-bitcoin-crackdown-beyond-commercial-trading-1505733976" to outlaw the purchase and sale of those currencies has hurt the market. Prices on ethereum and bitcoin slumped 45% and 26% respectively in the first two weeks of September, according to data from CoinDesk.

That would appear to pose at least some risk for Nvidia, particularly after the stock's record gains in the last two years and its 80% rally since early May. Nvidia now trades at more than 52 times forward earnings one of the highest multiples in semiconductors.

But most of that run-up can be credited to the company's success in artificial intelligence. Graphics chips play a vital role in this technology and are enjoying a boom in demand driven by data centers and self-driving cars. Nvidia's data center business has nearly tripled in size over the last year. Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch projects this segment will total nearly $4 billion in revenue by fiscal 2020 more than double its size now. When it comes to Nvidia, real money always beats the virtual kind.

MIT has created a new venture-capital firm to invest in emerging technologies.

The firm, called the Engine, has raised $200 million for its first fund, of which MIT has contributed $25 million.

The Cambridge, Mass.-based firm is investing in pre-seed and seed deals for ambitious undertakings in aerospace, advanced materials, biotech, genetic engineering and energy. It can also make follow-on investments in later-stage deals.

Many of the Engine's companies will be housed in the firm's 26,000 square foot space in Cambridge. The startups can get access to MIT's specialized equipment, labs and advice, said Katie Rae, chief executive and managing partner of the Engine, who previously was managing director of Techstars Boston.

"Our mission is to back and support  tough tech' companies that solve problems," Ms. Rae said. "This completely aligns with MIT's mission."

Board members of the Engine include Robert Kraft, chief executive of the Kraft Group; J. Brad Powell, managing director of investments for Emerson Collective; and Sue Siegel, chief executive of GE Ventures.

Many of its startups come out of MIT, but the firm said it would also look beyond campus for other opportunities.

So far the Engine has made seven investments such as iSee, an artificial intelligence startup for autonomous vehicles and other uses; Baseload Renewables, a low-cost energy storage company for renewable energy; and Kytopen, which aims to speed the genetic engineering of cells.

Image detection powered by machine learning isn't just for Facebook tracking friends anymore.

Big corporate interests are now aligning around the technology that could put recognition into cameras for use in autonomous vehicles, surveillance and the myriad Internet of Things devices, offering new forms of intelligence.

One startup, Palo Alto, Calif.-based Matroid, a pioneer in computer vision as a service, has enjoyed the rise of interest in artificial intelligence applications, which has become a gateway to corporate customers seeking to benefit from image recognition.

Matroid's self-service platform allows people to set up detectors for specific images, such as a person or a car, enabling people to quickly apply those image detectors to stored or live video to identify the things being tracked. For broadcast TV, Matroid could be used to identify appearances by Donald Trump and congressional leaders in televised video, and then Slack message alerts might go out, which is what the Internet Archive's TV News Archive did in releasing its Face-O-Matic public service in July.

Founded in 2016, Matroid has picked up Intel, Bloomberg and the Internet Archive.org as customers for its computer vision service.

Matroid, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-lifes-ambition-matroid-launches-1490614201", on Monday said it has picked up $10 million in Series A funding co-led by NEA and Intel Capital. The funding will help the company expand the number of video streams that implement its technology for image tracking as well as the number of image detectors.

"We're giving computers eyes and we're essentially building a Photoshop for computer vision," said Mr. Zadeh. "We're bringing computer vision to everyone, and that means someone who doesn't even know how to program."

Under the deal, NEA and Intel Capital each are putting in $5 million. Vijay Reddy, an investment manager at Intel Capital, will serve as a board observer.

The funding brings Matroid's total to $13.5 million.

What Comes After Passwords? A look at biometrics, behavioral monitoring and more

By Steven Norton

What will life after passwords look like?

For many companies, the goal is for the authentication of customer and employee identities to be nearly invisible, taking only a second as a shopper logs into the website, or running in the background as office staff do their work.

To achieve that, and be able to accurately verify that employees and customers are who they say they are, companies are embracing new technologies including biometric scans of faces and fingerprints, and behavioral-monitoring systems that track such activities as what apps you open most frequently.

As hackers are getting more sophisticated, traditional passwords are starting to be seen as less secure. The recent data breach of credit-reporting agency Equifax Inc. is likely to raise further questions about using Social Security numbers and other personal data to authenticate a person's identity, and to fuel the push for better authentication methods. While security is paramount, companies are also seeking to provide a seamless experience to employees and customers who don't want to be burdened with multiple passcodes.

Mastercard Inc. is equipping some of its employees with laptops that have built-in fingerprint readers, and is testing technology that scans employees' faces before allowing them inside an office building. Exploring another advanced capability, Mastercard in March acquired NuData, whose technology can recognize customers based on how they hold their phone and other behavioral biometrics.

"The driving force is the elimination of passwords," says Ron Green, Mastercard's chief security officer.

Companies walk a thin line as they work to improve security without disrupting the user experience. Some customers may perceive their data as less secure if a password isn't required. But if behavior-based programs are too sensitive and act on a false positive, such as blocking access for a user who types differently due to a broken finger, that is cumbersome, too.

Similar challenges apply to facial recognition, even as the technology continues to improve, says Steve Wilson, who researches digital-identity issues as vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research, a Silicon Valley-based firm that advises companies about disruptive technologies. A poorly lighted room or a day without shaving, for example, could keep a person from being able to access an application, Mr. Wilson says.

Like any authentication measure, such tools also remain susceptible to spoofing by hackers. A high-quality photo or animation, or in some cases an animated avatar, can fool some facial-recognition systems.

"It's an arms race between biometric designers and the criminals that are trying to fool the systems," Mr. Wilson says.

Companies are coming up with creative ways to combat the problem. Vasco Data Security International Inc., a maker of cybersecurity technologies, uses "liveness detection" technology which asks users to blink their eyes or turn their heads to verify that they're a living being, says David Vergara, the company's head of global product marketing.

Despite their limitations, biometric authentication measures such as facial recognition continue to become more mainstream. Indeed, Apple Inc. has said facial recognition will be used as the primary way to unlock its latest smartphone, the iPhone X, which could significantly popularize the technology.

A number of firms are turning to technology powered by machine learning to constantly authenticate people as they use an app. Such measures, which are largely behavior-based and look at a person's typical patterns of technology use, are relatively new, but corporate interest is high, says Forrester Research analyst Andras Cser.

Automatically analyzing users' behavioral patterns, which can include hundreds of disparate data points such as typing speed, is the Holy Grail for authentication, Mr. Vergara says, because it allows firms to monitor security in real time rather than relying on a one-time password.

Behavior-based authentication is focusing on consumers first, Mr. Vergara adds, because of the potential to improve the user experience, and therefore a company's bottom line.

Health insurer Aetna Inc. is rolling out behavior-based security measures for its mobile and web applications, which also will include options for biometric factors such as fingerprint swipes. The technology collects the attributes of Aetna members, such as how they move through an application or how quickly they type, and feeds that data into a risk engine. Based on data about a customer's behavior on the app and what device he or she is using, the engine can create a picture of "normal" behavior in about two weeks.

Then, if someone's actions deviate significantly from their typical behavior, the system takes note. If a customer gives her phone to a friend, for example, the app may recognize the friend as a different person and ask for another form of authentication, such as a finger swipe across the screen.

Voice is currently the hot area for startups, says Mr. Wilson. There are voice-identification systems that can learn and verify speech cadence, accent and pronunciation, and other factors to create a unique "voiceprint." Some companies are building algorithms that use voice to determine contextual clues, such as whether the speaker is under duress.

Other biometric authentication measures being developed or explored include tools that recognize handwriting, scanners that authenticate users based on their ear shape, and even ID markers obtained through a person's DNA. No matter what forms future authentication methods take, Mr. Wilson observes, "what really matters is getting a biometric that consumers can use."

Companies shouldn't rely on a single authentication tool, analysts say. Experts recommend taking a layered approach to security, one that uses a combination of biometrics, behavior monitoring and, yes, even passwords.

Nobody seems to know why there s no US inflation

Ron Paul, at least, has no regrets. The former Texas Congressman is one of the most prominent voices among those Americans who have long been deeply suspicious of the US central bank and its power to print money. When he ran for president in 2012, he assailed then Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke for debasing the currency and risking an inflationary upsurge by pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.

 We don t have prices in the consumer market going up like in the 1970s but we should not be surprised if that happens,  says Mr Paul, who once brandished a silver coin as he lectured the former Fed chair on Capitol Hill.

Elsewhere, certainty is harder to come by. As the Fed meets in Washington tomorrow, US central bankers, and their counterparts across the world, are genuinely flummoxed by recent low inflation readings.

Despite a recovery that is now the third-longest on record, America is trapped not in a 1970s-style, double-digit inflationary upsurge, but a slow-inflation quandary. Price growth jumped in August, driven by energy and accommodation prices, yet investors still doubt inflation will be strong enough to merit more than a couple of interest-rate rises before the end of 2018.

The uncertain outlook has confounded Fed policymakers just as the central bank prepares for a leadership overhaul in the new year. President Donald Trump, who will decide shortly on the replacement for current Fed chair Janet Yellen, has managed to be on both sides of the question   slamming low rates last year during the election but welcoming them this year.

 It is a puzzle and raises a real question what the Fed should do next; I would have thought we would have been seeing more inflation pressures by now,  says Jon Faust, a former adviser to Ms Yellen at the Fed now at Johns Hopkins University.  At a time when there is a confusing economic picture we don t know who will be judging that picture in a few months  time at the Fed. That added uncertainty is not a good thing. 

Having lifted rates twice this year in the face of this dreary inflation, the Fed is expected to keep the target range for its key rate at 1-1.25 per cent on Wednesday, even as it announces the gradual unwinding of its quantitative easing programme. Ms Yellen is likely to leave open the prospect of a further rate rise in December, as she banks on diminishing slack in the economy driving up prices amid a global growth rebound.

Yet the Fed s 2 per cent inflation target still appears out of reach   stripping out food and energy costs, it has not attained that rate for half a decade. It has been a quarter of a century since the Fed s favoured measure of inflation   personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy   last punched up above the still relatively sedate level of 3 per cent. It was just 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Wage growth, meanwhile, remains well below its pre-crisis pace at just 2.5 per cent.

In 2015 Ms Yellen set out a clear road map to higher goods and services inflation, making the traditional central bankers  argument that diminishing spare capacity would ultimately stoke up price and wage pressures. The trouble is that even as the economy grows steadily and joblessness falls to 4.4 per cent, inflation has this year undershot the levels suggested by her model.

Part of the problem is that the link between low unemployment and higher price growth embodied in the so-called Phillips curve has looked fragile for decades. Some officials suspect the Fed can afford an even stronger labour market without worrying about excessive price growth.

On one level, sluggish inflation combined with respectable growth is far from a bad thing   central bankers in the 1970s would have looked on the current paradigm with envy. But if inflation hovers too low it leaves the economy uncomfortably close to deflation and could damage the credibility of an institution that is meant to target 2 per cent inflation. Low rates and low inflation leave little rate-cutting firepower when the next downturn strikes.

Fed chair: two hawkish contenders

Kevin Warsh

A former Fed governor currently at Stanford, he has called for reform of the central bank and has endorsed Donald Trump s goal of a 3% growth rate.

John Taylor

Also a Stanford economist who served in the George W Bush administration, he co-wrote a paper with Mr Warsh on the 3% growth target.

...

Weak inflation may also prompt the central bank to leave policy so loose that it inadvertently stokes up a cycle of boom and bust   something the Fed has repeatedly been accused of doing in recent decades. That worry has reasserted itself thanks to soaring asset valuations.  The risk is that you are going to end up with interest rates that are too low relative to what is consistent with financial and macroeconomic stability,  says Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements.  If inflation doesn t show up, it will be hard to move interest rates up at the right speed to address this issue. 

A five-month-long string of weak figures this year has prompted some Fed policymakers, including Bill Dudley of the New York Fed and Rob Kaplan of the Dallas Fed, to start asking searching questions. Are globalisation and technological advances restraining inflation at a time when a cyclical pick-up might otherwise drive it higher?

 These two forces are colliding,  Mr Kaplan told the Financial Times last month.  The cyclical forces we have understood historically; the structural forces are somewhat new, particularly technology-enabled disruption. 

Some policymakers cite the increased ease with which shoppers can compare prices on the internet and the impact these changes have on brand loyalty and pricing power. Amazon is entering grocery retail via Whole Foods, while the hotel sector is being overturned by Airbnb. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock, sees more price disruption to come, as artificial intelligence promises to further transform some industries.

Research from Adobe Analytics shows what online competition is doing in some fields. Online prices of furniture and bedding are down 8.3 per cent over the past two years, whereas the equivalent category in the consumer price index, which includes offline sales, has dropped less than half that amount. Sporting goods prices online are down 10 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in the CPI. Online clothing prices are down 6.5 per cent in the same period, compared with a 4.1 per cent offline drop.

Goods price deflation is not new in the US, and Pete Klenow of Stanford University says comparisons between online and offline prices baskets can be tricky because of their different constructions. While some Fed officials argue that technology is eroding companies  ability to lift prices, Goldman Sachs analysts recently found an increase in corporate pricing power over the past 20 years, consistent with a rise in profit margins and industry concentration.

Goldman economists also question arguments that ecommerce, which accounts for around 8 per cent of retail sales   is having an appreciable impact on broader inflation. The effects of online competition on traditional retailers  pricing may be no larger than those seen during the rise of  big box  superstore chains like Walmart.

Other analysts have been looking closely at the labour market, linking paltry wage growth to the soggy inflation readings. Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations, says higher job insecurity and lower labour force mobility in the US may be stifling calls for higher wages.  Workers and producers are unsure that the market is actually going to be robust enough to support higher wage and price demands. 

While goods price inflation has been negative for much of the post-crisis period, Ms Mann highlights a weakening in services price inflation from 3 per cent before the crisis to closer to 2 per cent now. She is examining the growing role of services jobs held disproportionately by women who are paid less than men.  It is really tough to get inflation up if wages are not rising,  she says.

At the Fed, some officials struggle to see why big structural factors would have intervened to crush inflation numbers. Instead, the Fed has suggested this year s dull outcomes are being driven by a series of coincidental, one-off drags, including a fall in wireless data prices.

If they are right, the jump in inflation last month could herald further gains   with an extra lift potentially from the recent dollar depreciation. Yet Fed rate-setters are split over the outlook, and market confidence in Fed forecasts has ebbed. Charles Plosser, a former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, says:  I do think economists need to work harder on understanding the inflation process. 

The shortfalls are by no means confined to the US. In the euro area, a sharp drop in unemployment across the region is yet to be matched by a strong pick-up in wages   without which officials fear inflation will fail to hit its goal of just under 2 per cent.

Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said this year that  backward-looking  negotiation of nominal wages that reference low inflation rates may be restraining prices. Many of the new jobs are also in temporary or part-time employment, which may slow the growth of nominal wages as well. At the Bank of Japan, meanwhile, officials  struggles with achieving inflation targets are well documented.

In the US, whose monetary policy has global reach, questions about inflation are compounded by the uncertainty over who will call the shots from February. Mr Trump will have the opportunity to appoint up to five new Fed board members by next year, but attempting to predict his choices seems futile given the capricious nature of his personnel decisions.

Some analysts argue that the central bank could end up drifting in a hawkish direction   which would worry economists with a firm eye on low inflation. Mr Trump may not reappoint Ms Yellen, who inhabits the dovish end of the policy spectrum. A number of the alternative candidates for chair have shown signs of more hawkish leanings   among them the Stanford academics Kevin Warsh and John Taylor.

On the other hand, Mr Trump has called himself a  low-rates person  and there are precedents for presidents leaning on Fed leadership to keep policy loose   even when inflation threatens to start to pick up. Richard Nixon pressured Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the early 1970s, for example. While an inflationary upsurge may currently seem unlikely, economists have such a thin grasp on what drives inflation that it is far from impossible   as observers including Mr Paul continue to warn.

If inflation fails to reassert itself, the Fed and other central banks will find it harder to balance the need for low rates against the hazardous side-effects loose policy engenders in markets. Mr Faust says:  If the central bank keeps pushing it can make inflation go up   but the question is whether some other excess bubbles up first. 

The low-inflation enigma looks set to continue bedevilling policy not only in the US but across the world.

Brexit effect: Pound s depreciation feeds into rising prices

Unlike the US, the UK is witnessing a burst of inflation that is causing a dilemma for the Bank of England. But the reasons have little to do with low interest rates and quantitative easing and much more to do with Brexit.

Inflation in the UK, like that in the US and across the eurozone, had been firmly stuck below the BoE s 2 per cent target until the British public voted to leave the EU in June 2016; inflation hit a low of -0.1 per cent in September 2015. But the depreciation of the pound since the vote last year has pushed up the price of imported products, which has fed through into consumer prices. The trade-weighted sterling exchange rate has fallen by 11 per cent since the referendum and had dropped by as much as 16 per cent at its lowest point in mid-October last year.

This helped push inflation to a five-year high of 2.9 per cent in August, with many analysts predicting it will continue to move higher over the next few months and peak somewhere at or above 3 per cent towards the end of the year.

Many businesses had taken out currency hedges to cushion the impact of a fall in the value of sterling last year. But most of these hedges were for no more than 12 months, meaning the fall in the pound has gradually been felt by companies in the cost of imported goods and passed on to consumers. A pick-up in oil and other commodity prices has also boosted inflation.

But there is little sign that the depreciation-driven inflation is leading to any pick-up in domestically generated price rises.

Wage growth has remained subdued and the rate of growth of prices for services has not accelerated over the past year. And with sterling rising in recent weeks, some of the inflationary pressure from the currency could also dissipate.

Index provider dismisses self-indexing and is staying in London despite Brexit

Tad Hunter topped the US music charts with " Young Love " when the S&P 500 index was launched on March 4 1957. That tune faded into obscurity over the following six decades while the S&P 500 developed into the primary US stock market index and the world's most widely followed financial benchmark.

Around $8.7tn in assets are now benchmarked against the S&P 500 via index-tracking mutual funds, derivatives and structured products.

"The S&P 500 trades in every sphere. This provides a model that other countries, such as Brazil, South Korea and India, can follow to build thriving capital markets and promote economic growth," says Alex Matturri, the chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices.

The business led by the New Jersey-born Mr Matturri is surfing a wave of new business flooding into low-cost index-tracking funds from investors who have become disenchanted with the high fees and poor performance of traditional actively managed products that aim to beat the market.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is the largest provider of benchmarks to the exchange traded fund industry, which is on course for a fourth consecutive year of record-breaking growth in 2017. ETF assets tied to S&P Dow Jones Indices passed the $1tn milestone this year and account for the fastest growth within the division's revenues. Although ETFs carry low fees, they can be highly profitable. S&P Dow Jones Indices earned operating profits of $412m in 2016 from revenues of $639m. This translates into a profit margin of 64 per cent, far higher than most asset managers.

"Indexing is a scale business, similar to other intellectual property businesses. Those pennies from ETF fees add up," says the 58-year-old.

ETF managers, however, are fighting a cut-throat price war to win new business and are desperate to save money. Some, including BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, are threatening to "self-index" by creating in-house indices that could replace the benchmarks offered by commercial providers.

Mr Matturri believes self-indexing is a misleading solution, as asset managers would never use a rival's benchmark to create an ETF. This could constrain growth across the ETF industry instead of fostering the competition that has driven down fees and attracted investor inflows.

"Index licensing fees are really only a small part of the overall cost of an ETF. There are 90 different index providers, so there are plenty of choices if anyone thinks our fees are too high. But some index brands really can't be substituted," says the father of two grown-up children.

He is also adamant that self-indexing would create unmanageable conflicts of interest for asset managers, which would be involved in the trading and pricing of the assets held by ETFs that they sell to investors.

"The best way to avoid conflicts of interest is to ensure that the indexing business is not part of the same shop, and not just separated by invisible Chinese walls or located on a different floor in the same building. Our only goal is to make sure that an index does what it is supposed to do," he says, adding that S&P Dow Jones Indices does not sell investment products.

The largest indexing providers, S&P Dow Jones Indices and its two main rivals, MSCI and FTSE Russell, were largely unregulated before the Libor scandal forced regulators to re-examine the critical role benchmarks play in financial markets.

Rules that will introduce a common framework and consistent approach to benchmark regulation across the EU are due to come into force at the start of 2018.

"The major index providers will be ready, but the lack of knowledge among some of the smaller players of the impact of the European regulations is quite astonishing. There could be some rude awakenings," says Mr Matturri.

The UK's decision to leave the EU has led to some head-scratching as the European headquarters of S&P Dow Jones Indices is located in London and pre-Brexit the UK's Financial Conduct Authority would most likely have acted as its main regulator outside the US. So a European regulator must be found to ensure S&P Dow Jones Indices can continue to passport its indices across Europe.

"We are currently in discussions with a number of regulators to determine which functions need to be run locally. We are not planning on moving any of the commercial functions from London , but a few compliance and operational staff will have to be located in Europe," says Mr Matturri.

A keen student of military history, Mr Matturri has made no secret of his strategic ambition to expand his company's presence in fixed-income markets. This led to the creation in 2015 of an index based on the bonds issued by companies in the S&P 500. Ivy Investments, an arm of Wadell & Reed, the Kansas-based asset manager has launched a mutual fund based on this benchmark.

Mr Matturri hopes that futures and options trading based on the S&P 500 bond index will, in time, be developed to match the huge volume of derivatives dealing linked to the parent S&P 500 equity index.

A plan to acquire the bond indexing business of Barclays was thwarted by the technical and legal challenges of extracting those operations cleanly from the UK bank, but other deals have followed. Barclays' indexing business was acquired by Bloomberg for about 520m.

Last year, S&P Dow Jones Indices bought Trucost, a provider of environmental data and risk analytics. The deal reflects investor appetite for a better understanding of the risks that climate change poses to investors' portfolios.

Determined to ensure that investors retain as much choice as possible, Mr Matturri says the company plans to further expand its range of ESG offerings across its family of indices.

"Trucost has helped to beefed up our ESG capabilities. The skillset required of companies managing indices has become more complex as markets have evolved. That is likely to continue over the next 60 years," says Mr Matturri.

Nobody seems to know why there s no US inflation

Ron Paul, at least, has no regrets. The former Texas Congressman is one of the most prominent voices among those Americans who have long been deeply suspicious of the US central bank and its power to print money. When he ran for president in 2012, he assailed then Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke for debasing the currency and risking an inflationary upsurge by pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.

 We don t have prices in the consumer market going up like in the 1970s but we should not be surprised if that happens,  says Mr Paul, who once brandished a silver coin as he lectured the former Fed chair on Capitol Hill.

Elsewhere, certainty is harder to come by. As the Fed meets in Washington tomorrow, US central bankers, and their counterparts across the world, are genuinely flummoxed by recent low inflation readings.

Despite a recovery that is now the third-longest on record, America is trapped not in a 1970s-style, double-digit inflationary upsurge, but a slow-inflation quandary. Price growth jumped in August, driven by energy and accommodation prices, yet investors still doubt inflation will be strong enough to merit more than a couple of interest-rate rises before the end of 2018.

The uncertain outlook has confounded Fed policymakers just as the central bank prepares for a leadership overhaul in the new year. President Donald Trump, who will decide shortly on the replacement for current Fed chair Janet Yellen, has managed to be on both sides of the question   slamming low rates last year during the election but welcoming them this year.

 It is a puzzle and raises a real question what the Fed should do next; I would have thought we would have been seeing more inflation pressures by now,  says Jon Faust, a former adviser to Ms Yellen at the Fed now at Johns Hopkins University.  At a time when there is a confusing economic picture we don t know who will be judging that picture in a few months  time at the Fed. That added uncertainty is not a good thing. 

Having lifted rates twice this year in the face of this dreary inflation, the Fed is expected to keep the target range for its key rate at 1-1.25 per cent on Wednesday, even as it announces the gradual unwinding of its quantitative easing programme. Ms Yellen is likely to leave open the prospect of a further rate rise in December, as she banks on diminishing slack in the economy driving up prices amid a global growth rebound.

Yet the Fed s 2 per cent inflation target still appears out of reach   stripping out food and energy costs, it has not attained that rate for half a decade. It has been a quarter of a century since the Fed s favoured measure of inflation   personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy   last punched up above the still relatively sedate level of 3 per cent. It was just 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Wage growth, meanwhile, remains well below its pre-crisis pace at just 2.5 per cent.

In 2015 Ms Yellen set out a clear road map to higher goods and services inflation, making the traditional central bankers  argument that diminishing spare capacity would ultimately stoke up price and wage pressures. The trouble is that even as the economy grows steadily and joblessness falls to 4.4 per cent, inflation has this year undershot the levels suggested by her model.

Part of the problem is that the link between low unemployment and higher price growth embodied in the so-called Phillips curve has looked fragile for decades. Some officials suspect the Fed can afford an even stronger labour market without worrying about excessive price growth.

On one level, sluggish inflation combined with respectable growth is far from a bad thing   central bankers in the 1970s would have looked on the current paradigm with envy. But if inflation hovers too low it leaves the economy uncomfortably close to deflation and could damage the credibility of an institution that is meant to target 2 per cent inflation. Low rates and low inflation leave little rate-cutting firepower when the next downturn strikes.

Fed chair: two hawkish contenders

Kevin Warsh

A former Fed governor currently at Stanford, he has called for reform of the central bank and has endorsed Donald Trump s goal of a 3% growth rate.

John Taylor

Also a Stanford economist who served in the George W Bush administration, he co-wrote a paper with Mr Warsh on the 3% growth target.

...

Weak inflation may also prompt the central bank to leave policy so loose that it inadvertently stokes up a cycle of boom and bust   something the Fed has repeatedly been accused of doing in recent decades. That worry has reasserted itself thanks to soaring asset valuations.  The risk is that you are going to end up with interest rates that are too low relative to what is consistent with financial and macroeconomic stability,  says Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements.  If inflation doesn t show up, it will be hard to move interest rates up at the right speed to address this issue. 

A five-month-long string of weak figures this year has prompted some Fed policymakers, including Bill Dudley of the New York Fed and Rob Kaplan of the Dallas Fed, to start asking searching questions. Are globalisation and technological advances restraining inflation at a time when a cyclical pick-up might otherwise drive it higher?

 These two forces are colliding,  Mr Kaplan told the Financial Times last month.  The cyclical forces we have understood historically; the structural forces are somewhat new, particularly technology-enabled disruption. 

Some policymakers cite the increased ease with which shoppers can compare prices on the internet and the impact these changes have on brand loyalty and pricing power. Amazon is entering grocery retail via Whole Foods, while the hotel sector is being overturned by Airbnb. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock, sees more price disruption to come, as artificial intelligence promises to further transform some industries.

Research from Adobe Analytics shows what online competition is doing in some fields. Online prices of furniture and bedding are down 8.3 per cent over the past two years, whereas the equivalent category in the consumer price index, which includes offline sales, has dropped less than half that amount. Sporting goods prices online are down 10 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in the CPI. Online clothing prices are down 6.5 per cent in the same period, compared with a 4.1 per cent offline drop.

Goods price deflation is not new in the US, and Pete Klenow of Stanford University says comparisons between online and offline prices baskets can be tricky because of their different constructions. While some Fed officials argue that technology is eroding companies  ability to lift prices, Goldman Sachs analysts recently found an increase in corporate pricing power over the past 20 years, consistent with a rise in profit margins and industry concentration.

Goldman economists also question arguments that ecommerce, which accounts for around 8 per cent of retail sales   is having an appreciable impact on broader inflation. The effects of online competition on traditional retailers  pricing may be no larger than those seen during the rise of  big box  superstore chains like Walmart.

Other analysts have been looking closely at the labour market, linking paltry wage growth to the soggy inflation readings. Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations, says higher job insecurity and lower labour force mobility in the US may be stifling calls for higher wages.  Workers and producers are unsure that the market is actually going to be robust enough to support higher wage and price demands. 

While goods price inflation has been negative for much of the post-crisis period, Ms Mann highlights a weakening in services price inflation from 3 per cent before the crisis to closer to 2 per cent now. She is examining the growing role of services jobs held disproportionately by women who are paid less than men.  It is really tough to get inflation up if wages are not rising,  she says.

At the Fed, some officials struggle to see why big structural factors would have intervened to crush inflation numbers. Instead, the Fed has suggested this year s dull outcomes are being driven by a series of coincidental, one-off drags, including a fall in wireless data prices.

If they are right, the jump in inflation last month could herald further gains   with an extra lift potentially from the recent dollar depreciation. Yet Fed rate-setters are split over the outlook, and market confidence in Fed forecasts has ebbed. Charles Plosser, a former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, says:  I do think economists need to work harder on understanding the inflation process. 

The shortfalls are by no means confined to the US. In the euro area, a sharp drop in unemployment across the region is yet to be matched by a strong pick-up in wages   without which officials fear inflation will fail to hit its goal of just under 2 per cent.

Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said this year that  backward-looking  negotiation of nominal wages that reference low inflation rates may be restraining prices. Many of the new jobs are also in temporary or part-time employment, which may slow the growth of nominal wages as well. At the Bank of Japan, meanwhile, officials  struggles with achieving inflation targets are well documented.

In the US, whose monetary policy has global reach, questions about inflation are compounded by the uncertainty over who will call the shots from February. Mr Trump will have the opportunity to appoint up to five new Fed board members by next year, but attempting to predict his choices seems futile given the capricious nature of his personnel decisions.

Some analysts argue that the central bank could end up drifting in a hawkish direction   which would worry economists with a firm eye on low inflation. Mr Trump may not reappoint Ms Yellen, who inhabits the dovish end of the policy spectrum. A number of the alternative candidates for chair have shown signs of more hawkish leanings   among them the Stanford academics Kevin Warsh and John Taylor.

On the other hand, Mr Trump has called himself a  low-rates person  and there are precedents for presidents leaning on Fed leadership to keep policy loose   even when inflation threatens to start to pick up. Richard Nixon pressured Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the early 1970s, for example. While an inflationary upsurge may currently seem unlikely, economists have such a thin grasp on what drives inflation that it is far from impossible   as observers including Mr Paul continue to warn.

If inflation fails to reassert itself, the Fed and other central banks will find it harder to balance the need for low rates against the hazardous side-effects loose policy engenders in markets. Mr Faust says:  If the central bank keeps pushing it can make inflation go up   but the question is whether some other excess bubbles up first. 

The low-inflation enigma looks set to continue bedevilling policy not only in the US but across the world.

Brexit effect: Pound s depreciation feeds into rising prices

Unlike the US, the UK is witnessing a burst of inflation that is causing a dilemma for the Bank of England. But the reasons have little to do with low interest rates and quantitative easing and much more to do with Brexit.

Inflation in the UK, like that in the US and across the eurozone, had been firmly stuck below the BoE s 2 per cent target until the British public voted to leave the EU in June 2016; inflation hit a low of -0.1 per cent in September 2015. But the depreciation of the pound since the vote last year has pushed up the price of imported products, which has fed through into consumer prices. The trade-weighted sterling exchange rate has fallen by 11 per cent since the referendum and had dropped by as much as 16 per cent at its lowest point in mid-October last year.

This helped push inflation to a five-year high of 2.9 per cent in August, with many analysts predicting it will continue to move higher over the next few months and peak somewhere at or above 3 per cent towards the end of the year.

Many businesses had taken out currency hedges to cushion the impact of a fall in the value of sterling last year. But most of these hedges were for no more than 12 months, meaning the fall in the pound has gradually been felt by companies in the cost of imported goods and passed on to consumers. A pick-up in oil and other commodity prices has also boosted inflation.

But there is little sign that the depreciation-driven inflation is leading to any pick-up in domestically generated price rises.

Wage growth has remained subdued and the rate of growth of prices for services has not accelerated over the past year. And with sterling rising in recent weeks, some of the inflationary pressure from the currency could also dissipate.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
'Robots will widen pension savings gap'

The UK's retirement savings gap would widen to 2.3tn if Bank of England forecasts of the number of human jobs that could be lost to robots come to pass, research has found.

Hymans Robertson, the pension consultants, issued the warning based on the Bank's estimates that a third of UK jobs were at high risk of automation by 2030.

The pensions savings gap occurs when the amount of money set aside by workers today is not enough to generate at least two-thirds of pre-retirement income. It was estimated at 328bn ( 365bn) this year by the International Longevity Centre, a UK think tank.

Hymans said if more people were squeezed out of jobs by robots or artificial intelligence then the retirement savings crisis was set to worsen.

"If one in three jobs are at risk of automation by 2030, as estimated, then this would mean retirement shortfalls increase to 2.3tn, or one year's current UK economic output," Hymans said.

"The income shortfall of those at working age, relative to the living wage, would be another 1.25tn."

If there was as much employment uncertainty in the long term as many predict, Hymans said, debates around the state pension age could "become irrelevant" - particularly if many jobs were fully automated or significantly computerised and the growth in new jobs failed to keep pace, warned Hymans.

Since the Bank made its forecast in 2015 about the number of jobs that could be lost to robots, concerns about the impact of automation on the workforce have climbed up the policy agenda.

Last week, the Trades Union Congress, an umbrella organisation for UK trade unions, said the economic gains from the spread of robots in the workforce should be used to reverse planned rises in the state pension age for millions aged in their forties.

PwC, the professional services group, has suggested that the increased use of artificial intelligence could provide a 10 per cent boost to GDP, through lower costs and increased productivity for employers.

Trump blocks chipmaker's $1.3bn sale to China-backed buyers on security grounds; Semiconductors

Donald Trump has blocked the $1.3bn acquisition of a US semiconductor company by investors including a state-backed Chinese investment fund, rejecting an appeal to overturn a government review that found the deal posed a threat to US national security.

The move marked only the fourth time that a president had blocked a corporate acquisition on national security grounds and the first known time Mr Trump had intervened to block a deal.

It came at a time of growing scrutiny of Chinese investments in the US and Europe and calls for Washington to toughen its rules governing foreign investment, while Beijing has been pushing to acquire new technologies.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, found that Lattice Semiconductor's acquisition by a group of investors including the China Venture Capital Fund posed a threat to US national security - but in a regulatory filing earlier this month, the publicly traded chipmaker said it was appealing to Mr Trump to overturn the ruling.

The White House said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had decided to follow the committee's recommendation. It cited Beijing's support for the acquisition, the potential transfer of intellectual property to China via the acquisition of Lattice and "the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity" to the US. Some of the company's products were also used by the US government, the White House said.

"Cfius and the president assess that the transaction poses a risk to the national security of the United States that cannot be resolved through mitigation," the White House added.

Lattice later released a statement announcing the termination of its acquisition by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners. "The transaction with Canyon Bridge was in the best interests of our shareholders, our customers, our employees and the United States," said Darin Billerbeck , chief executive.

The company, based in Portland, Oregon, specialises in programmable silicon chips, which makes them well suited for complex tasks such as deep learning. Other US companies that make this type of chip include Xilinx. Patrick Moorhead, chips analyst at Moor Insights, said programmable silicon chips were often incorporated in weapons and defence systems. "I think it's as simple as, there is Lattice silicon inside of military systems that the US government doesn't want to get in the hands of another country," he said.

Although Lattice does not currently sell equipment to the US military, it has done so in the past and the military often stockpiles chips that are incorporated into its designs. "Cruise missiles have chips in them that are 20 years old," Mr Moorhead said.

In the regulatory filing laying out its appeal to Mr Trump, Lattice had said that both it and its group of buyers had promised "substantial mitigation measures", adding: "Lattice remains of the view that the proposed transaction does not raise any national security concerns that cannot be addressed by the comprehensive mitigation measures that Lattice and [the acquirers] have proposed to implement."

The decision highlighted US sensitivity about Chinese investments and Beijing's interest in the US semiconductor sector, Cfius experts said. In December, Barack Obama became the third president to block a deal on national security grounds when he rejected the acquisition of semiconductor equipment maker Aixtron by Chinese buyers.

Cfius is facing calls for reform. John Cornyn, a Republican Senator for Texas, has been working on a bill that would establish a list of countries of special concern and subject minority investment in US companies and joint ventures to greater scrutiny.

Mr Cornyn has made clear the changes are aimed at concerns over China's push to gain an economic advantage by acquiring US and other technology companies. In a speech in June, he accused China of seeking to "weaponise" investments in US companies.

Toys  R' Us Inc. could file for bankruptcy as soon as the next few weeks, as nervous suppliers have tightened terms for the retailer ahead of the crucial holiday selling season, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company, like many other big box chains, has struggled as shopping shifts online, pushing down prices and reducing store visits. In addition to shrinking sales and heightened competition, Toys  R' Us has been burdened with debt from a leveraged buyout 12 years ago.

The retailer has been in talks with holders of more than $5 billion in debt to extend 2018 maturities and stave off a chapter 11 filing. Still, the company and its restructuring advisers are considering filing for chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Va., the people said.

The potential filing would be propelled by the toy chain's suppliers tightening trade terms, including holding back on shipments unless Toys  R' Us is able to make cash payments on delivery, the people added.

While Toys  R' Us already has received a majority of its holiday shipments, it is still without a portion of the goods and could soon be cut off from receiving any fresh inventory, these people said.

More than most retailers, Toy  R' Us depends on the holiday season to recoup losses and drive sales. Last fiscal year, the holiday quarter accounted for about 40% of its $11.5 billion in revenue.

The company hired restructuring law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP to guide its refinancing discussions. In addition, the company has hired financial adviser Alvarez & Marsal, the people said. Toys "R" Us has publicly said it has been working with Lazard as its investment banker.

A Toys 'R' Us spokeswoman declined to comment. Last week, company said it planned to update investors on its refinancing activities and other plans during a second-quarter earnings call scheduled for Sept. 26.

An Alvarez & Marsal official declined to comment, while a Kirkland & Ellis spokeswoman had no immediate comment.

A Toys  R' Us restructuring would add to a list of more than 20 retailers, including RadioShack and Payless Shoe Source, that have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2017. Another big box chain, Staples Inc., recently agreed to be taken private in a leveraged buyout.

Industrywide, toy sales have been strong in recent years, though much of the growth is shifting to online sellers like Amazon.com Inc. and discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Amazon's toy sales were up 24% last year, compared with 5% for the overall market and five years of declines for Toys "R" Us, according to analytics firm One Click Retail.

Toys  R' Us has also struggled with increasing competition for its Babies  R' Us business, as sales of strollers, cribs and diapers are moving online. About 650 of the company's 1,700 stores include its Babies  R' Us concept.

Retailers have been going after parents online, where Toys  R' Us "http://www.wsj.com/articles/5-billion-reasons-toys-r-us-struggles-as-amazon-soars-1500283802". It is only now updating it dated technology platform so that it can accommodate must-have offers such as subscription systems. It also plans to improve its baby registry and loyalty program.

Some large toy brands, such as Lego and Star Wars, have also struggled recently, while the collectible Shopkins toys, which Toys  R' Us helped launch, is on the downswing. Earlier this month, Lego AS"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lego-to-slash-1-400-jobs-posts-first-sales-drop-in-13-years-1504599603" and said it would cut 8% of its workforce. Another toy maker, Mattel Inc., "http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ceo-at-mattel-has-first-big-test-what-to-do-with-the-dividend-1497432609"after a slide in holiday sales.

In recent weeks Toys  R' Us's advisers have been hunting for a bankruptcy loan which would help fund operations while under chapter 11 protection, the people said.

Toys  R' Us was loaded up with debt when private-equity firms Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout before the financial crisis. The owners had been hoping to prepare the company for an initial public offering, but its weak financial performance made such a move unlikely. A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment, while Bain and Vornado didn't immediately respond to comment.

Toys 'R' Us was loaded up with debt when private-equity firms Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout before the financial crisis. The owners had been hoping to prepare the company for an initial public offering, but its weak financial performance made such a move unlikely. A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment, while Bain and Vornado didn't immediately respond to comment.

SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. has created a $300 million fund targeting new investments for automotive software and technology, the latest sign of the world's largest smartphone maker's desire to diversify beyond traditional electronics.

Samsung said Thursday that it had secured the first investment from the automotive-innovation fund, spending 75 million euros ($89 million) to create a strategic partnership with TTTech, a company that specializes in safeguarding the real-time computer systems used in connected cars. Audi AG is also a major investor in the Austria-based TTTech.

The South Korean technology giant has identified the automotive sector as a critical area for growth, as cars are increasingly outfitted with multimedia platforms and high-tech software -- a potential windfall for Samsung's displays and semiconductor businesses.

Samsung has been accelerating investments and other efforts into the automotive space over the past year, following last year's announcement of an $8 billion deal to buy U.S. auto-parts supplier Harman International Industries Inc. Since then, Samsung has won regulatory approval in South Korea and California to test cars using its self-driving technology on public roads.

Like many of its Silicon Valley peers, Samsung doesn't plan to manufacture its own vehicles but sees vast potential to create autonomous-driving software it could one day sell to traditional car makers. Samsung's tests in South Korea install its deep-learning algorithms and other software onto a vehicle made by Hyundai Motor Co.

The $300 million investment, called the Samsung Automotive Innovation Fund, will target bets on smart sensors, machine vision and artificial intelligence that get used by connected cars, the company said. The firm is "excited to play a leadership role in supporting and shaping the future of smarter, more connected vehicles," said Young Sohn, a chief strategy officer at Samsung Electronics, in a statement.

The fund also serves as a statement that Samsung plans to continue making new investments following last month's conviction of the company's de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong. A Seoul court sentenced Mr. Lee, the company's vice chairman and the Samsung heir, to five years in prison for bribing South Korea's former president. Mr. Lee's lawyers have filed an appeal contesting the court verdict.

Three days after Mr. Lee's conviction, Samsung announced a fresh $2.3 billion investment in semiconductors. Chips and auto technology are areas Mr. Lee has signed off on as pillars for Samsung's direction.

Beyond Harman, Samsung has other auto-tech bets on several startups that focus on automated driving, sensors or high-performance computing.

Equifax, the US credit-reporting group at the centre of a huge data breach, has said that it was hacked via a weakness widely discussed in cyber security circles six months ago. The admission is likely to amplifycriticism of its lax defences.

The Atlanta-based company said last week that hackers broke into its vaults in mid-May to steal names, social security numbers, dates of birth and other identifying information for 143m Americans, along with more than 200,000 sets of credit card numbers.

Since then, shares in the company have fallen about 30 per cent amid calls for hearings on the affair in both chambers of Congress, state-level investigations and a flurry of private lawsuits.

Late on Wednesday, in an "https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/" posted to its website, Equifax said that the criminals had exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts, which is a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language.

But Oege de Moor, chief executive and founder of Semmle, a software analytics provider based in San Francisco, noted that the weakness   known by the code CVE-2017-5638   had been "https://struts.apache.org/announce.html#a20170707" by the Struts project in March, along with  clear and simple  instructions on how to "https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-045".

 The fact that Equifax [was] attacked in May means that [it] did not follow that advice,  he said.  Had they done so, this breach would not have occurred. 

Equifax could not be reached for comment.

The disclosure is likely to heighten pressure on the company and Richard F Smith, its chief executive, who last week said that Equifax did not realise it had been breached until late July.

Earlier on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of US senators called for sweeping federal investigations of Equifax over stock sales by company executives  within days  of the discovery of the raid.

In a joint letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the 36 senators   led by Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana   called published reports of such stock sales  disturbing  and urged a probe of potential violations of insider trading laws.

The lawmakers also asked for regulators  findings on  whether Equifax management employed reasonable measures to ensure the security of the now compromised data .

 We request that you spare no effort in your investigations and in enforcing the law to the fullest extent against anyone who is found to be at fault,  they wrote.

Mr de Moor of Semmle said that his group had disclosed a new Struts vulnerability (CVE-2017-9805) to the cyber security community last week, jointly with the Struts developers. Many companies reacted promptly, he said, singling out Cisco, the networking group, which put out a "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170907-struts2#vuln_prods" of the products that were affected by the vulnerability within 48 hours.

 Forward-looking companies, which have the right procedures in place 	. 	. 	. 	reacted to the disclosure by taking remedial action,  he said.

CFPB Gives Boost to New Ways of Vetting Customers for Credit; Regulator says lender can use data such as employment, bill payment histories when vetting customers

WASHINGTON The government gave a boost Thursday to lenders that are using data such as employment and bill payment histories when vetting customers for loans and other credit products, saying it won't try to stop the use of such data by an online lender.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it told Upstart Network Inc., an online lender started by former Google Inc. employees, it won't interfere with the firm's underwriting model for consumer loans.

More online lenders are starting to use "alternative data," such as cellphone payment records and employment status, to determine who should get credit and how much to charge for loans, a move that could reduce reliance on traditional credit reports issued by Equifax Inc. and others.

The CFPB's decision could spur further development of new underwriting methods at a time when the credit reporting industry is under scrutiny following the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-trade-commission-investigating-equifax-data-breach-1505400125" at Equifax.

Upstart, the San Carlos, Calif.-based online lender incorporates alternative data such as borrowers' educational background, job history and field of employment, in addition to traditional variables such as credit scores and income, when approving loans. Other online lenders that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-gives-fico-low-score-1452556468" in their lending decisions include Affirm Inc. and Avant Inc.

Aside from data security concerns, experts say traditional credit reports don't always capture borrowers' repayment ability, leading to millions of people not getting loans because they have a limited credit history.

The CFPB in February launched an inquiry into the use of alternative data sources by lenders. A CFPB spokesman declined to say if other companies have requested feedback on their practices, but said the bureau continues to hear from companies asking what it thinks about such practices. The CFPB spokesman said the timing of the guidance was unrelated to the Equifax data breach.

Lenders and regulators believe credit access for some customers could improve with the use of alternative data, which could also include rent and utility payment records. The use of such data, however, also raises concern about lending discrimination based on personal traits.

The CFPB was responding to Upstart's request for clarification regarding the application of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which bars banks and other lenders from discriminating against applicants based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status and age.

Upstart CEO Dave Girouard said in an interview that the idea of using alternative data, artificial intelligence and machine learning in lending requires the navigation of tricky issues. "There's an enormous opportunity to improve accuracy of credit models, but it could run afoul of fair-lending laws," he said.

Under the terms of the CFPB's guidance, Upstart agreed on a way to measure unintentional discrimination that may result from its loan program and to provide the bureau with regular compliance data. It also agreed to report information to them regarding how its machine-learning model is evolving over time "to given them a constant pulse as to whether there's anything in [our model] that will be of concern," Mr. Girouard said.

According to the CFPB's 2015 analysis of the top nationwide credit reporting companies, 26 million Americans have no credit history, a status known as credit invisibility. Another 19 million people have "thin files," meaning their credit histories are too limited or have been inactive for too long to generate a credit score.

Credit invisibility is most likely to affect minorities and people with lower incomes. About 15% of African-American and Hispanic consumers are credit invisible compared with 9% of white consumers, according to the CFPB.

Slow Going So Far at Clayton's SEC

When Jay Clayton became Securities and Exchange Commission chairman in May, the job came with the luxury of picking the agency's focus, something none of his recent predecessors had.

Speaking in July, Mr. Clayton said he had "inherited an agency with considerably more discretion over its agenda." That's because there are now fewer regulations to finish under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, thanks to the work of SEC chiefs who preceded him. The SEC might even be able to put the remaining Dodd-Frank requirements on the back burner, reflecting White House and congressional antipathy for the law.

So it's a bit surprising that his SEC is moving slowly so far. Mr. Clayton was sworn in May 4. It's been 133 days since then, and the commission has yet to vote on a proposed or final regulation. By comparison, the commission took 21 days to approve its first proposed rule after Mary Jo White, Mr. Clayton's immediate predecessor, took over in 2013.

Going back to the start of the 21st century, only former Chairman Christopher Cox took as many as 50 days to obtain a commission vote on his first proposed or final rule. Like Mr. Clayton, Mr. Cox was appointed by a Republican president who favored less regulation of financial markets. But under two previous Republican SEC chairmen, William Donaldson and Harvey Pitt, the SEC issued a proposed or final rule within a month of taking over.

It's fair to observe that Mr. Clayton isn't rushing into new rules because he wants to make it easier, not more cumbersome, for companies to raise capital. He also doesn't seem to face any pressing demand by Republican congressional leaders or the White House to move faster. But under the laws that govern how regulatory agencies function, loosening requirements usually requires a commission vote. Even deregulation takes time.

An SEC spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Clayton has also moved slowly to fill out the commission's senior staff. He still hasn't named permanent directors for two divisions that Wall Street watches closely Trading and Markets, which oversees exchanges, and the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations, which inspects regulated financial firms. His top choice to run Trading and Markets dropped out of consideration after he had been under review for several months.

The SEC chief could be waiting for two new commissioners to join before he gets started in earnest with regulatory changes. The White House has picked Republican Hester Peirce and Democrat Robert Jackson to fill the vacancies. While both Ms. Peirce and Mr. Jackson are likely to be confirmed, the Senate could take weeks, if not longer, to do so.

Mr. Clayton has proceeded cautiously to build and execute an agenda of his own. But the clock is ticking: If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, the SEC's chief is likely to step down. The agency also tends to do less around the time of congressional elections, which are coming up next year. At some point soon, key stakeholders will want to see action on what Mr. Clayton has primed them to expect.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Equifax Faces Bumpy Legal Terrain as Consumer Suits Mount

By Jacob Gershman

Credit-reporting company Equifax Inc., EFX -14.63% which last week suffered a massive data breach, could face a tougher challenge in court than other corporate giants that have dealt with the legal fallout of data breaches, according to legal experts.

Unlike earlier retailer hacks, such as those suffered by Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. , the Equifax breach is bigger in scope, potentially compromising the personal information including Social Security and driver's license numbers of roughly 143 million U.S. consumers.

The legal terrain, meanwhile, has become bumpier for hacking defendants. A few years ago, consumer litigation over data breaches had trouble even getting onto the docket. But as the number of hacking cases rises, judges have been increasingly willing to let data-breach plaintiffs have their day in court.

"Five or six years ago, it was much easier to simply get lawsuits dismissed," said Amy Mushahwar, a data-privacy and security attorney at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in Washington, D.C.

Since Equifax disclosed last Thursday that hackers had gained access to some of its systems, more than 100 lawsuits have been filed in federal courts across the country, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal.

"Equifax's only job in life was to safeguard data," said Marc Dann, whose Ohio law firm and co-counsel have brought lawsuits against Equifax in at least seven states.

Finding aggrieved plaintiffs didn't take a lot of searching, Mr. Dann said. "I couldn't take out the garbage without someone asking me to represent them in this case," he said.

An Equifax spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. The company said last week that it is offering free identity-theft protection and credit-monitoring to U.S. consumers. "We pride ourselves on being a leader in managing and protecting data, and we are conducting a thorough review of our overall security operations," Equifax Chief Executive Richard Smith said last week.

Many of the Equifax lawsuits allege the company was a negligent custodian of personal data that millions rely on to establish their identity and creditworthiness.

Most of the complaints bring their claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a 1970 federal law that imposes data-security requirements on consumer-reporting firms. The FCRA gives consumers rights to access their credit and ensure their credit file is accurate. The law offers per-violation damages that could be easier to prove than actual damages, but is little tested in the area of data-breach litigation.

Until recently, courts have generally declined to hear data-breach lawsuits trying to hold a company responsible for the havoc wrought by hackers. The reason: Plaintiffs in federal court generally must allege they suffered a concrete injury and that the injury can be redressed.

But more courts are warming to the idea that even the threat of identity theft and the aggravation, distress and cost of containing the risk can cause harm.

Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the dismissal of a lawsuit against health insurer CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield over a 2015 data breach. The appellate judges disagreed with a lower court finding that the injury claims were too speculative.

CareFirst said it plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue. The company's lawyers stated in their filing that they want the justices to "guide courts in sorting out the claims of truly injured victims of data breaches from those who file class actions without being able to allege that any harm is real."

The breadth of the Equifax breach could make it harder for the credit-reporting company to either win the cases in court or settle them cheaply, say legal experts.

When credit- or debit-card information is compromised, as in data breaches at Target and Home Depot, consumers could minimize the risk of identity theft or fraud by getting new cards and enrolling in credit-monitoring services.

With Equifax, hackers gained access to servers containing customers' names, social-security numbers, birth dates and addresses. The exposure of that personal information, which consumers use to apply for credit cards or to take out loans, raises the specter of a longer-term privacy threat that could encourage plaintiffs to push further into the discovery process instead of settling early, said Craig Newman, a cybersecurity lawyer at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP.

Florida Is Short on Insurance Adjusters, and That Could Stall Recovery Efforts

By Leslie Scism and Nicole Friedman

After Irma, Florida residents are lacking in many necessities. One of the more frustrating is the paucity of insurance adjusters, which is threatening to anger policyholders and potentially delay the state's rebuilding efforts.

Many of the state's adjusters are 1,000 miles away, working on claims made after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.

Insurers are scrambling to get more adjusters to Florida, creating a bidding war for those who are available. Some Florida home insurers have increased fees paid to adjusters by about 30%, insurers and adjusters say.

Citizens Property Insurance Corp., a state-run insurer of last resort, has boosted adjuster compensation by 18% to 20% and said it expects additional increases to keep up with rivals.

While higher fees for adjusters often only modestly impact the cost of a claim, the bigger worry is that damage to buildings will worsen from mold and other problems. In addition, claims that could have been resolved amicably may end up in costly litigation as homeowners get angry waiting.

"An insurance claim isn't a bottle of wine," said Randy Maniloff, an insurance-industry defense lawyer at Williams and White LLP.

Insurance companies are vying for the nation's independent claims adjusters, who total 57,200 as of July, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Florida also says it is easing the process of appointing insurance adjusters, which may help expand the number.

"Our Department has taken steps to make the adjuster-appointment process as simple  [as]  possible for insurance companies, and our team is processing appointments at a rapid-fire pace" in an effort "to ensure that Floridians get swift handling of their post-storm claims," said a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Financial Services. In addition, many insurance companies employ adjusters full-time and a lot of those will be on the ground, among other types of adjusters who could be available.

Lee Vorcheimer, a longtime adjuster in south Florida, said that "every day for the last two weeks, there have been 10 or 15 emails" from independent-adjuster firms seeking to recruit him to travel to Texas or handle claims for local insurers. He has been offered bonuses, including money for temporary housing.

Independent insurance adjusters are paid according to the size of a claim they assess for a company. For Irma claims, they are earning from about $500 to about $30,000 for policyholder claims of $1,000 to $1 million, respectively, according to two fee schedules from private insurers reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Some adjusters can make $65,000 to $100,000 in the first month after a major hurricane, people in the industry say.

"When you have a hurricane like Harvey and a hurricane like Irma, everybody loves you," said Mr. Vorcheimer, who settled on adjusting Irma claims for Tampa-based HCI Group Inc., in part because he likes their technology.

This week, Mr. Vorcheimer began inspections as early as 7:30 a.m., looking at up to 15 properties a day. In Broward County on Monday, he found trees on roofs, missing shingles, rain damage, and blown-over pool screens and fences. Damage ranged up to about $65,000, he said. He hauled ladders from his pickup truck and climbed on every roof. He finished his day just after 7 p.m.

Mr. Vorcheimer, 51 years old, got into adjusting in 2005 after selling a bakery and a neighbor recruited him to help with Hurricane Wilma claims. His wife, Cheryl, handles administrative matters for the business, Perfect Reliable Independent Claim Services Inc. . Like many other adjusters, the couple uses a 45-foot recreational vehicle when traveling to inspect long-distance claims. The couple is living there temporarily as their home in Pompano Beach has no power.

Though Irma didn't strike Miami, the state's largest city, as feared, damages from the storm could be large enough to displace Sandy as the nation's third most-expensive hurricane ever. That 2012 storm left $20 billion in losses, in today's dollars, mostly in the northeast. On Wednesday, catastrophe-risk modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. estimated Irma's U.S. damage at $18 billion.

The adjuster issues are especially acute in Florida because its home-insurance market is heavily dependent on small and midsize insurers. Over the past 25 years, many of the brand-name national insurers have shrunk their presence in the state to reduce their exposure to hurricanes.

Smaller insurance companies typically rely heavily on independent adjusters, said Joseph Burtone, an insurance analyst with ratings firm A.M. Best. The smaller insurers "have to figure out a way to handle that the best they can," he said. "It will be a challenge."

By comparison, the national insurers employ fleets of adjusters and can send people to Florida from other states. Many big names, such as American International Group Inc. and  Liberty Mutual Insurance, also contract with independent-adjuster firms as needed when disasters occur. Chubb Ltd. said it relies predominantly on its own staff.

On Tuesday, Tim Barziza, a Texas-based "claim leader" for Chubb, was on the last leg of a drive to Miami to oversee a command center there. It is one of several such centers Chubb has set up across the state for taking care of well-to-do policyholders' homes, fine art, boats and vehicles, as well as business clients.

Roughly 400 Chubb employees are expected to handle claims and adjusting, either in the state or from call centers. Chubb adjusters are arriving "from all corners of the U.S.," Mr. Barziza said, taking a break from driving and watching as utility-truck convoys and vehicles with children, dogs and suitcases returned home. By Wednesday, Chubb had received just over 1,000 Irma claims, the overwhelming majority tied to home policies.

In addition to private insurers, many Florida claims will be processed by Citizens, which at about 450,000 policyholders is one of the state's biggest insurers. It expects about 150,000 claims, a spokesman said. As of 1 p.m. Tuesday, about 7,000 had arrived.

"A stale claim is an expensive claim," said John Rollins, an executive with Cabrillo Coastal General Insurance Agency LLC in Gainesville, Fla., and a former chief risk officer of Citizens. "The key in a situation like this is getting to the policyholder and getting some money in their hands so they can begin the recovery process."

As Florida's market gets stretched, insurance executives said the fee increases being paid to adjusters in Florida are spilling over to Texas.

"There's a tug of war for adjusters" between the two states, said James Warren, who works as an adjuster for Crawford & Co., which handles claims for insurance companies.

Some adjusters who would ordinarily stay for two months or longer to adjust claims for a hurricane like Harvey are already heading to Florida, he said.

Mr. Warren is currently adjusting Harvey claims in south Texas, and opted not to go to Florida because he wants to stay close to his home in the Lone Star state.

"Right now, anyone with a license to adjust claims can get a job and some company will try them out," Mr. Warren said. "They're paying more for adjusters to work Irma than they've ever paid insurance adjusters ever."

Mr. Warren's firm, Crawford, is running an orientation program in Atlanta to get hundreds of longtime adjusters up to speed on protocols of clients with claims to adjust in Florida. The firm is moving adjusters from Canada and the U.K. to Florida as well, said Chief Executive Harsha Agadi.

This week, HCI, the Tampa-based insurer, signed up adjusters from Massachusetts to augment its Florida team. "Everybody is pressing into service everybody and anybody they can get," CEO Paresh Patel said.

Typically, insurers have contingency plans for hurricanes, "but we watched all of our contingency resources go to Houston" after Harvey, he said.

There's Never Been a Hotter Time to Freeze Your Credit

By AnnaMaria Andriotis, Daisy Maxey and Telis Demos

Until the Equifax Inc. EFX -14.63% hack, many consumers didn't know what a credit freeze was. Now, the credit-reporting company's massive data breach has people reaching for the tool, a move that could have a host of implications for both consumers and the financial industry.

A freeze typically prevents lenders from accessing a potential borrower's credit report, although it doesn't affect existing credit arrangements such as outstanding loans or cards. A freeze makes it unlikely a firm would immediately extend new financing, which, while helping prevent fraud could also slow legitimate business.

Freezes are being promoted as a first line of defense in the Equifax breach, which potentially affected 143 million Americans. It is a more drastic step than credit monitoring, which alerts consumers to potentially fraudulent activity on their reports.

Equifax peers TransUnion and Experian PLC said the number of credit-report freezes being requested by consumers increased significantly in the days after the Equifax news last week. Tens of thousands of U.S. consumers initiated credit freezes on Friday and Saturday alone, said Alex Lintner, president of consumer information services at Experian.

Demand to sign up for freezes appears to be so great that some consumers were complaining of delays or being unable to register on credit-reporting companies' websites. "The unprecedented number of consumers contacting us after the Equifax announcement has impacted our ability to respond to consumers as we would like," said TransUnion, adding it has taken steps to increase communications with consumers.

Previously, credit freezes were typically initiated by people who either had, say, their identity stolen or earlier instances of fraud on their accounts. While open to anyone and reversible temporarily or permanently, most consumers have in the past shied away from the step because it made getting new credit more cumbersome. In some states, consumers must pay a fee to temporarily or permanently lift a freeze.

In a country of free-flowing credit like the U.S., there is value to relatively open information about a consumer's creditworthiness. It makes it easier for someone to open a new credit card at a department store or gain quick approval for a mortgage.

But the Equifax hack appears to be changing some of that calculus, as worried consumers say they would rather have their default information status set to off-limits, unless they choose otherwise. That adjustment could change consumer behavior, the flow of consumer credit and, in extreme cases, the long-term rate of growth for consumer financing.

There is little official government data about freezes. A 2014 paper from researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimated that about 2 million U.S. consumers placed a credit freeze or fraud alert on their credit reports in 2012. The paper also showed that freezes spiked in South Carolina that same year in response to a data breach at that state's Department of Revenue.

"This may start to affect some of the spontaneous nature of credit access," John Thompson, senior vice president at the Center for Financial Services Innovation, a nonprofit firm that focuses on consumer financial-health issues.

Jeffrey Mark, of Chicago, froze his credit report with Equifax this week and is considering doing the same with the other credit-reporting firms.

"When a credit agency gets hacked, they have very sensitive information," said the 65-year-old architect, who plans to freeze his credit indefinitely. Mr. Mark said he isn't a big acquirer of credit cards, but expects that seeking credit will become "more of a hassle" with a freeze in place.

That's a trade-off he said he is willing to make. Given the amount of information about people taken in the Equifax breach, "it's very scary if that access becomes available to other people who shouldn't have it," he said.

Brendan Dickinson, of Darien, Conn., plans to shop for a car in the near future and said a freeze would make it harder to get credit. Still, that didn't stop him and his wife from freezing their credit reports with four companies the big three and another called Innovis in recent days.

"I've added a layer of pain for myself, but it seems worth it," said the 35-year-old partner at a venture-capital firm, adding that he expects to keep the freeze on for the foreseeable future.

Some businesses are worried about how the freezes might hurt business. At Galpin Motors Inc., a Southern California auto retailer that sells brands such as Ford, Honda and Volvo, dealerships began training staff Monday on how to handle frozen credit reports, including who to call at the credit-reporting companies for help, said Brian Allan, a senior director.

Freezes, he added, create challenges for car buyers, potentially delaying purchases for days.

Currently, dealers can call up a credit score within minutes. When a credit report is frozen, it typically requires a customer to first unlock it with a password and then verify its release to the store via a phone call, Mr. Allan said.

Often, customers forget their passwords, and it can take up to 72 hours to retrieve it. Or the agency calls a home phone number to verify the request, even though the customer is at the store, Mr. Allan said.

"We have people come in, and they don't realize the extent of what we have to go through," he said.

Credit specialists said rising freezes could ding loan volume, including for credit cards and auto loans, at the margin.

"Overall, this would lower the actual credit volume and access to credit markets," said Kyle Herkenhoff, an assistant professor of macroeconomics at the University of Minnesota and a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

Credit growth was already slowing before the Equifax hack. The rate of year-over-year growth for consumer loans at all U.S. commercial banks fell to 4.1% in July, less than half the recent peak of 8.6% in July 2016, according to Federal Reserve data.

Freezes can also stall lending before it gets started. Lenders often purchase lists of borrowers who meet certain criteria from credit-reporting companies, including Equifax, to mail them credit offers. The lists exclude people who have frozen their reports.

"There probably will be some chilling effect on making credit offers," said Marla Blow, chief executive of FS Card Inc., which offers credit cards to subprime borrowers. "A spike in freezes is something we are acutely aware of and working through in real-time."

WSJ Pro Short: SEC Chairman Open to Softening Auditor Rule

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton suggests he's at least open to softening a long-contested rule that requires companies to have auditors evaluate their internal controls, the procedures they use to prevent financial errors or fraud. Supporters of the rule, part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, say it helps ensure companies are giving accurate numbers to investors. But business groups say the rule is too costly and burdensome for small companies, and the proposed Financial Choice Act pending in Congress would exempt many more companies from having to follow it. At a meeting of an SEC advisory panel that discussed the issue, Clayton says, "To get to a good audit you have to have good controls, but the devil is in the details, and we should be exploring them."

WSJ Pro: SEC Chairman Suggests the Midwest Could Use a Few More VCs

By Dave Michaels

Memo to venture capitalists: the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to know why you don't have an Indianapolis branch office.

Jay Clayton, the SEC's chairman appointed by the Trump administration, asked on Wednesday why the Midwest has so few venture capitalists even though the region hosts so many large, established companies. "Over 100 Fortune 500 companies but only 4% of U.S. venture funds," Mr. Clayton said at a meeting of the SEC's small business advisory committee. "It doesn't make sense you would have that robust an economy and so few people looking toward the future."

Mr. Clayton, formerly a corporate attorney in New York and London, has taken an interest in longstanding complaints that it is too hard for smaller companies to raise money from investors. The SEC's staff is considering how deregulation could make it easier on them, with an eye toward helping entrepreneurs who live far away from Silicon Valley and New York.

Venture capitalists are largely unregulated by the SEC, but the agency does administer rules that restrict how private and public companies raise money and compensate employees by issuing shares.

The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would ease the ability of smaller firms to issue more shares as compensation to employees. The SEC's small business committee on Wednesday was discussing a similar measure that the SEC could implement on its own.

Foreign Investors Snap Up Chinese Bank Debt

By Shen Hong

SHANGHAI Foreign investors last month more than tripled their holdings of a popular short-term debt instrument issued by Chinese banks reflecting both the attraction of a rising yuan and a growing risk appetite.

That made them among the leading buyers of "negotiable certificates of deposit" or NCDs in August, a rare position for foreign investors in any Chinese debt market. Central banks and sovereign-wealth funds were big buyers, according to a Shanghai-based banker at a global bank that trades on behalf of such foreign investors.

NCDs effectively high-yielding bonds, generally with maturities of a month to a year have become extremely popular with Chinese banks, especially smaller lenders, since their launch in late 2013. But as concerns have grown that banks are issuing them as a tool for leveraged investment rather than to meet genuine refinancing needs, they have drawn heightened scrutiny from Chinese regulators, who recently imposed a partial ban.

Foreign investors' holdings surged to 88.3 billion yuan ($13.5 billion) in August, from 24.5 billion in July and just 2.2 billion yuan in January, according to data provider WIND Info. Their net 63.8 billion yuan in purchases last month put them second only to a group of nonbank institutions that include Chinese brokerages, insurers and trust companies. Still, foreign investors' holdings account for only 1% of the NCD market.

"The yuan's sharp appreciation must be a key reason behind foreign investors' interest in NCDs and the latter's high returns make them even more attractive, especially compared with the lower government bond yields," said Liu Dongliang, senior analyst at China Merchants Bank . The yuan has staged an unexpected comeback against the dollar, delivering a 6% gain this year after a 6.6% loss last year.

Six-month NCDs issued by AAA-rated, midsize Chinese banks the most popular category of the product pay an average return of 4.6%, compared with 3.3% for six-month bills issued by the Chinese government and 3.6% for 10-year government bonds.

"This is a bit unexpected because the foreign investors in the Chinese market are typically risk-averse and some of them used to shun bonds issued by quasi-sovereign institutions like China Development Bank," said Mr. Liu, referring to China's largest policy bank.

The NCD market has expanded to 8.5 trillion yuan, from 6.3 trillion at the end of last year and just 34 billion yuan at the end of 2013. In early April, the country's banking regulator criticized banks' speculative use of the instruments as "working without bending down" and "sitting there collecting free money," adding that banks should do more to ensure money flows to China's "real economy."

On Aug. 31, China's central bank said it will ban the issuance of NCDs with maturities longer than a year.

Canadian Exchange Weighs Risks in Trading U.S. Marijuana Stocks

By David George-Cosh

TORONTO As dozens of cannabis companies have flocked to raise capital on Canada's stock exchanges in recent years, the country's regulators are starting to question whether trading in their stock would run afoul of U.S. law.

The parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange and an umbrella organization of Canadian securities regulators are looking at cannabis companies with U.S. operations including growers, medical-marijuana distributors and pharmaceutical firms whose products include marijuana ingredients to determine whether trading in their shares should be allowed to continue on Canadian exchanges.

The regulatory attention comes as the Toronto Stock Exchange and its smaller rival, the Canadian Securities Exchange, have been actively courting marijuana company listings from around the world. At present, roughly half the trading activity on the Canadian Securities Exchange is sourced from marijuana-based businesses, a high-growth sector.

Medical marijuana has been legal in Canada since 2001 for patients with valid prescriptions, and Canada is expected to formally legalize marijuana by July 2018. In the U.S., meanwhile, while eight states plus the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana, and an additional 20 states have legalized it for medical purposes, it remains illegal under federal law.

U.S. exchanges list shares of some companies indirectly involved in the pot business, such as real-estate firms that lease sites to marijuana growers. But neither the New York Stock Exchange nor Nasdaq will allow trading of shares in companies that profit directly from growing or selling marijuana in the U.S., lawyers say.

The exchanges wouldn't discuss their marijuana policies on the record. A Nasdaq spokeswoman pointed to an exchange rule stating that Nasdaq "stands for integrity and ethical business practices." NYSE's rule book says its listed companies "should proactively promote compliance with laws, rules and regulations."

TMX Group Ltd. , parent of both the Toronto Stock Exchange and a clearinghouse unit, the Canadian Depository for Securities Ltd., a platform where Canadian exchanges settle equity, debt and money-market transactions, has sought clarity from Canadian regulators on the question of whether settling stock trades of cannabis companies with U.S. operations amounts to a violation U.S. law, according to a TMX Group statement.

"This is a complex matter which touches multiple aspects across our capital market system, and as such requires close examination and careful consideration," said a TMX spokeswoman. The company is cooperating with Canadian Securities Administrators, the umbrella group of provincial and territorial securities regulators.

Neither regulators nor the exchange platform have announced when a formal ruling is expected, although some observers believe a decision could come in November, when the clearinghouse's board is scheduled to meet.

Any action by Canadian regulators is likely to be closely watched by other countries grappling with how to treat the trading and clearing of marijuana stocks. Exchanges in Germany and Israel, for example, two countries that recently legalized medical marijuana and have publicly-listed cannabis firms, have also been weighing listing standards for such companies.

"The industry wants clarity, and would prefer that it come sooner rather than later," said Richard Carleton, chief executive of the Canadian Securities Exchange.

In all, there are 69 cannabis-related companies, representing a combined market value of about C$7.8 billion (U.S. $6.4 billion), trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the smaller TSX Venture Exchange and the Canadian Securities Exchange. These companies include more than a dozen fledgling U.S. marijuana entities that have turned to Canada to raise money, including 11 companies on the Canadian Securities Exchange with some assets or operations in the U.S., according to Mr. Carleton. There are at least four on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the smaller TSX Venture Exchange.

Cannabis companies that were eager to raise public funds in Canada to fuel expansion plans now face the possibility of new restrictions.

Canopy Growth Corp. , a Smiths Falls, Ontario-based grower and seller of medical marijuana, is the world's largest publicly-traded cannabis company, with a market valuation of C$1.7 billion on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Chief Executive Bruce Linton said he has turned down opportunities to invest in the U.S. because of the uncertain legal repercussions back in Canada.

Regulatory clarity, Mr. Linton said, would be "one of the last check boxes" to get institutional investors engaged in the cannabis market. "When a sector works in an unclear way, serious capital pools avoid that sector," he said.

Even if trading in U.S. cannabis shares is allowed to continue on Canadian exchanges, most marijuana startups face an uphill battle to attract capital, given uncertainty over future regulations in Canada and continued illegal status in the U.S. "Many institutional investors wouldn't touch any of these firms with a 10-foot pole," said Michael Mayes, president of Quantum 9, a Chicago-based marijuana-business consultancy.

Canadian investment bank Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. said it is considering stepping in to provide clearinghouse services if TMX's Canadian Depository unit decides to stop processing trades of publicly-traded cannabis companies with U.S. exposure. Canaccord has raised about C$415 million of capital in the cannabis sector as an adviser and underwriter since January 2016.

"If CDS is to make a change to its policy on clearing trades in U.S. cannabis companies, then Canaccord will explore options for a solution," said Graham Saunders, Canaccord's head of capital markets origination.

However, setting up a clearinghouse system is likely to take the investment bank take several months given the technological requirements, even if the plan were to get approval from securities regulators.

GSAM's Smart-Beta ETF Will Expand Price War

A planned smart-beta ETF from Goldman Sachs Asset Management with a management fee of 0.09% well below the management fees of other smart-beta ETFs aside from those sponsored by Vanguard expands the ETF price war beyond plain-vanilla ETFs, says Stephen Tu, senior analyst at Moody's. That's credit-negative for traditional active-equity players entering the smart-beta realm, including Legg Mason (LM), Franklin Resources (BEN) and Janus Capital (JNS), he says. It's also credit-negative for the existing smart-beta managers, including Invesco (IVZ), BlackRock (BLK), State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF), who are likely to respond with price cuts on existing products, Tu says. Thus far, most smart-beta ETFs have been priced between 24 basis points and 39 basis points, he says. BLK, STT and WETF didn't have an immediate comment. IVZ didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

Equifax Continues Slide As Data-Breach Complaints Mount

Shares in Equifax (EFX) are down 12% to $101.71 as the credit-reporting company continues to get scrutiny from customers, competitors, investors and lawmakers over the massive data breach it revealed last week. In an op-ed published in USA Today, CEO Richard Smith apologized for the breach impacting 143 million US consumers and added it has been the "most humbling moment" in its history. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Sen Heidi Heitkamp (D, ND) has called for federal agencies to investigate whether top executives sold shares based on knowledge about the hack prior to Thursday's public announcement. The company has denied any wrongdoing. EFX had gained 21% this year prior to Friday, but shares are now down more than 13% this year, shaving off about $4.8 billion in value from the company.

Harvey More Costly than Irma, Says Moody's Analytics

Hurricane Harvey, which caused widespread flooding in the Houston area last month, was more costly to the US economy than Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in Florida on Sunday, Moody's Analytics says. Harvey cost the economy between $86 billion and $108 billion, with median estimate of $97 billion, Moody's Analytics says. Irma cost between $58 billion and $83 billion, with a median estimate of $70.5 billion. Harvey was seen as causing significantly more damage to residential and commercial property, making it a more costly storm, the analysis showed. However, Irma caused slightly more loss of economic output. A larger number of people evacuated ahead of Irma and still millions in the Southeast are without power.

Goldman Raises Deposit Limit

Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped the velvet rope in welcoming small-time savers last year, opening online savings accounts with as little as $1. Now it's welcoming the big money back in. GS has raised the maximum account size from $250,000 to $1 million for its online accounts, which pay 1.2% a year, one of the best rates out there. Growing deposits has been a key goal, especially as GS looks to lower its overall cost of funding a boon to its traders and ramp up its lending activity. GS has $15 billion in retail deposits, according to an investor presentation this week. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)

New Irma Damage Estimate: $25B

Hurricane Irma caused $18 billion in insured losses in the US and $7 billion in the Caribbean, according to the latest estimates from catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. The estimates do not include crop losses or damage that is insured by the National Flood Insurance Program. In the Caribbean, half the property damage was in St. Martin, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, the company says. In the U.S., most of the devastation was in the Florida Keys, but Jacksonville and Charleston also experienced "significant inland flooding." (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

Tax Reform Hopes Vanish from Bank Stocks

Bank stocks have recently underperformed assets that the group tends to be tied to, evidence that "investors are pricing in a very low probability of significant regulatory or tax reform," Goldman Sachs analysts write. Bank stocks tend to be linked to assets like interest rates, fixed income, the dollar, and the stock market. But after the election, bank stocks outperformed these assets by 12% as traders forecast a greater chance of policy changes, says Goldman Sachs, adding that the entire financial sector has been volatile since the election. The firm benchmarked returns of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index with funds tracking the S&P 500, Treasurys, high yield bonds, gold and oil. "The Trump premium has drained out of banks," the analysts write.

SBI Life IPO to Raise Over $1 Billion

SBI Life Insurance, one of India's top life insurers, will raise as much as INR84 billion ($1.3 billion) in its initial share sale offer next week. This will be the largest IPO in the past seven years, after Coal India. The price band for the offer is fixed between INR 685-INR 700 a share and it will open on September 20. SBI Life is the second life insurer to be listed on the stock exchange. Last year, the country's largest private life insurer ICICI Prudential Life Insurance was listed. Many life insurance firms are coming out to list their shares to take advantage of a buoyant stock market and also due to regulatory requirements. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)

China's Next Debt Addiction: Credit Cards

China's rapid shift toward mobile payments has led some to assume the country would somehow bypass credit cards on the way to becoming a cashless society. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-next-debt-addictioncredit-cards-1505296621" Credit card loans in China rose 31% on year to almost 4.69 trillion yuan ($718 billion) in the second quarter, according to central bank data.

The stars have actually been aligning for the Chinese credit-card industry. Banks want to hand more of them out, while consumer confidence is off the charts. Beijing, meanwhile, is eager to shift more of China's monumental debt pile onto households which traditionally have high savings and away from the highly indebted corporate sector.

The big enablers have been China's so-called joint-stock banks, which are usually midsize lenders. Interest and fees related to credit cards accounted for 20% of their total revenue in the first half, on average, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. Banks are eager to find new income streams, as regulatory pressure on their lucrative shadow lending intensifies.

Managers Won't Take Risks If No One's Watching

The low profitability of Japanese firms has been attributed to their failure to restructure and their aversion to risk, a problem that has arisen as company managers who are protected from takeovers or shareholder intervention avoid making difficult decisions, according to a "http://nber.org/papers/w23804". Researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology found that those managers who are closely monitored by institutional investors and independent directors tend to be active in making difficult decisions. Improving the monitoring of managers by outsiders could help spur more managerial risk-taking at Japanese firms, the researchers say.

Equifax Critics Are Missing the Bigger Point

Amar Bhid, a professor of business at Tufts University, in a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-critics-are-missing-the-bigger-point-1505343139" writes that federal fair-lending laws have made impersonation of consumers easy. "Outrage that Equifax exposed more than 143 million credit records to identity thieves misses the point," he writes. "We really should worry about what makes impersonation so easy why do lenders know so little about the people to whom they issue credit?"

Bank-Risk Measures Overcompensate for Calm Markets

Bank risk as measured by "value at risk" has declined sharply since 2009, but that gauge may belie the actual risk in the market, Mark Whitehouse "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-11/how-much-have-banks-really-cut-their-risks". Value at risk measures how much a firm could lose on a given day based on the recent past, so calmer markets will show up as less risk even if a bank's assets haven't changed, he says. Adjusted to strip out the impact of the broader market, trading operations at the six largest U.S. banks are only about 25% less risky than they were in 2009, and have actually become a bit riskier over the past year, Mr. Whitehouse says. Lending is inherently risky, he says, but banks "don't have enough equity to absorb the inevitable losses from bad bets, and they're still taking plenty of risk in areas such as the trading book where they should be safer."

Stanley Fischer's Departure Reveals Weakness at the Fed

With Stanley Fischer set to resign from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Adam S.

"https://piie.com/commentary/op-eds/stanley-fischers-departure-reveals-weakness-fed", Mr. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argues that "there is a legitimate concern" that presidents of the New York Fed are "subject to cognitive capture by the leading financial firms." He adds that "macroprudential policy, and financial supervision in general, should be more rules-based and allow less discretion to central bankers."

MissionU has opened a school to serve the talent demands of technology companies.

San Francisco-based MissionU, founded in January 2016, was built to initially help with the growing need for data analytics workers.

"In the field of data analytics, there's still not enough talent," said Adam Braun, chief executive and co-founder of MissionU.

MissionU's school, which admits people without requiring SAT scores or transcripts, in recent weeks started its first class. Applicants are asked to take a number of steps, including a problem-solving test online, group challenge exercise in a class and a presentation.

Also, the startup doesn't require fees up front. Instead, its one-year program allows its graduates to pay back 15% of their income for three years, a repayment figure that is capped at $45,000.

The startup on Thursday said it has scored $8.5 million in funding, bringing its total financing to $11.5 million. The company's funding was led by FirstMark Capital and had participation from existing investors First Round Capital, University Ventures, Box Group, Rethink Education, Learn Capital, and new investors John Doerr, general partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Omidyar Network.

Matt Turck, managing director at FirstMark, is joining the board.

Canadian Exchange Weighs Risks in Trading U.S. Marijuana Stocks

Slow Going So Far at Clayton's SEC

When Jay Clayton became Securities and Exchange Commission chairman in May, the job came with the luxury of picking the agency's focus, something none of his recent predecessors had.

Speaking in July, Mr. Clayton said he had "inherited an agency with considerably more discretion over its agenda." That's because there are now fewer regulations to finish under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, thanks to the work of SEC chiefs who preceded him. The SEC might even be able to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-drop-pursuit-of-banker-ceo-pay-restrictions-1500590543", reflecting White House and congressional antipathy for the law.

So it's a bit surprising that his SEC is moving slowly so far. Mr. Clayton was sworn in May 4. It's been 133 days since then, and the commission has yet to vote on a proposed or final regulation. By comparison, the commission took 21 days to approve its first proposed rule after Mary Jo White, Mr. Clayton's immediate predecessor, took over in 2013.

Going back to the start of the 21st century, only former Chairman Christopher Cox took as many as 50 days to obtain a commission vote on his first proposed or final rule. Like Mr. Clayton, Mr. Cox was appointed by a Republican president who favored less regulation of financial markets. But under two previous Republican SEC chairmen, William Donaldson and Harvey Pitt, the SEC issued a proposed or final rule within a month of taking over.

It's fair to observe that Mr. Clayton isn't rushing into new rules because he wants to make it easier, not more cumbersome, for companies to raise capital. He also doesn't seem to face any pressing demand by Republican congressional leaders or the White House to move faster. But under the laws that govern how regulatory agencies function, loosening requirements usually requires a commission vote. Even deregulation takes time.

An SEC spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Clayton has also moved slowly to fill out the commission's senior staff. He still hasn't named permanent directors for two divisions that Wall Street watches closely Trading and Markets, which oversees exchanges, and the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations, which inspects regulated financial firms. His top choice to run Trading and Markets "https://www.wsj.com/articles/itg-executive-jamie-selway-withdraws-as-candidate-for-top-regulatory-role-1504881936" after he had been under review for several months.

The SEC chief could be waiting for two new commissioners to join before he gets started in earnest with regulatory changes. The White House has picked "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-to-nominate-hester-peirce-as-republican-sec-commissioner-1500417225" and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-set-to-tap-columbia-law-professor-for-sec-on-friday-1504225067" to fill the vacancies. While both Ms. Peirce and Mr. Jackson are likely to be confirmed, the Senate could take weeks, if not longer, to do so.

Mr. Clayton has proceeded cautiously to build and execute an agenda of his own. But the clock is ticking: If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, the SEC's chief is likely to step down. The agency also tends to do less around the time of congressional elections, which are coming up next year. At some point soon, key stakeholders will want to see action on what Mr. Clayton has primed them to expect.

Equifax Faces Bumpy Legal Terrain as Consumer Suits Mount

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-faces-bumpy-legal-terrain-as-consumer-suits-mount-1505342810", which last week suffered a massive data breach, could face a tougher challenge in court than other corporate giants that have dealt with the legal fallout of data breaches, according to legal experts.

Unlike earlier retailer hacks, such as those suffered by Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp., the Equifax breach is bigger in scope, potentially compromising the personal information including Social Security and driver's license numbers of roughly 143 million U.S. consumers.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theres-never-been-a-hotter-time-to-freeze-your-credit-1505321727", many consumers didn't know what a credit freeze was. Now, the credit-reporting company's massive data breach has people reaching for the tool, a move that could have a host of implications for both consumers and the financial industry.

A freeze typically prevents lenders from accessing a potential borrower's credit report, although it doesn't affect existing credit arrangements such as outstanding loans or cards. A freeze makes it unlikely a firm would immediately extend new financing, which, while helping prevent fraud could also slow legitimate business.

WSJ Pro Short: SEC Chairman Open to Softening Auditor Rule

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton suggests he's at least open to softening a long-contested rule that requires companies to have auditors evaluate their internal controls, the procedures they use to prevent financial errors or fraud. Supporters of the rule, part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, say it helps ensure companies are giving accurate numbers to investors. But business groups say the rule is too costly and burdensome for small companies, and the proposed Financial Choice Act pending in Congress would exempt many more companies from having to follow it. At a meeting of an SEC advisory panel that discussed the issue, Clayton says, "To get to a good audit you have to have good controls, but the devil is in the details, and we should be exploring them."

WSJ Pro: SEC Chairman Suggests the Midwest Could Use a Few More VCs

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chairman-suggests-the-midwest-could-use-a-few-more-vcs-1505339087": the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to know why you don't have an Indianapolis branch office.

Jay Clayton, the SEC's chairman appointed by the Trump administration, asked on Wednesday why the Midwest has so few venture capitalists even though the region hosts so many large, established companies. "Over 100 Fortune 500 companies but only 4% of U.S. venture funds," Mr. Clayton said at a meeting of the SEC's small business advisory committee. "It doesn't make sense you would have that robust an economy and so few people looking toward the future."

Foreign Investors Snap Up Chinese Bank Debt

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-investors-snap-up-chinese-bank-debt-1505280977" their holdings of a popular short-term debt instrument issued by Chinese banks reflecting both the attraction of a rising yuan and a growing risk appetite.

That made them among the leading buyers of "negotiable certificates of deposit" or NCDs in August, a rare position for foreign investors in any Chinese debt market. Central banks and sovereign-wealth funds were big buyers, according to a Shanghai-based banker at a global bank that trades on behalf of such foreign investors.

NCDs effectively high-yielding bonds, generally with maturities of a month to a year have become extremely popular with Chinese banks, especially smaller lenders, since their launch in late 2013. But as concerns have grown that banks are issuing them as a tool for leveraged investment rather than to meet genuine refinancing needs, they have drawn heightened scrutiny from Chinese regulators, who recently imposed a partial ban.

Canadian Exchange Weighs Risks in Trading U.S. Marijuana Stocks

The parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange and an umbrella organization of Canadian securities regulators are looking at cannabis companies with U.S. operations including growers, medical-marijuana distributors and pharmaceutical firms whose products include marijuana ingredients to determine whether trading in their shares should be allowed to continue on Canadian exchanges.

China's Next Debt Addiction: Credit Cards

China's rapid shift toward mobile payments has led some to assume the country would somehow bypass credit cards on the way to becoming a cashless society. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-next-debt-addictioncredit-cards-1505296621" Credit card loans in China rose 31% on year to almost 4.69 trillion yuan ($718 billion) in the second quarter, according to central bank data.

The stars have actually been aligning for the Chinese credit-card industry. Banks want to hand more of them out, while consumer confidence is off the charts. Beijing, meanwhile, is eager to shift more of China's monumental debt pile onto households which traditionally have high savings and away from the highly indebted corporate sector.

The big enablers have been China's so-called joint-stock banks, which are usually midsize lenders. Interest and fees related to credit cards accounted for 20% of their total revenue in the first half, on average, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. Banks are eager to find new income streams, as regulatory pressure on their lucrative shadow lending intensifies.

Managers Won't Take Risks If No One's Watching

The low profitability of Japanese firms has been attributed to their failure to restructure and their aversion to risk, a problem that has arisen as company managers who are protected from takeovers or shareholder intervention avoid making difficult decisions, according to a "http://nber.org/papers/w23804". Researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology found that those managers who are closely monitored by institutional investors and independent directors tend to be active in making difficult decisions. Improving the monitoring of managers by outsiders could help spur more managerial risk-taking at Japanese firms, the researchers say.

Equifax Critics Are Missing the Bigger Point

Amar Bhid, a professor of business at Tufts University, in a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-critics-are-missing-the-bigger-point-1505343139" writes that federal fair-lending laws have made impersonation of consumers easy. "Outrage that Equifax exposed more than 143 million credit records to identity thieves misses the point," he writes. "We really should worry about what makes impersonation so easy why do lenders know so little about the people to whom they issue credit?"

Bank-Risk Measures Overcompensate for Calm Markets

Bank risk as measured by "value at risk" has declined sharply since 2009, but that gauge may belie the actual risk in the market, Mark Whitehouse "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-11/how-much-have-banks-really-cut-their-risks". Value at risk measures how much a firm could lose on a given day based on the recent past, so calmer markets will show up as less risk even if a bank's assets haven't changed, he says. Adjusted to strip out the impact of the broader market, trading operations at the six largest U.S. banks are only about 25% less risky than they were in 2009, and have actually become a bit riskier over the past year, Mr. Whitehouse says. Lending is inherently risky, he says, but banks "don't have enough equity to absorb the inevitable losses from bad bets, and they're still taking plenty of risk in areas such as the trading book where they should be safer."

Stanley Fischer's Departure Reveals Weakness at the Fed

With Stanley Fischer set to resign from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Adam S. Posen reflects that the Fed board has "too much discretion in how any regulations and supervisory rules are applied." "https://piie.com/commentary/op-eds/stanley-fischers-departure-reveals-weakness-fed", Mr. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argues that "there is a legitimate concern" that presidents of the New York Fed are "subject to cognitive capture by the leading financial firms." He adds that "macroprudential policy, and financial supervision in general, should be more rules-based and allow less discretion to central bankers."

Fed policy expected to stay on course despite storms; Strategy: US growth

Harvey and Irma not likely to divert central bank from tightening, economists predict

While the physical damage from storms as ferocious as Harvey and Irma can last for months and years, the overall economic damage is likely to be fleeting and should do little to alter the Federal Reserve's broader strategy for tightening monetary policy, economists predict.

The US central bank lifted short-term interest rates in 2005, just a month after Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf of Mexico - with policymakers at the time describing the economic ramifications as significant but "essentially temporary". Chair Janet Yellen may take a similar view in the wake of the twin storms that hit Texas and Florida.

Estimates from Moody's Analytics put the total physical damage from Harvey and Irma at $150bn-$200bn - comparable to that following Katrina. The hit to annualised gross domestic product growth in the third quarter may be 0.5 percentage points, it said. Separate estimates from Goldman Sachs suggest the hurricane-related disruptions will shave as much as 0.8 percentage points from growth during that period, lowering the likely expansion to 2 per cent.

Conversely, headline inflation could briefly spike in the aftermath of the storms, driven by factors such as higher petrol prices following refinery shutdowns, as well as an uplift in used car prices after the storms left a trail of ruined vehicles. The impact on core inflation - which strips out food and fuel prices and is closely watched by the Fed - may be more muted.

Analysts stress that big disasters can lift growth further out as the rebuilding effort gets under way, leaving the overall economy on largely the same longer-term trajectory. That was the message from Bill Dudley, New York Fed president last week, when he described the national economic effects of epic storms as "modest and transitory". Stormrelated turmoil could make it hard to read the economic data given the volatility it will insert into numbers, he said.

Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase does not expect Fed policy to be heavily affected. At next week's meeting it is still likely to announce the start to the process of reducing its balance sheet; it has not been making this move contingent on near-term swings in economic data.

"The next realistic chance to adjust the funds rate is not until mid-December, and at that point we think some of the more noticeable disruptions from the data flow should be behind us," added Mr Feroli.

None of this is to play down the short-term impact from two such violent storms. Harvey has triggered a surge in claims for unemployment benefits in Texas, for instance. Initial claims rose by 62,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 in the week ended September 2, the biggest weekly jump since 2012, according to the Labor Department. In 2005 there were more than 500,000 hurricane-related jobless claims over three months following Katrina, according to High Frequency Economics.

Industrial production is likely to be dented by shutdowns in Texas's chemicals and petroleum sector. Power outages have affected more than half the homes and businesses in Florida, hitting utilities' output and business activity. The state's tourism sector has been particularly exposed to the storm's effects.

In addition, it may take time for rebuilding to get under way - especially in two states where there are shortages of construction labour. This could mean wages in the sector are boosted.

Goldman predicts the third-quarter hit from the two storms will be more than recouped over the subsequent three quarters as business investment and construction activity rallies. "You get an initial negative impact that is made up in subsequent months and quarters, and it washes out very quickly," said Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. "It should not have any material impact on monetary policy."

That does not necessarily mean the job of interpreting the coming weeks' data will be easy for the Fed. Inflation readings will probably be hit by the storms, at a time when the central bank is sensitive to fluctuations in prices.

D isappointments on inflation readings have left the Fed's interest-rate decisions finely balanced, with many investors doubting the central bank will be able to lift rates by another quarter-point by the end of the year. Greater clarity will come next Wednesday, when Ms Yellen gives a press conference after the central bank's latest meeting.

Exponential Technology Promises Fundamental Changes; Life spans, career paths, retirement face upheaval as technology disrupts traditional assumptions

Ric Edelman

 " Founder and executive chairman of Edelman Financial Services, Fairfax, Va.  " Education: B.A., Honorary Ph.D. Rowan University  " Professional Designations: Board Certified in Mutual Funds, Certified Fund Specialist, Chartered Mutual Fund Counselor, Certified Retirement Counselor, Qualified Financial Planner, Registered Financial Consultant

Background: Mr. Edelman, a best-selling author and a television and radio personality, began his career as a journalist covering financial issues in the 1980s. When Mr. Edelman and his wife hired a financial adviser who prompted them to lie on their mortgage application to qualify for a home loan, they were shocked. After their surprise ebbed, they felt inspired. "We thought, 'If this guy can make a living as an adviser giving people harmful advice, could we make a living giving someone helpful advice?' " Mr. Edelman says. He and his wife launched their own firm in 1986.

His practice: Mr. Edelman's practice currently serves over 34,000 clients, providing financial-planning services to anyone with at least $5,000 to invest. Mr. Edelman specializes in educating clients about how technology will affect their financial future. He says that rapidly advancing exponential technologies such as robotics, 3D printing and artificial intelligence will significantly increase the human life span, alter career paths, and put an end to traditional retirement.

The biggest challenge facing the advising industry: Mr. Edelman says most advisers aren't prepared for this type of longevity that will come with advances in medicine, neuroscience and robotics. "The typical adviser is using outdated financial-planning software that assumes their clients will live to 90 or 95," says Mr. Edelman. He says that this gap could put clients in serious financial jeopardy as they outlive their savings.

On helping clients prepare for change: Mr. Edelman takes a two-part approach to assisting his clients succeed financially in a rapidly changing world. The first step is exposing clients to information about exponential technologies and how it will affect their lives. The second is to provide them with investing opportunities that align with technological growth. Mr. Edelman has played a part in building such investment vehicles. In 2014, he worked with Morningstar and Blackrock to develop iShares Exponential Technologies ETF.

Advisers as career counselors: Mr. Edelman says that technology will eliminate many jobs, making it necessary for workers to be retrained in new industries. He says advisers will need to incorporate career counseling and planning into their practices and help clients plan to save money for additional education.

On games of strategy and advising: In his spare time, Mr. Edelman enjoys playing games of strategy such as pool, hearts and chess. His work and the games he enjoys are similar, he says. "It's all the strategic anticipation of what will happen next."

His proudest professional achievement & "Having been named by Barron's 3 times as No. 1 independent financial adviser," he says.

GSAM's Smart-Beta ETF Will Expand Price War

A planned smart-beta ETF from Goldman Sachs Asset Management with a management fee of 0.09% well below the management fees of other smart-beta ETFs aside from those sponsored by Vanguard expands the ETF price war beyond plain-vanilla ETFs, says Stephen Tu, senior analyst at Moody's. That's credit-negative for traditional active-equity players entering the smart-beta realm, including Legg Mason (LM), Franklin Resources (BEN) and Janus Capital (JNS), he says. It's also credit-negative for the existing smart-beta managers, including Invesco (IVZ), BlackRock (BLK), State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF), who are likely to respond with price cuts on existing products, Tu says. Thus far, most smart-beta ETFs have been priced between 24 basis points and 39 basis points, he says. BLK, STT and WETF didn't have an immediate comment. IVZ didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

Equifax Continues Slide As Data-Breach Complaints Mount

Shares in Equifax (EFX) are down 12% to $101.71 as the credit-reporting company continues to get scrutiny from customers, competitors, investors and lawmakers over the massive data breach it revealed last week. In an op-ed published in USA Today, CEO Richard Smith apologized for the breach impacting 143 million US consumers and added it has been the "most humbling moment" in its history. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Sen Heidi Heitkamp (D, ND) has called for federal agencies to investigate whether top executives sold shares based on knowledge about the hack prior to Thursday's public announcement. The company has denied any wrongdoing. EFX had gained 21% this year prior to Friday, but shares are now down more than 13% this year, shaving off about $4.8 billion in value from the company.

Harvey More Costly than Irma, Says Moody's Analytics

Hurricane Harvey, which caused widespread flooding in the Houston area last month, was more costly to the US economy than Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in Florida on Sunday, Moody's Analytics says. Harvey cost the economy between $86 billion and $108 billion, with median estimate of $97 billion, Moody's Analytics says. Irma cost between $58 billion and $83 billion, with a median estimate of $70.5 billion. Harvey was seen as causing significantly more damage to residential and commercial property, making it a more costly storm, the analysis showed. However, Irma caused slightly more loss of economic output. A larger number of people evacuated ahead of Irma and still millions in the Southeast are without power.

Goldman Raises Deposit Limit

Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped the velvet rope in welcoming small-time savers last year, opening online savings accounts with as little as $1. Now it's welcoming the big money back in. GS has raised the maximum account size from $250,000 to $1 million for its online accounts, which pay 1.2% a year, one of the best rates out there. Growing deposits has been a key goal, especially as GS looks to lower its overall cost of funding a boon to its traders and ramp up its lending activity. GS has $15 billion in retail deposits, according to an investor presentation this week. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)

New Irma Damage Estimate: $25B

Hurricane Irma caused $18 billion in insured losses in the US and $7 billion in the Caribbean, according to the latest estimates from catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. The estimates do not include crop losses or damage that is insured by the National Flood Insurance Program. In the Caribbean, half the property damage was in St. Martin, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, the company says. In the U.S., most of the devastation was in the Florida Keys, but Jacksonville and Charleston also experienced "significant inland flooding." (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

Tax Reform Hopes Vanish from Bank Stocks

Bank stocks have recently underperformed assets that the group tends to be tied to, evidence that "investors are pricing in a very low probability of significant regulatory or tax reform," Goldman Sachs analysts write. Bank stocks tend to be linked to assets like interest rates, fixed income, the dollar, and the stock market. But after the election, bank stocks outperformed these assets by 12% as traders forecast a greater chance of policy changes, says Goldman Sachs, adding that the entire financial sector has been volatile since the election. The firm benchmarked returns of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index with funds tracking the S&P 500, Treasurys, high yield bonds, gold and oil. "The Trump premium has drained out of banks," the analysts write.

SBI Life IPO to Raise Over $1 Billion

SBI Life Insurance, one of India's top life insurers, will raise as much as INR84 billion ($1.3 billion) in its initial share sale offer next week. This will be the largest IPO in the past seven years, after Coal India. The price band for the offer is fixed between INR 685-INR 700 a share and it will open on September 20. SBI Life is the second life insurer to be listed on the stock exchange. Last year, the country's largest private life insurer ICICI Prudential Life Insurance was listed. Many life insurance firms are coming out to list their shares to take advantage of a buoyant stock market and also due to regulatory requirements. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)

Good morning. I'm filling in for Lara today and will do my best with the music puns. It was a big day for media and technology executives out on the scene. Apple held its highly anticipated product launch event marking the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone. The buzziest announcement "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-unveils-new-products-at-iphone-event-1505238436", which will cost $999, and come loaded with facial-recognition and augmented reality features. Also noteworthy was an animated poo emoji, as Reuters reporter Stephen Nellis "https://twitter.com/StephenNellis/status/907675971859263489". Meanwhile, buttoned-up executives from top media, marketing and technology firms made their case for change at the kickoff of Goldman Sachs' Communacopia conference, and the advertising technology conference DMexco begins Wednesday.

Whole Lotta Cord Cutting

On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that two media agencies downgraded their forecasts for global ad spending. Now eMarketer has "https://www.emarketer.com/Article/eMarketer-Lowers-US-TV-Ad-Spend-Estimate-Cord-Cutting-Accelerates/1016463"for U.S. TV ad spending due to "faster-than-expected growth in cord-cutting" and the corresponding audience shrinkage. The research firm predicts there will be over 22 million cord-cutters this year, up 33% over last year and a big step-up from its earlier estimate of 15.4 million. Consumer attention is shifting to new "over the top" streaming services. The average time spent watching TV (excluding digital) among U.S. adults will drop 3.1% to 3 hours 58 minutes this year, while consumption of digital video will increase 9.3% to 1 hour 17 minutes, according to the report. As a result, this year, eMarketer predicts U.S. TV ad spending will increase 0.5% to $71.65 billion -- down from the $72.72 billion it estimated in its first quarter forecast. TV's share of total media ad spending in the U.S. will drop from 36.6% last year to 34.9% this year, and will go below 30% by 2021.

You've Gotta Give For What You Take

Google's "first click free" program has become a headache for some subscription-based news publishers, including The Wall Street Journal. It lets people access stories via search results even if they aren't subscribers, and publishers who don't participate can find their sites penalized in the search rankings. Now "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-offers-olive-branch-to-publishers-by-relaxing-policy-on-subscription-sites-1505259211", report WSJ's Jack Nicas and Lukas Alpert. Robert Thomson, CEO of WSJ-parent News Corp, let out the news at the Goldman Sachs media conference Tuesday. Subscription-oriented publishers will now be able to take whatever approach they want -- you can give away sample stories if you so desire, but if you opt to keep a strict paywall (zero free rides), as the Journal has done lately, you won't be penalized in the search results. That's due to an algorithm tweak that allows Google to scan entire news stories, not just the portions that are beyond the paywall. This represents a significant rapprochement after Google and publishers have sparred over a variety of issues. We'll see if the good vibes last.

I Like Big Data and I Cannot Lie

Elsewhere at the Goldman conference, the "it's all about data" theme kept surfacing. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson used his time to tout the benefits of targeted advertising. AT&T is "building an advertising capability" for more precise ad targeting, he said. He said he expects the company's acquisition of Time Warner to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-to-give-free-hbo-to-more-wireless-customers-1505226248" from advertising, and added that AT&T could use data on viewing habits to select what shows and movies to invest in, reports WSJ. Later in the morning, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts urged marketers to use the company's analytics to inform their ad-buying, rather than relying only on Nielsen data, WSJ's Imani Moise reports. And he talked down the value of targeted ads on Facebook. On the content front, Netflix CFO David Wells said the company would pay $20 million an hour for a show if the circumstances were right (wow), WSJ's Joe Flint reports. And at a time when Amazon and Facebook are angling into live sports, Mr. Wells said Netflix has no plans to.

'Duopoly' Blues

Winning the eyebrow-raising award at the Goldman conference was WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, who referenced former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon to make a point about digital media giants Google and Facebook. He said: "I have no great truck for Steve Bannon, but before Bannon left for the White House he did say, 'Google and Facebook are utilities.' And he implied that utilities should be regulated." He appeared to be referring to remarks "https://theintercept.com/2017/07/27/steve-bannon-wants-facebook-and-google-regulated-like-utilities/". We're not sure if Mr. Sorrell was making the case for heightened regulation of Google and Facebook, or just opening it up for debate. What is clear is that no matter how Mr. Sorrell feels about the digital giants he refers to as "frenemies," WPP will continue to increase its spending with the companies. In his speech, Mr. Sorrell said that WPP's spending with Google will increase to $5.5 billion in 2017, from $5 billion last year, and spending with Facebook will get a boost from $1.7 billion to around $2.5 billion. In other WPP news, Mr. Sorrell said the company will be changing its regional management approach and encouraging more integration on shared client work across agencies.

Banking & Finance: Banks Weigh Shift From Equifax --- TransUnion, Experian are poised to pick up business in the wake of big data  breach

Banks and other financial companies are considering the possibility of moving some business away from Equifax Inc. in the wake of its data breach and to some of the firm's credit-reporting rivals, according to people familiar with the firms.

Lenders are unlikely to take any immediate action and are seeking more information from Equifax about the hack that exposed sensitive personal financial information about potentially 143 million Americans. Still, large banks, in particular, have expressed dismay privately that their customers' information was compromised, that they received no advance warning of the breach announcement, and that they still have little insight into what went wrong, these people said.

Equifax didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Equifax has already faced widespread criticism from consumers. In the aftermath of the breach disclosure many consumers said they struggled with the firm's website and policies.

Equifax is also facing political ire: Two congressional committees are planning hearings into the hack, and the Senate Finance Committee on Monday sent the company a list of requests for information about the attack, the company's response to it, and who knew what and when about the problem.

Executives at financial firms in recent days have publicly expressed concern about the breach. James Dimon, chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, spoke about Equifax twice at conferences on Tuesday.

Mr. Dimon said he is interested in understanding more about whether the hack is the sort of attack that could have happened to any company or if there was something specific that Equifax didn't do correctly. "All that will matter, it's obviously important," he said.

He also said, "It depends what happened and how it happened, whether they could've or should've." Mr. Dimon said that the bank was in contact with Equifax.

Speaking at a conference the day before, Capital One Financial Corp. CEO Richard Fairbank said the cost of the attack would be borne by both consumers and financial companies. "A bunch of our customers are affected," he said. "It's going to be costly to them and to us."

It is unlikely that financial firms would cease doing business with Equifax altogether. But, as contracts with the company come up for renewal, they might look to shift some of their business to rivals such as TransUnion or Experian PLC, the people familiar with the matter said.

For most loans, excluding mortgages, lenders often don't check credit reports from all three big credit-reporting firms. Moving away from Equifax would likely result in more market share to TransUnion and Experian.

The possibility of losing market share could add to the pressure on Equifax, which is already facing lawsuits and investigations related to the breach. The company's stock has fallen nearly 20% since just before the hack was announced last week.

Pro Cyber
Open-Source Software in Spotlight After Equifax Breach

As cybersleuths work to uncover the exact vulnerability hackers exploited to pull off the Equifax Inc. data theft, one thing companies not wanting to be the next Equifax can do is review the types of open-source software used in applications they deploy and then look for ways to more effectively mitigate those threats.

A recent report from Sonatype--a software supply chain automation firm--found just 57% of organizations have a software governance policy, while 65% don't have meaningful controls over what components go into the apps they use.

Some software specialists say there is little hope for an organization to undertake such a review without the use of technology. "Even for organizations that are aware and concerned, if they are dealing with this problem through any mechanism that isn't automated, they are going to have a hard time scaling," said Wayne Jackson, chief executive of Sonatype.

Having an automated process can help catch errors that manual systems usually miss, said Mr. Jackson, citing the potential for misnaming deliberately or not.

"If you're a relatively sophisticated organization you need to create an organizational inventory of where open-source exists in your software infrastructure &then prioritize remediation based on risk," said Mr. Jackson. "If I'm Bank XYZ, I want to know what my apps are, what's in them and if what is on them is good or bad."

Lev Lesokhin, executive vice president of strategy and analytics at CAST, a software analysis and measurement company, said executives involved in cybersecurity should take an inventory of the open-source components used in their business-critical software and identify the specific vulnerabilities to which they might be particularly susceptible.

"Organizations that use a lot of open-source components should put tighter structural software-quality controls in place for those applications which control critical data," he said.

"Teams should make sure they are using the latest automation to control the way their open-source frameworks are configured and how they interface to your own custom components."

Equifax Hack Could Slow Down Fast Loans; In the wake of the breach, online lenders re-evaluate quick approval procedures for confirming a potential borrower's identity

The goal of digital lending in recent years has been to make credit decisions quickly and cheaply. The Equifax Inc. data breach could force some lenders to hit the brakes.

Lenders and data providers said that in the wake of the breach "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765", they are evaluating procedures for confirming a potential borrower's identity. Equifax, like other credit-reporting companies, played a big role in helping these firms verify borrowers' identities, selling them access to a database that could quickly match up a person's identifying information.

Unlike traditional banks, which may lend to people who walk into a branch, or to customers they know well through checking accounts or other products, newer online lenders take applications from unknown people, entirely online.

To compete with banks, firms such as LendingClub Corp. and Kabbage Inc. often promise near-instant approval for online personal or small-business loans, and make it easy to submit applications online or even through a mobile app. Some firms, like Quicken Loans Inc.'s Rocket Mortgage, even offer the same for home loans.

To offer such speedy access, one measure used by many lenders is to check customers' submitted Social Security numbers and other personal information against databases owned by Equifax and peers TransUnion and Experian PLC. If the data match up, the person is likely who they say they are.

Such a check is relatively inexpensive, roughly 5 cents to 50 cents per application, according to lenders. The price is low because such databases are well established and don't involve sophisticated analysis, and are effective enough in catching more blatant fraud attempts.

Now, however, those checks could become less effective in weeding out someone putting in a loan application with a false identity. The Equifax breach compromised personal identification data "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-customer-complaints-continue-to-pile-up-1505080789" exposing names, dates of birth, addresses and Social Security numbers. In some cases, drivers' license data may have also been exposed.

"Most banks and many financial technology companies rely on drivers' license validation or Social Security validation," said Zach Perret, chief executive of Plaid Technologies Inc., which connects companies to bank data for transacting and verification. "It will be hard to rely on them to verify identities going forward."

The complexity for these lenders is that updating procedures can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. Tools such as verifying images of a driver's license or using a phone's thumbprint reader can cost as much as $10 per application, lenders say. Firms also have added steps such as making small deposits in a borrower's bank account, and verifying them, before making a loan.

"There are some really great tools out there, but the industry today mostly uses older [identification] methodologies," Mr. Perret said. "Even though we know that 143 million peoples' data has been compromised, it could still take years for the industry to catch up and move to new identity validation standards."

LendingClub and Kabbage said they have previously incorporated tools beyond credit bureaus into their verification methods and were monitoring fraud rates for any sign of uptick. Quicken Loans declined to comment.

Dave Girouard, CEO of online lender Upstart Network Inc., said that as a rule of thumb, each additional document a company asks a borrower to produce reduces completed applications by 15%.

Upstart does verify borrowers' income information, which it says weeds out more bad loans, and is on balance worth the cost. It also asks for information such as where a person went to school and verifies bank accounts.

These tools can be relatively expensive, and some customers may not want to give up that information. But Mr. Girouard said the extra steps have curtailed fraud.

Lenders' profit margin from making a loan, which then tends to be sold on to investors, tends to be thin to begin with. And for every loan they make, lenders turn down hundreds or thousands of applicants. Identify verification, which helps to reduce fraud and fulfills regulatory obligations to know who you are lending to, is a big part of the cost of lending.

Plus, asking for more information perhaps the easiest way to update security procedures can discourage some legitimate borrowers.

Scott Carter, CEO of ID Analytics LLC, said that while larger lenders already tend to use more advanced methods for verifying identity, many firms may now need to invest in new systems.

"Smaller lenders with less volume can be less sophisticated in their fraud practices and this can impact their exposure to new fraud threats," he said. "But there are exceptions. There are a few small lenders that are very sophisticated and a few large ones that aren't."

Some lenders said they breathed a sigh of relief that the Equifax breach didn't extend to deeper data about customers, such as their detailed history of things like prior addresses or credit amounts outstanding. They also said that past breaches have already made them wary of basic identifying information.

One executive of a company that works with several lenders on verification, including some that use Equifax, said theft of detailed credit histories specific details of a person's borrowings and credit cards, for example would have been far worse than what occurred, the "nuclear weapon" of credit fraud. In that case, even lenders using more advanced steps, like testing whether a borrower can pick out an address where they have never lived, would be compromised.

"When I first saw [the Equifax headline], my heart sank," he said. "There would be no way to tell when identity theft occurs."

Still, because the stolen data included Social Security numbers, driver's licenses and other identifying information, lenders said the breach was more dangerous than, say, thefts of credit-card numbers. Those can be changed and aren't used to confirm borrower identity.

So even firms that aren't Equifax clients are weighing whether they need to make changes.

"We immediately started looking at alternatives, to ensure that we're ready to handle what may come right now," said Krishna Gopinathan, CEO of Applied Data Finance, an online lending credit-analysis firm that doesn't use Equifax for identity verification.

ITG Executive Jamie Selway Withdraws as Candidate for Top Regulatory Role

What Equifax Hack Means for CFPB

The huge Equifax Inc. hack has added fuel to debates about the future of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its new rule to ban forced arbitration in consumer financial contracts.

After the credit-reporting firm said Thursday that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765", Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups rushed to voice support for the CFPB, the only federal agency with broad authority to supervise the credit-reporting sector.

The news gave CFPB supporters a fresh chance to point to the need to protect the authority of the agency, which was created under the Obama administration and now faces renewed attacks from congressional Republicans, Trump administration officials and the financial-services industry. Backers of the bureau have already found a solid example in the phony-accounts scandal at Wells Fargo & Co., which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargos-year-of-scandal-stretches-on-1504863001" a year after the CFPB and other regulators punished the company.

The Equifax news could "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-hack-likely-to-scramble-deregulatory-efforts-1504898734" accused of harming consumers with inaccurate credit reports. The CFPB said the bureau was looking into the data breach, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as some congressional panels, have started their own probes.

In addition to reigniting a broad discussion about the CFPB's role, Equifax's response to the hack gave consumer advocates an opportunity to argue for the importance of the new arbitration rule, which some Republican lawmakers want to overturn. The rule will make it easier for consumers to band together to sue financial-services companies by banning clauses in contracts that lock consumers into going into arbitration to resolve disputes.

After disclosing the data breach, Equifax offered a free one-year credit-report monitoring service to affected consumers. But angry responses soon started flying in: People complained the service required its users to waive their right to sue Equifax.

"This is one more reminder why @CFPB rule blocking forced arbitration is so important to protect the rights of working Americans," tweeted Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio). "The @CFPB's new rule would stop companies like @Equifax from avoiding legal accountability like this as long as @GOP doesn't reverse it," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a close CFPB ally, said in her tweet.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, also a Democrat, said in a tweet that the company's language forcing customers with disputes into arbitration, rather than suing the company, "unacceptable and unenforceable." He said his office has demanded that Equifax remove the language.

Equifax said late Friday that the arbitration clause and class-action waiver don't apply to the hack.

The reactions from Democratic officials come as GOP lawmakers in the Senate accelerate their efforts to thwart the arbitration rule, finalized in July, using a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act. While House Republican overwhelmingly voted to support their version of the bill, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-effort-to-overturn-arbitration-rule-at-risk-from-republican-defectors-1502020803", making them the target of intense lobbying efforts.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Equifax Customer Complaints Continue to Pile Up

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Equifax Inc. struggled over the weekend with its response to its massive data breach as consumers continued to criticize the credit-reporting company's efforts and cited ongoing problems with a website set up to help them.

Regulators, meanwhile, are urging consumers to freeze their credit reports, a move some lenders fear could ding credit growth even as the finance industry struggles with the question of how to contain the potential for widespread fraud that could affect millions of Americans.

Despite Equifax's statement Friday evening that it had cleaned up many of the problems on its website, consumers said they were still receiving erroneous and confusing responses. Some said they made up fake last names and social security numbers and received responses from the site that suggest it didn't recognize they were fictitious identities.

The issues add to consumer ire over the data breach, which has exposed vital personal identification data including social security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth of potentially as many as 143 million Americans. The hack is second in size to only one that was disclosed by Yahoo last year but potentially the most dangerous to date given the vital gatekeeper role firms such as Equifax play in terms of consumer credit and people's personal information.

Kris Rockwell of Atlanta, Georgia on Sunday morning said she went to Equifax's website and entered random letters from the alphabet in the name field and all zeros in the social security number field. The response was that she "probably ha[d] been hacked," she said in an email. "Are they kidding us?"

Some consumers trying to visit the site also received a warning message that "attackers might be trying to steal [their] information from the website." That raised further concerns for already jittery consumers.

An Equifax spokesman said that the data file "likely contains a very limited number of names and numbers that do not connect to real people. But to reiterate, the key point is that every person potentially impacted is in the file."

Some consumers will be receiving letters in the mail from Equifax informing them that they have likely been impacted by the breach.

Meanwhile, authorities were urging consumers to do more than sign up for the free credit-monitoring service now being offered by Equifax. The office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent an email to state residents Saturday telling them to consider placing a freeze on their credit reports. The email said it would make it harder for someone to open a new account in their name. It added that tax identity fraud was a possible result of the Equifax hack since social security numbers were compromised. Similarly, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office issued a release on Friday recommending, among other things, that consumers contact each of the main credit-reporting firms to freeze their credit reports.

Equifax's offer of the free one-year credit monitoring service includes freezing people's credit reports at their firm but not elsewhere. Consumers would have to contact other firms on their own.

Credit freezes prevent lenders from being able to get copies of prospective customer's credit reports. That prevents swindlers from opening credit cards or other loans but also places that same limit on the legitimate customers unless they undo the freeze, says credit specialist John Ulzheimer.

For lenders, though, the prospect of millions of Americans freezing their credit raises the possibility of a crimp in lending. That could dent profits at some firms and, if the issue became widespread enough, could hamper economic growth.

At the same time, lenders have to deal with the data breach and the possibility it raises of widespread fraud. Banks and other lenders stand to incur losses on fraudulent loans and credit cards opened in consumers names with data pilfered from Equifax.

"There will be some impact on lending over time, but the more immediate challenge facing financial institutions is authentication," meaning making sure that the people who apply for loans and those using existing accounts are who they say they are, said a credit card executive at a large bank.

Credit specialists are stumped as to how the cleanup process will work here. In most cases, credit-reporting firms aren't in a position to validate whether a loan application is legitimate. That is the responsibility of the lender receiving the application, who relies on the files at credit-reporting companies to help determine whether the loan applicant is creditworthy.

Major lenders typically add information to credit reports when consumers apply for credit and if they receive loans. When fraudulent activity has been added to those reports, consumers as well as lenders need to get involved to inform the credit-reporting companies that the accounts are fraudulent.

Banks for decades have relied on credit-reporting firms as a key source of verifying consumers' identities to issue credit to them. While Equifax has said that the consumer credit reports weren't involved in the breach, the pieces of information that were stolen are enough in many cases for swindlers to open accounts in other people's names.

In some cases, if swindlers open up payday loans or loans from other nonmainstream lenders, those won't end up on the credit reports with the big three credit bureaus. That could make it more difficult to spot future fraud by effectively creating a shadow type of loan that consumers would be unaware of, even if they check their credit reports. In many cases consumers would only find out when lenders or collection firms contacted them.

Reinsurers Will Largely Be Writing the Checks to Pay for Irma Damage

By Leslie Scism

A global array of reinsurance companies will bear the financial brunt of Hurricane Irma's damage to potentially millions of homes across Florida.

Irma's winds are expected to leave tens of billions of dollars in insured damage. And when the insurance money arrives for many homeowners, much of it will be via reinsurance companies not the carrier on their contract.

Reinsurers play an especially large role in Florida's home-insurance market.

Andrew, Katrina and other severe hurricanes from 1992 through 2005 devastated the state's insurance marketplace. Most brand-name national home insurers sharply reduced their presence. Picking up the slack today is a state-run "insurer of last resort," Citizens Property Insurance Corp., and some 50 small to midsize home insurers.

Those carriers all are required to buy ample amounts of reinsurance to help ensure they have money for their policyholders, because they don't have the fat capital cushions of the national carriers. These reinsurance firms are specialty insurers that take on the risk of some of the policies sold by primary insurers. They send insurers money to help pay claims once claims reach contractual, designated levels.

As a result, the reinsurers "might end up holding the bag" for much of Irma's damage to residential properties, said Taoufik Gharib, a senior director at Standard & Poor's Global Ratings.

In addition to reinsurance, the U.S. government's National Flood Insurance Program will face payouts to those homeowners who hold its policies. Under standard homeowners contracts, insurers cover wind damage but exclude flooding. Much of Irma's damage is expected to come from storm surge.

The use of so much reinsurance introduces a few worries into the marketplace. The home insurers are exposed to potential disputes with their reinsurers over claims payments, industry analysts note. It also ties the home insurers' fates to the financial health of their reinsurers.

Irma's arrival is well-timed from one perspective: The global reinsurance industry is awash in capital. As of March, it had a record $605 billion capital cushion, which was built up thanks in large part to relatively few major natural disasters in the U.S. since 2005.

"Every company in Florida has reinsurance," said Joseph Petrelli, president of Demotech Inc., an insurance ratings firm with a specialty in Florida's homeowners market. "They buy reinsurance for multiple storms, and it is across the entire season."

The national carriers now account for only about one-fifth of Florida's market, far less than the more than half they commanded in 1992, according to S&P. The replacements include such companies as Universal Insurance Holdings Inc., Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc. and HCI Group Inc.

The state runs a reinsurance company itself, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, that provides much of the reinsurance. The next biggest providers to insurers in the state are Lloyd's of London, Bermuda-based Everest Re Group Ltd. , Germany-based Allianz SE and Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. in Japan, according to Fitch Ratings.

Many reinsurers that sell to Florida's home insurers are in Bermuda, which has grown into a global reinsurance capital in part by specializing in the state's hurricane risk.

In at least one instance, the reinsurance comes from Omaha, Neb. HCI Group Chief Executive Paresh Patel says a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is one of its several reinsurers.

The heavy reliance on this behind-the-scenes backstop community sent reinsurance stocks tumbling over the past week as Irma's power grew, while well-known national homeowners insurers like Allstate Corp. were down more modestly.

Many reinsurers fell sharply last week, when fear about Irma's danger to Florida began growing. Among the big decliners: Axis Capital Holdings Ltd. , Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd. , and Validus Holdings Ltd.

Aside from reinsurance, some insurance firms use "catastrophe bonds" to help offset their risk from a natural disaster. Because interest rates have been low since the global financial crisis of 2008, many yield-hungry pension plans, endowments and other big investors have pumped money into these securities.

The popularity of "cat bonds" has fueled competition with traditional reinsurance companies. Premium rates for catastrophe reinsurance for property have fallen about half since 2011, according to reinsurance brokers.

The "massive amount of new capital" flowing into cat bonds and the other reinsurance investments was a pivotal factor in allowing the smaller insurers to take on responsibility that the national carriers shed, said Kevin McCarty, a founder of Celtic Global Consulting LLC and former Florida insurance commissioner. As prices were driven down, these smaller firms could buy more reinsurance.

Many analysts say Harvey and Irma and other disasters this year would need to top $100 billion in insured damage before prices would harden, given how much capital there is. Risk-modeling firms estimate that insured damage from Harvey will be between $25 billion and $35 billion, while some early estimates put Irma's in the tens of billions of dollars also.

To help insure that reinsurance arrangements are adequate, Florida insurance regulators annually run a "catastrophe stress test" that simulates the impact of major hurricanes and the insurers' ability to pay claim, a spokeswoman for Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation said.

Nestled in House Spending Bill: Campaign-Finance Deregulation

By Cezary Podkul

WASHINGTON House Republicans are backing several provisions that could reshape campaign-finance rules ahead of next year's midterm elections as spending negotiations continue this fall.

The measures are included in a GOP package of spending bills being debated in the House. While the House package is unlikely to advance in the Senate, its provisions could become bargaining chips in the negotiations leading up to the next government-funding deadline, now Dec. 8.

Under one deregulatory measure in the spending package, churches may be able to contribute to candidates without fear of losing their tax-exempt status, furthering President Donald Trump's promise to "get rid of and totally destroy" a law that forbids such activity.

Corporations also would be able to ask their employees to donate to unlimited numbers of trade associations' political-action groups instead of limiting employee solicitations to one group per year.

Other measures included in the bill would continue to prevent the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission from implementing rules that would affect political activities of 501(C)(4) nonprofits and publicly traded corporations, respectively.

And the government would still be prohibited from requiring federal contractors to disclose their political contributions and campaign expenditures.

The multiple provisions called riders are prompting pushback from campaign-finance watchdogs, who generally favor tighter restrictions on money in politics. The provisions have been sought by religious or business groups, who have argued they are otherwise hamstrung from fully participating in the political process.

Riders are frequently inserted into appropriation bills as a way to pass controversial policies without having them voted on individually, because they would "ride along" with a larger spending bill.

It is unclear which House members inserted the language into the bill, which was drafted by the Republican majority. House Democrats tried to strike many of the provisions but didn't succeed. The House is expected to debate and possibly vote on a package of spending bills that includes the riders as early as this week.

On Friday, the House passed a bill to fund the government until Dec. 8. Lawmakers hope to pass a longer-term spending bill in December.

"It's as many riders as has been done in this area. Probably the most," said Fred Wertheimer, president of the group Democracy 21 and an architect of the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance overhaul bill. His concern, he said, is that the riders would enable "secret money" to "flow into elections."

On Thursday, Democracy 21 and about 20 other organizations sent a letter to House members asking them to oppose the riders.

The religious rider would allow churches to skirt the so-called Johnson Amendment. Named after its primary sponsor when he was senator, the late Lyndon Johnson, the 1954 rule prohibits 501(C)(3) nonprofit organizations such as churches from endorsing or opposing political candidates. While the IRS has rarely enforced the ban, the rider could give violators a free pass.

The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group, is lobbying to repeal the Johnson Amendment and has worked with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) to introduce a bill that would do so, according to its website.

"A nonprofit organization should not lose its tax-exempt status or be threatened with audits because it exercises its constitutional right to speak in favor of political candidates who share the organization's values and mission," the group argues.

The group didn't return a request for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Scalise, who was shot at a congressional baseball practice in June and has been in rehabilitation ever since, said his bill would prevent "unelected IRS bureaucrats from stifling the free speech of religious leaders and others under the auspices of the Johnson Amendment."

Another provision would continue to prevent the IRS from implementing a long-stalled rule that would better define the limits on political activities of organizations exempt from income taxes under section 501(C)(4) of the tax code. By law, such organizations are supposed to be "operated exclusively" for social-welfare purposes, but the IRS has interpreted the law to allow them to spend as much as 49% of their money on political causes.

Campaign-finance watchdogs like Mr. Wertheimer have pushed the IRS for years to limit its definition of social-welfare spending to eschew political expenditures. The long-running issue gained public notice in 2013, when the IRS apologized for targeting 501(c)(4) applications by tea-party and other conservative groups for closer scrutiny. The IRS subsequently proposed a rule aimed at clarifying limits on political activity by such groups. But many GOP lawmakers as well as a range of advocacy groups raised concerns, leading to the congressionally imposed moratorium.

The rider on the rule over disclosure of political spending by corporations wouldn't allow the SEC to "study, develop, propose, finalize, issue, or implement" the rule-making during the government's next fiscal year, a stronger prohibition than under existing law.

Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have opposed greater disclosure of political activity. They have argued to the SEC that forcing businesses to disclose political giving would hurt companies and their stockholders by "burdening, and in some cases preventing, corporations' participation in the political process."

ITG Executive Jamie Selway Withdraws as Candidate for Top Regulatory Role

By Dave Michaels and Alexander Osipovich

WASHINGTON The top candidate to run the Securities and Exchange Commission's division overseeing stock exchanges and most trading firms has withdrawn from consideration, according to people familiar with the matter.

Jamie Selway, a managing director at Investment Technology Group Inc., dropped out of the process last week, the people said. He would have been one of the last major staff hires by new SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, who announced directors of two other SEC divisions last week.

Mr. Selway emerged as the top candidate to run the SEC's Trading and Markets division early in the summer. His hiring had been subject to a long delay, the people said.

Mr. Selway is an electronic-trading expert who is widely respected on Wall Street and would have been the first nonlawyer to run the SEC division in nearly a decade. In the role, he could have taken charge of a review of the SEC's landmark trading rules known as Regulation NMS.

Market participants credit those rules with ending the effective duopoly of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc., but say they also led to the proliferation of stock exchanges and a surge in high-frequency trading.

ITG paid $20.3 million in 2015 to settle SEC claims that it ran a secret program called "Project Omega" in 2010 and 2011 that traded against clients, despite having told customers that its business didn't interact with their orders.

During a review of the program, Mr. Selway, who joined ITG in August 2010, found evidence suggesting that another ITG executive involved with the program had accessed private client data, and Mr. Selway brought the finding to ITG's compliance team. The program was temporarily taken offline and an outside lawyer was brought in to review the trading program. Mr. Selway was never implicated in wrongdoing at the firm.

ITG's chief executive at the time, Robert Gasser, was ousted after an investigation by the outside law firm found that he hadn't disclosed to ITG's board of directors some details of alleged improprieties.

WSJ Pro: Bank Indonesia Moves to Boost Trust in Commercial Papers

By I Made Sentana

JAKARTA Bank Indonesia has tightened regulation of commercial-paper issuance to improve investors' confidence in the securities.

Companies that plan to issue commercial papers must get investment grades from one of Indonesia's ratings companies. They also must issue commercial papers equal to $10 million, and the minimum subscription for a single investor is $50,000, said Nanang Hendarsyah, head of financial-market development department at Bank Indonesia.

Previously a rating wasn't necessary. As a result, many issuers didn't honor their obligations after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Investors lost confidence in the securities, Mr. Hendarsyah said, and offerings of commercial papers came to a halt.

Issuers can sell commercial papers to only institutional investors.

The new regulation on commercial papers is part of Bank Indonesia's efforts to develop the domestic financial market.

Employees of Fintech Firm SoFi Allege Women Are Treated Improperly

By Peter Rudegeair

Social Finance Inc., a fintech company whose hard-charging ethos propelled it to success, is grappling with accusations about its workplace culture that mirror a broader storm about the treatment of women at Silicon Valley technology startups.

In interviews, nearly a dozen current and former employees working in various departments told The Wall Street Journal that some executives, including the company's former finance chief, engaged in or tolerated what they described as improper behavior toward women in recent years.

Nino Fanlo, who was SoFi's chief financial officer until the end of May, said he occasionally complimented both men and women's outfits and touched both men and women's shoulders to try to be friendly. "It wasn't sexual," he said.

SoFi's board said Mr. Fanlo "left the company in May 2017 to pursue another executive opportunity. He no longer has any relationship with the company."

Separately, SoFi's board disclosed after questioning from the Journal that in 2012 it paid money to settle a dispute between a lower-level employee and Chief Executive Michael Cagney. The nature of the dispute isn't known, but the board said it didn't involve a sexual relationship.

The allegations levied against SoFi occur against a backdrop of debate within Silicon Valley about the culture of startups. Numerous companies in recent years have been the subject of accusations of improper conduct or hostile work environments. One of the industry's leading players, Uber Technologies Inc., has been criticized for its treatment of women in the workplace, which was one factor in the resignation of Travis Kalanick. its high-profile chief executive and founder.

SoFi was started six years ago and has thrived as it courted money managers into funding the loans it made to graduates of top-ranked universities. The San Francisco company has raised nearly $2 billion from investors, including a $500 million funding round this year, and recently signaled it was moving closer to an initial public offering.

Employees describe a culture inside its headquarters in the Presidio neighborhood in San Francisco and a call center in nearby Healdsburg, Calif., where they felt pressure to work extra hours at night and on holidays to avoid being fired. Mr. Cagney, 46 years old, used to tell SoFi staff that if they weren't waking up twice a week in a cold sweat, they weren't working hard enough, according to a former staffer.

Some of those employees said that the culture veered out of control at times, with executives breaking furniture and throwing telephones out of anger.

A SoFi spokesman said that the company had experienced strong growth and that it has been adding staff "to make sure we deliver the experience SoFi members and applicants expect while creating the internal culture we want."

On Aug. 11, a former operations manager, Brandon Charles, sued the company in a wrongful-termination claim, adding that a fellow manager had harassed female employees by making sexual or inappropriate comments. SoFi has said it investigated Mr. Charles's claims and found them to be meritless.

Less than 24 hours after Mr. Charles amended his lawsuit on Aug. 31, a companywide note sent by Mr. Cagney said that SoFi had launched an investigation into sexual-harassment claims.

Mr. Charles's lawsuit claimed that Mr. Cagney fostered a culture of "male bravado" in which sexual harassment was permitted.

A separate suit was filed last month by a group of former employees that accused the firm of pushing staff to work long hours without proper compensation. SoFi said it takes any allegations of unfair treatment seriously and it is reserving further comment until it responds to the complaint in court.

Mr. Cagney wrote to employees in his note that outside attorneys would look into other sexual-harassment claims. The investigation Cagney alluded to isn't into claims made in Mr. Charles's lawsuit or the other lawsuit.

He said in the companywide note that as SoFi was preparing its response to Mr. Charles's lawsuit, it discovered several people were prepared to "formally allege" they were witnesses to or victims of "improper activity" at the company's operations center in Healdsburg.

Although the company is growing quickly, "Our rapid expansion is no excuse for bad behavior in the workplace," Mr. Cagney wrote.

In the past year, SoFi's staff has doubled to more than 1,200 people, a company representative said.

In 2012, a dispute between Mr. Cagney and an employee led to an investigation by the company's board, which hadn't been previously reported.

Last week, SoFi's board issued a statement to the Journal saying, "The board concluded that it was in the best interests of all parties to reach a settlement. ... There was no allegation or evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship between Mr. Cagney and the employee."

The employee is no longer with the company and declined to comment. Mr. Cagney said he never had any relationship with a current or former SoFi employee, except for his wife, who works at SoFi.

Neither Mr. Cagney nor the company would discuss the nature of the dispute that led to the settlement, citing confidentiality agreements.

More than half a dozen former employees told the Journal that there were workplace issues involving Mr. Fanlo. He would commonly make comments about the physical appearance of female employees and touch their shoulders in ways that made them uneasy, according to ex-workers who experienced both behaviors.

Mr. Charles's lawsuit said Mr. Fanlo "touched women inappropriately, and made them feel uncomfortable."

Mr. Fanlo said that no one raised complaints with him and that he would have stopped had he known it made employees uncomfortable.

"I would have said,  Geez, I'm sorry,'" had those gestures been interpreted in that way.

Another former employee described a loan-review meeting that Mr. Fanlo attended along with the former employee, alleging that he made comments about a female applicant's breasts in front of other staff members. Mr. Fanlo said he didn't recall any such meeting.

SoFi has produced solid financial results. In the second quarter, SoFi reported record revenue of over $143 million and adjusted profit of $61.6 million, according to a letter to investors that was reviewed by the Journal.

SoFi is also experiencing some growing pains as it moves to expand its business into mortgages, life insurance, wealth management, and digital-banking applications. Among its other expansion plans, SoFi plans to take its business to foreign countries and roll out a family of funds it would manage for investors.

The company is also trying to open a bank in Utah. That move has drawn opposition from consumer-advocacy groups that question its commitment to lower-income borrowers, as well as questions from a powerful member of Congress.

SoFi's plans to branch out beyond its original student-loan refinancing business have hit snags. Efforts to move into the U.K. and Australia have been delayed.

The company has fallen short of its goal to have $287 million in assets under management by 2016 in its fledgling wealth-advisory business, according to presentations and filings reviewed by the Journal. As of September, the latest figure was $12 million.

The company is also trying to build an asset-management business, a project that gained steam after SoFi acquired Mr. Cagney's hedge-fund firm, Cabezon Investment Group LLC, last year in a deal valued at $3.25 million. Former Cabezon employees are working on plans to offer funds that would hold the riskier parts of bonds backed by SoFi's consumer loans, according to the filings and documents.

Some SoFi shareholders had worried that Cabezon had become a distraction to Mr. Cagney. In early 2015, when SoFi was previously considering whether it should file for a public offering, Cabezon suffered a deep loss after it bet wrong on a move in the Swiss franc.

A SoFi spokesman said Mr. Cagney "recused himself from all board discussions and decisions related to the acquisition" of Cabezon, which has $200 million in assets and generates annual fees including $1 million in management fees and "performance fees that have historically been many multiples of that."

WSJ Pro: Philadelphia Fed Launches Initiative to Study Consumer Finance

By Yuka Hayashi

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia launched Friday an initiative to study consumer behavior and its effect on the economy and financial system.

The new Consumer Finance Institute will bring together scholars, financial companies, consumer groups and regulators to share insights on consumer finance and help inform policy decisions that affect the U.S. economy, the Philadelphia Fed said in a press release.

The regional Fed bank said the institute will build on consumer-related research it has done in the past in areas such as credit cards, student loans, homeownership and payment systems.

"The absence of a fully developed field of robust research on consumer credit fundamentally indicates that we didn't acknowledge that it touches every aspect of the economy," Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said in a speech delivered at the bank's conference on consumer behavior in credit and payments markets. "Consumer issues are intertwined and interwoven, inextricable from virtually every economic issue."

The new institute also will enable the Philadelphia Fed to expand its research on consumer payment markets.

Analyze This: New Bank Research Rules Spark Price War in Europe

By Max Colchester and Christopher Whittall

How much are investment research reports actually worth?

The answer: less than the banks that produce them think.

In Europe a tug of war is playing out between banks and asset managers over the value of research that floods investors' inboxes every day urging them to buy or sell securities.

Currently banks dole out reports to asset managers for free, hoping to recoup the cost through commissions on trading. But as of Jan. 3 this opaque pricing system will be altered in Europe. New rules mean asset managers will have to disclose how much they spend on research every year.

That means putting a price on research. And banks and asset managers aren't seeing eye-to-eye.

As the haggling gets under way a price-war has broken out. Earlier this year, banks were quoting Olivier de Larouzire, head of interest rates at Natixis Asset Management, an annual fee of as much as  300,000 for his firm to have unfettered access to fixed-income research and meetings with analysts. Since then, most banks' prices have plummeted, he said, to around  70,000 on average, though some are still trying to charge about  150,000.

"The gap has clearly narrowed a lot," said Mr. de Larouzire. But he still gets "very, very different proposals," he added.

Overall total spending on research and trading execution could fall by up to $3 billion, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman.

Banks are increasingly at odds over the scope of research coverage to offer clients and how much to charge for it. Some are still hoping to negotiate big fees into the millions of dollars a year with the biggest asset managers. Others are looking to give away some of their research reports for free.

Credit Suisse Group AG is exploiting a loophole in the new regulations to offer some basic bond research free of charge online, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Swiss bank hopes to make money by charging for access to analysts instead, this person said. Dutch bank ING Groep said Tuesday it will be giving away some of its economics analysis for nothing, as a way to promote its brand.

For equity research banks are hoping to charge a little more. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is toward the bottom of the pack, quoting basic access to read-only equity reports for $10,000 a year, according to a person familiar with the matter, with prices steadily increasing for clients who want more face-time with top analysts.

At the other end of the scale, Barclays PLC is trying to price its research as a premium product, according to several clients.

Asset managers are working out how much of this research they actually want.

"It's made us have quality control. How much do I really need?" said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for fixed income at AXA Investment Managers.

Several investment firms asked their fund managers to rank research based on what was essential, helpful or useless. The results showed a lot of research is never read.

The new rules are "very bad for the price of bad research," said Neil Scarth, principal at Frost Consulting & Advisory. But they could also make the cost of access to top quality analysis increase, he adds.

Under the current system, equity investors pay a commission fee to a broker when they trade. Part of that fee goes toward executing the trade and a portion is retained to pay for additional services, including equity research.

So there is some idea of how much equity research should cost. The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority estimates U.K. investment managers pay around 3 billion of dealing commissions a year to brokers, of which half is spent on research.

In fixed-income investing, however, the two sides are heading into uncharted waters. Banks currently provide fixed-income research to clients for free in the hope they'd direct business their way in the form of trading bonds or currencies.

The new rules are part of a revision of an EU law that is implemented by regulators across the trading bloc. One of its aims is to stop asset managers receiving "inducements" to trade with certain brokers and guarantee value for investors.

Fixed income managers aren't delighted at the prospect of transparency. Many see paying for research as an extra cost that must either be passed onto their clients or taken from their own profits.

"Spreads will not come down because of this," said Craig MacDonald, global head of fixed income at Standard Life Aberdeen , adding that it costs a similar amount to trade with some brokers who don't provide research as those that do.

To push down research prices, fund managers are telling the banks: You need us more than we need you. Meeting bank analysts may be helpful to gauge the mood in the broader investment community, but the exchange of information cuts both ways.

They also exploited banks' overriding concern that if money managers didn't buy their research, they would trade with them less. "If you have no relationship in terms of research, how strong will your relationship stay in terms of execution?" said Mr. de Larouzire.

Mr. de Larouzire said his business uses around 50 research providers now, but he intends to cut that by more than half. He said he was now getting research quotes "at very low prices because they need to be on that list."

The adoption of the new European rules is complicated by the fact that in the U.S. the rules are in conflict. EU asset managers will have an obligation to pay for research. However U.S. firms, that aren't registered investment advisers, are prohibited from receiving direct payments. But analysts expect this to change.

"Research is a product that is going to be sold everywhere," said Elliot Hand, a manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. "This will become standard."

Equifax Breach Raises Fraud Risks

Equifax' data breach raises risks of increased fraud. More attempts at tax fraud may occur in the upcoming tax season, says Matthew Morris, partner at law firm Bowditch & Dewey. Morris, who specializes in part in individual tax, He says middle and low-income wage earners are more likely to be victims because more income tax is withheld from their paychecks throughout the year than is typically owed after deductions and credits have been claimed. Another risk: medical fraud, says Liz Weston, financial planner at NerdWallet. Personal identifying information could be used to impersonate victims to get medical care, falsify claims or fraudulently get government benefits, she says. This could create medical debt, and potentially mix a crook's medical history records with those of the victim, she says. (veronica.dagher@wsj.com; @VeronicaDagher)

Equifax Security Concerns Cited a Year Ago

Well before Equifax (EFX) disclosed a data breach affecting as many as 143 million U.S. consumers this week, investment research firm MSCI warned that the credit-reporting firm faced a high risk of security breaches and data theft. In August 2016, MSCI noted an earlier breach, compromising tax and salary data for 431,000 employees of a customer, and called the company's data and privacy policies limited, with scant evidence it regularly audited information-security systems. Those findings plus concerns over CEO pay and marketing practices helped push MSCI's corporate-governance rating for EFX to the lowest level possible level. (theo.francis@wsj.com; @theofrancis)

Chinese Initial Coin Offering Ban May Boost ICOs Elsewhere

The ban by Chinese authorities on issuance of new cryptocurrencies via initial coin offerings may boost ICOs in other countries, according to a blockchain entrepreneur. "They could've invested the money into Chinese ICOs, now they can't," says Volodymyr Panchenko, founder of DMarket, a startup that's planning an ICO in the US. "Money will have to leave the country and they will seek opportunities to invest elsewhere." Panchenko says he expects a greater demand for ICOs in the U.S. and Europe as a result of the ban announced earlier this week. Several Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges started delisting currency pairs as a result of the ban. (yuliya.chernova@wsj.com)

8.4M Homes, Businesses at High to Extreme Irma Wind Risk

CoreLogic says an estimated 8,456,455 residential and commercial properties in Florida are at either "Extreme," "Very High" or "High" risk of wind damage from Hurricane Irma. Meanwhile, an estimated 3,494,735 residential and commercial properties in Florida are at risk of hurricane-driven storm surge damage. Neither analysis includes potential damage from inland flooding, it said. The properties at risk of storm-surge damage far outpace the number of National Flood Insurance Program policies in place in the state. As of June 30, 1.7 million policies were owned by homeowners and small businesses, according to government data. Some homeowners and many bigger businesses get flood insurance from private-sector carriers. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

China Looks to Tighten Rules on Using Stock as Collateral

Chinese regulators are looking to tighten rules on using shares as collateral for loans, according to a statement by China Securities Depository and Clearing. A draft of revised rules sets a minimum value of 5 million yuan for pledging shares for the first time and caps investors from borrowing not more than 60% of the market value of their pledged shares. The statement said that such revisions, which come from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as well as the securities regulator, will be up for public review until Sept 22. (chao.deng@wsj.com)

Aussie Bank Ratios, Rather Than Capital, Set to Shift

The good news for Australia's major banks is that while the capital benchmarks they need to hit may be tweaked, the pot of dollars they need to isn't set to grow. The industry regulator recently flagged the big banks would need to increase capital requirements by 1.5 percentage points to hit an at least 10.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio. Wayne Byres, chairman of the industry regulator, in a speech says further adjustments are expected by year-end. But all things being equal, he says the next changes are likely to alter the target but not change the underlying requirement--a bit like measuring your height in centimeters instead of inches.

Will Irma Be an Insurance Catastrophe?

Irma could be the costliest hurricane for insurers ever, according to analysts at Barclays, outdoing even the damage done by Katrina in 2005.

The industry is already expecting significant losses upward of $10 billion from Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas last month. But this will only lead to a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-gauge-whether-irma-will-be-an-insurance-catastrophe-1504773157" such a loss isn't big enough to dent the huge amount of capital that has flooded into reinsurance risk in past decade. Since 2008, capital in the reinsurance sector has almost doubled to $605 billion at the end of March this year from $340 billion, according to Aon Benfield Analytics.

Global catastrophe losses for the reinsurance industry exceeded $55 billion last year, the fourth highest loss in the past decade, and yet reinsurance prices have still fallen. Some think it will take a single loss of more than $100 billion to turn the tide of more capital and weaker returns in reinsurance. Even a direct hit by a powerful Irma on Florida's population centers might not be big enough to buck the trend.

Fed Research Examines if QE Led Banks to Relax Lending Standards

Using confidential loan officer survey data, Robert Kurtzman, Stephan Luck and Tom Zimmermann in "http://bit.ly/2eMfXHU" show central bank asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, led banks to issue relatively more risky loans with lower lending standards. The significance of QE's effects is about the same during its first and third utilization during and after the recession, and "is comparable to the effect of a one percentage point decrease in the Fed funds target rate," the authors wrote.

Obamacare Offers Lessons for Flood-Insurance Market

The federal government has a tried model for revitalizing private insurance markets: the Affordable Care Act, Daniel Schwarcz writes in "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-fix-americas-broken-flood-insurance-scheme/2017/09/07/7cb5d2fe-93d9-11e7-aace-04b862b2b3f3_story.html?utm_term=.e7fbd5a12245". Like with Obamacare, private flood insurers shouldn't compete with a government insurer, and the government should tie flood-insurance subsidies directly to policyholders' income levels, he says. In addition, reinsurance should cap insurers' exposure in particularly catastrophic scenarios and exchanges should be established so consumers can compare private options, writes Mr. Schwarcz, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. Unlike with Obamacare, private insurers' underwriting and rating practices shouldn't be restricted because "it is both appropriate and prudent to charge individuals who own homes in flood-prone areas more for property insurance," he says.

Echoes of dotcom fever in the virtual currency boom

In 1999, the actor Whoopi Goldberg made a bold decision. Rather than be paid for an endorsement for a dotcom start-up, she took a 10 per cent stake in the business. It seemed wise. At the time, everyone was investing in internet businesses and a rush of initial public offerings was making early investors into millionaires.

I was reminded of this amid a flurry of news about the new boom in cryptocurrencies - and their celebrity backers.

Ms Goldberg's venture, Flooz, was billed as the future of money in a digital world and it hoped one day to rival the dollar. The way it worked, however, was much less revolutionary. The service resembled a gift certificate: customers paid in dollars and received Flooz balances. These could be redeemed at participating merchants, with the hope that credits would one day circulate as money in their own right.

The problem for Flooz was that little prevented mass replication of its model. One prominent competitor, Beenz, differed only slightly, by allowing its units to trade at fluctuating market prices.

Like banking syndicates before them, the ventures decided to club together for mutual benefit by accepting each other's currencies in their networks.

Even so, by 2001 both companies had failed, brought down by a lack of the one ingredient that counts most in finance: trust. Flooz was knocked by security concerns after it transpired that a Russian crime syndicate had taken advantage of its currency, while the fluctuating value of Beenz soon put users off.

Their loss turned into PayPal's gain, the latter succeeding precisely because it had set its aspirations much lower. Rather than replace established currencies, PayPal focused on improving the dollar's online mobility, notably by creating a secure network that gained public support. This, it turned out, is what people really wanted.

Did we learn anything from the failures of the internet boom? Apparently not. In what is looking increasingly like a new incarnation of dotcom fever, celebrities are endorsing virtual currency systems. Heiress and reality TV star Paris Hilton tweeted this week that she would be backing fundraising for LydianCoin , a digital token still at concept stage. It offers redemption against online artificial intelligence-assisted advertising campaigns. Baroness Michelle Mone, a businesswoman, announced she would be accepting bitcoin in exchange for luxury Dubai flats.

What is particularly striking about this path to riches is its "growing money on trees" character.

While the internet boom was dominated by IPOs, linked to a potentially profitable venture to come, this time it is " initial coin offerings " igniting investor fervour. Most ICOs do not aspire to deliver profits or returns. Indeed, from a regulatory standpoint, they cannot - most lawyers agree doing so could classify them as securities, drawing regulatory intervention which would force them into stringent listing processes.

That opinion was substantiated in July when the US Securities and Exchange Commission warned : "Virtual coins or tokens may be securities and subject to the federal securities laws" and that "it is relatively easy for anyone to use blockchain technology to create an ICO that looks impressive, even though it might actually be a scam."

So most ICOs make do by selling tokens for pre-existing virtual currencies for promises of direct redemption against online goods, services or concepts, or simply in the hope the tokens themselves will rocket in value despite offering nothing specific in return.

They still think they can succeed where other parallel currency systems have failed, by bolting into preestablished blockchain-distributed currency systems such as Ethereum or bitcoin. These already come with a network of token-owning users. But with the numbers of conventional merchants that will accept these currencies falling rather than rising, these holders need something more compelling to spend their digital wealth on.

As it stands, the real economy can only be accessed by cashing out digital currency for conventional money at cryptocurrency exchanges. This comes at some expense. But with regulators clamping down on how exchanges are governed, token holders who cannot or do not want to pass through know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures remain frozen out.

That leaves their holdings good for only three things: virtual currency speculation, which is ultimately a zero-sum game; redemption against dark-market goods or capital control circumvention.

It is assumed ICOs offering real goods, services or real estate in exchange for cryptocurrencies can somehow tap into this sizeable, albeit potentially illicit and restricted, wealth pool. Yet if competing unregulated economies really start gaining traction, governments will act.

China's central bank has already branded ICOs an illegal form of crowdfunding and more rulings are expected from other jurisdictions in coming weeks.

Then again, if history teaches us anything, the system's own propensity to cultivate fraud and unnecessary complexity in the face of more secure and regulated competition may be the more likely thing to bring it down. When given the choice, people usually opt for security.

Google parent backs use of computers to fight cancer; Technology

Google parent Alphabet's investing arm is among the backers in the latest fundraising round by Gritstone, a California-based biotech start-up which uses machine learning to develop new cancer drugs.

The investment by the GV unit, launched as Google Ventures in 2009, is the latest push into medicine by the group as Silicon Valley technology companies attempt to use their experience in analysing vast quantities of data to create new profit streams.

GV has invested an undisclosed sum in Gritstone Oncology, a two-year-old company aiming to use so-called deep learning to develop highly targeted immunotherapies , a relatively new class of drug that triggers the body's own immune response to fight cancer.

Eleven investors, led by Lilly Asia Ventures, the Asian venture capital arm of Eli Lilly, have collectively put $92.7m into Gritstone through its private second funding round, or more than three times this year's average healthcare start-up series B fundraising of $28.1m, according to CB Insights.

While early trials of immunotherapies have been very successful for a substantial minority of cancer patients - giving them months and even years of life beyond what doctors might have expected - four out of five patients tend not to respond to the drugs.

Gritstone believes that machine learning can help by developing narrower immunotherapies and matching them to the correct patient, a field of science known as precision medicine .

Andrew Allen , Gritstone's chief executive and co-founder, said that the biological processes underpinning immunotherapies were not generalisable between patients. However, computer algorithms could drill through the myriad of factors and be trained to mathematically discern signals and patterns almost undetectable to humans, Mr Allen said.

To overcome what he says is a lack of high-quality public data, the company has privately purchased and collected 200 human tumours. Gritstone scientists have analysed each one at a molecular level to provide thousands of data points that can be fed through the sensitive computer programs.

Gauging Irma's Risk to Insurance

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic storms in years, already has pounded several Caribbean islands and threatens lives and catastrophic damage in the Dominican Republic, Haiti and beyond.

For the insurance industry, it is what happens from Saturday onward that matters most. This Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of up to 185 miles an hour is heading on a track likely to take it up the east coast of Florida. If this path and the storm's strength are sustained, Irma could be the costliest hurricane for insurers ever, according to Barclays analysts, outdoing even the damage done by Katrina in 2005.

There is still uncertainty around this, and many hurricanes dissipate or change direction, but investors are already reacting. Shares of U.S.-listed insurers and reinsurers with big natural catastrophe exposures, such as Aspen Insurance, Validus, RenaissanceRe and Everest Re, have already dropped by 7% to 10% since Friday.

The industry is already expecting significant losses -- upward of $10 billion -- from Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas last month. But this will only lead to a drop in profits rather than stop the squeeze on reinsurance pricing. Such a loss isn't big enough to dent the huge amount of capital that has flooded into reinsurance risk in the past decade. Since 2008, capital in the reinsurance sector has almost doubled to $605 billion at the end of March of this year from $340 billion, according to Aon Benfield Analytics.

A lot of this capital growth has been in traditional reinsurance, but alternative capital -- in the form of catastrophe bonds and related products -- has more than quadrupled over the same period to $86 billion, or 14% of the industry total, its highest share ever.

Money has continued to flow despite declining yields on cat bonds and falling returns on equity for reinsurers, because the income investors get from both is still attractive compared with other investments, while catastrophe risk is also seen as independent of the economic cycle that affects other investments.

Global catastrophe losses for the reinsurance industry exceeded $55 billion last year, the fourth-highest loss in the past decade, and yet reinsurance prices have still fallen. Some think it will take a single loss of more than $100 billion to turn the tide of more capital and weaker returns in reinsurance. Even a direct hit by a powerful Irma on Florida's population centers might not be big enough to buck the trend.

Investors have been taking on more risk for less return in the insurance industry for some time. So far, the trade-off hasn't been too painful, but at some point that will change.

Economy
How Hurricane Harvey Will Ripple Through the U.S. Economy; Economists in The Wall Street Journal's monthly survey see hit to GDP and jobs in third quarter, followed by slow rebuild

Hurricane Harvey will distort measures of the U.S. economy in the weeks and months ahead, making it more difficult for economists and policy makers to gauge its trajectory at a sensitive time for the Federal Reserve.

Everything from jobless claims, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-jumped-as-hurricane-harvey-hit-gulf-coast-1504788016", to gross domestic product and inflation will be knocked off course, with brief spikes across a wide range of reports, economists say. And that is before any impact from Hurricane Irma, which could devastate cities across the Southeast.

It will be hard to discern whether bad reports result from storm damage and then whether good reports owe to the effects of rebuilding. The Fed, already struggling with conflicting signals as it decides the path of rate rises, must look through even greater volatility in inflation and other reports. It could be well into 2018 before the effects of the storms have fully washed out of economic data.

Forecasters in The Wall Street Journal's survey of economists expect the storm to reduce the pace of job gains by about 27,000 jobs a month in the third quarter on average, followed by little change in the fourth quarter and then a boost of 13,000 in the first quarter 2018, as many "https://www.wsj.com/articles/harveys-rebuilding-squad-your-employer-1504797709". Fed policy makers watch job growth closely for signs of whether the labor market is tightening.

Economists also expect the growth rate of gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, will fall by about 0.3 percentage points in the third quarter, followed by no effect on the fourth quarter, and a 0.2-percentage-point boost in the first quarter of 2018.

"The devastation in the surrounding Houston area, America's fourth-largest city, will be significant enough to negatively impact activity and employment nationally," said Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.

In the longer run, the storm isn't expected to have a lasting economic effect, with forecasts for GDP, unemployment, inflation and other major economic indicators unchanged for 2018 overall, according to the survey of 56 business, financial and academic economists from Sept. 1 to Sept. 5. In the months ahead, here is where economists say to watch for the storm's distortions.

Jobless Claims

Early evidence of the hurricane's impact on the U.S. job market came Thursday, when the Labor Department reported the largest one-week jump in initial jobless claims since the aftermath of superstorm Sandy in November 2012. It is likely only the beginning of a spike in unemployment filings.

In the weeks after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012, jobless claims were highest not during the week of the storm, but two weeks after. Many who were out of work from the hurricane waited until the storm had passed to file their claims.

Compared with the week of the storm, initial jobless claims rose 23% in the second week after superstorm Sandy and 30% in the second week after Hurricane Katrina.

"Irma's right behind Harvey, so that could cause claims to spike again," said Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody's Analytics.

Inflation

Measures of inflation will soon reflect Harvey, with gasoline prices spiking due to disruptions to oil refineries in the Houston area. The national average gas price was $2.66 a gallon on Wednesday, according to the AAA, up from $2.35 a month ago.

Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst of Oil Price Information Service, sees gas prices peaking near $2.75 before leveling off.

Energy prices make up 7% of the consumer-price index, with motor fuel accounting for nearly half of that. Already, the move in gas prices could raise the inflation rate, a key area of focus for Fed policy makers, by about 0.5%. With past major storms, the effect has faded within a few months. That added volatility could further sharpen the Fed's focus on core measures of inflation that exclude food and energy.

Consumer spending

With gas prices up, consumers across the country will have less cash for everything else. Every penny increase in gasoline prices reduces consumer spending by $1 billion over the course of the year, according to Mr. Sweet of Moody's.

"Consumers are going to feel it in their pocket," Mr. Sweet said.

Consumer-spending measures may also show the impact of Houston being shuttered for so long. The city has nearly three million workers and produces about $500 billion a year of gross domestic product.

That is "a non-negligible economic impact, assuming 25% of Houston area output was idled for seven days," said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics.

Housing

Before the storm, Texas was on track for a 14% increase in housing starts this year, according to James Gaines, chief economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.

In 2016, Houston alone accounted for about 4% of the nation's permitted housing. Now builders wait to assess the market as construction sites dry out and will "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-hurricane-related-shortage-construction-workers-1504798033" and repair the city.

Household Wealth

Destruction of homes and businesses doesn't show up in GDP figures, but it would show up in measures of household wealth. Many homeowners and businesses swamped by the storm didn't carry flood insurance, meaning that a large share of the over $100 billion in estimated damage could reduce household wealth.

"With so many homeowners uninsured, this is more akin to a wipeout of assets such as one would expect from a stock-market crash," said Constance Hunter, chief economist for KPMG, the accounting firm. "The effects are more negative and widespread."

But in a $19 trillion economy with 150 million workers, many of the effects will be hard to tell apart from the usual churning of such a large nation. Economic indicators can only measure so much of a storm's effect.

Ultimately, "the impact on individual lives will dwarf the economic dollar losses," said Lynn Reaser, a former Bank of America economist who is now a professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego.

Proxies are paying off for Vestar Capital Partners.

The New York-based buyout shop has agreed to sell corporate governance firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. to Genstar Capital for $720 million, a sale price that will roughly triple Vestar's original investment in the company, said a person with knowledge of the deal.

Launched in 1985, Institutional Shareholder Services offers services that include governance and proxy research, responsible investment data, analytics and advisory services, end-to-end proxy voting and distribution services, as well as securities class-action claims management services, according to a press release. The company serves roughly 3,000 clients across asset owners, asset managers, hedge funds and service providers.

Vestar originally "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0020140318ea3igmswe", including debt. Under the firm's ownership, the Rockville, Md.-based company expanded the range of services it offers and has completed five acquisitions, the press release stated. In June, for example, the company announced the acquisition of the investment climate data unit of South Pole Group. In January, the company acquired IW Financial Inc., which offers environmental, social and governance research and consulting. In August 2016, the company acquired iiWisdom LLC's interactive governance platform.

Vestar is exiting ISS in the midst of fundraising for its seventh buyout fund. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vestar-targets-1-billion-for-latest-fund-1490095808", Vestar Capital Partners VII LP received a $200 million commitment from the Washington State Investment Board in June, according to pension meeting minutes.

Insight Venture Partners Sets Sights on $5.5 Billion for New Fund; Investors' eagerness to tap software and big data  is leaving tech-focused firms flush with cash

Insight Venture Partners is seeking as much as $5.5 billion in investor dollars for its newest fund, the latest in a string of large private-equity pools being raised for deals in software and technology businesses.

The venture-capital and private-equity firm set a $5 billion target for the fund, but likely will exceed that goal, said people familiar with the matter. The fund is expected to hit its $5.5 billion hard cap on money from outside investors, one of the people said. That amount doesn't include the additional money that will come from people within the firm, another person said.

If the firm meets its goal for Insight Venture Partners X LP, the fund would be its largest pool of capital raised to date. Insight previously wrapped up a $3.29 billion flagship fund as well as a $1.46 billion co-investment vehicle in 2015.

It isn't clear whether the target and hard cap amounts for the new fund include capital the firm could raise for co-investments.

Insight disclosed in a July filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insight-venture-partners-collects-3-6-billion-so-far-for-fund-x-1500330488". It anticipates another closing this month, the people said.

The firm's ambition for Fund X is another sign of how investor eagerness to tap into Silicon Valley and other software hubs is leaving technology-focused private-equity firms, from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-equity-goes-big-with-11-billion-tech-focused-buyout-fund-1494244800" to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thoma-bravo-raises-7-6-billion-for-latest-flagship-fund-1473704895", flush with cash.

Insight, which has backed tech darlings such as Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., makes venture and buyout investments. The companies it has invested in typically have developed software and other tools to help a range of organizations, from churches to schools to enterprises, digitize their operations.

The New York firm is selling eVestment Alliance LLC, a data provider that Nasdaq Inc. on Tuesday said it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-to-buy-evestment-for-705-million-1504631789" for $705 million.

After receiving $25 million from investors less than two months ago, customer analytics company Pendo Inc. said it has acquired mobile-engagement startup Insert Inc..

Tel Aviv-based Insert was backed by Battery Ventures, which also is an investor in Pendo. The startup's Tel Aviv office will become Pendo's first international office and development center.

Pendo, based in Raleigh, N.C., announced a $25 million Series C round in July. Meritech Capital Partners led that round, joined by Battery, Contour Venture Partners, Core Capital Partners, IDEAFund Partners, Salesforce Ventures and Spark Capital.

Guru's Customer Service Support Tools Gain Backing; Funding will fuel machine learning  development

Guru Technologies Inc, which makes customer service software, has raised $9.3 million led by Emergence Capital.

The Series A round brings the company's total funding to date to around $13 million. Previous investors include FirstMark Capital and Slack Technologies.

Guru's software works as a coaching tool for sales and support teams. The platform uses bots and browser extensions to offer a layer of contextual knowledge within multiple applications like Salesforce, Gmail, Slack and Zendesk, giving employees cues and information to respond to customer inquiries more efficiently.

The Philadelphia company targets its services to large customer-facing organizations with similarly big sales teams that typically are distributed across geographic locations. Many have large call centers, and may have previously used third-party wikis or internal portals to manage customer analytics.

The funding follows a period of considerable growth for Guru, said co-founder and Chief Executive Rick Nucci. Over the past two years, the company has added more than 300 new customers.

"Now, our focus is on building out our engineering team and investing in machine learning capabilities," said Mr. Nucci, who was the co-founder of Boomi (acquired by Dell in 2010). "We are introducing features that act very similar to how Amazon might recommend something to a user."

It's a tool that reduces the time it takes for employees to respond to customer queries and cracking down on redundant questions. The firm noticed the traction Guru had with customers like Square Inc., Shopify Inc., and TaskRabbit Inc, according to Emergence Capital Principal Jake Saper, as well as their growth since launching in 2013.

"These are customers who are all pretty savvy and are really leaning into the technology, and no one wants to go to third party wikis anymore," said Mr. Saper, referring to common methods used in customer service analytics. "It's turning something static into a dynamic piece of software that essentially sits beside you and coaches you as you do your job, and that really fits into our vision of what next-generation cloud software will do for the industry."

Emergence Capital will work with Guru as it expands its West Coast presence with the opening of a San Francisco office this year, and General Partner Gordon Ritter will take a board position at the company.

DD deal update: Shares inNets Group, the Danish payments processor, had a brief wobble on Tuesday morning, falling as much as 14 per cent and leading some in the market to panic thata potential takeoverof the company is off.However, DD can reveal  followingour scoop last week  thatHellman & Friedmanhas now formally entered into exclusive discussions regarding a $5bn-plustakeover of Nets. A dealcould be finalised and announced in the next few weeks. One caveat: Nets is a public company so exclusivity doesn't mean this is a done deal.Now back to our regularscheduled programming.

Amazon's$13.7bn purchase ofWhole Foodsspooked retailers when it was announced. But news of how the deal came to be has given those retailers new hope . . . that they might be next.

This was not the story of a predatory disrupter, but rather one of courtship   a process Whole Foods' chiefJohn Mackeybreathlessly described as a "whirlwind romance". And it began with the high-end grocer, under pressure from activists, reaching out to Amazon after spotting a report that the ecommerce giant might be interested in buying it.

You can read more about why that news has other retailers' hearts all aflutter inour story here.

A couple of links for further reading:

*

Here's the FT's Alphaville on whether "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/09/05/2193164/is-amazonification-real/"  that is, that ecommerce, robotics and AI are crushing consumer retail prices and leading to an overall disinflationary environment   is real.

*

Here's an excellent piece in the Yale Law Journal on "http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"and the ways in which US law is inadequately equipped to address its anti-competitive aspects (say, how it acts as both a competitor to traditional retail and an essential piece of infrastructure for those competitors).

Before Whole Foods, Amazon s bets were smaller. The Seattle-based ecommerce companyhas made about 130 acquisitions or investments since its debut in 1995, in a wide range of industries from books and music to cloud computing. Its largest acquisition until this year was video game siteTwitch,for $970m in 2014.

So where mightJeff Bezosnext bestow his largesse? If it's going whole-hog into food, the US delivery start-upGrubHubmight make sense, analysts say. It'd be Bezos's for a cool $4.5bn. Other options include big box retailers includingBed Bath & BeyondandTarget, or higher-end or speciality retailers such asNordstrom,Warby ParkerorLowe's.

But Amazon has been tipped as the white knight for struggling retailers in the past, and one senior executive at a large US grocer sounds a word of caution to those holding out hope for an Amazonian life preserver: "Jeff thinks differently than us . . . I think he ll be doing something completely different."

Cambridge tech cluster under foreign ownership

The sale ofAvevaon Tuesday toSchneider Electricmarks the end of an era for the so-called  Silicon Fen , the area around Cambridge,which has housed one of the UK s most successful technology clusters over the past 40 years. (Read more here)

The region remains a popular destination for the world s biggest tech players  for instance,Amazonis in the process of tripling its R&D team there. But as Nicholas Megawreportsfor the FT,Aveva was the last of Cambridge s five homegrown 1bn tech groups to be sold into foreign ownership.

Here are the other major takeovers of companies based there in the past six years:

*

Japan'sSoftBankspent 24bn on chip designerArm Holdingslast year.

*

Another Japanese group  Brother Industries  boughtDomino Printing Sciencesfor 1bn in 2015.

*

Cambridge Silicon Radiois now an arm ofQualcommafter a 1.6bn deal completed in 2015.

*

Most infamously,HPspent $11.7bn on the disastrous purchase ofAutonomyin 2011.

Figures such as Arm founderHermann Hauserhave bemoaned the UK s inability to hold on to its biggest tech successes. But many younger founders have seen the bright side, hoping that a glut of experienced engineers   many of whom benefited from generous share schemes before their companies were acquired   will help fund a new generation of start-ups in the city.

Apax joins the PE tech club

Tech entrepreneurs are increasingly trying to impress private equity investors, the new kids in town pouring money into this booming space.

Apax Partners, the UK-based buyout fund,has become the latest playerto raise a dedicated digital fund as it looks to invest outside its main flagship fund.

This means the company will write smaller cheques than it is used to   between $30m to $150m   to purchase stakes in companies in places it already operates in, including Europe, the US and Asia.

 Apax Digital will make minority and buyout investments in high-growth software, internet, and tech-enabled services companies globally,  according to a letter to investors seen by the Financial Times.

But Apax is no rookie when it comes to tech: the firm has already deployed close to $9bn in 32 technology and digital companies since 2003. More recently,it bought a majority stakeinMatchesFashion, a luxury eretailer.

Apax is following in the footsteps ofKKR,CVC,Silver Lakeand other firms that have technology-focused funds.

Advisers looking at this space have warned that Apax, which currently has a $9bn flagship fund, will need to be nimble and prepared to invest in myriad companies as it looks for the next disruptive champion.

Nasdaq buys analytics  group eVestment; Financials

US equities exchange pays $705m for asset manager focused data provider

Nasdaq is buying eVestment, an analytics and content provider to asset managers, for $705m in cash and debt in the latest step to expand the group's technology, data and analytics businesses.

During the past decade Nasdaq, operator of the eponymous US equities exchange, has diversified its business as the profitability in trading equities has shrunk in the face of regulatory change and heightened competition.

Nasdaq's chief executive Adena Friedman , who took the helm in January, has repeatedly signalled data and technology as areas of focus and growth.

"It's an evolution of our strategy," she told the Financial Times, adding that "our clients' needs are expanding and evolving rapidly with the data available and the technology advancing".

Investors are among Nasdaq's clients along with corporate issuers of stock, brokers and other exchanges.

Evestment runs a database on both traditional and alternative investment strategies. A pension fund, for example, may use the service for performance and other details in selecting hedge fund investments. eVestment includes as many as 2,800 individual data points on more than 74,000 investment vehicles, which it sells to investment managers, consulting firms and pension funds.

"There are a lot of new strategies becoming available and a lot more need for data and analytics to make investment decisions," Ms Friedman said.

Citing research from Boston Consulting, the total size of investable assets is set to increase from $71tn in 2015 to $100tn by 2020, she said.

Nasdaq will integrate eVestment with its existing mutual fund quotation business, which collects information from mutual funds, and plans to help eVestment expand. The logic of the transaction also comes in that eVestment operates by subscription, making it a source of recurring revenue for the group.

"We've grown this business at a 13 per cent annual growth rate since 2013, and together, we expect to produce new and expanded opportunities for our clients by combining our proprietary capabilities with Nasdaq's core information services offerings," said Jim Minnick , eVestment's co-founder and chief.

In the second quarter, market services, which include Nasdaq's trading businesses, accounted for 37 per cent of its $602m net revenue. The remainder was 27 per cent from corporate services, information services at 24 per cent, where eVestment will be housed, and market technology at 12 per cent.

Littlejohn & Co. is selling Newgistics Inc., a provider of parcel delivery, returns, fulfillment and digital commerce services for retailers and e-commerce brands, to publicly traded technology company Pitney Bowes for about $475 million.

Newgistics offers digital commerce development, analytics, relationship management, systems integration, fulfillment, parcel delivery and returns management to retailers and brands. The Austin, Texas-based company has nearly 500 retail clients. It is a work-share partner of the U.S. Postal Service and processes nearly 100 million parcels annually, according to a news release.

Littlejohn acquired Newgistics in 2013 for an undisclosed sum. Newgistics in a separate press release said that under LittleJohn's ownership, the company grew its revenue and earnings, added new customers and globalized its portfolio of services.

The transaction is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter, according to the release. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. served as financial adviser to Littlejohn and Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP as legal adviser.

Littlejohn has more than $5 billion under management. The Greenwich, Conn.-based firm focuses on private-equity and debt investments in midmarket companies.

Banks Set Stage for Analyst-Research Shakeup

BRUSSELS European Union regulators have broken   apart the traditional model banks have employed for decades to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-poised-to-reshape-analyst-research-sector-1423514292" and it has the industry in a fracas.

Starting in January, when postcrisis rules known as Mifid II come into effect, money managers who get fixed-income research from banks will have to pay for it directly, from a dedicated account. That's a big change from the previous model, in which clients paid for research indirectly through the execution of trades or through the "spread," the difference between financial products' buying and selling prices.

The rules will apply to all banks doing business in the EU, including U.S. banks operating in the bloc.

Before the rules were approved by the EU's executive arm in 2016, banks protested the portion of legislation that would define research as an "inducement," saying such a move wasn't what lawmakers intended and it could block smaller clients' access to top-quality research.

But Markus Ferber the German lawmaker in charge of Mifid II, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, in the European Parliament said this is exactly what he and his colleagues had in mind.

He told The Wall Street Journal that the entire idea was to unbundle research costs, making them transparent and no longer paid for as part of the brokerage commission. "Once prices become transparent, fund managers have to make a conscious decision about what to buy and what not to buy," Mr. Ferber said. "That will ultimately drive down prices."

Banks are now scrambling to find a price point as they negotiate with clients. Deutsche Bank AG halved the  proposed    price of its fixed-income and macro research to  30,000 ($36,000) a year for as many as 10 users , from an initially planned  60,000, "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/deutsche-bank-is-said-to-halve-mifid-fixed-income-research-price", citing people with knowledge of the bank's plans.

A couple of years ago, the rule against inducements caught investment banks off guard. The way the draft laws were written, it wasn't clear if "morning macro" notes summarizing market moves bread and butter for salespeople would fly under the new standards.

In what was seen as a concession, the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, clarified that bespoke research containing so-called original insights had to be paid for directly, but banks could continue to offer market commentary as a complimentary service.

 Up until now, this is how it worked: A salesperson on a bank's rates or currency team would bring along a top research analyst from the same bank to meet a hedge-fund manager. With a fund investing in, say, French bonds, the salesperson would book lunch with the head of French rates research  perhaps in Mayfair,  the upscale London neighborhood hedge funds call home.

After wining, dining and chatting about the future of the French economy, the hedge-fund manager knew he had to pay for that research expertise. But the price wasn't clear. There was no fee. Subsequently, the hedge-fund manager would execute a few trades and throw some business over to the bank.

As of next year, investment banks will have to rely on a standalone business model to support fixed-income research that clearly stipulates pricing. Interested parties on both sides will be watching to see how it all shakes out.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

SEC Chief Wants Investors to Better Understand Cyberrisk

By Dave Michaels

NEW YORK The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that regulators and Wall Street need to do more to educate investors about the serious risks that companies and the financial system face from cyberintrusions.

Jay Clayton, speaking at an event sponsored by New York University's School of Law, said investors still don't fully appreciate the threat posed by hackers. "I am not comfortable that the American investing public understands the substantial risk that we face systemically from cyber issues and I would like to see better disclosure around that," Mr. Clayton said.

Some cybersecurity experts have in the past called for the SEC to require more specific disclosures by U.S. public companies about cyberrisks, particularly following a 2013 breach at Target Corp. that compromised the credit- and debit-card information of millions of customers.

Mr. Clayton said the SEC would investigate companies that mislead investors about material cyberrisks, but said the battle against hackers is much broader and shouldn't be waged in government "silos."

"We have to have our individual responsibilities, but we also have to do our best to foster a collective approach to the issue," Mr. Clayton said.

The SEC's role in policing cybersecurity is more nuanced than that of many state regulators, which investigated Target for what they alleged was its failure to provide reasonable data security. Target agreed in May to pay $18.5 million to resolve the probe.

The SEC is more focused on whether financial companies that it directly supervises, such as brokerage firms and asset managers, are protecting themselves and their clients against hackers. The agency issued a risk alert last month that outlined policies it sees as effective for mitigating the risks and highlighted some deficiencies.

The markets regulator has occasionally taken enforcement action against financial firms whose practices left customers' data unprotected. It has also gone after individuals who hacked into brokerage accounts in order to carry out insider trading or other fraud. But it has never sued a public company over how it communicated the threat of hacking or breaches that it suffered.

Fired Wells Fargo Managers Sue Over Sales Scandal

By Emily Glazer

Two former managers have sued Wells Fargo & Co., claiming they were unfairly fired over the bank's sales-practices issues.

Reza Razzaghipour and Marla Razzaghipour claimed their dismissals were retaliation for them raising issues with senior managers about the questionable sales practices, such as falsification of bank records, according to a lawsuit filed Aug. 31 in Los Angeles Superior Court.

The former managers, who are husband and wife, were fired in March 2017 from positions overseeing regions in Southern California. Combined, the two managed about 3,500 staff, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

A Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement Tuesday that the bank "denies the allegations of these two former regional presidents. The termination decisions were not retaliatory as alleged in the complaint. The company terminated the employment of these two individuals for legitimate and lawful reasons."

Wells Fargo was ordered to pay a $185 million fine last year over its sales practices and has since faced public and political pressure as the scandal erupted. More than 5,300 employees were fired over a five-year period for the behavior. The bank said last week up to 3.5 million customer accounts may have been unauthorized.

The lawsuit alleges that Mr. Razzaghipour reported one type of employee fraud in 2013 and fired a "significant number of employees involved." The lawsuit also alleges that Mrs. Razzaghipour, known to some at work as Marla Clemow, "reported the illegal and unethical sales practices at the highest levels multiple times."

Both former managers "never fired or disciplined anyone for failing to meet the bank's impossible and fraudulent sales goals," the lawsuit claimed.

But some current and former employees and managers have told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. and Mrs. Razzaghipour pushed them to engage in questionable sales tactics.

"My clients were fired in retaliation for complaining of illegal conduct at Wells Fargo, including the bank's improper sales practices," the managers' lawyer Emanuel Shirazi, of Los Angeles-based Shirazi Law Firm, said in a statement. "Despite knowing this, Wells Fargo chose to scapegoat Mr. & Mrs. Razzaghipour."

The lawyer didn't comment specifically on the employee allegations.

The Razzaghipour's lawsuit also names several retail-banking executives, some of whom are still employed by the bank and others who were fired, as the real "bad actors."

The managers requested their payroll and personnel files from Wells Fargo, which refused to produce them, according to the lawsuit. They then filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. In the lawsuit they ask for damages of at least $50 million.

Mortgage-Backed Securities Market Heats Up

By Peter Grant

Banks and other underwriters of commercial mortgage-backed securities are on track to issue more notes in September than any other month this year, according to a trade publication that tracks the business.

Close to $16 billion worth of deals are in the pipeline for September, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. So far this year, the top month was June, when $10.7 billion of new securities were issued, the newsletter said.

As of the end of July, deal volume had hit $47.4 billion, compared with $37.9 billion for the same period in 2016, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. If current volume trends continue, new deals this year likely will exceed the $77.6 billion of 2016 but fall short of the $106.2 billion recorded in 2015, according to industry experts.

Volume dried up during the fourth quarter of last year partly because of new rules that went into effect on Christmas Eve under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.

Those so-called risk retention rules required issuers to keep at least 5% of the securities they create. Concerned about the added risks and costs resulting from those rules, a number of firms last year exited from the commercial mortgage-backed securities business. But the players that have remained have been able to start increasing volume.

"At the end of last year, there were a lot of folks who were saying we may not get to what we did in 2016," said Robert Grenda, a senior vice president with Morningstar Credit Ratings LLC. "There was some real concern about risk retention."

But underwriters have "gotten pretty comfortable" with the new rules, Mr. Grenda said. "We haven't seen a significant impact on volume."

The record year for new commercial mortgage-backed securities was 2007, when there were $314 billion of new issues, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert.

Analysis: China's Big Banks Still Have a Credibility Gap

By Anjani Trivedi

For China's big banks, business is looking better than it has in years. Investors shouldn't be fooled by the act.

Midyear results for the likes of ICBC and Bank of China show China's regulatory crackdown over the last year has had some success in whipping banks into shape: Interest income rose and asset quality improved for all of the so-called Big Four. Under pressure to clean up their shadow-banking activities, banks have reined in a key profit engine, noninterest income. Fees and commissions from off-balance sheet investment and wealth-management businesses plummeted in the second quarter.

Still, going back to basics isn't proving simple. The four banks are able to earn a roughly 5% yield on new loans, while their funding costs remain lower than those of smaller rivals. That should mean easy profits, but the big banks' average return on assets was just over 1% in the first half, partly thanks to high operating costs, and partly because of still-high loan impairment charges.

Together with declining fee income, poor profitability is harming banks' capital positions. With little to add to retained earnings, bank capital levels are growing slowly. Their assets, meanwhile, are growing fast as they expand their loan books. The net effect is that their capital ratios bank capital divided by risk-weighted assets are declining. Bank of China's core equity Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio fell to 11.8% from 12.3% a year earlier.

More optimistically, banks' bad-loan positions seem to be improving although again, the good news is qualified. The improvement is partly a game of numbers: Total loans have been growing faster than bad loans. Moreover, big banks have found creative ways to dispose of soured debt. Bank of China has been securitizing some of its bad loans, while others have carried out debt-for-equity swaps or just transferred them into off-balance sheet entities.

Chinese bank stocks are up 17% so far this year, and now trade at 0.9 times book value on average. Anyone hoping they can push higher still should take a closer look below the surface.

Wall Street Migrates to  T+2 2 Settlements

By Chris Dieterich

Anybody who sold shares Tuesday is guaranteed to receive cash for their trade by Thursday   a day earlier than any point during the past two decades.

That's because Tuesday marks the first day that trades in most financial products in the U.S. will be required to "settle" within two business days, rather than in three days as has been in place since 1995.

The settlement process finalizes trades, transferring money from buyers to sellers in exchange for ownership of a security. In industry jargon, Tuesday is the first day of the "T+2 3 era, which supplants "T+3."

A large group of financial firms and other market participants have pushed for the shortened settlement cycle for years. They argue that risk is lessened for brokers and investors alike when money moves more quickly between buyers and sellers. Since the global financial crisis nearly one decade ago, the financial industry and regulators alike aimed to reduce systemic risk within the financial system. Shortening the settlement period would reduce the risk that one party in a trade experiences financial distress and is unable to complete settlement obligations, industry participants say. It also means that investors will receive their money or shares faster after making a transaction.

The Securities and Exchange Commission finalized rule changes to facilitate the shorter settlement cycle in March.

The new settlement timeline applies to stocks, exchange-traded funds, corporate and municipal bonds, among other financial products. Canada also is transitioning from T+3 world to T+2, aligning markets in North America with others across the Atlantic. Most European Union member states harmonized their settlement cycles to T+2 in 2014.

WSJ Pro Transcript: Q&A With Fed Governor Lael Brainard

Federal Reserve Board governor Lael Brainard took audience questions Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017, following her speech at an Economic Club of New York breakfast. She discussed the labor market, inflation, the Fed's balance sheet and financial regulation, among other topics. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.

(Applause.)

MODERATOR: OK, thanks very much. Well, let me ask the first question, just about unemployment. It did   it is very low, of course, but it did have   it did tick up during the last reporting cycle, with fewer jobs added then than expected. Any concerns about that as we move forward?

LAEL BRAINARD: So I would anticipate that we will see some effect, in particular from Hurricane Harvey, in the payrolls reports. But we expect those to be   or, at least I expect those to be somewhat short-lived. Overall, the labor market picture I think is a very positive one. We're continuing to see margins of slack diminishing. And so in the last report, even though unemployment did tick up a small amount, we also saw some welcome improvements in (the share of people holding part-time jobs who say they would prefer full-time work) coming down. We've seen discouraged workers coming back into the workforce. So it does suggest that there may still be some margins of slack, as does the still low level of the overall employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers, which really controls for some of the demographic shifts, which is still a noticeable 2 percent below where it was before the crisis.

Q: First of all, I appreciate your remarks very much. The inputs to inflation of labor and capital seem to be offset more and more by technology. And when you look at the   for example, the big three automakers, their revenues are identical to the revenues of the FANG stocks ( Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). But the FANG stocks represent one-tenth of the employees of the big three companies, and represent 50 times more their market cap. So the question I have is, is the ability to measure inflation in the context of a technological disruptive period such that you can't really measure the deflationary effects going on from the internet and other technological innovations going on?

MS. BRAINARD: So I think the question that you raise about do we fully understand the impact of technological innovation on how inflation is measured and really what those measures represent is a   is a very important question. I think there's a lot of discussion, a lot of research going on in this area at the moment. It's certainly the case that the mechanisms that we have   that the (Bureau of Labor Statistics) uses, for instance, for undertaking quality adjustments as products change over time or when new products are introduced   that there are some complicated measurement issues there.

And so this is an area that bears close watching. It may well be impacting, for instance, our measured productivity. There may be a difference between what we're measuring in terms of productivity and what the underlying rate of productivity growth actually is. It's not clear whether those differences are greater now than they may have been, for instance, you know, in the late '90s, when we also saw a big surge of technological innovation. But the relationship between innovation, technological innovation, wage setting, and inflation, I think is one that we need to continue to pay very close attention to.

Q: My question is regarding the normalization of the balance sheet. Academics, researchers, and even on occasion Federal Reserve banks, have blogged that the growth in the Fed balance sheet has exacerbated income inequality in the United States. And, first of all, I'd like to ask, while income inequality is not one of your dual mandates, do you consider that? And do you agree or disagree with that assertion or those pieces of research? And secondly, as you are   as the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will lead the balance sheet normalization with the mortgage side of the balance sheet. And do you have any concerns that by doing so you may be limiting housing finance availability for the middle class?

MS. BRAINARD: So the questions about income and wealth inequality in the U.S. and how do they figure into policy makers' thinking, clearly at least in my own mind I pay very close attention to the trends in income distribution, in part because I think they matter for the robustness and the resilience of our economy, because they matter for the   who is receiving the bulk of the income and their likelihood of spending that may be quite different. So it does matter as we think about the overall resilience of the economy. It certainly mattered going into the crisis, where the financial health and stability of households at the lower end of the income distribution mattered for the overall stability of the system.

Do I think   have I seen evidence that the balance sheet may in some respect be contributing to that? I think these are very longstanding trends. And those trends long predate the use of unconventional monetary policy in the U.S., the asset purchases. And they, I believe, have much deeper causes. This goes back to some of the technological questions that were asked earlier. And the sets of policies that are appropriate to address them are really well outside the realm of the Federal Reserve's tools, or the specific objectives that Congress has set us.

With regard to the balance sheet normalization plans that the (Federal Open Market Committee) has agreed, as you know, the balance sheet runoff has specific caps that are set separately for Treasurys and for (mortgage-backed securities). In my own view, those are set and increase over time gradually, and in a way that should be well-anticipated, and that will give the ample space for private markets to be able to fund those securities going forward. So I think that the plans that were announced were   took into consideration a number of important characteristics and do carefully and gradually and predictably allow the balance to runoff in a way that should really be well anticipated and well managed by the markets.

Q: Governor, thank you for sharing your insights with us. And also, thank you for your longstanding service. Coming out of Jackson Hole, and you just echoed it also right now, that when you look at the reforms that were put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis   whether it was capital, liquidity, risk management, derivatives market, transparency, or money market reforms   overall they have contributed   this is the finding coming out of Jackson Hole, and you repeated it   towards the sustained economic growth that we are seeing. I'm curious if, within the Federal Reserve, you have also done any studies that you could speak to in terms of the hampering effect or the dampening effect on the animal spirits, which is a structural component of powering risk-taking end growth. I would be curious of any studies have been done to the counterfactual, not to what you are speaking to. Thank you so much for your thoughts.

MS. BRAINARD: Yeah. So, thank you. I think that there's been a lot of work done, both   and by policy researchers as well as academic researchers   both focused on the U.S. only as well as on the international financial system, asking the question as to whether asking the largest, most systemic, most complex institutions to hold more robust capital buffers, to stress-test those capital buffers, to better risk-weight the assets that they're holding those buffers against, to better manage their liquidity and to better risk manage whether that may in some respects impede the flow of credit to the economy. Now, animal spirits is a somewhat different question, although I think we've seen very robust readings, certainly of confidence of consumers and more broadly.

With regard to credit, you know, if you look in the U.S. economy, credit is flowing. Credit is really very available by   in all of our surveys that we've undertaken recently. You would be hard-pressed to find cases where credit is not readily available to qualified borrowers. And standards in some cases have been tightened, but in those instances I think we had first seen a bit of a deterioration in underwriting standards, for instance, in (commercial real estate). So my sense is that for the institutions at the core of the system, their ability to lend has actually been supported by the rigorous reforms they've undertaken.

Now, I think there are some institutions who   the community banks or smaller banks in particular   who, by virtue of the way that the statute is written, got caught up in some of the reforms, that perhaps are not necessary or useful for their particular business models. And there, you know, I think there is scope for statutory changes. And here I'm thinking about Volcker or incentive comp or stress testing, depending on what the size and the complexity of that institution is.

So, do I think there are also ways that we could right-size those regulations? Absolutely. And that it would allow smaller financial institutions, supervised institutions in particular, to be more active in lending. I hope that there will be an opportunity to make some of those changes.

Q: Thank you for a very interesting talk, particularly on inflation. Most of your comments   I haven't heard that much on inflation from a Fed person for a long time.

We've had about 20 years of experience now with inflation-indexed bonds. And one of the principal arguments in bringing them out   not the only one that has been modestly useful in asset management   but also the information context, the wisdom of the market would show us where inflation was headed and could you comment on how you appraise the usefulness of that asset class?

MS. BRAINARD: So, I can't appraise it from an investor's point of view. But I can say that when we are trying to gauge inflation expectations and we're looking at market-based measures, that asset class proves extremely important, because we look at the difference between inflation Treasury yields and non-inflation index to try to get a sense of what kind of probabilities the markets are placing on inflation coming in above target, inflation coming in below target over different horizons. And we also look at other market-based measures, but that is one of the key measures that we look at.

And, of course, there are different liquidity characteristics in those markets. And so, you know, it's not a straight read on expectations. I don't take it as such. I don't think any of us do. But it is one useful indicator, along with a host of other indicators   some survey-based, some model-based   that does help us gauge whether, in fact, there may be some change in inflation expectations. And certainly, based on those markets, it does appear, in fact, that market participants are putting a somewhat lower probability on high-inflation outcomes and a somewhat greater probability on low-inflation outcomes. And it suggests that, in fact, there has been a noticeable change in inflation expectations, a decline since the precrisis period. And it's certainly something that I   that I focused on over the last few years.

Q: Thank you very much. Where do you stand on the debate in the FOMC currently on financial conditions? It seems to me that wanting to wait for inflation to be in the rearview mirror runs the risk of running a monetary policy that is very accommodative for maybe longer than necessary. And in the meantime, boosts asset prices to levels that might be of concern. So wouldn't you agree, like, the one participant mentioned in the last minutes that continuing to hike as per the dots would strike the right balance between achieving the inflation mandate and guarding off against risks from too loose financial conditions? Thank you.

MS. BRAINARD: So I think financial conditions are an extremely important consideration for all of us as we look at the appropriate path of monetary policy. In particular when financial conditions ease, that contributes to a stronger economy, may well contribute to a more robust outlook for inflation. And so it's certainly something that materially factors into the outlook.

The separate question is whether we should be undertaking monetary policy to target financial conditions. And there, I think you can also see in previous minutes of FOMC discussions that there has been quite a bit of discussion   robust discussion   where the minutes will suggest that people generally in the committee believe that we have other tools that are our first line of defense against buildup of financial imbalances, and that the tools that we have in the wake of the crisis are much, much more robust than we had going into the crisis. Moreover, we have a much more systematic and rigorous quarterly review of potential financial imbalances, potential financial stability concerns, so that the board, which is responsible for most of those nonmonetary policy tools, and the FOMC in turn now have regular and systematic looks at financial stability.

So, while it is something that I think is a concern, and I have noted in previous remarks that in the past two episodes, when unemployment reached very low levels, it was in fact financial imbalances that were the primary concern rather than accelerating inflation. Again, though, we have generally taken the view that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense. And that's why the robust macroprudential tools that we have as a result of Dodd-Frank and tools such as the countercyclical buffer, which is now a tool that is also out there that we can use, have been so important to our ability to focus monetary policy on the dual mandate.

Q: I had two questions if that's OK, the first revolving around the balance sheet. When and if the announcement comes, how do you view further announcements of the reduction versus FOMC hiking interest rates? So if the reduction is, for example, X, and then it's done a second time, at what point would you revisit, then, hiking the (federal-funds) rate?

And the second question was you mentioned the 40 basis points of term premium. I was just curious how   if there's a certain quantity or how you guys think about that if, for example, after the first announcement, is that viewed as, let's say, a 5-basis-point tightening. Just any color that you're comfortable sharing.

MS. BRAINARD: So I think the first important thing to just say is that the plans that were agreed by the FOMC essentially lay out a path for the balance sheet on both types of securities that is   once it is initiated is   essentially can be thought of as going on autopilot: that it's completely laid out, that it is capped, and of course there is complete transparency around the (system open market account) portfolio so that market participants will be able to correctly anticipate exactly how that balance sheet runoff will proceed.

Now, there was   and again, let me just say my own view is that we know so much about how the federal-funds rate works   we have decades of experience, tons of empirical estimates   and really most of the estimates that we have regarding asset purchases are very recent, and we're in the midst of a large, protracted period of, you know, economic challenges, so that it does not provide as much predictability to the public. So that my preferred instrument, my preferred active instrument   and I think this is consistent with the plans that were laid out by the FOMC   would be to use the federal-funds rate and to calibrate that to economic conditions as they evolve. Now, of course there is some consideration in those plans, and it certainly would be true of my own thinking that if the economy were to evolve very differently   if we were to see large adverse developments   at that juncture there may be some reason to slow or change the balance sheet runoff policy. But that would be under very different circumstances.

That was your first question. Let me see. Was there a second question?

Q: It was basically how you think about the additional term premium that might be created  

MS. BRAINARD: Oh, so the term premium   yeah. So the one thing I would say is those estimates, too, they're out in the public domain. They are primarily based on event studies during periods of asset purchases. Whether those estimates are the appropriate, you know, sort of neighborhood of magnitudes during a period of runoff I think is an open question. They give us some sense of what we might expect to see in terms of the term premium. But I think it's fair to say, at least in my mind, those estimates are   come from a sufficiently different period that I don't know. And I will be watching very carefully   I'm sure everyone else will be as well   to see whether the effects differ materially enough that it may have implications for how to think about the federal-funds rate path. But at least going into it, those are the   those are some of the least-most well-understood estimates that are out there.

Q: You have a great deal of expertise in the fields of globalization and trade, not only from your academic research but also as a practitioner   for example, your time in the Treasury. I wonder, how would proposed or existing changes in U.S. trade policy arising from the rise of populism affect the way that you are thinking about achieving your goals as a Fed governor   whether, for example, its impact on the labor market, impact on the dollar, how those things could drive inflation or other effects.

MS. BRAINARD: So I would say that generally the   to the extent that, you know, there are big policies that are, you know, being enacted of any sort, we would want to take into account, to the extent one could estimate the impact on our dual mandate, that would obviously be a conditioning factor in how we think about the appropriate path of policy.

From where I sit today, you know, the economy actually looks   as I said earlier, growing is continuing. Trade flows have actually improved a bit. Net exports are making a positive   small positive contribution for the first time in several years. And so, you know, now, there could be some disruptions associated with Harvey, but generally speaking the policy environment that we're taking into account has some fiscal uncertainty about it, but really those   geostrategic uncertainty   but those would be the main sources of uncertainty as I think about the policy arena. And that the implications for monetary policy, you know, if we were to see different kinds of policy shifts in the future, obviously, those are ones that I would take into account at that time.

Q: You've mentioned several times the happy condition of growth occurring elsewhere in the world simultaneously. Could you say a bit more about how durable you see those external sources of growth, as well as the risks that are drawn to your attention?

MS. BRAINARD: Yeah. So what we have seen is after several years of (International Monetary Fund) and others having to mark down global growth forecasts, what we have recently seen is actually the IMF and others marking up global growth forecasts. And this is on the back of stronger growth in several of our major economies around the world around the same time. So obviously the euro area activity and labor market readings have come in somewhat stronger than anticipated, and that's very welcome. Japan has recently come in a bit stronger, Canada, and then China. Now, of course there are risks to those outlooks, but I a year ago would have said that a major downside risk to our outlook really came from abroad, and I would say today that balance of risk has really shifted.

In China, in the medium term I think there are risks associated with the trajectory of growth. We've seen a rapid buildup of corporate debt in particular. We've seen some house-price increases in areas. And we, I think, would anticipate that the underlying trend growth rate is going to come down over time. And how the authorities manage to deal with those financial imbalances while also converging on a sustainable growth path is something that I think could be a risk for the medium term. We know that we have some changes in the relationship between Britain and the EU that are being discussed, and so that has some medium-term risks to the global outlook as well. And, as I said earlier, there's some geostrategic risks out there.

But the core growth outlook has improved really quite notably over the last two years in a way that I think now is contributing positively to the U.S. economy, which is extremely welcome.

Q: My question is to pull back from the micro and to ask you what you think the role of monetary policy should be eight and a half years into an economic expansion. And you've laid out a scenario where perhaps the suppressed rate of inflation is a global phenomenon, perhaps outside the direct impact of the Fed, and that the preferred policy tool is the fed-funds rate. So my question is, when it is appropriate for the Fed to perhaps shift its focus from trying to fine-tune the rate of inflation to building in protection or building in enough room for monetary policy to have a real impact on the economy the next time it falls into recession?

MS. BRAINARD: So I think it's a very tricky question to ask if, in fact, the neutral (interest) rate has come down and is likely to remain low for some time. And as I said earlier, I think there are a variety of reasons to believe that it is low currently and that it's likely to remain low for some time. In those circumstances, the room for maneuver above our effective lower bound using conventional policy is inherently limited. And so, you know, as a monetary policy maker, you're   you know, you've got a very clear objective of achieving sustainably the dual mandate, full employment and 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis. And so that is the guidepost for our policy.

Now, it's actually more important than ever that we get to that symmetric 2 percent inflation goal if, in fact, the neutral rate is lower because that gives us as much room as we are going likely   future monetary policy makers are likely to have in terms of being able to buffer adverse shocks above the effective lower bound. So I think the real underlying question is, you know if we are in fact in a low neutral rate environment and are likely to be for some time, achieving that 2 percent goal is more important than ever. And the question is, you know, how do we get from here to there? So that's really been the focus of my thinking recently, and over a longer horizon as well.

Q: Governor Brainard, do you see a trend or at least an increased likelihood of a lessening in international regulatory cooperation among the (Group of 20) countries going forward, and a trend toward each country wanting more capital in its borders and each country going it alone?

MS. BRAINARD: So I certainly think   you know, putting on my old hat, when I was responsible at the Treasury Department for negotiating some of the international agreements that led to more harmonization, I certainly think it's in America's interest that we do level the playing field to the greatest extent possible and level up that playing field internationally. You know, we learned in the crisis, we've learned through several crises right now that we are not immune to financial instability abroad, particularly in some of the larger financial jurisdictions. We've seen that in the last few years, when concerns about banks that may not have had sufficient capital reverberated into our financial markets at a time when our banks were actually building capital and looking a lot healthier.

So it matters to our financial resilience and the health of our economy that financial institutions abroad are just as   you know, just as risk-tested, just as well-capitalized, husbanding their liquidity just as carefully as U.S. institutions are. It's simply   it seems to me simply self-interest to make sure that the world is working together around a set of, you know, sort of similar regulations that look a lot like the ones we have here.

Q: Let's go back to the international, if it's   if it's OK. I worry about how much growth internationally   and especially look at Europe, for example   is really due to so much central bank liquidity versus fundamental issues. So, for example, in Europe we all know that there's still   and I realize the IMF came out with their, you know, more positive report, but we all know that the real structural reforms have not really been fully implemented. (Non-performing loans) are very high still in those countries. And I worry in particular about the emerging economies, where one of the reasons they were not impacted negatively during the most previous crisis was because they had really revised their debt-management strategies   largely, you know, local currency as opposed to U.S. dollar currency, as well as extending the duration and so on. But we have seen   (inaudible)   because of low rates they have really increased not only on the corporate level, but also at the government level U.S. dollar-denominated debt again. So I worry, A, have the fundamental structural issues been resolved? And, B, what's going to happen with all these emerging economies who now have lots of U.S. dollar-denominated debt as normalization occurs, as the dollar, you know, increases again, is this all setting up for sort of a(n) unhappy ending?

MS. BRAINARD: So the kinds of risks that you pointed to I think are ones that, you know, have been highlighted by some of the financial stability reports that international organizations have done. It's certainly something that we think a lot about, potential financial spillovers into the U.S. market, and try to figure out where those risks may come from.

There is a risk in a(n) environment such as this that you could see behavior that does lead to financial imbalances, and there's a risk that you could see complacency that leads to a slowing down of structural reforms. Obviously, you know, we think that the reverse is preferable. And that's why here in the U.S., again, you know, we put in place a number of difficult structural reforms in the financial system. That process was a difficult and challenging process. But now that we're on the other side of it, I think we can feel more confident that there are guardrails and risk buffers in the economy that should serve us well. And I would hope that other countries move forward on the same kinds of structural reforms so that we also would see less risks abroad.

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo Speak Out on White House DACA Decision

J.P. Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) both speak out against the Trump Administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects from deportation undocumented immigrants who enter the US as children. "We should do everything in our power to continue to attract the best and brightest because they make us stronger as a people and as an economy," says JPM CEO James Dimon, who is also chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group that lobbies for businesses. "And, when people come here to learn, work hard and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay in the US." A WFC spokeswoman says in a statement: "Wells Fargo believes young, undocumented immigrants brought to America as children should have the opportunity to stay in the US. DACA is relevant to our team members and the communities we serve." (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)

Hurricane Irma Could Pose Record Threat to Florida

Hurricane Irma could cause a record level of insured damage in Florida, Barclays says, drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, the costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Katrina caused about $50 billion in insured losses in 2016 dollars. Irma is still days away from landfall and its path is uncertain. If the hurricane does hit a highly populated area like Miami, the insured losses could cause a turn in the reinsurance market, where prices have been declining for years, Barclays says. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)

Florida Leads Nation in Number of Govt Flood Policies

With Hurricane Irma a potential threat to Florida, the state has one thing going for it: It boasts the largest number of National Flood Insurance Program policies in force, at 1.7 million, according to U.S. government statistics as of June 30. Those add up to $422.92 billion in flood coverage. Florida is the nation's third most populous state, behind California and Texas. By contrast, Texas had 593,115 policies. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

Test of  Hurricane Deductibles' May Finally Be Here

Since Katrina in 2005, insurers have increasingly included "hurricane deductibles" in coastal policies to put more of the riskiness of coastal living on backs of homeowners. Harvey may be the biggest application of the concept yet. They often are 5% of the insured value, which means policyholders have to shell out potentially tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs. Sandy was supposed to be a big test, but NY, NJ and some other states said the deductibles didn't apply because Sandy's winds lost hurricane status before arriving in their borders. Harvey was Category 4 in hitting Texas, seemingly giving the state no wiggle room on this front for helping consumers, insurance experts said. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)

Why Harvey Isn't Socking Home Insurers:  Hurricane Deductibles'

Private-sector home insurers got a break when Harvey's Category 4 winds landed in a relatively thinly populated part of Texas coastline. Winds dropped off sharply as Harvey moved inland, a big reason home insurers face estimated claims of less than $3 billion. Another reason: Many policies contain special "hurricane" or "windstorm" deductibles that ratchet up policyholders' share of rebuilding costs. The deductibles often are 5% or so of the insured value, not the claim. So if a home insured for $200,000 sustains $10,000 of hurricane damage, a 5% deductible saddles the policyholder with the entire $10,000, a Texas government website for consumers explains.

Chinese Stocks Face Headwinds, Says Credit Suisse

Tensions between the U.S. and North Korea could dampen a run in Chinese stocks. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) has rallied over 26% this year, but the sector faces a number of headwinds, says Credit Suisse. There could be a leadership change, and the Trump administration's stance toward China remains uneasy, writes the firm's Mandy Xu in a note. "We could see further hardening in the Trump administration's stance toward China, particularly if China keeps up its support of the North Korean regime," she says. Trump has already threatened to cease trade with China. Expected volatility for the China large-cap ETF has been rising along with geopolitical tensions in the region, but remain relatively muted. Xu recommends buying options on FXI to protect against a downturn. (gunjan.banerji@wsj.com; @gunjanjs)

Bitcoin Fund Plummets After China Bans ICOs

Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) fell $100, or more than 12%, in early trading after Chinese regulators declared initial coin offerings illegal on Monday, sending the prices of two leading cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, tumbling. The trust fell more than 20% Friday after news that short seller Andrew Left had targeted it. "Because we currently have a registration statement on file with the SEC, federal securities laws prevent us from commenting," Grayscale Investments says. Bitcoin itself, meanwhile, traded at $4,397.49 Tuesday, down from its September 1 high of $5,013, according to CoinDesk. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

Pimco Total Return Fund Breaks Outflow Streak

Bill Gross's old mutual fund had its first monthly increase in new client money in more than four years. Pacific Investment Management Co.'s Total Return Fund, the flagship bond fund Gross ran until his 2014 ouster, had $348 million in net inflows in August, excluding reinvested dividends, a person familiar with the matter says. The results snapped a streak that began in April 2013, and accelerated once Gross departed. Pimco Total Return had about $74 billion in assets under management; in 2013, before clients began to exit, the fund managed more than $290 billion. (justin.baer@wsj.com)

Another Indonesia State Firm to Issue Asset-Backed Securities

In Indonesia, the ball finally appears to be rolling for listings of asset-backed securities, following a hiatus of just 20 years. After toll road operator Jasa Marga last week listed securities on the local exchange, now another state-owned company, Indonesia Power, is seeking to raise up to IDR4 trillion to fund the construction of several power plants. The listing is the first part of the company's plans to raise as much as IDR10 trillion by securitizing its assets through the end of 2018. Offerings of asset-backed securities came to a halt after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. (i-made.sentana@wsj.com)

Severe Storms, and Their Costs, on the Rise

It's too soon to know the full economic toll of Hurricane Harvey but not too soon to predict that it won't have much impact on Houston's future economic growth or that of other coastal cities that have become ever denser population and economic centers, which guarantees that storm-related disasters will get even costlier.

As the disaster in Texas has unfolded, commentators have criticized the National Flood Insurance Program for encouraging development in risky flood zones by selling insurance too cheaply. But Houston illustrates a more serious problem: "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insuring-coastal-cities-against-the-next-hurricane-harvey-1504282974".

Business owners across the country also say the National Flood Insurance Program, the only option for most since private insurers largely got out of the flood business nearly a century ago, is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/harveys-test-businesses-struggle-with-flawed-insurance-as-floods-multiply-1504022632".

Basel Committee's Fintech Tips for Bank Regulators

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has "http://bit.ly/2em5ZNq" on how banking regulators should make sense of fintech. The committee examined the risks associated with potential future scenarios in the banking industry and crafted case studies around new technologies, such as a distributed ledger, and business models. For example, the paper recommends banks review their governance structures and risk-management processes, and offers tips for supervising transactions under current regulatory and licensing frameworks. "A common theme across the various scenarios is that banks will find it increasingly difficult to maintain their current operating models, given technological change and customer expectations," the Basel Committee writes. Comments on the guidance are due Oct. 31.

Verlaine's Take: Banks Set Stage for Analyst-Research Shakeup

SEC Chief Wants Investors to Better Understand Cyberrisk

Fired Wells Fargo Managers Sue Over Sales Scandal

Mortgage-Backed Securities Market Heats Up

Analysis: China's Big Banks Still Have a Credibility Gap

Banks Set Stage for Analyst-Research Shakeup

BRUSSELS European Union regulators have broken   apart the traditional model banks have employed for decades to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-poised-to-reshape-analyst-research-sector-1423514292" and it has the industry in a fracas.

Starting in January, when postcrisis rules known as Mifid II come into effect, money managers who get fixed-income research from banks will have to pay for it directly, from a dedicated account. That's a big change from the previous model, in which clients paid for research indirectly through the execution of trades or through the "spread," the difference between financial products' buying and selling prices.

The rules will apply to all banks doing business in the EU, including U.S. banks operating in the bloc.

Before the rules were approved by the EU's executive arm in 2016, banks protested the portion of legislation that would define research as an "inducement," saying such a move wasn't what lawmakers intended and it could block smaller clients' access to top-quality research.

But Markus Ferber the German lawmaker in charge of Mifid II, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, in the European Parliament said this is exactly what he and his colleagues had in mind.

He told The Wall Street Journal that the entire idea was to unbundle research costs, making them transparent and no longer paid for as part of the brokerage commission. "Once prices become transparent, fund managers have to make a conscious decision about what to buy and what not to buy," Mr. Ferber said. "That will ultimately drive down prices."

Banks are now scrambling to find a price point as they negotiate with clients. Deutsche Bank AG halved the  proposed    price of its fixed-income and macro research to  30,000 ($36,000) a year for as many as 10 users , from an initially planned  60,000, "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/deutsche-bank-is-said-to-halve-mifid-fixed-income-research-price", citing people with knowledge of the bank's plans.

A couple of years ago, the rule against inducements caught investment banks off guard. The way the draft laws were written, it wasn't clear if "morning macro" notes summarizing market moves bread and butter for salespeople would fly under the new standards.

In what was seen as a concession, the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, clarified that bespoke research containing so-called original insights had to be paid for directly, but banks could continue to offer market commentary as a complimentary service.

 Up until now, this is how it worked: A salesperson on a bank's rates or currency team would bring along a top research analyst from the same bank to meet a hedge-fund manager. With a fund investing in, say, French bonds, the salesperson would book lunch with the head of French rates research  perhaps in Mayfair,  the upscale London neighborhood hedge funds call home.

After wining, dining and chatting about the future of the French economy, the hedge-fund manager knew he had to pay for that research expertise. But the price wasn't clear. There was no fee. Subsequently, the hedge-fund manager would execute a few trades and throw some business over to the bank.

As of next year, investment banks will have to rely on a standalone business model to support fixed-income research that clearly stipulates pricing. Interested parties on both sides will be watching to see how it all shakes out.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

SEC Chief Wants Investors to Better Understand Cyberrisk

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chief-wants-investors-to-better-understand-cyberrisk-1504651526" said Tuesday that regulators and Wall Street need to do more to educate investors about the serious risks that companies and the financial system face from cyberintrusions.

Jay Clayton, speaking at an event sponsored by New York University's School of Law, said investors still don't fully appreciate the threat posed by hackers. "I am not comfortable that the American investing public understands the substantial risk that we face systemically from cyber issues and I would like to see better disclosure around that," Mr. Clayton said.

Some cybersecurity experts have in the past called for the SEC to require more specific disclosures by U.S. public companies about cyberrisks, particularly following a 2013 breach at Target Corp. that compromised the credit- and debit-card information of millions of customers.

Fired Wells Fargo Managers Sue Over Sales Scandal

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fired-wells-fargo-managers-sue-over-sales-scandal-1504647699?tesla=y"Wells Fargo & Co., claiming they were unfairly fired over the bank's sales-practices issues.

Reza Razzaghipour and Marla Razzaghipour claimed their dismissals were retaliation for them raising issues with senior managers about the questionable sales practices, such as falsification of bank records, according to a lawsuit filed Aug. 31 in Los Angeles Superior Court.

The former managers, who are husband and wife, were fired in March from positions overseeing regions in Southern California. Combined, the two managed about 3,500 staff, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

Mortgage-Backed Securities Market Heats Up

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-backed-securities-market-heats-up-1504644057" of commercial mortgage-backed securities are on track to issue more notes in September than any other month this year, according to a trade publication that tracks the business.

Close to $16 billion worth of deals are in the pipeline for September, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. So far this year, the top month was June, when $10.7 billion of new securities were issued, the newsletter said.

Analysis: China's Big Banks Still Have a Credibility Gap

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-big-banks-still-have-a-credibility-gap-1504595194", business is looking better than it has in years. Investors shouldn't be fooled by the act.

Midyear results for the likes of ICBC and Bank of China show China's regulatory crackdown over the last year has had some success in whipping banks into shape: Interest income rose and asset quality improved for all of the so-called Big Four. Under pressure to clean up their shadow-banking activities, banks have reined in a key profit engine, noninterest income. Fees and commissions from off-balance sheet investment and wealth-management businesses plummeted in the second quarter.

Wall Street Migrates to  T+2 2 Settlements

"https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/09/05/wall-street-migrates-to-t2-settlements/" to receive cash for their trade by Thursday a day earlier than any point during the past two decades.

That's because Tuesday marked the first day that trades in most financial products in the U.S. will be required to "settle" within two business days, rather than in three days as has been in place since 1995.

The settlement process finalizes trades, transferring money from buyers to sellers in exchange for ownership of a security. In industry jargon, Tuesday is the first day of the "T+2 3 era, which supplants "T+3."

The Property Report: European Mall Operators Are Upbeat --- Demographics, design and relative scarcity have helped Continent weather downturns

As in the U.S., the retail world in Europe has been turned upside down by the brave new world of shopping that enables you to buy practically anything while sitting in your pajamas at the computer or waiting in line with your phone.

But the pain to European retail landlords has been less severe.

Shares of listed European retail real-estate companies have fallen but not as far as their U.S. counterparts. Values of European malls and shopping centers continue to rise in some European markets while they are falling throughout the U.S.

The U.S. landscape is pockmarked in many regions by empty and near-empty shopping centers. In Europe, there are fewer such "dead malls," analysts say.

"Europe is not the U.S.A.," said Paris-based commercial-property company Unibail-Rodamco SE, in a first-half earnings-presentation in July.

Why not?

The main reason that analysts cite is that Europe didn't experience the retail-development boom that the U.S. did in the 30 yearsleading up to the 2008 crash.

In the U.S., there are 24 square feet of retail space for every man, woman and child in the country compared with five square feet in the U.K., four in France, and three in Spain and Italy, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.

"It's a completely different scale," saidDavid Ironside, chief investment officer of LaSalle Investment Management's continental European business. LaSalle's private-equity group owns 242 retail assets in U.K. and continental Europe. "You don't get into a distressed zone that quickly in Europe."

But there are other reasons besides moderate supply that explain why European landlords have been more sheltered from the retail storm. These reasons are now being studied closely by retail investors, developers and lenders as they look for opportunities and risks on both sides of the Atlantic.

One factor buffering European landlords is mall layout. Shopping centers in Europe are typically anchored by a grocery store, rather than a department store, which tends to be the norm in the U.S. Grocery stores bring in a lot of foot traffic. Department stores have been among the biggest victims of online shopping.

U.S. malls and shopping centers also are being hit harder by a recent spate of retailer contractions and failures. Department stores such as Macy's, J.C. Penney and Sears

have announced closures of more than 400 stores across the U.S. since August 2016, hurting many secondary malls that are struggling to find replacement tenants.

Retailers in Europe currently are healthier, in part because many of the weaker ones failed during the financial upheaval between 2008 and 2009 and between 2011 and 2013, said Hemant Kotak, analyst at Green Street Advisors.

"We had a cleansing process in the last downturn and what survived were the better concepts and the ones with the better financial positions," said Mr. Kotak.

One of the retailers that filed for bankruptcy in 2012 is fashion chain Peacocks, which was subsequently sold to another retail group that has since expanded Peacocks' stores.

Not every European landlord is doing better than those in the U.S. Some top U.S. mall companies, such as Simon Property Group and GGP Inc., are popular with retailers and are recording rent growth and low vacancy rates comparable to the numbers being chalked up by leading European landlords.

Some trends in Europe aren't as promising as in the U.S. For example, Europe's population growth has been lackluster, which doesn't bode well for future increases in retail sales.

Still, investors are keenly aware of the advantages of Europe. In the 12-month period ended in July, the FSTE NAREIT Equity Regional Malls Index, which tracks seven mall REITs in the U.S., skidded 32%.

During that period, the Stoxx Europe Total Market Retail REITs, which tracks net returns of seven mall landlords in the region, declined a more-modest 11%.

Sales of U.S. shopping centers also have fallen sharply.

Volume totaled 670 million square feet between 2015 and the end of this June, according to an analysis of deals in excess of $10 million by data firm Real Capital Analytics. By comparison, some 790 million square feet traded hands between 2012 and 2014, Real Capital said.

In Europe, deal activity increased to 627 million square feet in the 18 months period ended in July, up from 559 million square feet in the previous period, Real Capital said.

Investors are particularly hungry for shopping centers in Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, which are politically stable and whose economies are still growing.

In March, U.K.-based Intu Properties PLC acquired Xanadu shopping center in Madrid and its management company for 530 million euros ($630 million).

Klepierre SA, the second-largest pan-European REIT and the largest to specialize in shopping centers, acquired a shopping mall in Spain's Murcia area for 233 million euros, and is redeveloping Hoog Catharijne, a mall in Utrecht, the Netherlands.In April, Klepierre opened 16,000 square meters (172,250 square feet) of new shops and restaurants in Hoog Catharijne and is scheduled to deliver more space in subsequent phases in November, March and 2019.

"We will continue to buy shopping centers in big cities and get rid of the ones in small cities where demographics are decreasing," said Jean-Marc Jestin,chairman of Klepierre's executive board, in an interview. The France-based landlord is looking at shopping centers in the top three to five cities in each country in the eurozone where the population is growing and in areas connected to public transportation. "We don't like suburban retail," Mr. Jestin said.

Supply has been kept in check in Europe partly because city planners have protected downtown shopping areas from suburban competition. In many places, people prefer to take public transportation, bike or walk, weakening demand for malls with large parking lots.

The one exception in Europe that faces a cloudier outlook is the U.K., which has more online shopping than countries on the Continent and faces uncertainties from Brexit. A weakening pound that has yet to fully flow through to consumers could exacerbate pressures on them, especially if the housing market remains lackluster and interest rates rise, said Green Street Advisors in a report in August.

Nasdaq is buying eVestment, a data and content provider to asset managers, for $705m of cash and debt in the latest step to expand the group s technology, data and analytics businesses.

Known most commonly as the operator of the eponymous US equities exchange, Nasdaq has over the last decade diversified as the profitability in trading equities has shrunk with regulatory change and heightened competition.

The latest acquisition comes as chief executive Adena Friedman, who took the helm of the company in January, has repeatedly signaled data and technology as areas of focus and growth for Nasdaq.

 It is an evolution of our strategy,  she told the FT, adding that  our clients  needs are expanding and evolving rapidly with the data available and the technology advancing. 

Investors are among Nasdaq s clients along with corporate issuers of stock, brokers and other exchanges.

eVestment runs a database on both traditional and alternative investment strategies. A pension fund, for example, may use the service for performance and other details in selecting hedge fund investments. In all, eVestment includes as many as 2,800 individual data points on more than 74,000 investment vehicles. It sells to investment managers, consulting firms and pension funds.

 There are a lot of new strategies becoming available and a lot more need for data and analytics to make investment decisions,  Ms Friedman said.

Vista Equity Partners Management has made a strategic investment in Gather Technologies Inc., a provider of event management software for restaurants and venues.

The Atlanta company will use the new capital to expand its employee base and bolster its product development efforts, according to a press release.

Gather in 2016 raised $2.5 million from investors led by Ryan Floyd of Storm Ventures, with participation from Jonathon Triest and Brett DeMarrais of Ludlow Ventures and Nick Romano, founder and chief executive of management software company SignUp4.

Gather's cloud-based platform enables venues and restaurants to manage their roster of events. The company's software has been used for around 3,500 U.S. restaurants and venues, including Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, Rick Bayless restaurants and Darden Specialty Brands, according to the release.

Vista Equity Partners invests in software, data and technology-enabled businesses. The Austin, Texas, firm closed its largest-ever buyout fund at nearly $11.1 billion in early May, WSJ Pro Private Equity "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-equity-goes-big-with-11-billion-tech-focused-buyout-fund-1494244800".

Russian President Vladimir Putin is the latest to sound the alarm bells over artificial intelligence.

He said Friday in a meeting with students that "the one who becomes the leader in this sphere will be the ruler of the world," according to an Associated Press account. "It would be strongly undesirable if someone wins a monopolist position."

Silicon Valley's tech leaders, certainly fans of monopolistic technology positions, have been voicing concerns about AI, too. Last month, 116 founders of robotics and AI companies "https://futureoflife.org/2017/08/20/killer-robots-worlds-top-ai-robotics-companies-urge-united-nations-ban-lethal-autonomous-weapons/" to the United Nations urging it to address lethal autonomous weapons, or killer robots, and ban their use internationally.

But regulating AI isn't a simple task. As a result, diverging viewpoints have emerged on how to manage the technologies that emerge.

Elon Musk has come out strongly in favor of regulation. "Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated," he wrote on Twitter in August. "AI should be too."

That didn't sit right with some. "AI on its own will not be a danger to humans for the foreseeable future." wrote Reza Zadeh, a professor at Stanford and the founder and CEO of machine learning startup Matroid."AI combined with weapons, maybe. So, regulate weapons, not AI."

Mr. Zadeh said by email that "regulating AI is like regulating mathematics or physics."

Pursuing broad AI regulation has pitfalls: Any U.S. regulation that would slow AI advances could put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage on the global stage in terms of national security and financial prospects.

Then again, we just witnessed "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles" in the U.S. presidential election, so maybe it's time to take a harder look.

General Atlantichas appointed a payments technology specialist in the new role of head of financial services and software for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Aaron Goldman is now working from in General Atlantic's London office, having moved from its New York headquarters, the firm said in a statement. He joined the growth-equity investor in 2007 and has focused on deals in payments, online commerce and data analytics, the statement said.

Mr. Goldman has already worked on several investments outside the U.S. He led General Atlantic's 2014 investment in Adyen BV, a payments technology company based in Amsterdam, and its 2015 investment in Dubai-based Network International, another payments company.

Mr. Goldman's arrival comes amid intense interest in the payments technology space from private-equity firms and others.

Blackstone Group LP and CVC Capital Partners last month agreed to buy Paysafe PLC for 2.9 billion. In July, Stockholm-based buyout house Nordic Capital AB agreed to sell Swedish payment-services company Bambora Group to France's Ingenico Group at a  1.5 billion valuation. The same month, Vantiv Inc. bought U.K. payments processor Worldpay Group PLC in a $10 billion deal.

General Atlantic was involved in the summer's flurry of deal making. In July it sold a minority stake in Klarna AB, another Swedish payments group, to Permira Advisers at an undisclosed valuation.

"We see strong potential for attractive growth-equity investments in the EMEA region," Gabriel Caillaux, managing director and joint head of EMEA at General Atlantic, said in the statement.

He said the firm had strengthened its team to help it find new investment targets in the region and assist existing portfolio companies.

General Atlantic's website lists nine other employees in its investment team in EMEA, which is jointly led by Mr. Caillaux and another managing director, John Bernstein.

Before joining General Atlantic, Mr. Goldman spent five years working on growth-equity deals at the Fremont Group in San Francisco.

General Atlantic was founded in 1980 and has $20 billion of assets under management, according to its website. The firm invests from a single evergreen pool of capital backed by wealthy families and other long-term investors.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- The Myth of Stock-Market Tops

By Mark Hulbert 
1,047 words
5 September 2017
The Wall Street Journal
J

English

Many investors are trying to pinpoint the exact day on which the bull market eventually reaches its top. My advice to them: Stop.

I say that not because it is difficult to predict when the stock market changes direction -- though that is true, too. But there's an additional reason: Stock-market tops typically are a gradual rolling-over by the market rather than a sharp trend reversal. Some market averages will hit their peak months before or after others, and individual sectors can behave differently than the market as a whole.

In other words, the top doesn't occur on just one single day, or even in one week or one month. Even if you successfully predict the precise day, or week or month, on which a particular market average hits its top, you can still lose money -- or leave a lot of it on the table -- because other market averages and sectors likely aren't at their peaks.

This is an important insight not just for market historians. With the stock market up more than 300% from its March 2009 lows, and with the economy in its ninth year of recovery from the latest recession, many investors worry that a bear market is overdue. Rather than anxiously trying to determine the exact day when to shift out of stocks, they should instead view market tops as a gradual process in which equity exposure is slowly and deliberately reduced over time.

Take the 2007 bull-market top. The most widely followed market benchmarks, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index, hit their highs on Oct. 9 of that year, and that is the date that most market timers record as the "top" of the 2002-07 bull market. Yet the Russell 2000 index, a widely used proxy for the small-cap sector, registered its top on July 13, three months prior. The Dow Jones Utility Average topped out even earlier, on May 21. And some sectors began their bear markets even longer before; the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, for example, hit its bull-market high in December 2006.

What this means: Pinpointing that Oct. 9 top wouldn't have been very helpful unless you were investing in the S&P 500. In the event you were investing in the average small-cap, utility or regional bank, among others, you would have lost money if you had waited until Oct. 9 to sell.

Perhaps the most spectacular example of a divergence at a market top, however, came when the internet bubble burst. Though the S&P 500 topped out on March 24, 2000, and didn't hit bottom until October 2002, the average small-cap value stock actually rose during that bear market, according to data from University of Chicago professor Eugene Fama and Dartmouth professor Ken French. So small-cap value investors left a lot of money on the table by going to cash during the 2000-2002 bear market.

Divergences this stark and spread out aren't unusual at market tops, according to David Aronson, a former finance professor at Baruch College and now president of Hood River Associates, a research firm that uses machine learning to enhance stock-market trading systems. "The process of topping out can take a really long period of time, evolving over a year or more," he told me in an interview.

Take the end of the bull market in the early 1970s, for example. Though the S&P 500 didn't hit its high until January 1973, major divergences "started to manifest as early as the spring of 1971," nearly two years prior, he says.

In contrast, Mr. Aronson adds, "market bottoms tend to be sharper." The bottom at the end of the 2007-09 bear market is a good case in point: Virtually all major averages hit their bear-market lows on March 9, 2009. Most individual sectors did so also, and those that didn't mostly hit their bottoms only a few days before or after. As Mr. Aronson argues in a just-published book, "bottoms are easier to identify, in real time, than tops."

Instead of trying to pinpoint the day of a particular market's average top, therefore, you might want to focus on the prospects for the individual stocks or mutual funds that you own. Bragging rights for calling the top of this or that market benchmark mean little if your stocks or funds start declining months before that top.

One helpful focus would be on internal market divergences between different sectors of the market. A healthy market is one in which most stocks are participating. As divergences emerge and become more pronounced, odds increase that the stocks you own may suffer even if the major market averages such as the Dow and S&P continue rising.

By the same token, you need to be alert to the possibility that your individual stocks will continue to rise even if the major averages begin a major decline.

It's worth noting in this regard that some potentially worrisome divergences have materialized in recent months, according to Hayes Martin, president of Market Extremes, an investment consulting firm that focuses on market turning points. In an email to me, he pointed out that there have been some significant divergences among groups that historically have been reliable "coal-mine canaries," such as small banks, which peaked on March 1, and smaller-cap stocks, which have been "battered" since late July. This suggests to him that we are probably in a long-term topping process.

Mr. Aronson agrees, though he says it's unclear from his work whether the coming top will precede a major bear market or something of more intermediate-term significance.

Regardless, these divergences suggest that risk is elevated. We may want to focus more on which stocks or funds we would want to sell to reduce our equity exposure rather than what we'd buy to increase it.

What employers want from MBA graduates - and what they don't

Sionade Robinson has an almost impossible task. As associate director for the MBA programme at Cass Business School in London, she must manage the expectations of high achievers about where their business school degree will take them.

One student arrived in her office distraught after being rejected by a large investment bank from its fast-track management programme. They were offering just 15 places worldwide, Ms Robinson recalls.

"People think an MBA is a golden ticket , when it is not," she says.

Landing a job after business school has never been straightforward. But a Financial Times survey could shed light on the process. The anonymous poll reveals what skills leading employers want - and what they don't - from MBA graduates. Read the methodology at FT.com/work-careers.

Our findings suggest students should prepare themselves for a changing MBA jobs market. Our subsequent conversations with employers found graduates should be realistic about the roles for which their MBA degree alone will qualify them.

One in three of the employers we surveyed said they struggled to find business school graduates with the right skills.

The five most important skills were not core MBA subjects, such as finance and marketing, but more loosely defined qualities, or so-called soft skills, such as the ability to work with a wide variety of people (cited by 76 per cent of employers) and the ability to prioritise (cited by 72 per cent). Of these, employers said the ability among MBA graduates to manage their time effectively was the most difficult to find.

The findings may be explained in part by a perception gap. Employers in some sectors, such as oil and gas, civil engineering, transport and energy, see little need for senior staff to hold an MBA degree. Part of the reason, they say, is that they do not believe that business schools teach the right skills.

Business schools are reacting by trying to broaden the pool of MBA employers. At Chicago's Booth School of Business, technology companies such as Amazon and Google have overtaken management consultancies and investment banks as the biggest hirers in recent years. The school is looking for new sectors in which companies may be interested in hiring their MBAs.

Julie Morton, associate dean of careers services and corporate relations at Booth, says half her team of 22 are employed specifically to spread the word about the value of hiring MBA graduates. Many of the companies new to hiring MBA graduates are interested in soft skills, such as the ability to network - one of the most important skills cited in the FT survey, Ms Morton adds. The trick is convincing companies that MBA students have them. "We work with companies all the time where the MBA is not the goal," Ms Morton says.

Several employers told the FT that MBA qualifications were not their priority. At Servest, the facilities management company, four people in senior posts have MBAs. But the company, which employs 51,000 people across the UK and South Africa, did not seek MBA graduates to fill any of these roles, according to Dennis Zietsman, Servest's deputy chairman.

"It's the type of person rather than the business degree that we focus on," he says. "[MBA graduates] have never been our star performers."

Some joining the company with business masters degrees have struggled to convert theory into practice, he says. "Case studies in the MBA programmes seem to be based on big corporates, often American, which cannot be applied to smaller corporates that have cultures different to those that they've studied."

Neither are MBA graduates a priority for the clients of Mark Butter, director of Blueprint Recruitment Solutions, a company that specialises in executive appointments for the oil and gas, marine, civil engineering, transport and energy sectors.

"They are far more likely to be concerned with whether the candidate has industry qualifications, such as being a chartered engineer," Mr Butter says.

Adrian O'Connor, founding director of Global Accounting Network, which helps with appointments of qualified accounting professionals up to finance director level, says an MBA is a "nice to have" rather than a sought-after qualification.

Some clients will accept an MBA instead of an accounting qualification, Mr O'Connor notes. "This is particularly true in either the more commercial finance roles, or indeed at board level."

The FT research suggests there may be an opportunity for business schools to market graduates more effectively among companies not used to hiring at this level. Even among Mr O'Connor's clients, the perception is that business school graduates are good at networking - listed in our survey as among the five most important skills to employers.

"Clients view it as a strong testimonial of someone's intelligence and ability to apply that," Mr O'Connor says.

Ilona Drozd is campus recruiter for the online travel site Expedia in Europe. The company became interested in hiring MBAs for senior strategy roles in part because many of its board directors were MBA graduates, Ms Drozd says.

Despite this, Expedia does not have a specific graduate programme for recruits with an MBA. This year the company, which employs more than 20,000 people worldwide, hired just nine MBA graduates in the UK and three in the US.

The most common reason for rejecting applicants coming in at the senior level, where an MBA graduate would typically aspire to start within an organisation, is a lack of cultural fit and an inability to solve complicated problems, according to Ms Drozd.

Soft skills, such as teamwork, are important but they are not enough, she adds. "The ideal candidate is someone we would like to have long term, which means they have to really want to work at Expedia."

Kevin Marvinac is both an MBA graduate and chief operating officer at TransparentCareer, a database of salary data for people hired from business schools, which is aimed at helping MBA graduates hone their search to find the ideal job.

He believes that an MBA is helpful in securing a rewarding senior executive role, but admits that it is not sufficient in industries where people are also expected to have certain technical skills or experience. The FT survey found big data analysis, for example, was one of the hardest skills to recruit.

"It is really hard to be a product manager at a tech company, for instance, if you don't know how to code," Mr Marvinac says.

Speaking candidly: what employers say

'Business schools must continue to focus on and emphasise analytical hard skills, such as programming languages, because most companies will be using big data to extract insights from internal and external sources. What tends to be missing is the ability to translate these insights into opportunities' 'Too much tactical execution and not enough big-picture thinking' 'Often, MBAs do not have much patience. When companies hire them, the MBAs have been off the market for between one and two years. It takes time to integrate and learn about a new company' 'MBAs hear very often that they are special during their courses - when coming back to business, reality often hits them hard' 'The ability to deal with ambiguity is missing'

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Mifid II will deliver overdue value for money; THE LAST WORD

Some of the headlines seem shocking. "Star research analysts to be hawked for $5,000 an hour" ran a recent one in this publication, reporting on new rules for the fund management industry that are set to upend business models across Europe and beyond.

On the face of it, the rules - requiring sellside companies to separate their charges for execution services out from those charged for access to research - appear to be a blow not only to the fund management industry but, by extension, to the pension funds and retail investors that are their ultimate customers.

However, analysts and consultants familiar with both the buy- and sellsides of the investment industry see things differently. While the European legislation, known as Mifid II, will pose significant challenges for fund managers, it will also force them to make changes to the way they conduct business that may ultimately benefit end investors. The change is long overdue.

Take the requirement to unbundle the purchase of research services, says Nicola Beattie, founder of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy specialising in helping buy- and sellside companies to improve interaction. Under current practice, end clients pay for research; returns to investors are net of brokerage commissions. "Free" research to fund managers is effectively paid for by their clients. Fund managers "are not going to pay more for research than they used to pay", Ms Beattie says, "but now it will come out of their own profit and loss account." That, in turn, could mean higher returns for pension schemes. Already some of the biggest names in fund management have announced their intention to do just that, including Vanguard , Aberdeen and Jupiter.

But the second iteration of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is not simply about forcing the unbundling of services whose costs were previously hidden from investors. In particular, the onus will be on fund managers themselves to ensure that they receive best execution - the sale and purchase of investments at the best available price. That is good news for end clients. Getting the best price for a security on purchase or sale should improve returns to end investors.

The US-based Tabb Group, which produces research on the buy- and sellsides of the industry, notes in a recent research report that it is not just Mifid that is forcing fund managers to focus on best execution. Massive outflows from actively managed funds in light of high charges and poor returns and their resettlement into passive management have also contributed. That shift represents end investors effectively voting with their feet and moving to platforms where value for money is more certain.

Indeed, Mifid is about competition, choice and value for money. And it is not just Europeans who will feel its effects. Roughly 76 per cent of US fund managers surveyed by Tabb expect to fall under some Mifid rules, and they are gearing up for them. Tabb found that 37 per cent of fund managers have initiatives to improve routing to venues where best execution can be achieved, as well as initiatives aimed at improving the reporting of best execution. This contrasts sharply with a 2016 survey that found only a fifth of those surveyed were making best execution and its measurement top priorities.

This is no small matter, Ms Beattie says. "I see instances where the sellside is not getting the best price for the buyside." Not all brokers will have trading arrangements with every exchange where specific securities are dealt, meaning it may cost more for Broker B to acquire a line of stock than it would Broker A. But when investment houses no longer feel obliged to trade through Broker B because of some ancillary service that is provided but not explicitly paid for, end investors can make better choices on trade execution.

The thorny issue of transaction cost analysis (TCA) is climbing up the ladder of US fund managers' priorities, even as European regulators grapple with how it should be measured and reported, according to Tabb. Fine-tuning their TCA analytics is a top concern for roughly a quarter of the 95 fund management groups in the survey. Regulators take note: if asset managers are measuring their own transaction costs, there is no reason these should not be disclosed.

Adapting to the changed environment may involve hefty upfront costs for fund management groups. Companies that cannot afford this investment in technology may be forced out of business. But, overall, the drive to achieve the best price for the customer and to make it clear to customers exactly what they are paying for can only be a good thing for end investors. Better late than never.

Buell's Take: The ECB Can Scream, but That Won't Stop a Strong Euro

Analysis: Jobs Report Won't Alter Immediate Fed Plans, but Doesn't Solve Inflation Puzzle

U.S. Hiring Slows in August, Unemployment Rate Ticks Up

New York Fed's Dudley Investigated, Cleared Over Wells Fargo Disclosure

Eurozone Factory-Gate Prices Stall for Sixth Month, Posing Quandary for ECB

The ECB Can Scream, but That Won't Stop a Strong Euro

In March 2014, my colleague and I were poring over European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's speech in Vienna when we saw "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecbs-draghi-preparing-measures-should-deflation-arrive-1394735302?tesla=y":

"The strengthening of the effective euro exchange over the past one-and-a-half years has certainly had a significant impact on our low rate of inflation and, given current levels of inflation, is therefore becoming increasingly relevant in our assessment of price stability."

An analyst at the time said the verbal intervention was "almost unprecedented." Subsequent comments, a negative deposit rate, and eventually asset purchases known as quantitative easing all led the euro on a nose dive from about $1.40 in March 2014 to $1.05 one year later.

The ECB faces a similar situation now. The single currency exceeded the $1.20 mark last week, sparking concern about whether a stronger currency will depress consumer prices, thus endangering the ECB's effort to push inflation up closer to 2%.

Will Mr. Draghi and top ECB officials react as they did in 2014?

It will be harder for them to do that for the simple reason that speaking against the euro today wouldn't be backed up with dovish action. There is a clear direction in policy toward less monetary policy stimulus, which is bullish for euro investors. Only an unlikely reversal in this policy would allow the euro to weaken.

"We imagine the ECB would scream were EUR/USD to near 1.25 over the next couple of months," wrote ING in a note. But the comments would have to be backed up by a significant delay in reducing bond purchases to reverse the euro rally, it added.

Still, the ECB faces the dilemma that it appears to be gradually changing policy toward less stimulus despite inflation being still short of the target. The ECB will reveal Thursday how far off the mark inflation may be. Frederik Ducrozet of Pictet expects the ECB to cut its 2018 inflation forecast to 1.1% from 1.3% and its 2019 forecast to 1.5% from 1.6%.

The further shortfall from the just below 2% target likely would add pressure to the ECB not to move too rapidly to the exit, as this would put further upward pressure on the euro. This makes it even more likely that the ECB won't announce any detailed plans to reduce its asset purchases Thursday, thus shifting the focus to its Oct. 26 meeting.

So if investors or reporters read a speech with complaints about the strong euro, it will not be unprecedented, but there is doubt whether it will be effective without a much more significant turn in policy.

Key Developments Around the World

Analysis: Jobs Report Won't Alter Immediate Fed Plans, but Doesn't Solve Inflation Puzzle

A solid if "https://www.wsj.com/articles/analysis-jobs-report-wont-alter-immediate-fed-plans-but-doesnt-solve-inflation-puzzle-1504274416" for August is unlikely to change the Federal Reserve's immediate plans to initiate the slow runoff of its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. But the internals of Friday's Labor Department report could magnify the debate over how aggressively the central bank should move forward with rate increases because, at the margins, the data give less reason to worry about the economy overheating. Fed officials have been willing to look past softer inflation pressures because they expect a tighter labor market ultimately will force employers to raise wages and prices. But because Friday's report doesn't show a further decline in labor slack, it may reduce the pressure some officials will feel to raise rates.

U.S. Hiring Slows in August, Unemployment Rate Ticks Up

The U.S. labor market "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-hiring-slows-in-august-unemployment-rate-ticks-up-1504269227" with the pace of hiring easing and the unemployment rate edging up from a historic low. Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 156,000 in August from the prior month, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% from 4.3%. Wage gains remained stuck at the recent modest growth rate. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 179,000 new jobs and a 4.3% unemployment rate last month.

New York Fed's Dudley Investigated, Cleared Over Wells Fargo Disclosure

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-feds-dudley-investigated-cleared-over-wells-fargo-disclosure-1504289320" for failing to disclose a relative's employment at Wells Fargo & Co. and was cleared of any wrongdoing, the regional Fed bank said Friday. The New York Fed said Mr. Dudley noticed in April an "unreported position" related to a sibling and Wells Fargo, as part of the annual process of disclosing his financial interests as required by law. Mr. Dudley's half-sister was a product management executive for the financial firm, the New York Fed said. The New York Fed said Mr. Dudley "identified and recognized his omission and immediately notified" bank leadership. That disclosure triggered an investigation. The New York Fed said an external law firm reviewed his tenure at the regional Fed bank for any "potential conflicts of interest" related to Wells Fargo. The law firm found the failure to disclose the connection was "inadvertent," and found no sign that the Wells Fargo connection affected any of his activities.

Eurozone Factory-Gate Prices Stall for Sixth Month, Posing Quandary for ECB

The prices of goods leaving the eurozone's factory gates "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-factory-gate-prices-stall-for-sixth-month-posing-quandary-for-ecb-1504515805", indicating continued weakness in inflationary pressures, despite a firming economic recovery. The ECB's economists will publish new forecasts Thursday. Some analysts expected them to lower their projections for inflation in 2017 and 2018 to reflect the euro's appreciation against other major currencies over recent months.

Quick Hits: Euro Could Be in Focus at Next Week's ECB Meeting

A Jobs Pause That Refreshes

The labor market may be cooling just enough to put the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-jobs-pause-that-refreshes-1504275015?tesla=y" about slack in the economy, writes Spencer Jakab in The Wall Street Journal. "Another blowout jobs number might have undercut doves on the Federal Open Market Committee who would like to slow down the pace of interest-rate increases until there were signs of stronger wage growth and inflation. After all, unemployment already is at the theoretical level that sparks price pressure. But if payroll growth is indeed cooling off then the Fed can focus on hard data without worrying about labor market slack and could well be on hold for the rest of 2017."

For the ECB, There's Only So Much Time to Play For

With the path of the ECB's bond-purchase program set only until the end of December, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-the-ecb-theres-only-so-much-time-to-play-for-1504454400", writes Richard Barley for The Wall Street Journal. "The ECB might yet play for more time in September, but that will just put the focus on October," he writes. "The stumbling block for the ECB is the euro, which has risen steeply. That is likely to dent the ECB's new inflation forecasts, making communication about policy trickier.

Finance & Markets: Investing Chief Leaves Hedge-Fund Firm

The chief investment officer at Winton Group Ltd., one of the world's largest hedge funds, quit to set up his own firm.

Matthew Beddall worked at Winton for about 17 years and is one of the best-known managers of computer-driven hedge funds in Europe. He left Winton in August, according to regulatory filings.

He has set up Havelock London, a consultancy and investment-management business in which Winton plans to take a stake.

Mr. Beddall, 37 years old, who has been on sabbatical in the U.S. for the past year, said in an interview Friday that his new firm will aim to use technology to manage money and give advice to clients.

Winton, set up by billionaire hedge-fund manager David Harding, runs around $30 billion in computer-driven hedge-fund strategies, much of which is based on trying to profit from trends in financial markets.

Mr. Beddall's departure comes as the hedge-fund industry is in flux. Many investors, tired of lackluster returns and some managers' inability to turn a profit, are increasingly looking to computer-driven funds to navigate markets.

Mr. Beddall, who is still a shareholder in Winton, is setting up Havelock with former Winton research director Kate Land, former Winton technology director Alisdair Wren, and Neil Carter, a former senior distribution head at Jupiter Asset Management.

Winton said that since Mr. Beddall began his sabbatical, his role has been divided up among other Winton staff.

Mr. Beddall said his new firm wouldn't compete with Winton or focus on trying to follow market trends -- one of the biggest areas of quantitative trading. He said one of his main areas of interest was investing based on securities' valuations, and that much of his own wealth is run in that manner. Machine learning -- one of the hottest areas of computer-driven investing -- was useful in "specific circumstances," Mr. Beddall said, but it was "not prudent to leave a computer to it in an unspecified way."

Finance & Markets: Storm Victims Check Fine Print --- Most home-insurance policies in U.S. exclude flooding; shortfalls in coverage expected

Hundreds of thousands of Texas homeowners are expected to lack adequate insurance for repairing flooded houses, if they have it at all.

Many homeowners never examine details of the policies they buy, and it is only after a flood they learn the basics: Standard homeowners' policies provide payouts for damage from wind, fire, fallen trees and other storm-related events but not flooding. For that, people generally need to buy separate policies from the U.S. government, through its nearly 50-year-old National Flood Insurance Program.

As Houston residents started to return home Friday following Hurricane Harvey, many were for the first time checking the fine print on their insurance contracts and hoping for the best.

Among them was Andrea Womack, a 38-year-old mother of four. The carpet and some clothing in her one-story house in Houston's Settegast neighborhood were damaged by water. On Friday morning, Ms. Womack was waiting for an insurance company representative to come by and go through what was covered.

"I signed up for insurance awhile back, but on my papers it says it does not cover flood insurance. So I'm not sure" what will be covered, she said.

Early loss estimates are starting to show that Ms. Womack isn't alone.

Analytics firm CoreLogic has estimated total residential flood costs of $25 billion to $37 billion in 70 counties in Texas and Louisiana hit by Harvey. Of that, about 70%, or $18 billion to $27 billion, is uninsured.

Overall, households and businesses in Harris County, which includes Houston, held roughly 249,000 federal flood policies as of June 30, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. There are about 1.7 million housing units in the county.

Those homeowners who do have flood insurance are likely those whose mortgage lenders require it, said Etti Baranoff, an associate professor of insurance at Virginia Commonwealth University.

"The mortgage company checks if your home is in a flood zone or not, and they'll make you take" a policy out if so, she said.

Even so, those with the government flood policies aren't always made whole, she said. These policies pay out a maximum $250,000 for rebuilding and $100,000 for personal possessions.

Among homeowners with flood coverage are Sydney Truss and his wife, who live south of Houston in Friendswood, Texas.

When they were house hunting last year, the couple worried about possible flooding. So, before they settled on a home, they looked up whether it flooded during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001.

"That's kind of the storm Houstonians judge everything by," said Mr. Truss, 36 years old. "It did not flood during Allison." Even so, the couple's bank required them to get a federal flood policy.

"We're hearing you have to have [all the damaged items] to get insurance" claims paid, Mr. Truss said, surveying the piles of clothes, toys and books in his front yard. He said he was initially going to wait until he heard from insurance officials before clearing out the house, but "it would be a disaster if we kept waiting any longer."

Standard homeowners' policies do pay for some damage from water -- such as if it enters the house after the wind rips off the roof. But if water overflows a riverbank or gushes down a street to seep into a house, the homeowner can expect a claim to be rejected, according to industry lawyers.

The federal flood insurance program's payouts for Harvey appear on track to rival those made for superstorm Sandy in 2012, the U.S.'s third-costliest hurricane (behind Katrina in 2005 and Andrew in 1992). So far, 130,622 Sandy claims have cost the program $8.4 billion, an average of $64,331 apiece, according to the Insurance Information Institute trade group.

Overall, private-market insurance payouts for Harvey are expected to be dominated by payments to business policyholders and range from $10 billion to $20 billion.

A frequent area of dispute after hurricanes has been how much an insurer ought to pay in instances in which both winds and flooding damaged a property. Those disputes could arise in coastal communities where Harvey landed as a Category 4 hurricane with its strongest winds.

"If there is a breath of wind and breath of storm surge, that ought to be enough to put in front of the Texas courts and ask for relief for these people," said David Wood, a policyholder lawyer for corporate clients at Barnes & Thornburg LLP in Los Angeles.

Sapience's technology allows bosses to track automatically employees by monitoring their PCs, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. That sets it apart from traditional work monitoring systems that require users to log their activity in time sheets. Laura Noonan
