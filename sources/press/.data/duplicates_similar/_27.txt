EXCHANGE --- Business & Finance News: Wells Fargo in Talks to Sell Real-Estate Unit

Eastdil Secured, the real-estate brokerage and investment bank owned by Wells Fargo & Co., is in advanced talks to sell the property firm to a venture led by Guggenheim Investments and a Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund, according to people familiar with the matter.

The management team at Eastdil, led by Chief Executive Roy March, would also take an ownership stake along with Guggenheim and Singapore's Temasek Holdings, these people said.

It isn't clear how much the buyers are paying for Eastdil, and there is still a chance an agreement won't be reached.

A deal with the Singapore fund and Guggenheim could provide a big lift for Eastdil, a niche firm that focuses on selling large buildings, mostly in major urban markets. The Singapore fund is expected to help open up new opportunities for Eastdil in Asia, where it has a limited presence. Eastdil would also face fewer regulatory restrictions if it is no longer part of a U.S. bank.

For Wells Fargo, an Eastdil sale would be consistent with the bank's strategy of shedding noncore businesses. Wells Fargo bought Eastdil in 1999 for about $150 million, according to a person with knowledge of the sale, in an effort to bolster its commercial real-estate-lending business.

Guggenheim Investments is the money-management arm of Guggenheim Partners, a sprawling financial conglomerate with interests ranging from investment banking to insurance. Eastdil and Guggenheim Investments share the same Wilshire Boulevard address in Santa Monica, Calif.

Guggenheim views the potential Eastdil deal as a financial investment, not a business it intends to fold into its operations, people familiar with the matter said.

An Eastdil sale would represent a crowning achievement for Mr. March, who would regain some control of the company where he has worked for more than 40 years. He became CEO in 2006, when Eastdil merged with Secured Capital.

Eastdil is smaller than such rivals as CBRE Group and Cushman & Wakefield Inc., which offer services including property management that provide steadier income and are less vulnerable to economic cycles. It has dominated larger commercial real estate sales in Manhattan and other major markets for years. Among U.S. sales of $100 million or more in 2018, Eastdil ranked No. 1, according to Real Capital Analytics.

But the firm has lost some ground to competitors recently. And it lost a top-performing group in New York City led by Douglas Harmon and Adam Spies when they moved to Cushman & Wakefield in 2016. In May, Newmark Group Inc. poached a senior hotel sales and financing team. Late last year, Eastdil hired Gary Phillips, head of acquisitions for Allianz Real Estate of America, to bolster the firm.

What's the alternative as quantitative easing turns to quantitative tightening?

Alternative facts were first unleashed upon a partsuspecting world by president Donald Trump's political adviser in 2017. Since then, the US candour-mangler-inchief has provided no shortage of his own most recently about the economy and interest rates.

In late 2018, he said: "I think the [US Federal Reserve] right now is a much bigger problem than China ... I don't like what they're doing in terms of interest rates"; "they're raising interest rates too fast"; "the ... problem our economy has is the Fed" all apparently contradicting Fed chair Jay Powell, who judged the economy strong enough for rate rises.

In February, Mr Trump declared: "We are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world ... an economic miracle is taking place" in apparent contradiction of Mr Powell's renewed caution.

All this left equity investors struggling to discern truth from fiction helping to send volatility in the S&P 500 index to its third-highest level in seven years. The recent inversion of the US yield curve seen by many as a signal of a coming recession rattled investors.

Wealth managers, however, think they have the perfect counter to alternative facts: alternative assets.

Hedge funds, commodities and assetbacked lending can all protect portfolios from what Iain Tait, partner at London &Capital, deems "the great Powell U-turn".

Mr Tait has spent months working out what the shift in Fed tone means for risk assets and risk-averse clients. As he puts it, the markets "convulsed" at the thought of the Fed raising rates and reversing the quantitative easing stimulus of past years.

"The greatest threat to wealth and families is the transition from QE to QT, or quantitative tightening," he says. "You don't pivot to tightening without extreme volatility."

For more conservative wealth managers such as L&C, this creates a headache. They had thought the QEfuelled equity bull run would burn out by mid year, but the Trump/Fed turnabouts suggest it will now last further into 2019. Even so, Mr Tait concludes it is an "exhausted-looking cycle for stocks and bonds".

His head of alternatives, Kristian Richmond, has been looking to hedge funds. "Going back to traditional longshort equity funds is beneficial at this point," he suggests. But he needs managers with a verifiable record of making money at the end of a bull run. L&C uses Sandler US Equity.

Alternatives to long-only equity holdings are global hedge funds, says Mr Richmond. Here, he favours Informed Portfolio Management's Systematic Global Macro strategy, which trades assets based on economic fundamentals.

Ben Gutteridge, head of fund research at Brewin Dolphin, shares L&C's faith in long-short funds notably Janus Henderson's and BlackRock's but reckons it is currently a challenge for global macro hedge fund managers to put big economic and asset class calls at the heart of an investment strategy.

As a result, Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer at Lloyds Bank Private Banking, puts his trust in technology to outperform delusional humans: "The systematic models used by machine learning trading strategies are agnostic as to the direction of their positions and can help reduce the risk of unconscious bias."

Bias can be removed by holding assets highly uncorrelated to the stock market or economy, argues Mr Tait. Here, he recommends renewable energy investments, where returns are driven by government subsidies and technological advances, such as battery storage systems. Examples used by L&C include the Foresight Solar fund and Gresham House's new Energy Storage fund.

For some, there is no alternative to classic alternatives. "The other way to diversify an equities-heavy portfolio is an exposure to commodities, and more specifically to gold," says Stphane Monier, chief investment officer at Swiss bank Lombard Odier.

"The precious metal tends to perform well in higher volatility and weakening US dollar environments, especially if market participants start having doubts about monetary policies," he adds.

Recommended allocations to alternatives range from 5 per cent at Hassium to 15-17 per cent at L&C, for wealthy families familiar with the risks and liquidity profile.

But, as with all things alternative, from political populists to uncorrelated asset classes, the cycle eventually turns. All the way back to active equity funds, Mr Monier believes: "As volatility rises above the all-time lows experienced in 2017, active management could once again be in a position to extract alpha."

Extracting truth from the White House's resident "Alpha" may take a little longer.

Facebook Accused Of Aiding Bias in Housing

WASHINGTON -- Federal officials accused Facebook Inc. Thursday of unlawful discrimination by allowing real-estate companies to target potential customers by race, religion and other factors, and signaled other technology firms are in its crosshairs.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development said the social-media giant violated the Fair Housing Act "by restricting who can view housing-related ads."

HUD has sent letters to a number of technology companies, including Alphabet Inc. unit Google and Twitter Inc., asking for more information about their advertising practices, an agency official said. Those inquiries are preliminary and don't amount to formal investigations, but could lead to additional probes.

"Just because a process to deliver advertising is opaque and complex doesn't mean that it exempts Facebook and others from our scrutiny and the law of the land," HUD General Counsel Paul Compton said in a statement. "Fashioning appropriate remedies and the rules of the road for today's technology as it impacts housing are a priority for HUD."

A spokesman for Facebook said the company was surprised by HUD's action, saying it had been working with the department to address the concerns. The spokesman said the company last year eliminated thousands of targeting options subject to misuse, among other measures.

"While we were eager to find a solution, HUD insisted on access to sensitive information -- like user data -- without adequate safeguards," the spokesman said in a statement. "We're disappointed by today's developments, but we'll continue working with civil rights experts on these issues."

Google didn't address questions about how it has responded to HUD's request and whether the alleged flaws in Facebook's algorithms would also be common to its own.

"We've had policies in place for many years that prohibit targeting ads on the basis of sensitive categories," a Google spokeswoman said in an email.

Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment.

The allegations against Facebook amount to a modern spin on redlining, or the historic practice by some real-estate brokers, lenders and others of drawing red lines around low-income and minority neighborhoods and either denying services, or targeting them with higher rates.

Facebook's trove of data allowed it to go much further, according to HUD -- for example, enabling ad buyers to exclude people that some unscrupulous landlords might seek to avoid, including people who expressed interest in an "assistance dog," a "mobility scooter" or "deaf culture."

It also allowed advertisers to block people who identified themselves as interested in "Puerto Rico Islanders," "Hijab Fashion" and "Hispanic Culture," according to HUD. Facebook offered customers hundreds of thousands of exclusionary categories.

Galen Sherwin, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU Women's Rights Project who helped lead a settlement that was announced last week with Facebook over many of its practices, said her group "would encourage HUD to investigate other platforms."

The ability to target consumers by their identifying characteristics "is a feature that's being touted," Ms. Sherwin said. "That's true in general of digital advertising -- it allows microtargeting based on user data in ways that were never possible before."

Private lawsuits against Facebook already have led the company to agree to changes that could lessen the impact of discrimination. But the company's use of algorithms and machine learning in advertising also is a big problem, according to critics. The HUD case could go further in forcing the company to change those practices as well.

Among other things, HUD alleged that Facebook's machine learning predicts likely responses to an ad to help determine its distribution. That can effectively become a source of bias against protected groups itself, the agency alleged. "Respondent's mechanisms function just like an advertiser who intentionally targets or excludes users based on their protected class," the complaint alleges.

Some experts in online discrimination said the HUD allegations show the need for Congress to step in and clarify that existing antidiscrimination rules in housing, employment and lending apply just as clearly in the digital world as in the physical world.

"Congress really needs to engage in a very deliberative process to see what applies to the digital space," said Nicol Turner Lee, a Brookings Institution fellow. "We don't want a regress" in civil rights because antidiscrimination laws were generally written before the internet, she said.

One potential problem for the government's effort to impose antidiscrimination rules online is a law written by Congress in the 1990s. It gives online platforms sweeping immunity from liability for the actions of their users. That law has been used by online firms to shield themselves from government action and private lawsuits alike.

Still, Thursday's action underscores how big internet companies are running into more problems.

In addition to the HUD action, Facebook is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy concerns. Last year, Congress also made it easier to go after online platforms for sex trafficking.

Facebook's discrimination troubles date to 2016, when the ProPublica news organization reported how advertising could be targeted to -- or exclude -- users of particular races, genders and ages. Such targeting is acceptable in certain contexts, but federal law and state laws prohibit such discrimination in advertising for housing, jobs and many financial products.

Following the revelations, Facebook pledged to prevent such discriminatory advertising by blocking advertisers' ability to screen people protected by federal discrimination laws from seeing their advertising. HUD opened -- and then dropped -- an investigation into Facebook's practices.

HUD reopened its investigation in 2018, and Facebook settled a lawsuit with the state of Washington by agreeing, again, to prevent discrimination on its advertising platform.

HUD Action Against Facebook Signals Trouble for Other Platforms; Department accuses social-media firm of fostering discrimination in advertising based on race, national origin, religion and more

But the company's use of algorithms and machine learning in advertising also is a big problem, according to critics. The HUD case could go further in forcing the company to change those practices as well.

Among other things, HUD charged that Facebook's machine learning predicts likely responses to an ad to help determine its distribution. That can effectively become a source of bias against protected groups itself, the agency said. "Respondent's mechanisms function just like an advertiser who intentionally targets or excludes users based on their protected class," the complaint says.

Some experts in online discrimination said the HUD charges show the need for Congress to step in and clarify that existing antidiscrimination rules in housing, employment and lending apply just as clearly in the digital world as in the physical world. That hasn't always been clear.

That law has been used by online firms in the past to shield themselves from government action and private lawsuits alike. The federal courts are currently divided over how it applies in the housing discrimination context, but it could arise as a potential hurdle for HUD's case against Facebook, lawyers said.

Still, Thursday's action underscores how big internet companies once darlings of Washington are running into more problems. In addition to the HUD action, Facebook is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy concerns. Congress last year also made it easier to go after online platforms for sex trafficking.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department last summer filed a brief siding with the National Fair Housing Alliance in a case against Facebook. Justice Department lawyers said that Facebook could be held liable for discriminatory practices, despite the 1990s immunity law. The government also said decisively that it was unlawful to send ads selectively in a discriminatory way.

"It was a critical turning point showing the federal government was on our side," said Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer with Outten & Golden LLP.

Facebook's discrimination troubles date to 2016, when the ProPublica news organization reported how advertising could be targeted to or exclude users of particular races, genders and ages. Such targeting is acceptable in certain contexts, but federal law and state laws prohibit such discrimination in advertising for housing, jobs and many financial products.

Following the revelations, Facebook pledged to prevent such discriminatory advertising by blocking advertisers' ability to screen people protected by federal discrimination laws from seeing their advertising. HUD opened and then dropped an investigation into Facebook's practices.

HUD reopened its investigation in 2018, and Facebook settled a lawsuit with the state of Washington by agreeing, again, to prevent discrimination on its advertising platform. The ACLU and fair-housing groups also filed a suit that Facebook settled just last week that included payments of just under $5 million. As part of that settlement, Facebook said it was removing age, gender and ZIP Code targeting for housing, employment and credit-related advertisements.

In the wake of that settlement, Facebook said it believed it was working toward a similar agreement with HUD. But negotiations over how to proceed on a HUD request for key Facebook data broke down.

According to someone familiar with the request, HUD sought an array of data Facebook uses to personalize content to specific users, including location information, users' consumption of past content, what features of Facebook they engage with and who they interact with on the platform. Facebook balked, this person said, and HUD sued.

Advertisers are waiting to see if changes Facebook makes going forward will prohibit targeting that makes the platform so useful, said an executive at a large ad-buying agency.

In the meantime, buyers are identifying additional, alternative mediums for advertisers targeting people in the market for a home. The executive expects home sites to see bigger commitments from advertisers, and therefore an increase in ad revenue, in 2020.

Good day. The U.S. is forcing a Chinese company to sell U.S. mobile app Grindr on national security grounds. That development will likely further turn off Chinese acquirers' pursuit of U.S. assets, sealing off an important exit path for American VCs.

"The Chinese internet companies are very large, flooded with cash, have massive valuations and would be great acquirers that have an appetite to expand into the U.S.," said David Pakman, a partner at Venrock.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. ordered Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. Ltd. to sell Grindr out of concern that personal information obtained by the gay-dating app could be exploited by the Chinese government for espionage, The Wall Street Journal reports. Kunlun acquired a majority stake in Grindr in 2016.

Geron's Take: Who Really Benefits as Startups Fuel Growth Via Venture-Funded Ads?

By Tomio Geron

Gaining customers the key for growth used to be as cheap as unveiling an app in the Apple App Store or launching a Facebook app. But these days, the cost has skyrocketed as those channels have become heavily saturated, making it nearly impossible to get seen above the crowd.

* Some of the most successful companies like Google, Facebook and Stripe have grown through word-of-mouth. But many of today's startups rely on ads. As a result, they're raising more and more venture funding at higher valuations leaving venture firms to arm themselves with larger funds and higher management fees.

* Some startups that are put off by that trend are experimenting with an alternative that directly funds their customer-acquisition tactics.

* One specialist that provides funds to pay for ads is called Clearbanc. The company provides $5,000 to $10 million to startups to buy ads. Startups split the revenue with Clearbanc that results from the ads, or about 6% of the capital.

* Startups are getting the message. Toronto-based Clearbanc says it did 500 deals last year and expects to do 2,000 this year.

Still climbing: Lyft Inc. raised its targeted price range to $70 to $72 a share for its initial public offering.

* At the top of the new range, which was disclosed in a filing Wednesday, the ride-hailing service would be valued at more than $23 billion on a fully diluted basis.

* The Wall Street Journal had previously reported that Lyft was telling some investors it was likely to price the stock in the low $70s, above its previously targeted range of between $62 and $68 a share. The WSJ's Corrie Driebusch has the story.

Vapor wager: With its $12.8 billion bet on Juul Labs Inc., Altria Group Inc. made a calculated gamble: Buying a startup whose stated goal is to get smokers to drop cigarettes would help the Marlboro maker, the biggest U.S. tobacco company, keep up with a quickly changing market. The risk: It could hasten its own decline.

Equifax, FICO Creator Team Up

Two consumer-credit giants plan to start working together to sell consumers' data to banks, the latest attempt to feed banks' appetite for more information on customers.

Equifax Inc. and Fair Isaac Corp., creator of the widely used FICO credit score, started pitching each other's services earlier this month, and the companies announced the partnership Wednesday. Both companies already sell their services to banks, but now their sales employees will pitch each other's services as well. Sometimes the companies will approach clients together.

Equifax, a credit-reporting giant still trying to recover from its massive 2017 data breach, maintains extensive data on U.S. adults that often include their income, bank account balances and whether they pay their gas and cellphone bills. FICO's software analyzes the data to help banks get a better read on loan applicants.

The partnership is the latest effort by companies that have been the bedrock of the U.S. consumer-credit system to diversify beyond the nuts and bolts of credit reports and scores.

For decades, most U.S. lenders have reviewed loan applicants' reports and scores to determine whether to approve them and what interest rate to charge.

After years of relatively cautious lending, banks and other lenders are seeking additional consumer data to help them make loans to more borrowers, including people with little credit history or with credit blemishes. Credit reporting and scoring firms have been pivoting to address the demand.

Late last year, FICO and another credit-reporting giant, Experian PLC, said they would begin factoring how consumers manage their bank accounts into credit scores. Soon after, Experian separately said it would add cellphone and utility payments into its credit reports and the FICO scores it sells to lenders. The new methodologies, which are optional for consumers, are designed to boost the number of approvals for credit cards, personal loans and other products.

Equifax and FICO argue that buying their services together will help lenders make underwriting decisions more quickly, especially for borrowers with thin credit histories. They also say that lenders will be able to make more precise decisions about what products to pitch to a customer, such as a plain-vanilla credit card versus a premium rewards card, and will be able to better screen people who apply for bank accounts.

But the companies will face competition from data providers and financial-technology firms that do the same and banks' own in-house analytics resources.

Equifax, Experian and competitor TransUnion have for years been amassing growing piles of data about American adults that go far beyond people's history managing their debts. At Equifax that includes information on people's employers, brokerage accounts and other information. Most of that extra data haven't made its way into credit reports or FICO credit scores, but credit-reporting firms have been selling that data separately to lenders.

Deciding which loan applicants to approve is complex. Making risky borrowers look more creditworthy can expose lenders to default risk. Denying someone who additional data might prove creditworthy -- like someone who pays their cellphone and other non-loan bills on time -- would hurt revenue. Approving a consumer whose credit reports and scores look good but has other hidden red flags, such as minimal savings, would elevate the lender's risk.

The FICO-Equifax deal was spearheaded by the companies' chief executives. FICO CEO Will Lansing and Equifax CEO Mark Begor have known each other for decades, and Mr. Begor was a FICO board member until he took over Equifax last year.

Politicians warn high pay in asset management undermines efforts to hold companies to account

UK chief executives were caught in politicians  crosshairs following the release of a report on  eye-watering  pay this week, but a less prominent group also came in for stinging criticism: asset managers.

MPs on parliament s business select committee said soaring executive packages at FTSE 100 companies tarnished Britain s reputation and were a symbol of corporate greed.

As the biggest shareholders in Britain s listed companies, institutional investors have considerable power to push for change in investee groups. They can talk to executives, use their votes and, ultimately, wield the threat of divestment.

Many asset managers like to burnish their credentials as responsible investors, which is especially the case with active managers as they try to show they offer more than their passive rivals.

The MPs  report, however, was withering over the quality of this work. While it noted that asset managers were giving more attention to pay, it said many were not doing enough. It cast doubt on their ability to curtail pay through engagement alone and suggested that high salaries in fund management were a stumbling block.

 In general stewardship is not working as well as it should,  it said.  We do not have confidence in . . . institutional investors in exercising their stewardship functions, in a way that consistently bears down on executive pay . . . We cannot rely on shareholders to exert pressure. 

Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create-Research, the consultancy, said the report  makes uncomfortable reading for asset managers .

 Some will quibble with the report s broad-brush approach,  he said.  The rest will accept the spirit behind its conclusions. 

The committee called for a stronger correlation between employee and executive pay and questioned whether asset managers were best placed to police the issue.

The report said it was not impossible for investors to take  a principled stand  but that fund managers were often themselves extremely highly paid.  It may be awkward, if not hypocritical, for them (or the corporate governance teams which engage directly with companies) to criticise pay policies for prioritising short-term financial incentives,  said the report.

Peter Harrison, chief executive of Schroders, received a package of more than 6.7m in 2018   63 times that of median employee pay at the UK s second-largest listed fund manager. Average pay at the group was 103,615 across all staff.

Dick Weil, chief executive of UK-headquartered Janus Henderson, took home just over $9m (6.8m) last year after seeing his salary rise 26 per cent in six months.

Meanwhile, Prudential, the insurance group, paid an unnamed employee 16.6m last year   more than double the total package earned by chief executive Mike Wells. It is widely believed that worker is Richard Woolnough, a star bond manager in the company s asset management division.

 As long as the people in charge of putting ticks in the boxes that push through such pay deals are themselves paid large amounts of money, their idea of what is normal is skewed,  said Fergus Moffatt, head of UK policy at responsible investment group ShareAction.

The MPs also noted that even protest votes against pay packages, usually considered a last resort, were largely ineffective.

Both Royal Mail and Persimmon suffered shareholder rebellions over executive pay last year but neither vote resulted in change. The vote was nonbinding in the case of Royal Mail while at Persimmon abstentions were not counted.

However, Andrew Ninian, director of stewardship and corporate governance at the Investment Association, the trade body, said there was evidence that stewardship was working.  Firms such as HSBC, Aviva and Lloyds have all changed their pay packages in response to investor concerns,  he said.

The three companies have all recently cut the amount of money to which top executives are entitled in lieu of a pension contribution or defined benefit pension payments.

IA members undertook more than 7,000 engagements with companies in 2018 and 63 companies received more than a 20 per cent vote against a remuneration resolution last year.

 Shareholders want companies to be able to demonstrate the link between executive pay and company performance,  said Mr Ninian.  Asset managers play a key role in the stewardship process. 

Angeli Benham, corporate governance manager at Legal & General Investment Management, the UK s biggest fund manager, welcomed the call to make asset owners more responsible in holding managers to account but highlighted the difficulties of doing so.

 Getting companies to listen is often a challenge,  she said.  That is partly because they receive different feedback from different asset managers, some of whom may not have enough corporate governance resources to engage with as many companies in as much depth as they d like to. 

She added that LGIM avoided conflict of interest over pay by having the corporate governance team report directly to the chief executive and vote independently of the investment team.

Schroders, Standard Life Aberdeen, M&G Prudential and Aviva Investors declined to comment.

Mr Rajan said asset managers were still best placed to enforce a crackdown on lavish pay.  I don t think they re the only people but they re among the best. They own the companies, they have a very clear role,  he said.

However, he added that investors  should not be afraid  to signal their displeasure publicly.

The report urged large investors to make known their stance on generous executive pay, noting that it is  relatively rare  for them to do so. It called on them to explain policies and voting records.

Asset owners, such as pension funds, also faced MPs  criticism. The report said the  primary responsibility for changing the environment on executive pay rests with asset owners, rather than asset managers . It recommended that the new stewardship code should require them to provide more information on their objectives in relation to executive pay.

 We call for greater transparency in the way they set investment objectives, including on executive pay, and that the regulator is given powers to take effective action against those who do not meet their responsibilities under a revised stewardship code. 

The committee concluded that improved stewardship alone was not the answer, recommending drastic measures such as an absolute cap on total remuneration for executives in any year, allowing workers to sit on committees and including staff in profit-sharing schemes.

George Dallas, policy director at the International Corporate Governance Network, said stewardship could be improved but argued that concern over the lack of trust in business and economic inequality was political and separate to the job of investors, which is to ensure good returns for clients.

 There is room for improvement [but] public policy is not necessarily their role,  he said.

Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Minerva Analytics, a consultancy that advises shareholders, welcomed the committee s findings. She said it would increase scrutiny on shareholders who backed lavish pay deals but warned it would be difficult to implement the recommendation that boards should set an absolute cap on total pay.

 That s very challenging because it would seem to be a wages policy, which is not left open to the market.

Stanford, Anthem Blue Cross Set Out to Address AI Bias,  Black Box' Problem in Health Care; Partners look to build confidence and trust in machine-based decisions relating to treatment and prices

Corrections & Amplifications

Anthem Blue Cross insures 8.4 million people in California. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it insures nearly 40 million people in the state. (March 27, 2019)

Anthem Blue Cross and Stanford University are working together to develop artificial intelligence algorithms for health care that can make unbiased, transparent decisions about insurance prices and treatment approvals.

The health insurer, a Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based subsidiary of Anthem Inc., said in a statement last week it will share the results of the research project with affiliated health plans in 11 states.

Anthem Blue Cross, which insures 8.4 million people in California, will become the first member of Stanford's AI for Health Affiliation program, a new research initiative within the university's Department of Computer Science. Founding members must contribute $300,000 a year and are expected to be members for at least three years, a spokesman for Stanford said.

The increased use of artificial intelligence in business is prompting questions about the soundness of AI-based decisions that could potentially affect who gets a car loan, who is selected for marketing specials or who is cleared to use costly new medications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year approved the first AI-powered medical device to help diagnose strokes in patients by analyzing digital images of the brain.

The Stanford initiative will initially focus on developing AI for patient engagement and health-care transparency to help consumers understand their options and make informed decisions, the announcement said.

Over time, the Stanford collaboration will address two well-known and persistent AI challenges: the risk of bias, and the "black box problem" of explaining how an AI system arrived at a particular decision, said Rajeev Ronanki, senior vice president and chief digital officer of Indianapolis, Ind.-based Anthem Inc.

Anthem Blue Cross is looking to develop fair, interpretable AI that in the future could justify rates and pricing to the public and to regulators, back up medical diagnoses used to approve or deny coverage, and provide evidence in claims denials or disputes.

Anthem already uses AI to help staff make decisions in some areas, including billing and prior authorizations for treatment, Mr. Ronanki said.

For Anthem, seeking internal confirmation of its AI-based decisions is as important as convincing outsiders, Mr. Ronanki said. The company hasn't yet determined how making AI easier to explain or less biased could change the way it interacts with regulators or customers, Mr. Ronanki said.

With regard to bias, Anthem is trying to get ahead of potential mishaps. The issue is not theoretical: AI systems have in some cases been found to favor whites and males in job applications, for instance.

Bias is "a challenge that we see coming," Mr. Ronanki said. "Even internally we want to be sure [AI] is accurate."

The owner of Arby's and Buffalo Wild Wings is tapping a high-end-retail technology leader as its chief information officer, as the newly merged restaurant chains seek to leverage digital tools to improve online ordering, mobile payments and other services.

Inspire Brands Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arbys-buffalo-wild-wings-merge-to-compete-in-fast-changing-industry-1517841000" after Arby's Restaurant Group acquired Buffalo Wild Wings Inc., said this week that Raghu Sagi will take on his new role April 15. He will lead a team of more than 200 IT professionals, a company spokesman said.

Mr. Sagi, who for the past two years served as chief engineering officer at Sephora America, succeeds departing CIO Darla Morse, who is leaving to oversee IT at CKE Restaurants Holdings Inc., the parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's restaurants, Inspire Brands said. He will report to Inspire Chief Executive Paul Brown.

"We have the opportunity to build something that will set us apart in the industry," Mr. Sagi told CIO Journal. Among his priorities will be to "further develop our digital ecosystem to differentiate and personalize the guest experience while also driving brand loyalty," he said.

For two years, Mr. Sagi has served as chief engineering officer at Sephora America, the beauty retailer owned by Paris-based luxury-goods company LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE.

At Sephora he held a range of tech posts since 2011, including vice president of digital and retail technology and vice president of engineering. Earlier, he was director of engineering at Walmart Inc. and an applications architect at Best Buy Co.

Based in Atlanta, Inspire Brands oversees more than 8,300 restaurants, including Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic Drive-In and Rusty Taco locations world-wide. Together, they serve more than 180 million guests every year, the company said.

Mr. Sagi will oversee efforts to leverage "existing and emerging technologies" across the chain to improve customer service, the company said.

Mr. Brown, in a statement, described the CIO role as instrumental to the company's digital strategies, adding that many tech initiatives Mr. Sagi led in the past are "widely considered the benchmark for the implementation of cutting-edge technologies in the retail space." These include improving data insights at Sephora to boost personalization and customer loyalty capabilities, among other projects.

Across the restaurant industry, the most common customer-facing tech tools include guest Wi-Fi services, online ordering or reservations, mobile payments and other smartphone apps, according to the National Restaurant Association.

More advanced capabilities, such as predictive ordering or automated menu-price adjustments based on demand, require data analytics and artificial-intelligence skills that are in high demand across all industries.

Technology can help restaurant operators increase sales and productivity, while providing an edge over competitors, the trade group says. The most common barrier to tech adoption is cost, followed by a lack of infrastructure and staff training, it says.

Anthem already uses AI to help staff make decisions in some areas, including billing and prior authorizations for treatment, Mr. Ronanki said.

Adversarial AI

Why adversarial AI could be a big problem. Dawn Song, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in security risks involved with AI and machine learning, said adversarial machine learning methods could be used to attack just about any system built on the technology, reports MIT Technology Review.

Defining the term. Adversarial machine learning involves a bit of experimentation. The aim is to feed data into an algorithm to reveal the information it has been trained on or distorting an input and causing the system to malfunction. By putting tons of images into a computer vision algorithm, for example, someone can reverse-engineer its functioning and get it to produce certain outputs, including incorrect ones, according to MIT Technology Review.

Examples. Ms. Song provided some examples of adversarial-learning. One project, which was done with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, involved probing a machine-learning algorithm that was programmed to generate automatic responses from emails. The results demonstrated that by creating the right messages, the model could be made to output sensitive data such as credit card numbers. Google used the findings to prevent Smart Compose, a tool that automatically generates text in Gmail, from being abused.

Adversarial AI, with its huge potential to be used both defensively and offensively, is of particular interest to the defense systems industry. This year, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency began a project called Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception to study adversarial machine learning.

Ethics

Google establishes ethics council. Alphabet Inc.'s Google is establishing an advisory council to address the ethical issues around AI and other emerging technologies, reports Reuters.

At the table. The council includes technology experts, digital ethicists, and people with public policy backgrounds, according to Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president for global affairs. Among its members are Joanna Bryson, an associate professor in computing at the University of Bath; William J. Burns, a former U.S. deputy secretary of state; and Dyan Gibbens, chief executive of drone startup Trumbull, according to a Google blog post.

The goal. The council's mission is to provide recommendations for Google and others working on technologies such as facial recognition software. The group is expected to release a report at the end of the year.

Quotable

"When I see it applied to something that without AI, it is just too complex, we never would have seen how that system works, that I feel like,  Wow, that is a very good thing.'"

  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates

Customer Service

AI at your service. AI is on the verge of a mass adoption by customer service organizations as public expectations have risen to the point that customers now expect organizations to anticipate their needs, reports ZDNet.

Growing fast. Currently, fewer than a quarter of customer service organizations use chatbots, but AI adoption is projected to grow 143% in the next two years, ZDNet said, citing a recent report from Salesforce, the digital sales and marketing platform company. The most common use of AI right now is handling repetitive tasks, such as asking customers for basic information, helping reset passwords or providing status updates on order shipments. AI will free up sales agents from such mundane tasks to acting as "strategic client advocates."

The businesses that get the most out of AI will be the ones that see the technology not merely as a labor-saving device but as a liberator of human potential.

Innovators

Unsung women powered  intelligence' behind first digital computer. Male physicists and engineers were the public face for ENIAC, the world's first general-purpose electronic computer, but six women working at the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-1940s were the brains, IEEE Spectrum reports.

No acclaim. The group was responsible for configuring the 6,000-switch mega machine to perform specific computations, and they sometimes had to climb inside to replace parts. But they received virtually no acknowledgment at the time, in part because programming ENIAC was closely associated with human computation "and was therefore considered to be a type of  subprofessional' women's work," said the report.

Drones

Humans dominate AI in drone racing. Simulations are one thing, but performance tests in the real world show there is still work to be done when it comes to AI-controlled drones, according to the New York Times.

Three-dimensional spaces contain more unknowns than a simulation can offer. This creates unforeseen challenges for programmers. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, along with other companies, challenged world-class drone pilots to race their machines. With a commendable speed for automated drones being 5.6 miles per hour, there was little competition.

Take it slow. The images AI uses to navigate become blurred as the flying speed of a drone increases. This causes the machine to confuse where it is in a three-dimensional space. While Alphabet Inc.'s AI team, DeepMind, has created systems that consistently best human players in computer games, AI has a long way to go to compete with humans.

"For autonomous drones to be useful in disaster zones as delivery vehicles or in rural areas they will need to be able to fly far, fast and without human oversight, often in environments where they can't rely on external guidance systems, like GPS," according to the Times.

Automation

Worries of an AI takeover. Should AI ever prove to be harmful to humans, it probably won't come in the form of The Terminator. OpenAI's Paul Christiano categorized two disaster scenarios human irrelevance and humans being influenced by AI, reports Vox. Both are theoretical, but as automated machines play a larger role in society, a failure could prove to be devastating.

"I definitely think humans are bad at precisely stating what they want, and that combined with a powerful enough technology, human failure could lead to very bad outcomes," Vox said.

Governance

Regulators give the go-ahead for private sector innovation. Roll Call reported on enthusiasm in the financial services industry after receiving encouragement from regulators. The news comes as a call-to-action for banks and consulting firms to increase protection against "money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activity," regulators said. Navigant's managing editor, Tim Mueller, said the new rush is reminiscent of banks using the World Wide Web to bolster business.

Notoriously secretive, DE Shaw mixes quantitative investing with common sense to manage $50bn in assets. But as rivals adapt this hybrid approach, the hedge fund faces a fight to keep its edge in the market. By Robin Wigglesworth

I n 1988, Revolution Books, a tatty Communist bookstore near New York's Union Square, got some strange new upstairs neighbours: a bunch of geeky programmers trying to crack the code to financial markets.

In the early days, the embryonic hedge fund founded by David Shaw, a former computer science professor at Columbia University, was a ramshackle start-up. Exposed pipes and extension cords meant that tripping on a cable could take out its entire trading system. Yet today DE Shaw is one of the hedge fund industry's biggest players, managing over $50bn of assets.

It has enjoyed some mainstream fame as the place where a young Jeff Bezos first worked on what would ultimately become Amazon. But most importantly for a wider investment industry desperately trying to reinvent itself for the 21st century, DE Shaw has evolved dramatically from the algorithmic, computerdriven "quantitative" trading it helped pioneer in the 1980s.

It is now a leader in combining quantitative investing with traditional "fundamental" strategies driven by humans, such as stockpicking. This symbiosis has been dubbed "quantamental" by asset managers now attempting to do the same. Many in the industry believe this is the future, and are rushing to hire computer scientists to help realise the benefits of big data and artificial intelligence in their strategies.

Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman who owns a 20 per cent stake in DE Shaw, predicts that this approach will profoundly reshape the investment management industry. "People have gone insane about this, but in a good way," Mr Schmidt says. "We are at the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence. These technologies should benefit investing as well."

There are plenty of pitfalls though, with experts warning that poor implementation can lead to disastrous results. Wall Street has seen several cycles of quant hype before, and many remain sceptical that traditional firms can retool their culture sufficiently to unlock the potential advantages of a more hybrid approach.

The combination of DE Shaw's performance and the secrecy around exactly what it does both vexes and fascinates rivals and counterparties. "They're like a calibrated machine that can respond to nearly every market," says the head of an investment bank's hedge fund trading desk. In a series of interviews with senior DE Shaw executives, the Financial Times has had a rare glimpse of how the "machine" operates.

Geek show Little known outside investing's arcane corners, DE Shaw is the fourth-highest grossing hedge fund group of all time, having made over $29bn for its investors since those early days near Union Square, according to LCH Investments.

Last year its flagship $14bn Composite Fund which has been closed to new investors since 2013 returned over 11 per cent to investors net of fees, despite the turmoil in financial markets. That was its seventh double-digit gain of the past decade, over which period it has not suffered a losing year. Its $7.6bn "macro" fund, Oculus, returned 5.9 per cent in 2018, and the $7bn stocksfocused Valence fund made 8 per cent. Even among peers on Wall Street, DE Shaw is still a largely unknown quantity. "They're really smart, but I've never quite understood them," says one quant hedge fund manager. "They are one of those places where you just don't know exactly what [it is] they do, except that it is some mix of quantitative and discretionary investing."

This hybrid approach is not new. DE Shaw ventured out of its quantitative roots soon after its founding. But it now manages a wide array of strategies, ranging from completely machinedriven and dizzyingly complex, to human and artisanal, such as "distressed debt" investing and activism. Roughly half of the $50bn it manages are invested in quant strategies, and the rest in discretionary or more hybrid funds.

"The world tends to view quantitative and fully discretionary investing as distinct and separate, but the opportunity set [to make money] is not as cleanly divided," says Max Stone, one of five members of DE Shaw's executive committee, along with Eddie Fishman, Eric Wepsic, Julius Gaudio and Anne Dinning.

Some rivals question whether it has departed too far from its roots. For instance, Two Sigma a major quant hedge fund started by former senior DE Shaw executives has eschewed their former colleagues' hybrid methods.

DE Shaw executives stress that their one constant is to have a data-driven "quanty" approach across the board, whether it is in high-speed arbitrage or investing in renewable energy. "Our core strength is thinking scientifically about things, so it doesn't feel like we are wandering away from our roots," says Alexis Halaby, head of investor relations at the company.

It currently employs about 1,300 people, which includes more than 80 PhDs and 25 International Math Olympiad medal holders. All interviewees at DE Shaw face a series of analytical questions to demonstrate their suitability to work there something even former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers had to go through ahead of a stint at the fund in 2006.

That approach seeps through into the culture, say observers. Mahmood Noorani, a former hedge fund manager who now leads Quant Insight, an analytics company, describes the people at DE Shaw as "less alpha male and more gentle scientists".

This has helped the company survive the type of leadership transition that has felled some rivals. Most hedge funds see their fortunes fade once their founder steps down, but DE Shaw has thrived since Mr Shaw, 67, semi-retired in the early 2000s to pursue research into "computational biochemistry".

Fittingly for a company started above a bookstore selling Marxist treatises, the day-to-day running of the hedge fund is now handled by the central committee of five, rather than a single, imperial impresario typical of the industry. "You'd be hard-pressed to find a management textbook that says a committee is a good way of running a company," says Mr Stone. "But it works for us."

This was among the factors that attracted Mr Schmidt when he scooped up the 20 per cent stake in DE Shaw held by the bankrupt estate of Lehman Brothers in 2015. "It feels like Silicon Valley in Manhattan," he says. "People get consumed by hierarchy, but the evidence shows that flat structures and diverse teams operating collectively have better outcomes."

Sometimes things go awry, however.

In an unusually public spat for a company that shuns publicity, DE Shaw last year fired Daniel Michalow, a senior fund manager, after an internal review found "gross violations of our standards and values".

In an open letter Mr Michalow conceded that he might have deserved his dismissal for being "an abrasive boss" but insisted that his departure was not related to any sexual misconduct. He did, however, paint a very different picture of DE Shaw criticising the hedge fund for "lavish, alcohol-filled parties" and said visits to strip clubs and senior employee relationships with their juniors were common. DE Shaw declined to comment on the accusations, citing ongoing legal proceedings. Mr Michalow is suing DE Shaw for defamation and other claims relating to the announcement of his termination.

The hedge fund's executives are happier to discuss how it manages money, even if the details can be opaque. DE Shaw runs some quant strategies so complex or quick that they are in practice almost beyond human understanding something that many quantitative analysts are reluctant to concede.

The goal is to find patterns on the fuzzy edge of observability in financial markets, so faint that they haven't already been exploited by other quants. They then hoard as many of these signals as possible and systematically mine them until they run dry and repeat the process. These can range from tiny, fleeting arbitrage opportunities between closely-linked stocks that only machines can detect, to using new alternative data sets such as satellite imagery and mobile phone data to get a better understanding of a company's results.

Common sense investing Yet, the hedge fund's executives say they also frequently use common sense to overrule their algorithms, another anathema in an industry where human tinkering can be considered a foible.

Some of these manual interventions are obvious. When Russia annexed the Crimean part of Ukraine in 2014 and started fomenting unrest in its eastern province, DE Shaw quickly dialled back its exposure to the Moscow stock market. And after the Volkswagen emission cheating scandal erupted a year later another of the unexpected shocks that machines are ill-equipped to deal with it pared back bets on the carmaker.

Other strategies require a heavier human hand, such as taking advantage of periodically wide discrepancies between Tencent and Naspers, the South African holding company that owns nearly a third of the Chinese tech giant. Normally they trade in lockstep, but sometimes they diverge because of emerging market stress or South African politics opening up a valuable opportunity. The optimal time to pounce can be modelled, but is best paired with the discretion of a human fund manager.

Yet, DE Shaw still sees plenty of opportunities in the quantitative investing side, especially its "long-only", nonhedge fund investing business, DE Shaw Investment Management. DESIM has quintupled in size since 2011 and now manages $24bn. To grow this further, the company is expanding into something dubbed "risk premia", systematically exploiting theoretically timeless drivers of returns, such as the tendency for smaller or cheaper stocks to outperform the overall market over time.

Historically these have been factors that hedge funds might explicitly or indirectly harness and charge hefty fees for but they have now been packaged up into simpler, cheaper vehicles by the likes of AQR and BlackRock.

DE Shaw is also ramping up its investment in computer science, setting up a semi-independent machine learning research group and investing in a quantum computing start-up.

It is early days, but Cedo Crnkovic, a managing director at DE Shaw, says a fully-functioning quantum computer could potentially prove revolutionary. "Computing power drives everything, and sets a limit to what we can do, so exponentially more computing power would be transformative," he says.

March of technology Nearly every traditional investment company is scrambling to hire data scientists, programmers and technologists, and turn themselves into human-machine hybrids. DE Shaw's apparent success in bridging those two worlds offers an alluring template for rivals.

However, many "pure" quants are sceptical that traditional asset managers have the cultural architecture needed to make a success, arguing that companies cannot just hire a bunch of computer scientists, tell them to work with 50-year-old fund managers with MBAs and hope that magic will ensue. Others fret that by not fully grasping the limitations, they might even do damage to themselves, and or investors.

Mr Stone has a stuffed albino peacock sitting in his office, a reminder that sometimes markets like nature serve up the unexpected. He is wary of criticising the quantamental rush, but also cautions that it could end in tears.

"There are some good ideas at the intersection of systematic and discretionary investing," he says. Nonetheless, "if you don't have experience of separating signal from noise," he adds, "you can easily be led astray by extraneous data."

Kicking on DE Shaw has thrived since its founder semi-retired to pursue 'computational biochemistry' research Human lead The fund's executives often use common sense to overrule algorithms in areas like political risk 'Premia' play Its 'long-only' non-hedge fund investing business has quintupled in size since 2011, managing $24bn 'Crowding' fears Will quants be able to ride out the next crisis? For many, the summer of 1998 was defined by the Monica Lewinsky scandal enveloping the White House, the Spice Girls losing a member and France's stunning victory at the football World Cup. But for the finance industry, it will forever be remembered as the period when some of the finest minds on Wall Street came undone.

The collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund led by Salomon Brothers' former star trader John Meriwether and advised by Nobel laureates Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, hogged the headlines. But the market maelstrom also nearly killed DE Shaw, which had made many of the same trades as LTCM with similarly massive dollops of leverage. "The market environment was harrowing," says Eddie Fishman, who now sits on the DE Shaw executive committee. "But the lessons served us well in subsequent crises."

The 1998 crisis, and the "quant quake" in August 2007, are reminders that even the most sophisticated computerpowered strategies can implode. Given the popularity of quantitative investing and the competition to find and mine new trading signals, there are concerns that markets are primed for a rerun.

History indicates that the two main dangers are leverage and "crowding". The toxicity of aggressive leverage whether debt or through derivatives is well-known, but too many investors crowding into the same security or trade can also cause severe damage, especially when trading conditions deteriorate quickly.

While most hedge funds use far less leverage than in 1998 or 2007, the sheer amount of money raised by quant funds since the crisis is leading to fears of crowding, lowering returns for everyone and ultimately raising the risk of an abrupt reversal, which would in turn lead to a crash as burnt investors dash for the exit.

As volatility stalks world equity markets, wealth managers look to alternatives

 Alternative facts  were first unleashed upon a part-suspecting world by president Donald Trump s political adviser in 2017. Since then, the US candour-mangler-in-chief has provided no shortage of his own   most recently about the economy and interest rates.

In the latter part of 2018, he said:  I think the [US Federal Reserve] right now is a much bigger problem than China 	. 	. 	. 	I don t like what they re doing in terms of interest rates ;  They re raising interest rates too fast ;  The 	. 	. 	. 	problem our economy has is the Fed    all in apparent contradiction of Fed chair Jay Powell, who deemed the economy strong enough for rate rises.

Then, in February, Mr Trump declared:  We are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world 	. 	. 	. 	an economic miracle is taking place    in apparent contradiction of Mr Powell s renewed caution over coming risks.

All this has left equity investors struggling to discern truth from fiction   helping to send volatility in the S&P 500 index to its third-highest level in seven years. The recent inversion of the US yield curve  seen by many as a signal that a recession is on the way   has rattled investors.

Wealth managers, however, think they have the perfect counter to alternative facts: alternative assets.

Hedge funds, commodities and asset-backed lending can all protect portfolios from what Iain Tait, partner at London & Capital, deems not so much the Trump contradiction as  the great Powell U-turn .

Mr Tait has spent recent months working out what the shift in Fed tone means for risk assets and risk-averse clients. As he puts it, the markets  convulsed  at the thought of the Fed raising rates and reversing the quantitative easing stimulus of past years. He thinks investors got their facts right.

 The greatest threat to wealth and families is the transition from the world of QE to the world of QT, or quantitative tightening,  he says.  You don t pivot to a world of tightening without extreme bouts of volatility. 

For more conservative wealth managers such as L&C, this creates a headache. They had thought the QE-fuelled equity bull run would burn out in the middle of this year, but the Trump/Fed turnabouts suggest it will now last further into 2019. Even so, Mr Tait concludes it is still an  exhausted-looking cycle for traditional stocks and bonds    and time to look to alternatives.

In fact, his head of alternatives, Kristian Richmond, has been looking to hedge funds.  Going back to traditional long-short equity funds is beneficial at this point in the cycle,  he suggests. But he needs managers with a verifiable record of making money at the end of a bull run. L&C uses Sandler US Equity, which established a record of returns through the early-2000s bear market.

Other alternatives to long-only equity holdings are global macro hedge funds, says Mr Richmond. Here, he favours Informed Portfolio Management s Systematic Global Macro strategy, which trades assets based on economic fundamentals. He and Mr Tait stress that this is one of the more liquid hedge funds   remembering that an inability to exit holdings in the 2008 crisis meant many  alternative  assets proved no real alternative to equities.

Not all are true believers, though. Ben Gutteridge, head of fund research at Brewin Dolphin, shares L&C s faith in long-short funds   notably Janus Henderson s and BlackRock s   but reckons it is a big challenge for global macro hedge fund managers to put big economic and asset class calls at the heart of an investment strategy in the current environment.

As a result, Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer at Lloyds Bank Private Banking, puts his trust in technology to outperform delusional humans:  The systematic models used by machine learning trading strategies are agnostic as to the direction of their positions and can help reduce the risk of unconscious bias. 

Bias can be removed altogether by holding assets highly uncorrelated to the stock market or economy, argues Mr Tait. Here, he recommends renewable energy investments, where returns are driven more by government subsidies and technological advances, such as battery storage systems. Examples used by L&C include the Foresight Solar fund and Gresham House s new Energy Storage fund.

Specialist debt holdings may also provide an alternative to equities, provided they are quite alternative, adds Mr Richmond. Asset-backed loan funds, such as the Biopharma Credit fund that lends to the pharma industry, with drug royalties or patents as collateral, can prove defensive holdings, he thinks. So, too, aircraft leasing funds. Yogesh Dewan, chief executive of Hassium Asset Management, sees opportunity in private credit vehicles, although he acknowledges these still bring equity-like risk in a recessionary business cycle.

For some, though, there is no alternative to classic alternatives, amid mixed monetary signals.  The other way to diversify an equities-heavy portfolio is an exposure to commodities, and more specifically to gold,  says Stphane Monier, chief investment officer at Swiss bank Lombard Odier.

 The precious metal tends to perform well in higher volatility and weakening US dollar environments, especially if market participants start having doubts about the effectiveness of monetary policies,  he adds.

Drew McNeil, director of Wren Investment Office, remains sceptical about other holdings.  We are recommending our clients hold gold, cash and long-dated government bonds to hedge against equity volatility. We have looked at other non-correlated assets but are wary of taking too much credit or liquidity risk in this environment. 

Recommended allocations to alternatives range from 5 per cent at Hassium to 15-17 per cent at L&C, for wealthy families familiar with the risks and liquidity profile.

But, as with all things alternative, from political populists to uncorrelated asset classes, the cycle eventually turns. All the way back to active equity funds, Mr Monier believes:  As volatility rises above the all-time lows experienced in 2017, active management could once again be in a position to extract alpha. 

Extracting truth from the White House s resident  Alpha  may take a little longer, though.

U.S. News: FHA Clamps Down on High-Risk Loans

By Ben Eisen

The federal agency that insures mortgages for first-time home buyers is tightening its standards, concerned it is allowing too many risky loans to be extended.

The Federal Housing Administration told lenders this month it would begin flagging more loans as high-risk. Those mortgages, many of which are extended to borrowers with low credit scores and high loan payments relative to their incomes, will now go through a more rigorous manual underwriting process, the FHA said.

The FHA tries to boost homeownership by insuring loans to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit, lessening the risk for lenders. The agency is worried that lenders are making loans to borrowers who can't repay, leading to a spike in defaults that strains the agency's reserves.

The FHA's decision to tighten underwriting standards could mean fewer first-time home buyers are able to get mortgages. Roughly 40,000 to 50,000 loans a year likely would be affected, or about 4% to 5% of the FHA-insured mortgages originated annually in recent years, according to Keith Becker, the agency's chief risk officer.

"We have continued to endorse loans with more and more credit risk," Mr. Becker said. "We felt that it was appropriate to take some steps to mitigate the risks we're seeing."

The move is an about-face from a 2016 decision to loosen underwriting standards. At the time, the FHA removed an earlier rule that required manual underwriting for mortgages with credit scores below 620 and a ratio of debt to income above 43%.

"Since that happened, we have observed a steady increase in the endorsement of higher-risk loans," Mr. Becker said. The FHA has also been warning of rising risks in the portfolio that it insures in its annual reports submitted to Congress.

The government agency's $1.3 trillion insurance portfolio is now filled with a large share of loans made by nonbank mortgage lenders. The biggest FHA lenders last year were Quicken Loans Inc., loanDepot Inc., and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corp., according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group.

Many flagged loans likely won't pass muster under FHA rules, Mr. Becker said. Lenders ultimately decide whether the flagged risks are offset by other borrower attributes, which would allow them to receive an FHA-insured loan under the agency's guidelines.

Some lenders say they don't expect the FHA's risk-management steps to affect their businesses. "Our analytics and underwriting teams have determined that this new criteria will have a de minimis effect," said Bob Walters, the president of Quicken Loans.

In the previous fiscal year, almost a quarter of FHA-insured mortgages were made to borrowers with a debt-to-income ratio above 50%, having risen sharply in recent years. The average credit score for borrowers fell to 670, the lowest level in a decade. In the FHA's letter to lenders, it noted a rising concentration of loans with high debt-to-income ratios and low credit scores.

Banks use AI to catch rogue traders before the act

Technology presents an opportunity to spot errant bankers before misconduct takes place

Imagine if you could stop rogue trading when it was just the spark of an idea   a stray thought sparked by a trader s expensive divorce, a big loss suffered at a poker game, or growing disillusionment with the daily grind.

Imagine if, instead of being bogged down in 10,000 emails a day with words like  fraud , compliance teams could instead detect changes in tone and other subtle tics that show a trader s behaviour is changing.

In a world where a Japanese company has launched artificial intelligence cameras that are designed to predict shoplifting before it happens, it is not so hard to believe that the world s biggest banks are closing in on advances that will allow them to do the above and more.

Banks have already made major leaps in trader surveillance in the past few years, embracing communication monitoring tools that look for obvious flash phrases and keywords as well as less obvious ones like  let s take this conversation offline .

They have set stricter limits on traders  activities, making it harder for anyone to make the kind of enormous bets that led to one-off losses of as much as $6bn (in JPMorgan s  London Whale  scandal). Losses and fines in the past decade across the top 13 global banks add up to more than $10bn, according to analytics provider Corlytics.

Now, banks  efforts are entering a new era, powered by AI and machine learning.  We have opened up the doors of what s possible,  says Marc Andrews, vice-president of IBM s Watson Financial Services division, as he outlines its tools that do everything from monitoring conversations for tone to using changes to credit scores in order to predict which traders are likely to go rogue.

About a dozen banks are already deploying Watson, IBM s AI software, which they use to monitor everyday communications.  We re looking at their emails and identifying their communication patterns, the tone of their emails in addition to what they re saying,  says Mr Andrews.

 One of the benefits of 	. 	. 	. 	applying machine learning is that you re not implementing specific rules that someone can just work their way around,  he adds.  As people do start changing their behaviour 	. 	. 	. 	the models will learn over time and will be able to adapt much more quickly. 

One important outcome is cutting down the number of  false positives  banks have to deal with under traditional systems which flag hundreds of thousands of potentially suspect messages a month, leaving banks to find a needle in a haystack.

The IBM software differentiates between higher and lower-risk alerts, to allow banks to cut through the mass that they receive. The idea, Mr Andrews says, is to reduce the effort and cost they are spending on the low-risk incidents.

Erkin Adylov, whose company Behavox also provides surveillance tools to banks, describes one case where a bank was getting 450,000 alerts per month for  silly things  like a trader asking his wife for a favour.

 When we came in we reduced that by 95 per cent,  he adds.

Mr Andrews says banks are already pulling other metrics into their surveillance systems, including human resources reviews and credit scoring reports to identify traders with either the motive, or predisposition, for rogue activity.

The technology company has separately developed tools that would allow other information like public filings to be integrated into their trader surveillance system. A court conviction, or sizeable divorce settlement could be used as a red flag.  We ve had a lot of enquiries about that, but none have started putting it into production,  says Mr Andrews of the newest technology.

 Lots of these firms are very much in that experimental stage 	. 	. 	. 	trying to figure out which of these techniques are worth investing in. 

Typical costs of less than $10m for rogue trading detection systems are small compared to the multibillion-dollar losses banks have taken on rogue trading, but Mr Andrews says banks are still  price-sensitive  on what they will adopt.

He believes this is partly because there have been no big rogue trading cases in recent years and regulators are currently more focused on requirements such as  know your client  and anti-money laundering practices.

Banks do not ask for solutions that eliminate rogue trading altogether, he says, but do ask questions like:  can you cut out 20 per cent of our alerts and guarantee there won t be any events in that bottom 20 per cent?  His answer is always no.

The big question is whether these sophisticated tools, alongside other factors including changes in bank culture, stricter trading limits and regulatory pressure, will lead to an era where rogue trading is an anachronism.

Lex Sokolin, a fintech analyst at research provider Autonomous, says the combination of machine learning tools and so-called  regtech , which aligns what machines are able to do with regulators  requirements, makes it likely that large banks will see suspicious internal activity before it hits the market.  [But] no system is foolproof,  he adds.

The head of one large US investment bank says that while rogue trading is seen as less of a live problem than it was a decade ago, it has not gone away and never will   a sentiment echoed privately by other banks. Many decline to speak publicly about it, though, for fear of tempting fate.

 Fundamentally it [rogue trading] is always a concern,  says Eoin Cumiskey, of UK-based financial services advisory firm FSCom.

 The application of technology allows for greater controls to be in place but 	. 	. 	. 	no one we ve come across has really said:  It s fine, we have a little black box in the corner, that stamps it out, it s yesterday s issue. 

The Digital Art Market Heats Up; Prices are rising, but buyers may not always know the risks given technology's fast pace

It's a digital age, and art is no exception

The market for digital artworks which include anything that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process is flourishing, thanks in large part to younger collectors, according to industry experts.

Although prices have been rising, one attraction of digital art is that it is still generally cheaper than traditional paintings, sculpture and other collectibles found in galleries and at auctions both at the lower end of the market and at the higher end, where prices for digital art mostly top out below $1 million.

"Early digital works cost a few thousand dollars, like any new medium," says Magda Sawon, co-founder of the Postmasters Gallery in New York, which has half of its inventory in digital work. "The artists I work with go up to $30,000 and in a few instances, a few hundred thousand."

The potential for price appreciation is another strong attraction. Marc Glimcher, chief executive of Pace Gallery in New York, says prices for top works have doubled or tripled in the past five years. Christie's made a splash in the market in October with the auction sale of a "https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx", generated by artificial intelligence, of a fictitious person for $432,500.

Blockchain technology also is helping to drive the market, as it provides a means to ensure a work's scarcity and its provenance, or history of ownership, says Mac MacLellan, executive vice president at Northern Trust Wealth Management. "That's driving even some traditionalists into digital collecting too," he says.

Blockchain technology is commonly used to create ledgers where digital-art transactions are recorded and art is stored, Mr. MacLellan says. Once an image is embedded in the blockchain ledger it can no longer be modified, he says. The ledger allows the buyer to verify the number of images in existence and trace the ownership of a piece all the way back to its creator. Only the current owner can unlock the blockchain ledger entry to view the image or to permit its sale to someone else, Mr. MacLellan says.

Possible glitches

Even with the security of blockchain ledgers, though, buyers of digital art should be aware of potential problems and be prepared to ask a number of questions, experts say.

Pace Gallery's Mr. Glimcher urges caution in collecting the works of young artists just getting started in digital art production. "A lot of people are making digital art that's unstable," he says. "You take it home, and it breaks," leaving you unable to view it. For instance, a random software glitch could suddenly crop up, causing the monitor that's supposed to display a computer-rendered pig to show nothing but a blank screen.

"People need to be prepared for the fact that digital artists are using cutting-edge technologies and novel algorithms," Mr. Glimcher says. "It's great to support those artists, and part of supporting them is not getting frustrated when you bring a work home and may have to call the artist and say it's not working, because there's a possibility that may happen. These people are artists, not tech companies with quality controls."

Problems can also crop up in presenting the art, even if there's nothing wrong with the piece itself. Mr. MacLellan recommends that people considering a purchase ask what equipment they need to present the artwork some pieces can simply be viewed on a computer, but others might require a projector or a virtual-reality viewer, for instance and be certain that they understand how to display the piece.

Can it last?

Prospective buyers should also ask how, or if, the artwork can be protected from technological obsolescence, Mr. MacLellan says. Years from now, replacements or servicing may not be readily available for equipment, such as projectors, that break down. And software needed to view images may go out of date. "An artwork might be cutting-edge technology at a moment, but technology has a tendency to go obsolete," says Tim Schneider, author of "The Great Reframing: How Technology Will and Won't Change the Gallery System Forever."

Another important thing to ask about, Mr. MacLellan says, is an artwork's rarity is it a one-of-a-kind piece, a limited edition, or are there many copies of it on the market or already sold? And if it's limited or unique, how is it protected from replication or piracy? As in the market for traditional art, rarity generally makes a digital work more valuable.

Mr. MacLellan also suggests that people ask how established the market is for the kind of artwork they're considering buying. The uniqueness of an artwork contributes to its value. But it's always preferable to know that demand for pieces in the same genre has been demonstrated in the market, so that you can have some confidence that you'll be able to sell the piece when you want to do so.

 Big data  key for commodity traders  future

Report forecasts margins to fall further unless industry invests in new technology

The world s biggest commodity traders need to invest heavily in big data and technology if they are to arrest the relentless erosion of profit margins and recapture their information edge over rivals.

Oliver Wyman, one of the few consultancies to track the performance of the largely private industry, forecast in a report that profit margins could fall by another 15 per cent to less than $30bn by 2025, continuing a trend that has already weighed on traders such as Trafigura and Vitol.

Gross trading margins   the amount made on trades before deducting costs such as tax, salaries and bonuses   have already dropped by 20 per cent to $35bn since their recent peak in 2015 amid fierce competition and more widely available access to market intelligence.

Roland Rechtsteiner, a partner at Oliver Wyman and co-author of the report, said that after growing trading volumes aggressively between 2014 and 2017 to offset margin erosion, the industry now needed to prioritise boosting its analytical capabilities.

 The industry is maturing after a period of rapid growth, but it is also facing big changes ahead,  said Mr Rechtsteiner.  All commodity trading firms will have to review their business models. 

Oliver Wyman, which is advised by Trafigura co-founder Graham Sharp, said the trading houses needed to invest in sophisticated analytical systems and hire data scientists to allow them to draw valuable insights from the reams of data generated by their global network of ports, warehouses and storage terminals.

That will require companies to revamp their operating models and experiment with large-scale pilot programmes to discover new trading strategies.

 Historically commodity trading was all about market intelligence but over the past decade data has been socialised. It s omnipresent and available for everyone,  said Mr Rechtsteiner.

 Predictive analytics provides commodity traders with the opportunity to regain their information edge. But they will have to invest quite significantly. You need to have deep pockets. 

The publication of the Oliver Wyman report comes as the world s biggest commodity traders gather in Lausanne, Switzerland. for the eighth FT Commodities Global Summit.

The conclusions of the report are likely to be hotly debated by senior industry executives, many of whom are yet to be convinced that employing armies of data scientists will bolster profits. They see cost-cutting, new markets and providing structured finance deals for producers, as a better way to counter relentless margin pressure.

Swiss-based trader Mercuria has increased its presence in gas and power markets, while Vitol has backed the construction of the UK s largest battery park and has also announced plans to invest in large-scale wind generation in Europe, part of plans to tackle what many executives see as an even graver challenge   the move towards cleaner fuels and a possible peak in oil demand. Vitol said this week it saw oil demand topping out within 15 years. Consolidation could also help alleviate some of the pressure as the industry matures.

Over the past 30 years commodity trading has been one of the most profitable industries in the world.

Companies such as Glencore, Vitol, Trafigura, Mercuria and Gunvor have surfed a wave of globalisation and emerging market industrialisation to build businesses that have revenues larger than many banks or tech companies, delivering substantial riches to their top executives.

Last year Vitol, the world s largest independent oil trader, turned over more than $231bn in revenues and traded 7.4m barrels of oil a day, or almost 8 per cent of global oil consumption. Trafigura s revenues were $180bn.

But after a period of turbocharged growth, not least in the past five years, the industry is now rapidly approaching a crossroads. While the top companies are still generating in excess of $1bn a year and paying huge dividends to their staff, the landscape for the industry is changing.

The old-fashioned macho traits of their industry, long dominated by buccaneering male traders who view long hours and punishing workloads as a badge of honour, have not been immune to wider society s focus on diversity and gender balance.

At the same time, the industry is coming under scrutiny from governments and regulators for the manner in which they operate in challenging jurisdictions in Africa and Latin America, with a number of corruption and bribery investigations launched in the past year.

Glencore, Trafigura and Vitol are under investigation in Brazil on suspicion of paying bribes to employees of state-controlled oil company Petrobras in exchange for contracts.

In a statement this week Russell Hardy, Vitol chief executive, said:  We are cognisant of the responsibilities which our business entails .

CUPERTINO, Calif. Apple Inc. unveiled new products for entertainment, financial services, news and videogames as the technology giant vies with competitors that are also moving to expand their disruptive influence outside their core businesses in search of new growth.

The announcements Monday mark a strategic shift for Apple as it seeks new momentum amid "https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-the-iphone-sputtering-apple-bets-its-future-on-tv-and-news-11553437018". The centerpiece of the star-studded event at Apple's headquarters, capped by an appearance by Oprah Winfrey, was a new video-subscription service to carry original programming.

In a first for the company, it plans to make its TV app, which will carry that content, available on competitors' televisions and other devices as well as its own reflecting Apple's growing ambition to go beyond selling its own gadgets.

Apple also "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-apple-card-is-here-with-cash-back-and-privacy-promises-11553541513", a mainly digital credit card launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that aims to challenge incumbents by offering low interest rates and eliminating both late fees and annual fees.

It unveiled Apple News+, a $9.99 monthly service that provides access to 300-plus magazines as well as newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal through an agreement with parent Dow Jones & Co. And it showed off Apple Arcade, a gaming subscription service offering access to 100-plus exclusive games for an unspecified monthly fee.

Chief Executive Tim Cook portrayed the services as an extension of Apple's existing mix of products, saying the integration of hardware, software and services is something Apple does better than anyone else. "We're excited to extend our services even further, making them even more entertaining, more useful and more informative," he said.

New Services

A look at the services announced by Apple on Monday.

APPLE NEWS+ A news-subscription service that offers access to more than 300 magazines, newspapers (including The Wall Street Journal) and digital publications. Costs $9.99 a month.

* Pitch: Easy access to journalism, much of which is behind different paywalls

* Risk: Are consumers willing to pay $9.99 a month to read magazines and newspapers?

APPLE CARD A new credit card that includes Goldman Sachs and Mastercard as partners

* Pitch: There are no fees with Apple Card

* Risk: Card's rewards are seen as less generous than rivals

APPLE ARCADE A game-subscription service with more than 100 exclusive games. No pricing information released.

* Pitch: Users can try any game and not deal with ads or additional purchases.

* Risk: Do serious gamers enjoy playing on touch screens?

APPLE TV+ A video-subscription service featuring original content. Pricing details to come this fall.

* Pitch: Has big-name artists behind it, such as Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon

* Risk: Are consumers willing to pay for another streaming service? And at what cost?

The initiatives are part of a broader movement by tech titans to spread into new industries, betting their combination of loyal users and troves of data can help unlock revenue opportunities. The efforts are fueling competition in new arenas between some of the world's biggest companies, as Amazon.com Inc. pushes beyond e-commerce into entertainment and finance and Alphabet Inc. goes past advertising into subscription gaming.

The tech companies are applying their digital expertise to established industries just as Apple did years ago with the music business, said Bob O'Donnell, president at Technalysis Research. "A lot of the markets they're currently in are peaking, so to maintain growth and satisfy investors they have to extend their reach," he said.

Apple's success in its new bets isn't guaranteed, and the company didn't disclose important details Monday that could shed more light on its odds, including pricing for the video-content and gaming services. Apple faces stiff competition in areas where it is expanding, including from existing entertainment and credit-card players and from companies providing free news and videogames.

Apple shares closed down 1.2% on Monday. They have gained ground this year despite a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-posts-drop-in-quarterly-revenue-and-profit-11548797780" at the end of last year but remain well below their record high from last October.

The new video-content plans thrust Apple into rapidly intensifying competition among technology companies and traditional cable operators for pay-TV users.

Growing disillusionment with cable companies and the rise of streaming-subscription services like Netflix Inc. is leading millions of Americans to change their pay-TV habits, allowing companies like Amazon, Sony Corp. and Hulu to elbow into a $100 billion industry long dominated by Comcast Corp., AT&T Inc.'s DirecTV and others.

Apple's revamped TV app unveiled Monday which will house the new video-content service is designed to grab a share of that splintering TV market. A May software update will turn the app into a central portal where customers can use a single password to subscribe to content from AT&T's HBO, CBS Corp.'s Showtime and others. That will put it most directly in competition with Amazon, which is spending billions of dollars a year on content to compete with Netflix while also acting as a distributor for channels like HBO.

Apple's original-content service, called TV+, will be available in its TV app starting in the fall. Though the company only showed brief footage from its original series, it brought out several stars and directors to discuss their work with Apple, including Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.

Ms. Winfrey cited the broad audience of people with Apple devices as one reason she is working with the company. "The Apple platform allows me to do what I do in a whole new way, to take everything I've learned about connecting with people to the next level because they're in a billion pockets, y'all, a billion pockets," she said.

Still, Apple acknowledged that to truly compete in services, it needs to do something it hasn't done before and bring its TV app to non-Apple hardware, including smart TV devices from Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Inc., Vizio Inc., Roku Inc., Sony and Amazon.

The broader distribution is designed to help in an already crowded content marketplace. There were 496 scripted original series in 2018, according to research from Walt Disney Co.'s FX Network. Streaming services including Netflix and Amazon are driving that surge in programming. Since 2014, the number of streaming shows has grown nearly 40%, according to FX.

The competition has driven the cost of content sky high as programmers are spending heavily to lock down major producers. Apple committed $1 billion to create original shows, an amount that pales in comparison to what Netflix, HBO and others spend annually.

While streaming services are growing as more consumers cut the cords to their traditional pay-TV services, it isn't clear whether the marketplace can sustain the volume of content being produced.

"There's potential in a future Apple mega-bundle, but today, their announcement was mostly about creating an offering and experience largely identical to the one Amazon has had for years," said Matthew Ball, an independent consultant and former head of strategy at Amazon Studios.

The launch of Apple Card, which customers will sign up for on their iPhones, marks a major expansion of the tech giant's foray into financial services, begun in 2014 with Apple Pay. The card uses machine-learning on Apple's devices to organize people's spending behavior into summaries. Customers can receive a physical, titanium card to use in locations where Apple Pay isn't yet accepted.

The news app, called Apple News+, is a premium version of the existing, free Apple News app. Available immediately in the U.S., it provides access to articles from magazines including Vogue, GQ and Sports Illustrated, as well as newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and the Journal. Publishers will split revenue from the app 50/50 with Apple, according to people familiar with the agreements.

"We believe in the power of journalism and the impact it can have on our lives," Mr. Cook said. "We think Apple News+ is going to be great for customers and great for publishers."

Apple emphasized the privacy of its new services, saying it won't track articles people read, purchases they make or games they play. The company recently released a TV advertisement touting its position on privacy as it looks to differentiate its offerings from competitors like Google and Facebook Inc.

Lyft Leading Wave of Startups That Will Make Debuts With Giant Losses; Lyft last year posted a loss of $911 million, more than any U.S. startup has ever lost in the 12 months leading to its IPO

Ride-hailing company Lyft Inc. is leading a"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-discloses-ipo-filing-for-first-time-11551458522" to Wall Street that display an unusual quality with parallels to companies going public in the dot-com era: lots of red ink.

With its initial public offering expected this week, Lyft will serve as one of the biggest tests ever of investors' appetite for money-losing companies.

Lyft posted last year a loss of $911 million, more than any other U.S. startup lost in the 12 months preceding its IPO, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Lyft's loss, in the sixth year since the company's founding, could soon be eclipsed by 10-year-old Uber Technologies Inc., which has been losing more than $800 million a quarter. Uber plans to go public later this year.

Many other highly funded startups with a propensity for heavy spending similar to Lyft and Uber are considering listing as they age.

WeWork Cos. reported a 2018 net loss of $1.9 billion on $1.8 billion of revenue. The office-space company has indicated it intends to go public but hasn't said when. Also, many food-delivery companies that have raised billions collectively are enduring heavy losses as they fight each other for market share, investors said.

Some companies moving toward an IPO are closer to a profit. Image-search company Pinterest Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pinterest-makes-ipo-filing-public-11553290835" it halved its annual loss to $63 million in 2018. Data-analytics company Palantir Technologies Inc. has said it is expecting profitability in the next year or two.

"Many of their business models have not been tested fully," Ilya Strebulaev, a Stanford University business professor who studies late-stage startups, said of the large private companies. "I would not be surprised if many of these companies would not be as successful as investors expect them to be."

Heavy losses and big spending on marketing by startups have been abetted by a bountiful supply of private capital, as long as the recipients show promising revenue growth. However, big risks can accompany big losses, analysts and investors said. Investors can easily misjudge the depth of demand for a popular new product, for instance. Also, none of the startups formed over the past decade have endured a recession.

Of the five companies with the largest losses before an IPO, four of them discount marketplace Groupon Inc., biotech Moderna Inc., social-media company Snap Inc. and communications company Vonage Holdings Corp. have performed poorly on the public markets. A fifth, Viasystems Group Inc., went private years ago at a fraction of its IPO value.

For investors drawn to the coming IPOs, the main appeal is rapid growth which Lyft has made a centerpiece of its push to Wall Street. Its revenue doubled last year to $2.2 billion in what would be the third-largest annual revenue for a U.S. startup pre-IPO, behind Facebook Inc. and Google, according to S&P. Both Facebook and Google were profitable before their market debuts.

Lyft hasn't publicly outlined when it hopes to turn a profit, but company executives and bankers point out that big costs like marketing are falling as a percentage of revenue. It is also pushing to reduce insurance expenses.

Bankers have found very strong demand thus far from investors at Lyft's target valuation of between $21 billion and $23 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Lyft was last valued at $15.1 billion by private investors in a funding round.

The giant losses at both Lyft and Uber are largely due to their battle for market share. The companies initially operated with thrift in mind; they were online marketplaces connecting drivers and riders and that owned no vehicles. But competition has meant spending heavily to recruit drivers and subsidize rides for consumers for nearly a decade.

Lyft spent $1.3 billion on marketing and incentives for drivers and riders in 2018, which averages out to more than $2 a ride. Many Lyft and Uber investors say they expect the incentive war will end once these companies go public because they won't be constantly raising capital. Still, early private investors say they had hoped heavy rider subsidization would have ended years ago.

Lyft and Uber each will have raised more venture capital than any U.S. startup that has ever gone public, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Private investors see the new services and products spreading rapidly around the globe given the ubiquity of the smartphone, and given the competitive environment, they generally have been more tolerant of losses as long as there is revenue growth.

"We find ourselves in a liquidity surplus," said Doug Leone, a partner at Sequoia Capital, an early investor in Google, Apple Inc. and Instagram. "Companies have to run very fast given local and global competition."

Similar dynamics were widespread during the dot-com boom, although that era's private investors didn't have to wait as long for startups to become profitable.

Amazon.com Inc. raised only about $8 million in venture capital before going public in 1997, when it posted a $31 million loss. Its first quarterly profit came in 2001, seven years after its founding. Google raised $25 million and had a profit of $106 million in the year before its 2004 IPO.

Other companies like e-commerce flops eToys and Pets.com went public on very little or no revenue a distinct difference from today.

One of the dot-com bubble's biggest busts, online grocer Webvan Inc., was small by today's standards. Between 1997 and 1999, Webvan notched one of the largest funding hauls of the era $700 million in venture capital and IPO funds, or over $1 billion adjusted for inflation only to shut down in 2001 when financing ran dry. Lyft, by contrast, has raised nearly $5 billion and is seeking another $2 billion in its IPO.

Kevin Czinger, Webvan's former chief financial officer, said despite the frothy markets, investors wanted profits soon and wouldn't tolerate years of large losses. "It would have been totally impossible to have these types of business plans," said Mr. Czinger, who is now CEO of vehicle manufacturing startup Divergent 3D.

Top-ranked FT 1000 fintech Blue Motor Finance up for sale

Private equity owner Cabot Square in talks about potential buyers

The county of Kent, commonly called the garden of England, is not the most obvious spot to find a fast growing finance company. Bob Jones, who has worked in the sector for almost 50 years and now leads Blue Motor Finance, does not look like a stereotypical fintech executive.

But when Mr Jones is asked how his enterprise   which launched five years ago within an existing licensed business   has grown so quickly, his explanation could be taken right out of the fintech textbook.  The banks provide a fantastic service in the marketplace, we just do it better because they re not as agile as we are,  he explains in Blue Motor s headquarters outside Sevenoaks.

Chris Jones, Bob s son and Blue s chief operating officer, says that the  100bn-plus  motor finance market has been  dominated by the banks for a long time . He adds:  We ve basically used tech to make the process better, faster and smarter, removing friction from the process 	. 	. 	. 	you can walk into a dealership and at the fastest level you can walk out with a car 20 minutes later. 

Behind Blue s dealer-facing app lies sophisticated analytics to make speedy and risk-graded loans. This tech helped drive it to the top of the annual FT 1000 list of Europe s fastest growing companies, up from 21st last year. Revenues hit 52.3m in 2017, from just 102,000 in 2014.

Tarun Sharma, a partner at Blue s private equity owner Cabot Square   management also holds a small stake   says the company has performed  significantly better than our expectations  since it invested 37.5m in the venture in 2014. Now, Cabot and Blue are in discussions with investment bankers about a potential sale which could see the business taken over by a larger private equity group or established lender.

A buyer might question the health prospects of such a fast-growing loan book. Blue s expansion has coincided with a growth period for consumer lending businesses, with low interest rates helping push default levels to historic lows. But the economic outlook has grown more uncertain, with banks expecting a rise in defaults.

Mr Sharma insists Cabot is not looking to cash in before the going gets rough.  [The sale is] driven by Blue s maturity and available options   they have grown significantly, but they re just scratching the surface in terms of related or adjacent areas they could be involved in, and for the next leg of growth they need significantly more capital,  he says.

Blue has lent around 1bn since 2014 and expects to increase that figure by 50 per cent this year alone.

Last year, it completed its first securitisation of its motor finance contracts, which analysts at Moody s cautioned was higher risk than a typical UK auto deal. However, Blue said investor demand was high, which it saw as a  big vote of confidence .

Car purchases have been a key factor in household debt levels reaching new highs, leading some to question their sustainability. Bob Jones argues the car financing market should be resilient in a downturn, as customers  reliance on their cars makes them particularly reluctant to risk losing the vehicle by defaulting.

Much of the recent growth in the market has been driven by the personal contract purchase, a form of leasing where drivers rarely take actual ownership of the vehicle but instead finance its depreciation for several years before trading it in. This exposes lenders to risks if cars do not hold their value as well as predicted.

Finance is used for 91 per cent of new car purchases, the bulk of which is now via PCP. Blue has focused instead on traditional loans for used cars and has avoided PCP.  [It s] the frothy bit of the market. We ve been under pressure to do it but we ve always held the line and said we just don t think it s a clever idea,  Chris Jones adds.

Blue is looking to expand into lending directly to dealerships to fund their stock purchases. Mr Sharma suggests that a future owner could also use Blue s technology to grow in areas beyond motor finance.

Despite its revenue and profit growth   with pre-tax profits of 7m in 2017   Blue has not yet attracted the eye-watering valuations of some fintechs. Bob Jones jokes that he is  in jealous awe  of start-ups such as peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle, which has a market value of 1.4bn despite not turning a profit. Any sale is not expected to value Blue above the $1bn mark to qualify as a  unicorn .

 What we ve achieved in terms of the growth so far is itself spectacular   we just don t see why that would diminish,  says Bob Jones. Having lent its first billion pounds, he thinks Blue could get to that level in annual lending  almost automatically .

Banks use AI to tackle bad behaviour at source

Conduct

Technology presents an opportunity to catch errant bankers before misconduct takes place, writes Laura Noonan

Banks use AI to tackle misbehaviour at source

Imagine if you could stop rogue trading when it was just the spark of an idea   a stray thought sparked by a trader's expensive divorce, a big loss suffered at a poker game, or growing disillusionment with the daily grind.

Imagine if, instead of being bogged down in 10,000 emails a day with words like "fraud", compliance teams could instead detect changes in tone and other subtle tics that show a trader's behaviour is changing.

In a world where a Japanese company has launched artificial intelligence cameras that are designed to predict shoplifting before it happens, it is not so hard to believe that the world's biggest banks are closing in on advances that will allow them to do the above and more.

Banks have already made major leaps in trader surveillance in the past few years, embracing communication monitoring tools that look for obvious flash phrases and keywords as well as less obvious ones like "let's take this conversation offline".

They have set stricter limits on traders' activities, making it harder for anyone to make the kind of enormous bets that led to one-off losses of as much as $6bn (in JPMorgan's "London Whale" scandal). Losses and fines in the past decade across the top 13 global banks add up to more than $10bn, according to analytics provider Corlytics.

Now, banks' efforts are entering a new era, powered by AI and machine learning. "We have opened up the doors of what's possible," says Marc Andrews, vice-president of IBM's Watson Financial Services division, as he outlines its tools that do everything from monitoring conversations for tone to using changes to credit scores in order to predict which traders are likely to go rogue. About a dozen banks are already deploying Watson, IBM's AI software, which they use to monitor everyday communications. "We're looking at their emails and identifying their communication patterns, the tone of their emails in addition to what they're saying," says Mr Andrews. "One of the benefits of |(85) applying machine learning is that you're not implementing specific rules that someone can just work their way around," he adds. "As people do start changing their behaviour |(85) the models will learn over time and will be able to adapt much more quickly."

One important outcome is cutting down the number of "false positives" banks have to deal with under traditional systems which flag hundreds of thousands of potentially suspect messages a month, leaving banks to find a needle in a haystack.

The IBM software differentiates between higher and lower-risk alerts, to allow banks to cut through the mass that they receive. The idea, Mr Andrews says, is to reduce the effort and cost they are spending on the low-risk incidents.

Erkin Adylov, whose company Behavox also provides surveillance tools to banks, describes one case where a bank was getting 450,000 alerts per month for "silly things" like a trader asking his wife for a favour.

"When we came in we reduced that by 95 per cent," he adds.

Mr Andrews says banks are already pulling other metrics into their surveillance systems, including human resources reviews and credit scoring reports to identify traders with either the motive, or predisposition, for rogue activity.

The technology company has separately developed tools that would allow other information like public filings to be integrated into their trader surveillance system. A court conviction, or sizeable divorce settlement could be used as a red flag. "We've had a lot of enquiries about that, but none have started putting it into production," says Mr Andrews of the newest technology.

"Lots of these firms are very much in that experimental stage |(85) trying to figure out which of these techniques are worth investing in."

Typical costs of less than $10m for rogue trading detection systems are small compared to the multibillion-dollar losses banks have taken on rogue trading, but Mr Andrews says banks are still "price-sensitive" on what they will adopt.

He believes this is partly because there have been no big rogue trading cases in recent years and regulators are currently more focused on requirements such as "know your client" and anti-money laundering practices.

Banks do not ask for solutions that eliminate rogue trading altogether, he says, but do ask questions like: "can you cut out 20 per cent of our alerts and guarantee there won't be any events in that bottom 20 per cent?" His answer is always no.

The big question is whether these sophisticated tools, alongside other factors including changes in bank culture, stricter trading limits and regulatory pressure, will lead to an era where rogue trading is an anachronism.

Lex Sokolin, a fintech analyst at research provider Autonomous, says the combination of machine learning tools and so-called "regtech", which aligns what machines are able to do with regulators' requirements, makes it likely that large banks will see suspicious internal activity before it hits the market. "[But] no system is foolproof," he adds.

The head of one large US investment bank says that while rogue trading is seen as less of a live problem than it was a decade ago, it has not gone away and never will   a sentiment echoed privately by other banks. Many decline to speak publicly about it, though, for fear of tempting fate.

"Fundamentally it [rogue trading] is always a concern," says Eoin Cumiskey, of UK-based financial services advisory firm FSCom.

"The application of technology allows for greater controls to be in place but |(85) no one we've come across has really said: 'It's fine, we have a little black box in the corner, that stamps it out, it's yesterday's issue.'"

'As people do start changing their behaviour, the models will learn'

BlackRock to buy risk platform eFront for $1.3bn

Acquisition underlines asset manager s drive to be dominant analytics provider

BlackRock has moved to snap up a risk management platform for the burgeoning  alternative  asset management industry for $1.3bn, underscoring its desire to become the dominant provider of analytics for the global investment industry.

The $6tn New York asset manager led by Larry Fink has agreed to buy eFront, an analytics company for the private equity, real estate and direct lending industries, from Bridgepoint, its private equity owner.

BlackRock plans to combine eFront with Aladdin, the analytics platform that is the crown jewel of its  Solutions  business that caters to other asset managers and institutional investors such as pension and sovereign wealth funds. But eFront would still operate as normal for its existing clients after the purchase, according to people close to the deal.

While BlackRock s technology services are dwarfed by its asset management activities, the business is growing at a robust pace. The firm s Solutions division increased its revenues by 20 per cent to $785m last year, while fund inflows were dented by last year s market turbulence.

 Technology and illiquid alternatives are two pillars of BlackRock s growth, and this transaction provides a unique opportunity to accelerate our positioning in both,  Mr Fink said in a statement on Friday, which noted that completion of the deal was subject to a few conditions.

So-called alternative or  private  asset classes are enjoying strong interest from investors who desperately want higher returns than are available in mainstream public markets.

Aladdin, which stands for Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network, caters primarily to investors in stocks and bonds. Staff spanning portfolio managers to compliance officers can use Aladdin as it combines risk analytics, portfolio management and trading in a single system.

 eFront vastly expands Aladdin s alternatives capabilities and further distinguishes it as the most comprehensive investment operating platform in the world,  Rob Goldstein, BlackRock s chief operating officer, said in the statement.

A study on the global asset management industry from Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman estimates that alternative investments will account for 40 per cent of all revenues by 2023   vaulting above income from traditional stock and bond funds that have always been its bedrock.

 Broader adoption of private markets within investor portfolios is spurring alternatives growth,  the report said.  We view building capabilities in alternatives as critical for any asset manager seeking to grow revenues. 

Private capital funds have raised almost $5tn since 2012, according to Preqin, a data provider for the industry. But fundraising has outstripped the opportunities, with the amount of committed but uninvested money topping $2tn last year. Private equity accounts for most of it, but direct lending funds, real estate and infrastructure are also hot destinations for investors.

Indeed, a BlackRock survey of 230 pension funds, endowments, private banks and insurers with more than $7tn under management indicated that 51 per cent intended to cut exposure to stock markets, but nearly half planned to put more money into private markets and hardly anyone planned to cut their allocations.

Bridgepoint to Take Control of Kyriba, Deal Values Cash-Management Firm at $1.2 Billion; Company last valued at roughly $350 million in 2017

Private-equity firm Bridgepoint has agreed to take majority control of Kyriba Corp., a venture-backed provider of treasury-management software for corporate finance executives, in a deal that values the San Diego-based company at roughly $1.2 billion, people familiar with the matter said.

Venture investors in Kyriba, which has been led by Chief Executive Jean-Luc Robert since 2003, include Mangrove Capital Partners and Upfront Ventures, which were among early investors in 2001. Bpifrance, Iris Capital and Sumeru Equity Partners are also among the investors in the firm.

Bridgepoint will own roughly 75% of the company when the transaction is completed, according to the people. Most of the institutional investors are selling their stakes, they said.

A spokesman for Bridgepoint declined to comment on the deal. Kyriba representatives couldn't be reached for comment.

The deal's valuation of Kyriba is a jump from the roughly $350 million price tag that investors gave the company in a 2017 funding round, one person familiar with the round said.

For London-based Bridgepoint, the investment is a significant step in the firm's recent move to build its U.S. portfolio.

Bridgepoint, which in November opened its first office in San Francisco, is "http://www.bridgepoint.eu/en/news/press-releases/2015/bridgepoint-acquires-business-software-solutions-provider-efront" with asset manager BlackRock Inc. to sell eFront, a French financial-services software specialist that Bridgepoint acquired in 2015 for 300 million euros ($341 million).

Regulators at the Federal Trade Commission cleared an antitrust review of the Kyriba deal earlier this month, according to the agency's database.

Kyriba's platform offers a range of cash-management, analytics and cross-border payment functions. In a world of increasingly global financial operations, CFOs have turned to cloud-based software like Kyriba for visibility and compliance controls over vast accounting, banking and foreign-exchange processes.

In February, the company said its revenue for last year exceeded $110 million for the first time and said it expects a 40% growth in 2019.

Kyriba says it has partnerships and software integrations with companies ranging from BlackRock to payments specialist WorldFirst to Ripple Labs, a venture-backed global payments platform based on blockchain technology.

The Kyriba investment would complement holdings in Bridgepoint's financial-software portfolio. In addition to its ownership of eFront, the firm acquired Moneycorp, a British-based foreign-exchange platform for 212 million British pounds ($280 million) in 2014.

Ambienta Plans to Triple Its London Team

Private-equity firm Ambienta SGR plans to more than triple its London-based team in the coming months as the sustainability-focused investor seeks opportunities in the U.K. market despite the political uncertainty caused by the UK's approaching deadline to leave the European Union.

Milan-based Ambienta plans to expand its U.K. team to six or seven investment professionals from two currently and will name two new senior executives in the coming weeks, said Nino Tronchetti Provera, founder and managing partner of the firm.

"We are growing in the U.K. and have significantly expanded our office in London to help facilitate this growth," he said.

The firm's decision to expand its London office comes as many financial institutions continue to open offices elsewhere in Europe and some are relocating employees from London as the deadline for Brexit approaches.

"We are thematic-oriented. If companies that have a sustainable edge and meet our investment criteria are in the U.K., we will invest in them, regardless of geography," said Mr. Tronchetti Provera, a former McKinsey consultant. "We bought a company in the U.K. shortly after the Brexit referendum," he added.

Founded in 2017, Ambienta employs 30 people across Europe, according to a statement. The London expansion follows the hire of three investment professionals in Dsseldorf last month.

Ambienta targets businesses that are either able to reduce pollution or offer services and technologies addressing a more efficient use of natural resources, Mr. Tronchetti Provera said. For instance, Oskar Nolte, a portfolio company sold last year, makes water-based wood coatings and lacquers used by furniture manufacturers, which avoid the use of toxic solvents. Ambienta made 3.5 times its initial invested capital with the exit.

Private-equity firms have made efforts in recent years to adopt higher environmental, social and governance standards, as institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies increasingly weigh those factors as they make their investment decisions. Eighty 5% of limited partners consider ESG factors during their due-diligence process, according to London-based information and analytics company IHS Markit.

But one of the biggest mistakes made by private-equity firms in the sustainability and environmental space is to focus only on energy or climate change.

"The way we approach investing is very simple: Human beings are simply consuming too many resources and creating too much pollution," Mr. Tronchetti Provera said, identifying that as a business opportunity.

The strategy is attracting investors, which flocked to back Ambienta's latest fund. The firm raised  635 million ($716.2 million) for its largest fund in May, nearly double the size of its 2014 predecessor.

Ambienta's portfolio of companies grew organically by 13% in revenue and 16% in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year, he said. Overall, Ambienta's three funds delivered net returns well above 20% to their investors, according to the firm.

"While most of sustainability-focused funds are losing money, we are making money," Mr. Tronchetti Provera said.

Business News: L Brands Answers Calls To Seek Broader Board

For decades, Leslie Wexner has run the parent of Victoria's Secret with a close-knit group of directors. But amid scrutiny of the board's ties to the 81-year-old chief executive, the company is preparing to bring in some fresh blood.

L Brands Inc. has retained a search firm to find three new board candidates, according to people familiar with the matter. The company intends to replace some directors at its May annual meeting with an eye to increasing board diversity, they said.

The change would come after an activist hedge fund, Barington Capital Group LP, said this month that L Brands' board members lack the independence or skills needed to navigate drastic changes in the lingerie market.

Sales in L Brands' lingerie business have declined as new competitors cropped up, and the company's stock price has tumbled by a third from a year ago.

Mr. Wexner built L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works, into a global powerhouse from a single store in Columbus, Ohio, in 1963. The billionaire businessman, who is also L Brands' chairman, has drawn heavily from his local ties to populate the retailer's 12-person board, whose average tenure is 20 years.

New York-based Barington, which has a stake of less than 1% in L Brands, urged the company to add more women and younger directors who are outside Mr. Wexner's business and social circles. It also called on L Brands to consider breaking itself apart.

"It is unclear that the board as currently comprised has the independence to effectively oversee you as chief executive officer," James A. Mitarotonda, Barington's chief executive, wrote in a March 5 letter to Mr. Wexner.

Mr. Wexner remains the company's largest individual shareholder, with a 17% stake. His wife, Abigail, is also on the board, and neither is independent under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Two additional directors also don't meet the requirements, including one who acts as a business adviser to the Wexners.

Though the company classifies the remaining eight directors as independent, most of them have close ties to the Wexners, Barington argues. One headed a university to which Mr. Wexner promised $100 million. Another runs a charity that partners with an organization founded by Mrs. Wexner. One director was formerly employed by Mr. Wexner at his retail company.

"It's an old-style board with the kinds of interrelationships you saw many years ago, particularly in certain localities," said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. "It's surprising that this kind of board continues to exist in today's climate."

A spokeswoman for L Brands said Mr. Wexner and the other board members weren't available to comment.

In its proxy filing last year, L Brands said the eight directors were independent because in the past three years they hadn't worked for L Brands or received more than $120,000 from it, and they aren't related to top executives at the company. L Brands said it evaluates whether a director is independent on a case-by-case basis.

The average age for L Brands' directors is 71, the youngest being 57, and seven of them have been on the board for more than a dozen years. The median age of a director at S&P 500 firms is 63.3, while the median tenure is 7.8 years. Three L Brands directors are women.

"When more than a third of directors have served for more than nine years, that's when we start to have a little bit of concern," said John Roe, head of ISS Analytics, the data intelligence arm of Institutional Shareholder Services. "The danger is groupthink, or the reluctance to consider new opinions."

'Big Short' star manager raises bets against Canada lenders on weaker property sector

Asset management

A fund manager made famous by the book The Big Short has turned his sights on Canada, betting that a tottering housing market and a sluggish economy will bring trouble for the country's biggest banks.

Steve Eisman, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, is among a growing number of short-sellers taking positions in the likes of TD Bank and Royal Bank of Canada, in anticipation that the shares will fall.

The moves come after property prices raced ahead of incomes for several years, boosted by loose lending, low interest rates and lax controls on foreign money. But new house prices in Canada slipped year on year in January for the first time since 2009, squeezed by tighter rules on mortgages and new taxes on foreign buyers, while the broader economy has begun to falter.

"I'm calling for a simple normalisation of credit that hasn't happened in 20 years," Mr Eisman told the FT, while declining to name the banks he is shorting or the full extent of his positions. He said the effects would hurt banks and the real estate sector but would not be as intense as the financial crisis a decade ago in the US, when he and others saw huge profits from the implosion of the subprime mortgage market. "This is not The Big Short: Canada I'm not calling for a housing collapse," he said.

Mr Eisman is not alone: collective wagers against Canadian banks have risen 19 per cent since the start of the year to positions worth US$12.3bn, according to S3 Partners, a data provider based in New York.

The activity is largely driven by falls in the country's property market after years of rapid growth, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. "Unsold inventories are beginning to stack up," said Mr Dusaniwsky. "Even the turbocharged markets of Vancouver and Toronto are experiencing slowing demand and price fragility."

Toronto's TD Bank has emerged as the most popular target for the short sellers with bets against its stock up 17 per cent to a total of $3bn since January.

Bets against CIBC, also based in Toronto, have jumped 26 per cent to $2.3bn while those against Bank of Montreal are up 37 per cent to $1.3bn, according to S3 Partners.

All but one of Canada's Big Six banks boosted provisions for loan losses in the first quarter to the end of January, according to Royal Bank of Canada research. Mr Eisman said these increases signalled pain that would drag down shares over time.

Profits have already begun to sag. Four of the six biggest banks fell short of the market's earnings estimates for the first quarter, said Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank of Canada. Despite this, the S&P/TSX index of financial stocks has held up, matching the broader Canadian market this year.

Slowing economic growth is also pressuring the banks. In January, the Bank of Canada revised its growth predictions for 2019 to 1.7 per cent from 2.1 per cent forecast in October. It has recently joined other major central banks around the world in adopting a dovish tack, holding off on interest rate increases after five rises since July 2017.

Mr Eisman is convinced that shares in the banks will be under pressure. "Canadian banks are an oligopoly," he said. "They're not mentally prepared."

Painstaking Progress for Funds That Aim to Do Good; A large fund launch signals increased investor interest in socially responsible ETFs

DWS Group Inc., the asset-management business of Deutsche Bank AG, recently raised $843 million in a single day for a new fund that tries to invest in the best corporate citizens in the U.S.

It was one of the most successful exchange-traded-fund debuts of all time, and especially noteworthy in the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-its-so-hard-to-be-an-ethical-investor-1535799601" devoted to responsible investing.

For years, asset managers have been trumpeting a new dawn for strategies that deliver competitive returns along with a clear conscience. In the past year alone, firms including Vanguard Group, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc.'s iShares have introduced more than a dozen ETFs that use environmental, social and governance scores to pick stocks and bonds.

But investors have been slow to buy into so-called ESG funds. The triumphant inaugural run of DWS Group's Xtrackers MSCI USA ESG Leaders Equity ETF may signal a step change in investor participation.

"It's been a huge topic of conversation, but it's been more of a trickle when it comes to investment," said Brendan Powers, associate director of product development for Cerulli Associates. "There are a lot of headwinds."

ESG is a contemporary offshoot of socially responsible investing that tries to deliver a feel-good flavor of investing without sacrificing diversification or returns. Unlike older strategies, ESG doesn't categorically ban unloved industries but tries to find those companies that perform the best on issues like pollution and pay parity. There are now 221 U.S. mutual funds and ETFs that invest based on ESG criteria, up from 130 in 2012, according to Cerulli Associates, a research, analytics and consulting firm.

"To us, ESG is part of good portfolio management," said Anna Hyrske, head of responsible investment for Ilmarinen, Finland's largest pension-insurance company and the big investor behind the new Xtrackers ETF. "We are here to make money. We're not tree-huggers."

The new Xtrackers ETF invests in an index that picks the companies with the best scores on MSCI Inc.'s sustainability ratings. To come up with the scores, MSCI analysts scour news stories, financial records, company reports and regulatory filings looking for hazards that a traditional financial analysis might miss.

"One of the reasons we like the MSCI ESG Leaders index is that it's best in class, and the companies that don't get into the index are motivated to improve," Ms. Hyrske said.

Such strategies have won influential adherents, especially among big institutional investors like pension funds in California, Japan and Norway. There are $11.6 trillion in assets overseen by U.S. money managers who consider ESG criteria, up from $8.1 trillion in 2016, according to the most recent biennial report from US SIF, the forum for sustainable and responsible investment.

Ilmarinen, which manages  47 billion, began screening its portfolio in 2002 to identify whether companies met international standards on issues such as human rights and child labor. In 2017, Ilmarinen adopted MSCI ESG indexes as the benchmark for roughly half of its listed equity investments, but couldn't find an inexpensive, easily traded ETF that met its needs, Ms. Hyrske said.

ESG funds tend to be more expensive than plain-vanilla index ETFs, a hindrance in a market where the cheapest products win the most assets. But prices have begun to come down. The new ETFs Vanguard "https://www.wsj.com/articles/etfs-new-challenge-showing-socially-responsible-funds-can-deliver-1538478001" cost as little as $12 a year for every $10,000 invested, and the new Xtrackers U.S. ETF that Ilmarinen invested in costs just $10 a year, making it one of the cheapest ESG options on the market.

While big institutional investors are embracing ESG, individual investors have been harder to win over. The 49 ETFs that FactSet identifies as adhering to ESG strategies hold $7.7 billion in assets, just 0.2% of the $3.8 trillion U.S. ETF market.

Some barriers are structural. Until recently, there were few ready-made ESG model portfolios to make responsible investing easy. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/robo-advisers-latest-foray-socially-responsible-investing-1497697212" Robo adviser Betterment LLC said 12,000 of its 350,000 customers are using its socially responsible portfolios, which were introduced in July 2017. Last year, Bank of America Corp., the largest provider of ETF portfolios, added ESG strategies for Merrill Lynch and Merrill Edge clients, and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. added "Socially Aware" portfolios to its Essential Portfolios robo adviser business.

Another barrier is demographic. Baby boomers, who have had time to amass larger savings, aren't as interested in ESG as millennials are. The younger generation is just beginning to sock away money for retirement. Millennials account for 18% of TD Ameritrade's Essential Portfolios accounts, but make up 41% of the accounts in the Socially Aware lineup, the company said. By contrast, boomers hold 41% of its plain-vanilla Essential Portfolio accounts but just 26% of the Socially Aware portfolios. The average client in Betterment's socially responsible portfolios is 34 years old.

"While a subset of our Essential Portfolios clients are investing in Socially Aware portfolios, it remains early days," said Keith Denerstein, TD Ameritrade's director of guidance product management, in an emailed statement. "We're encouraged by our results to date."

Good day. Food, beverages and...micro-mobility? Those could be just a few of the themes at work as a result of a new partnership in which Starbucks Corp. has invested $100 million into a new food-tech and retail-focused fund managed by Valor Equity Partners, a backer of Bird scooters.

The investment in Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. could help the coffee company "explore commercial relationships down the road," Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said.

Chicago-based Valor has backed companies in food tech including goPuff, also known as GoBrands Inc., Fooda Inc., Sizzling Platter LLC and Eatsa.

Valor said it will seek to raise an additional $300 million for the new fund in the coming months.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Follow-on funds for biotech: Flagship Pioneering has closed an $824 million fund aimed at maturing companies from its portfolio of life sciences holdings.

Flagship launches health-care and sustainability startups and builds them early on through funds devoted to company origination. Among companies it created are Moderna Inc., a messenger-RNA drug developer that went public in December in the largest initial public offering in biotechnology history.

The firm's latest vehicle, Flagship Pioneering Special Opportunities Fund II LP, will go to companies whose platform technologies have led to new drug candidates or other products. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has the story.

Sounds, by subscription: For $7.99 a month, subscribers to five-year-old Splice have access to millions of musical sounds and audio snippets they can download and use in their own songs, without paying any additional royalties.

Those sounds which range from melodic phrases to short claps to vocal loops can be heard in recent hits from Marshmello, Ariana Grande and Maroon 5, among others.

Splice said Wednesday is closed a $57.5 million Series C round, bringing its total raised to $102 million. The round was led by existing investors Union Square Ventures and True Ventures.

The startup also formally named as its chief product officer Ryan Walsh, previously a venture adviser with Floodgate and a former product lead at Apple Inc. The WSJ's Anne Steele has more.

Global ambitions, Beijing's line: A Chinese education startup with U.S. investors is cracking down on how its Western teachers cover politically fraught topics.

VIPKid has put hundreds of its mostly American teachers on notice for using certain maps in their classes with Chinese students, and has severed two teachers' contracts for discussing Taiwan and Tiananmen Square in ways at odds with Chinese government preferences, Julie Steinberg and Shan Li report for the WSJ.

VIPKid's investors include Sequoia Capital, Tencent Holdings and a venture fund co-launched by Kobe Bryant.

Boosting the Garden State: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wants to set up a new fund alongside venture-capital firms to bring startups to the state.

Under the plan, New Jersey would auction off $250 million worth of tax credits to businesses over five years and use the proceeds to fund the program, dubbed the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund. Venture-capital firms would pitch in another $250 million and oversee the fund.

The fund would target investments in high-wage sectors such as cybersecurity, financial technology and advanced manufacturing.

Mack's Take: Startups Find Early Customers Within Their Cohort

By Heather Mack

Money, mentorship and a global network may be the most visible perks of the best accelerator programs. One of the greatest advantages that startups have in such firms is their peers, as they become the built-in customer base for one another while undergoing training.

That symbiosis was on display during Y Combinator's latest two-day run of startup demos, the firm's largest such gathering to date.

As founders gave rapid-fire pitches across two stages in San Francisco, there was plenty of back and forth name-dropping when listing top customers, as well as those from past batches.

In addition to showing off adoption by real-world customers albeit within the laboratory-like confines of Y Combinator's program startups were also armed with hard numbers about growth and traction with which to pitch investors.

Says Michael Seibel, chief executive of Y Combinator: "They have access to so many people excited to try out new dev ops or b-to-b tools, so it's open season for them to quickly get to scale and have early feedback."

Row over lump sums threatens to drag in fellow bank bosses

Lloyds Banking Group's attempt to quell anger about its chief executive's pay by cutting his pension payments for this year by about 3,000 has been denounced by a staff union as an "obscene piece of symbolism".

The row threatens to embroil chief executives at Standard Chartered, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland who are in line for lump sums of 34-40 per cent of their cash salary in 2019, according to their annual reports.

The Investment Association, which represents fund managers, has recommended CEOs receive a cash lump sum in lieu of pension that is in line with the contributions of most employees, which tend to be capped at about 10 per cent.

The only large listed bank to comply so far is HSBC, which last week agreed, under investor pressure, to cut the sum John Flint will receive this year to 10 per cent of his cash salary from 30 per cent.

Antnio Horta-Osrio of Lloyds was set to receive 76,139 as part of a finalsalary scheme awarded when he joined the bank in 2011 in recognition of a pension he gave up when he left Santander.

After protests from the Affinity union, Lloyds said the payment would be cut to 73,200, bringing the chief executive into line "with other colleagues participating in the group's defined benefits arrangements".

But left unchanged was an arrangement in which Mr Horta-Osrio will receive a cash payment of 419,000, equivalent to a third of his base salary. That is down from a payment equivalent to 46 per cent of his salary in 2018. "Mr Horta-Osrio's gesture five years too late is an obscene piece of symbolism designed to distract attention away from the fact that he still gets a pension allowance worth 33 per cent of salary whereas everyone else in the bank gets just 13 per cent," said Mark Brown, general secretary of Affinity.

Bill Winters of StanChart is set to receive 474,000, equivalent to 40 per cent of his base pay, and Ross McEwan of taxpayer-backed RBS is set to receive 350,000 in 2019, equivalent to about 35 per cent.

Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre said: "It's essentially taxpayers' money and, if it hadn't been for the bailout, top bankers at RBS would be lucky to get anything at all."

Mr Hildyard said UK Government Investments, which controls the Treasury's 62 per cent stake in RBS, should intervene but had been "quite weakwilled on pay practices at RBS".

When RBS appointed Katie Murray as its chief financial officer, it agreed to pay her a lump sum equivalent to 10 per cent of her cash salary. Ewen Stevenson, her predecessor, received 35 per cent.

Sarah Wilson, chief of Minerva Analytics, which advises shareholders, criticised RBS for not also revising Mr McEwan's arrangements when it lowered the sum paid to its CFO. "It's disappointing the remuneration committee didn't use the opportunity to renegotiate both contracts and rebalance them on to par." See Lombard

US tech dominance caught in White House race spotlight

Sector s leadership of Wall St stocks is set to face political and regulatory tests ahead

Whether or not voters pick Elizabeth Warren to take on Donald Trump in next year s presidential election might be beside the point for tech investors.

A vow to break-up America s biggest tech companies is part of a manifesto from the Democratic senator for Massachusetts that strategists say could help define the policy debate during the fight for the White House.

Although the regulatory threat to big tech has risen since the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal engulfed Facebook a year ago, the presidential race looks likely to return the spotlight on to the tech companies, including Amazon and Alphabet, which have helped underpin the decade-long bull market for US stocks.

 It would be pretty impactful, depending on how it gets done,  Lee Spelman, head of US equities for JPMorgan Asset Management, said of a plan to break-up big tech. These measures would dent the companies  profitability, but estimating the likelihood they might materialise is difficult.

The intervention from Ms Warren, one of the first to enter a now crowded race for the Democratic nomination, comes as the tech sector   encompassing everything from software makers to Apple   shows little sign of relinquishing the role it has had in driving Wall Street higher.

An 18.5 per cent gain for the S&P 500 info tech sector this year has made it the best performing part of the market, comfortably beating the 13.2 per cent gain for the wider index of large-cap stocks. Shares of those big tech companies that are not part of the info tech sector, such as Facebook and Netflix, have also outshone the S&P 500.

Yet beneath the strong showing from tech, concerns are stirring. Nor is it only down to the potential shadow of politics, which was underlined on Tuesday when the chair of the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee, urged the Federal Trade Commission to launch a probe into whether Facebook had violated antitrust laws.

The list of worries includes a slowing global economy that poses a threat to ad-driven businesses like Google. At the same time, any further trade rupture between Washington and Beijing could add to Apple s difficulties in China. There are signs investors are becoming less comfortable with tech.

US mutual funds have cut back their overweighting to technology stocks to the lowest level in three years, according to research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Savita Subramanian published this month.

Richard Bernstein Advisors is one asset manager that has whittled down its exposure to tech stocks. The New York fund group holds 11 per cent of its portfolio in tech shares, down from 26 per cent at the start of the year.

Mr Bernstein, founder and chief executive, said tech companies are more vulnerable to periods of poor earnings growth and pointed to pallid forecasts   S&P 500 earnings are set to slide 3.6 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, according to FactSet   as reasons for his caution.

 This is a deep cyclical sector that people mistake for growth,  Mr Bernstein said.  If profits decelerate in 2019 and 2020 and if we have a profit recession will this sector be immune? It won t be. 

The trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies have hurt Apple, which Microsoft has unseated as the world s largest company by market capitalisation. The iPhone maker s shares remain a fifth below their October highs after signs of weakening demand for its smartphones in China   a key market that doubles as its manufacturing hub   triggered a drop in the stock.

Hopes for a permanent US-China trade truce has helped Apple s stock rebound this year after a 30 per cent tumble in the final quarter of 2018, but a deterioration in the Chinese economy remains a key concern for the iPhone maker.

 The trade war looms, but it feels like there is some resolution on the horizon,  said Ms Spelman.

However the trade battle unfolds in coming months, the tech sector   and its promise of disruption and innovation   will always hold allure for investors. The adoption of automation and machine-learning tools, features of the so-called  fourth industrial revolution , will only add to this as companies from banks to manufacturers adapt to new technology or risk losing out.

 There are fantastic businesses that will be the beneficiaries of the industrial revolution 4.0, but some will benefit more than others,  says Ankur Crawford, a portfolio manager with Alger, the fund group in New York.

For now, though, the focus for fund managers who have come to rely on the tech sector as the engine for US stocks, the challenge is to work out how it can withstand the set of economic and political challenges over the next year.

 At the beginning of the year you could have thrown a dart and you would have been right   now you need to be more selective,  said Ms Crawford.

Good day. Adding entertainment content to your app can make for some contentious dealings.

Peloton Interactive Inc. is a popular fitness startup that sells stationary bicycles for more than $2,000, plus various accessories. Many of its customers use the bikes at home, paying about $39 a month to stream live classes that the company produces using its own instructors.

A group of music publishers has filed suit against the company for copyright infringement, alleging that Peloton has released thousands of videos including unlicensed music since launching its at-home streaming capabilities in 2014. Those videos include music recorded by artists such as Rihanna, Bruno Mars and Katy Perry, according to the lawsuit.

A spokeswoman for Peloton told The Wall Street Journal that the company has received the suit and is evaluating it. Peloton's backers include GGV and Kleiner Perkins.

And now on to the news...

Social medicine: Investors are providing $35 million to a startup that bridges the medical and social-services fields at a time when health systems increasingly are looking for ways to meet patients' social needs.

Hospitals and other medical groups aim to help patients overcome social problems, such as a lack of adequate housing, that keep them from getting and staying healthy. Unite Us, which has just raised a Series B round, sells technology to connect medical and community-based organizations.

Startups also are providing other types of technologies to deal with social issues affecting health. Innovaccer Inc., a San Francisco-based provider of a patient data platform for health systems, has added a new social-vulnerability index into that system that highlights social needs of patients and suggests interventions.

Oak HC/FT has just led New York-based Unite Us's new round, joined by Define Ventures and Town Hall Ventures. Also participating were existing backers Luminate (part of the Omidyar Group), New York Ventures and Scout Ventures.

Chernova's Take: Can Glossier, Loaded With Capital, Still Bring Investors Winning Returns?

By Yuliya Chernova

Stitch Fix Inc. and Glossier Inc., both style companies, have followed different paths when it comes to their fundraising with venture capitalists.

Stitch Fix raised about $48 million before going public in 2017; Glossier has already rounded up almost four times that with the addition of the company's $100 million Series D round led by Sequoia Capital.

Glossier's funding infusion may help the company grow faster but it also limits its investors' exit options.

Now with a valuation of $1.2 billion, Glossier would have to be worth significantly more than beauty brands were in recent acquisitions if it is going to bring VC firms meaningful returns. The $1.45 billion sale of Too Faced by Estee Lauder Cos., for example, represented one of the largest cosmetics brand M&A transactions in recent years.

With the new late-stage capital in hand, Glossier appears to be gunning for an IPO path, which Chief Executive Emily Weiss said is something the company "is able to do."

But as Ms. Lake's experience shows, that trail can be full of stumbles even for a solid business.

Exits

Conversocial, a digital customer experience platform, is acquiring chatbot startup Assist for an undisclosed amount. With offices in New York, London and San Francisco, Conversocial is backed by investors including Dawn Capital, Draper Esprit and Octopus Ventures.

VC Funds

Green Visor Capital is in the market to raise its third flagship fund, targeting up to $100 million, the San Francisco firm disclosed in a regulatory filing. Portfolio companies include research platform DataFox, which sold to Oracle last year, and consumer finance startup Credit Shop.

Fed Meeting Puts Focus on Rate Projections, Portfolio Runoff; Lenders Compete for Customers; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Wednesday, March 20, 2019

Good day. The Federal Reserve is set to leave short-term interest rates unchanged today, but officials could lower their rate projections. As the central bank wraps up its two-day policy meeting, Fed officials also may explain how they intend to end the runoff of their $4 trillion asset portfolio. Outside the U.S., Thailand's central bank held rates steady, but trimmed its growth outlook for this year.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Five Things to Watch at the Fed's March Meeting

Federal Reserve officials are on track to leave interest rates unchanged at their two-day meeting ending Wednesday and could indicate they are comfortable holding them steady for a while. The Fed releases its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT, and Chairman Jerome Powell starts his press conference at 2:30 p.m. The update will show for the first time just how patient Fed officials expect to be, and shed light on their assessment of the economy. It could also offer new information on the end of the Fed's portfolio runoff. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-things-to-watch-at-the-feds-march-meeting-11553074200?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb"

Loans Get Cheaper for Some

Borrowing costs for some U.S. consumers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/loans-get-cheaper-for-some-11553076000?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3" in recent months, as lenders have adapted to the Federal Reserve's message that it is likely to hold off on raising interest rates for the foreseeable future. After a year in which Fed rate increases rippled through consumer-debt markets, data from the past three months suggest financial institutions are again jostling for customers by offering lower rates, particularly to those with good credit scores.

Bank of America Sees Good Chance of Very Dovish Fed

Bank of America sees a pretty dovish turn coming from the Fed on Wednesday. When it comes to the interest rate forecasts, "we think the dots will shift down 25 (basis points) across the curve, leaving one hike this year and next. The risk is that they move even lower," says the investment bank in a note. As for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Bank of America says he'll "likely reiterate the desire for wage inflation to move higher, accepting the labor market will remain tight. He will likely be asked about the Fed's view on an inflation overshoot. We doubt he will give precise numbers, but instead note inflation running above 2% is justified." (Michael Derby)

Thai Central Bank Stands Pat on Rates, Trims 2019 Growth Forecast

The Bank of Thailand left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.75% Wednesday against a backdrop of soft inflation and a subdued economic-growth outlook. The central bank also reduced its 2019 forecast for economic growth to 3.8% from 4%. (Dow Jones Newswires)

Sydney Apartments a Financial-Stability Risk in Australia

Reserve Bank of Australia Asst. Gov. Michele Bullock said in a speech that the property market remains a big concern. A soft market in Sydney, where more than 80,000 apartments were built in the past few years, may exacerbate home-price declines and impact the financial positions of households and developers, she said.

High-Level U.S.-China Trade Talks to Resume in Final Push for Deal

U.K. Won't Seek Long Brexit Extension

The U.K. government"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-wont-seek-long-brexit-extension-11553070761" the European Union for a "long" Brexit delay, a British government official said Wednesday, suggesting any extension request would likely be for months rather than upward of a year.

More Detail and Plain English: Auditors' Reports Get a Makeover

By Michael Rapoport

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-detail-and-plain-english-auditors-reports-get-a-makeover-11553012005": More insights for investors about the biggest concerns lurking in their companies' financial results.

Auditors are gearing up to revamp and expand the yearly letter in which they bless a company's financial statements. Starting later this year, those audit reports must tell investors more about what an auditor found most difficult or challenging when scrutinizing a company's books.

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board adopted the changes the most substantial since the 1940s in 2017. Auditors are required to submit expanded reports starting June 30, for bigger companies whose fiscal years end then; the rule kicks in for smaller companies in 2021.

Investors can expect a report offering a glimpse at what the auditor considers the knottiest issues in a company's financial statements, ranging from investment valuations to tax decisions. It'll be more individually tailored than the current report, which largely uses the same boilerplate language for everyone.

The shape of the new reports is starting to come into view. As they do their regular reports on the year-end 2018 audits of big clients, auditors have been preparing practice reports with the added information as if the new requirement already were in effect.

Big Four accounting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP even has a "vocabulary list" examples of the technical language the firm has previously used in the report, along with guidance on how to reframe it more clearly.

Instead of saying the auditor performed a "retrospective review" of a company's revenues and operating margins, for example, Deloitte will say the auditor "compared actual results to management's historical forecasts" to evaluate a company's forecasts of those measures.

"It's a great opportunity for the auditor to be more transparent with investors about the more challenging parts of the audit," said Dave Sullivan, Deloitte's national managing partner for quality and professional practice.

The changes are aimed at making auditors' reports more helpful to investors and telling them more about what's going on inside companies. That could lead to investors learning more about areas of concern sooner that could lead to earnings restatements or other problems later.

New reports will add information on "critical audit matters," or CAMs, the complex issues about an audit that "keep the auditors up at night," as auditors and PCAOB members have put it. Auditors will have to describe each such issue and explain how it was ultimately addressed in the audit.

The issues that auditors single out will generally align with the kinds of matters an auditor thinks are serious enough to raise with a company's audit committee. They will vary by company and industry a bank's procedures for setting aside reserves for potential losses on loans might be a critical audit matter, for instance. At another company, it might be the way it values hard-to-price investments that don't trade often. Inherently complex issues like taxes or accounting for mergers and acquisitions also could be CAMs.

"The CAMs tend to be in areas involving high degrees of uncertainty," said Cindy Fornelli, executive director of the Center for Audit Quality, which represents public-company auditors. Identifying an issue as a CAM doesn't mean the company has done anything wrong, she said, but it might lead investors to "ask more pointed questions."

The Center for Audit Quality has issued a sample of what the description of a critical audit matter might look like. In the group's scenario, the CAM is the company's evaluation of whether it should write down its "goodwill" the intangible asset reflecting the premium one company pays when it buys another. Evaluating the goodwill involves "significant estimates and assumptions," the sample report says, and the auditor addressed it by testing the effectiveness of the company's controls and bringing in a valuation specialist to help with the audit, among other steps.

The PCAOB has indicated it expects auditors to cite at least one CAM at most companies. In staff guidance on the change issued Monday, the board emphasized that auditors "should be specific to the circumstances" when determining and explaining a CAM and should do it in a "clear, concise, and understandable" way.

In Europe, where a similar requirement is already in effect, auditors disclosed an average of about three "key audit matters" per company in fiscal 2017, according to consulting firm Audit Analytics. The most common subject cited was impairment of assets such as goodwill, followed by revenue, investment valuation, and income taxes.

Auditors have also been preparing their corporate clients about what they should expect once the requirement takes effect. Among other things, the added work the expanded audit report requires could lead to some audit-fee increases.

"Certainly there's incremental time that factors in to how we talk about fees," said Brian Croteau, a PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP partner who leads the firm's efforts concerning CAMs.

Virtual Casinos Deliver a Tricky Jackpot to the Philippines

By Jake Maxwell Watts

MANILA, Philippines In casino halls packed into this city's premium high-rise office towers, young, skimpily dressed croupiers deal cards and flash winning smiles for Chinese gamblers. Only there is no one else there. The players are connected by webcam.

Until recently, the Philippines was attracting gamblers the old-fashioned way, building casinos and hotels. But when Chinese authorities intensified an anticorruption crackdown in 2015 that put traveling high-rollers on notice, gamblers began looking online a venue that is illegal in China, but easier to play undetected.

The result has been a boom in an industry that has brought this country millions of dollars in revenue and bolstered the capital's real-estate market, but has also been difficult to monitor and spurred calls by lawmakers for investigations into illegal immigration and the risk of money laundering.

Many jurisdictions, including some U.S. states, allow online gambling among their own populations but few specifically license companies to target foreign markets. Those that do tend to be small tax havens looking to tap industries where they can be globally competitive.

The Philippines is the largest among them, more than double its nearest rival, Gibraltar, according to Global Betting and Gaming Consultants, on the Isle of Man.

As the business grew, President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017 put the national casino regulator in charge of licensing online-gambling providers, formally taking the role from special economic zones outside the capital and ending the contract of a private operator. The shift allowed the industry to proliferate in Manila, where connectivity is better and labor and support services easier to come by.

Mr. Duterte cast the move as an effort to rein in illegal gambling, but the gambling regulator's ability to do that is limited. The Philippines prohibits online casinos from targeting markets where gambling is illegal, including China, according to the regulator, Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp., or Pagcor. But many online casinos use the Philippines purely as a base for their production and support operations, Pagcor says, and are registered and process payments elsewhere.

That limits Philippine jurisdiction when investigating and prosecuting alleged financial crimes, according to Pagcor, which says it still maintains a robust anticrime framework.

Since 2016, the year Mr. Duterte took office, Pagcor has licensed more than 50 online operators, almost all of them aimed at a Chinese market, with Chinese-language websites and advertising.

Online gambling companies contacted in Manila didn't respond to requests for information about their operations and what share of their client base is in China which offers the biggest supply of Chinese gamblers. The Chinese Embassy in Manila has repeatedly warned Chinese citizens not to participate in online gambling or move to Manila to work in the industry, citing examples of kidnappings and extortion.

"The Chinese like to gamble. If they can't go to Macau for political reasons there are plenty of other places around Asia that will service them," said Lorien Pilling, a director at Global Betting and Gaming Consultants. The Philippines is on the same time zone and is geographically close to China, he said, so "that's why it sprang up as the base for these firms."

Many gambling sites operate from what used to be office space for call centers and other traditional outsourcing companies. At tables rigged with cameras, croupiers, most of them Filipina, silently deal baccarat and blackjack or spin roulette wheels under the glare of spotlights, smiling at a camera for gamblers they can't see.

Recruiters advertise for attractive, slim women; tattoos and dental braces aren't allowed, and cleavage is a requisite, said one former dealer, a Filipina woman in her 20s, who said she enjoyed working in the industry.

At one of the Philippines' tallest buildings, the 55-story PBCom Tower in Manila, more than half the tenants are Chinese, most of them online gambling firms, according to the building receptionist.

Online-gambling businesses brought in 7.4 billion pesos ($141 million) in licensing fees for the Philippine government in 2018. The broader Philippine casino industry generated a record $4.1 billion in revenue last year, Pagcor estimates show, up 8.5% from a year earlier.

Gambling revenue has helped Mr. Duterte's cash-strapped government pay for budget needs including schools and disaster recovery, according to Pagcor.

The industry's growth is also contributing to rising property prices in Manila. About 21% of new office rentals in 2018 were for online gambling companies, compared with 26% for outsourcers and 19% for call centers, according to Colliers International Philippines.

Mr. Duterte, who has made his image as crime-fighter central to his presidency, has raved against gambling in the country, comparing casinos to organized crime and saying he wanted to "suppress" online gambling. Last year he canceled a $1.5 billion casino project in Manila and blocked a casino operator from building a $500 million resort.

A congressional committee this year launched an inquiry into what it said was an influx of illegal immigrants. The committee chairman, Sen. Joel Villanueva, said more than two-thirds of the 167 illegal immigration cases heard in court last year involved illegal online gambling. Hundreds of illegal Chinese workers have been deported for working without permits in the industry, he said.

In February, 276 illegal immigrants were arrested in a raid on a company in Manila's central business district, most of them working in online gambling.

The government is missing out on more than $57 million in monthly income tax revenue from illegal workers in online casinos, the Philippines' finance minister said this month.

"We strongly believe there is a dire need to strengthen legislation and enforcement to stop illegal online gambling and proliferation of illegal Chinese workers that shamelessly robbed our own people [of] jobs," Sen. Villanueva said last year after an earlier raid on an online gambling firm.

Sen. Leila de Lima, a critic of the Duterte government, has called for official investigation into the risk that online gambling could facilitate money laundering. After more than $81 million stolen from Bangladesh's central bank disappeared into Philippine casinos three years ago, the country heeded longstanding calls to include the gambling industry in anti-money-laundering regulations.

"Lax regulations have turned gambling into a potential hotbed for criminal activity," said Ms. de Lima. "The sheer difficulty of policing the internet has made sanctioning, let alone regulating online gambling, an increasingly risky proposition even for developed countries."

The government's Anti-Money Laundering Council said it has received no reports of suspicious or large transactions through the online gambling industry. That means no gambling site reported a bet of more than 5 million pesos ($95,000).

But the industry isn't transparent, and "is definitely a blind spot for money laundering," said Alvin Camba, a Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University who researches online gambling in the Philippines.

Mr. Camba said he doesn't oppose a well-regulated industry, but currently, "We don't know who's gambling, how much, and when."

How Monetary Policy Shaped the Housing Boom

Between 2003 and 2006, the Fed raised rates by 4.25 percentage points, and "this tightening "https://www.nber.org/papers/w25649.pdf?mod=article_inline" in deposits, leading banks to substantially reduce their portfolio mortgage lending," Itamar Drechsler, Alexi Savov and Philipp Schnabl write in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper. "Yet, this contraction did not translate into a substantial reduction in total mortgage lending. Rather, an unprecedented expansion in private-label securitization, led by nonbank mortgage originators, substituted for most of the reduction in bank portfolio lending and thus largely undid the impact of Fed tightening on the mortgage lending boom."

They add that tighter supervision of mortgage-lending standards might have helped prevent the housing boom, perhaps more so than further monetary policy tightening. "It is difficult to predict, however, whether this would have fully insulated the mortgage market from instability once government-insured deposits were replaced with capital markets funding. Ultimately, it was the willingness of end investors to supply this funding that enabled the boom and limited the effectiveness of monetary policy."

Investing in Europe's Japanification

"The slowdown in European growth and inflation has Wall Street once again raising the fear that Europe is turning Japanese," "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investing-in-europes-japanification-11552989721?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1". He notes that Japan has struggled for years with low inflation, and its stock market hasn't recovered from a crash nearly 30 years ago. Europe, he finds, shows some strong similarities. "The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have both tried long periods of zero and now negative interest rates, without igniting inflation. Both prematurely raised rates before realizing the extent of their troubles. And both have aging populations weighing on growth prospects. These similarities matter to investors. But the differences may matter more to governments and the population. The truth is, Japan's economic growth hasn't been nearly as bad as everyone believes, while Europe's policy response has been quite different from Japan's."

Metro Money: An Investor Club Open to All Entrepreneurs

By Anne Kadet

When Raina Casbon-Kelts recently pitched a roomful of potential investors on Gilded, her cryptocurrency-accounting software, she was stumped by a seemingly simple question: How would she pay investors back?

"Um, that's a great question," she said.

No one seemed to mind. The crowd laughed and clapped, in fact, when she noted that so far, the fledgling startup had "six paying customers -- woo-hoo!"

But this wasn't a formal presentation for a venture-capital committee. Ms. Casbon-Kelts was addressing the Alternative Investments Club of New York, a lively gathering of deal seekers that is open to any entrepreneur looking for funding.

Every Tuesday night, anyone can head upstairs to the Jay-Z Lounge of the 40/40 Club, a Manhattan sports bar co-owned by the hip-hop mogul, to make a pitch or just enjoy the scene.

The crowd of 40 to 50 typically ranges from business students to VC executives -- the rough equivalent of record-label reps scouting an open-mic night for the next hot act.

Entrepreneurs seek funding for ventures ranging from blockchain startups and real-estate deals to Broadway shows. Most seek $50,000 to $500,000.

Venture-capital and private-equity deals in New York City totaled $45.8 billion last year, according to PitchBook data. But these opportunities are typically closed to all but the wealthiest (and, allegedly, sophisticated) investors. Entrepreneurs, meanwhile, typically need connections to tap such funding pools -- which can create particularly burdensome obstacles to businesses founded by women and people of color.

At the Alternative Investments Club, however, there are no barriers. "Everyone gets an opportunity," says founder Bakari Akil, a 29-year-old former software salesman who lives in Harlem and launched the club in 2016 as part of an effort to find a business to buy.

Last Tuesday, a crowd of 57, including eight women and one robot, gathered at the bar, waiting to be admitted to the upstairs lounge.

Investors said they were seeking below-the-radar opportunities at a time when everything looks overvalued.

Compliance analyst Samora Legros was looking for real estate outside New York City. "The market values here don't make sense compared to the rest of the country," he said.

Inventor Matthew Flannery was looking to raise $500,000 for the second iteration of SpongeBath, his countertop sponge-sanitizing gadget already on the market. "Hopefully I'll find a few high-net-worth investors to board the rocket ship," he said. "We're taking off!"

At 6:30 p.m., Mr. Akil opened the lounge and laid out the rules. No pitching services -- only deals. Entrepreneurs get five minutes to present and two minutes to answer questions.

"The way I decide who will present in this room is whoever puts their hand up fast," he added.

After starting the Alternative Investments Club, Mr. Akil said he found he could make enough money running it to support himself, while continuing his search for businesses to purchase. He doesn't charge admission, but he collects donations from guests and fees from sponsors who pay to make longer presentations.

The first to pitch that evening was real-estate salesman Alon Sole, dressed in a black T-shirt, gold chain and sneakers. He offered a three-family home for $625,000 that he said would generate $80,000 a year in rental income. "You can see your money grow in the Bronx!" he said.

Entrepreneur Justin Starr told his personal story in an effort to raise $1.2 million to develop a motion-capture device that uses artificial intelligence to provide corrective feedback to people performing physical-therapy routines.

He was homeless and living in a 14th Street subway station, he said, when he met a neurosurgeon at the gym where he worked as a personal trainer.

"Now we have the first patent in the world on this technology," he said, displaying a prototype.

Following presentations, a waitress brought in a bucket of beers, a big platter of fries and a bowl of ketchup. Mr. Akil encouraged guests to network and make deals.

Dentist Ekpa Eyoma, a first-time attendee looking for investment opportunities, pronounced the evening "amazing."

"There were a lot of words I didn't understand," she said. "What's blockchain? It sounds like it's something important, because a lot of people have said it. I will Google that tonight."

Ms. Casbon-Kelts said she didn't meet any investors for her accounting software, but made plenty of connections. "Tonight was a breath of fresh air," she said. "You get to talk to humans who actually make eye contact."

Mr. Akil said deals do get made. Roughly 40 a year, he estimates. One real-estate entrepreneur found a fellow investor to sink $25,000 into a $700,000 multifamily building in Allentown, Pa., for example. The founder of a health-care startup got $70,000 from an angel investor to develop a device prototype.

And while the club hasn't produced a business for him to buy, Mr. Akil said he met several co-investors with whom he plans to purchase an out-of-town company he found through a broker.

If the deal closes, Mr. Akil will be leaving New York. But he hopes the Alternative Investments Club would continue under the management of two volunteers he is grooming.

And if he has done it once, he can do it again.

"I'll probably start a similar club in the city I move to," he said.

UK broker TP ICAP takes asset hit after last year s profit warning

Interdealer group will spend more on risk management and insight for brokers

TP ICAP, the UK interdealer broker, has taken a 65m non-cash charge relating to the value of its assets following its hefty profits warning last summer.

The London group said it had reduced the carrying value of its US business by 58m and its Asia-Pacific operations by 7m as it reduced its forecasts for future profitability in the units. It took a 14m charge for consultancy fees as it tried to integrate the 1.3bn purchase of ICAP more than two years ago.

The move contributed to a drop in pre-tax profits, after acquisitions, disposals and other costs, from 72m to 62m.

TP ICAP said it would ramp up its spending on its risk management systems to make it more attuned to the day-to-day risks it faces when trading across global over-the-counter markets.

The group said it had spent 1m last year on processes that gave it a better insight into the risks its brokers faced when trading on venues and counterparties in the swaps, commodities and foreign exchange markets, and their ability to take on the positions while meeting regulatory requirements. Next year that amount will rise to 5m, it said.

In its annual results on Tuesday Nicolas Breteau, chief executive, said he would focus on finishing off the delayed integration of its purchase of ICAP for 1.3m more than two years ago.

The results were the first full-year earnings under Mr Breteau, who was promoted in July to stabilise the company after a summer in which departing chairman Rupert Robson removed John Phizackerley, the former Lehman Brothers banker, amid tensions between the two men. Mr Robson is due to leave at the annual shareholder meeting in May.

TP ICAP also said it was moving more of its UK brokers into EU offices to interact with clients as part of its preparation for Brexit. It is relocating its electronic trading platform iSwap to Amsterdam and expects a French unit to be approved by local regulators before the end of March.

For the year to December 31 revenues rose 3 per cent to 1.76bn. Underlying pre-tax profits rose from 233m to 245m as it improved operating margins from 15 per cent to 15.7 per cent. Turnover in its data and analytics business, a growth area Mr Breteau has targeted, rose 8 per cent to 117m.

Bitcoin Is in the Dumps, Spreading Gloom Over Crypto World; The value of all cryptocurrencies outstanding is down 85% from peak and volumes on U.S. exchanges have been falling; making it through 'winter'

Corrections & Amplifications

An earlier caption with the photograph showing a technician monitoring cryptocurrency mining rigs at a Bitfarms facility in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, incorrectly labeled it as Eric Larchevque, the CEO of Ledger. (March 19, 2019)

Bitcoin is in the longest slump of its 10-year history. That is forcing even its most ardent supporters to shelve dreams of global disruption and focus on simply tightening their belts long enough to outlast the downturn.

Signs of the crypto winter are everywhere, marking a sharp reversal since the manic highs of 2017. The price of bitcoin Tuesday was just below $4,000, down about 80% from a trading peak of about $19,800 in December 2017. The total market value of all cryptocurrencies outstanding is down 85% from its peak in January 2018. And volumes on the largest U.S. exchanges have been falling steadily for the past 15 months, according to research firm TradeBlock.

Also wounded in the crash: many companies and technology platforms that promised to transform businesses from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. The young industry was built with billions of dollars raised through initial coin offerings, a method of capital raising that involves selling bitcoin-like tokens to the public. Those offerings have all but disappeared, choking off a vital funding source for the heady tech projects that were supposed to bring crypto mainstream.

Bitcoin is still driven largely by momentum, and right now it doesn't have it. Cryptocurrencies have struggled to attract mainstream institutional investors. Regulation is still unclear, which has scared off some potential users. Companies that have sprung up around the crypto world are under pressure until the next upswing, and crypto fans aren't sure where that will come from or when.

While bitcoin is trading well above its December 2016 level, the severity of the recent drop is raising concerns that it may never recover. The market's long-term viability now hinges on the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-2019-goal-technology-people-can-use-11546347601" for bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology.

To be fair, crypto markets have long been defined by choppiness. During part of 2011, the price of bitcoin dropped about 95%. The price also dropped 85% from December 2013 to January 2015, sparked by the shutdown of the Silk Road website, an online drug bazaar that used bitcoin, and problems at the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-who-solved-bitcoins-most-notorious-heist-1533917805?mod=article_inline".

But the sector is much bigger than it was during some of those earlier swings, and it is closer than ever to becoming mainstream. Its influence today is widespread: Western governments have given it tacit or explicit acceptance and venture capitalists support it. Developers are finding ways to apply its underlying technology, blockchain, to fields as varied as supply-chain management and capital-markets trading.

The sharp decline in price over the past year has led to cost-cutting at some firms. "There's still coffee," said Eric Larchevque, CEO of Paris-based Ledger SAS, which makes crypto-storage products that resemble thumb drives, "but you don't have the extra nuts." The company has also cut back on travel and advertising, he said, though it has avoided layoffs.

"We're trying to deal with it on a day-by-day basis," said Mr. Larchevque, whose firm raised $75 million in January 2018. That plus product sales have been enough to sustain the company, he said, but it is contingent on more austere management. "We want to make sure the company will still be here in 18 months."

Firms that raised capital and made money during the boom are taking advantage of the slump, scooping up smaller companies. Circle Internet Financial, which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-may-be-down-but-a-digital-currency-startup-still-soars-1526416063" for storing cryptocurrency and a trading desk, among other things, has raised a total of $246 million from investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The Boston-based company last year acquired cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, and earlier this month it closed an acquisition for a crowdfunding platform called SeedInvest.

Some companies that raised big sums in initial coin offerings also are holding up. Block.One "https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-chaotic-launch-of-eos-the-blockchain-project-that-raised-4-billion-1528810352" in its ICO and has been using the proceeds to support its EOS platform. Telegram, which operates the popular messaging service, raised $1.7 billion last year and has been using the funds to support the service and to build its own blockchain platform.

Investors in these and other offerings haven't been so fortunate. EOS tokens currently trade at around $3.77 after peaking at $21 in April 2018. Tezos, which raised more than $200 million in 2017, saw the value of its tokens rise as high as $11.21 in December 2017. They're now trading at around 55 cents. Telegram's tokens have not yet started trading.

ICOs, which brought in $12 billion in 2018, have raised only $100 million so far this year, according to research firm TokenData. Of the 50 ICOs tracked by TokenData this year, only 13 stayed in business, a 74% failure rate, the firm said. In 2018, the failure rate was 55%, it added.

"People are looking for ways to support themselves through winter," said Galen Moore. The Boston resident recently started an open-source data-analytics project called Canary Data that he hopes to turn into a new startup, but he has also taken consulting work to pay the bills.

Dan Held, director of business development at a startup called InterChange, said that as vicious as this bitcoin bear market has been, it isn't the worst. After the Silk Road and Mt. Gox debacles, "we weren't sure if demand would ever come back," Mr. Held said.

One thing Mr. Held noticed during those other bleak periods: Firms that survived were the ones closest to employing trading fees, like exchanges, which collect fees regardless of whether the market is rising or falling.

InterChange focuses on back-office accounting software for trading desks, exchanges and hedge funds. "No matter what the market is doing, you still have to do your accounting," he said.

Revenue for bitcoin miners, who get paid in newly created bitcoin in exchange for processing transactions, has also fallen over the past 15 months, according to research firm Diar.

Boaz Bechar started a data-research site called Blocktrail in 2014 and sold it to the big mining company Bitmain in 2016. Bitmain recently laid him off as part of a broader downsizing.

Mr. Bechar believes that only the biggest crypto companies will be able to weather the volatile industry. "The big players are going to get bigger doing what they do," he said. "It will be a race to the top."

Good day. What started as a beauty blog is now a billion-dollar business.

Glossier Inc., a New York-based direct-to-consumer beauty company, has been valued at $1.2 billion with a new capital infusion led by Sequoia Capital, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Good day. Federal Reserve officials meeting this week may take up the issue of what combination of Treasury securities they should hold as the central bank's portfolio runoff nears an end. Recent comments from several officials indicate the Fed could boost purchases of shorter-term bills. Meanwhile, many female economists said in a new survey they have faced discrimination.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Markets have cheered the Federal Reserve's imminent announcement that it will stop shrinking its asset portfolio later this year, but determining that date is just one challenge facing central-bank officials.

Now, they are turning to the arguably more sensitive task of determining the composition of the Treasury securities the central bank will hold. Specifically, they "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-faces-crucial-decision-on-mix-of-treasurys-in-its-portfolio-11552987920?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" the right combination of Treasurys of varying duration to hold whether mostly short-term bills or a mix that also includes more longer-term notes and bonds. This composition will be a matter of intense interest to the markets for those securities, with implications for the economy and monetary policy.

Female Economists, in Survey, Cite Gender Discrimination

Female economists "https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-economists-in-survey-citegender-discrimination-11552923797?tesla=y&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" and, in some cases, sexually assaulted by their colleagues, according to a new survey by the American Economic Association.

Obama Economic Adviser Alan Krueger Dead at 58

Alan Krueger, a top economic adviser to former President Barack Obama and one of the nation's most influential labor-market experts, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-economic-adviser-alan-krueger-dead-at-58-11552921415?mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" at the age of 58. The cause of death was suicide, his family said in a statement released by Princeton University, where he taught.

White House Seeks Ways to Get More People to Work

The White House in a new report "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-seeks-ways-to-get-more-people-to-work-11552968060?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" of the labor-force participation rate and pushed for policies to encourage more people to work as millions of baby boomers retire.

Trump Budget Relies on Potentially Phantom Revenues

President Trump's budget blueprint for the next decade "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-budget-relies-on-up-to-1-2-trillion-in-potentially-phantom-revenues-11552949891?tesla=y&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" in revenues that might not materialize. The estimate comes from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent bipartisan nonprofit.

Bank of Korea Sees Financial Imbalances Easing

Most Bank of Korea policy makers believe the country's financial imbalances have eased a bit following November's rate hike and alongside tighter mortgage rules, but that more time is needed to judge if wild household-debt growth is on a sustained slowdown, the minutes of last month's meeting show. The cautious stance suggests the central bank is keeping the option of further tightening, despite its dovish pause amid anemic growth and subdued inflation. The consensus view is that the central bank won't move rates this year. (Dow Jones Newswires)

Asian Central Banks Seen on Hold

Ahead of a busy central-bank week in Asia, Moody's Analytics is among those not expecting any change out of Thailand and Indonesia when their policy makers respectively meet on Wednesday and Thursday. Thailand lifted rates in December for the first time in seven years, but inflation should remain low, the firm says. None of the 11 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the Bank of Thailand to change rates at the meeting. As for Indonesia, which had a series of rate hikes last year as the rupiah slumped, Moody's says that central bank should be on hold all year so long as capital outflows don't resume.

New York Fed: Auto-Credit Applications Booking Aggressive Declines

Demand for auto loans is falling in a notable fashion. The New York Fed says in its February Credit Access Survey the application rate for auto credit reached a series low of 12.4% of respondents. But auto loans appeared to be a singularly bleak spot, as the survey finds the proportion of those who aim to apply for credit over the next year rose to 28% of respondents, up 5.4 percentage points from the same month in 2018. Some Fed officials have noted the economy has become broadly more credit sensitive, so the Fed's rate rises may be taking a bite out of the auto sector. (Michael S. Derby)

Cboe Abandons Bitcoin Futures

By Alexander Osipovich

The first U.S. exchange company to launch bitcoin futures has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cboe-abandons-bitcoin-futures-11552914001?tesla=y&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" on them, the latest sign that mainstream financial firms are losing their enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies.

Cboe Global Markets Inc. said in a notice to traders last week that it "does not currently intend to list additional XBT futures contracts for trading." XBT is the symbol for the bitcoin futures listed by Cboe.

Monthly futures contracts, such as XBT, expire every month and the exchange must keep listing new ones to keep the market going. Cboe's move means that the bitcoin-futures market it launched in 2017 will wind down once its last contract expires in June.

Cboe "is assessing its approach with respect to how it plans to continue to offer digital asset derivatives for trading," the notice said. A spokesman for Cboe declined to comment beyond what the company said in the notice.

Chicago-based Cboe which runs options, equities and futures exchanges introduced bitcoin futures with much fanfare in December 2017, during a frenzied run-up in the cryptocurrency. At the time of the launch, one bitcoin was worth nearly $17,000. On Friday, it was trading just below $4,000.

Trading volumes in Cboe's bitcoin futures have lagged behind those of its larger crosstown rival, CME Group Inc. On Thursday, the last trading day before Cboe's announcement came out, close to $90 million worth of CME's bitcoin futures changed hands, compared with around $8 million worth of Cboe's contracts, according to data from the two companies. CME also launched bitcoin futures in December 2017, a week after Cboe did.

As investor interest in bitcoin has cooled, Wall Street firms that had dipped their toes in digital currencies have also pulled back. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said early last year that it was planning a bitcoin trading desk, but the operation has yet to materialize.

Futures contracts allow traders to bet on whether the price of an asset will go up or down. When the first U.S. futures on bitcoin were launched in 2017, many of the digital currency's fans hailed the moves as a sign of the maturation of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Is in the Dumps, Spreading Gloom Over Crypto World

Bitcoin is in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-is-in-the-dumps-spreading-gloom-over-crypto-world-11552927208?tesla=y&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" of its 10-year history. That is forcing even its most ardent supporters to shelve dreams of global disruption and focus on simply tightening their belts long enough to outlast the downturn.

Signs of the crypto winter are everywhere, marking a sharp reversal since the manic highs of 2017. The price of bitcoin is about $4,000, down about 80% from a trading peak of about $19,800 in December 2017. The total market value of all cryptocurrencies outstanding is down 85% from its peak in January 2018. And volumes on the largest U.S. exchanges have been falling steadily for the past 15 months, according to research firm TradeBlock.

Bitcoin is still driven largely by momentum, and right now it doesn't have it. Cryptocurrencies have struggled to attract mainstream institutional investors. Regulation is still unclear, which has scared off some potential users. Companies that have sprung up around the crypto world are under pressure until the next upswing, and crypto fans aren't sure where that will come from or when.

To be fair, crypto markets have long been defined by choppiness. During part of 2011, the price of bitcoin dropped about 95%. The price also dropped 85% from December 2013 to January 2015, sparked by the shutdown of the Silk Road website, an online drug bazaar that used bitcoin, and problems at the teetering Mt. Gox trading exchange.

But the sector is much bigger than it was during some of those earlier swings, and it is closer than ever to becoming mainstream. Its influence today is widespread: Western governments have given it tacit or explicit acceptance and venture capitalists support it. Developers are finding ways to apply its underlying technology, blockchain, to fields as varied as supply-chain management and capital-markets trading.

"There's still coffee," said Eric Larchevque, CEO of Paris-based Ledger SAS, which makes crypto-storage products that resemble thumb drives, "but you don't have the extra nuts." The company has cut back on some costs, like for travel and advertising, he said, though it has avoided layoffs.

Companies Target Firms That Advise Shareholders

Companies want the firms that advise shareholders on proxy proposals "https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-target-firms-that-advise-shareholders-11552987800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" of their activities, a wish securities regulators are expected to act on as early as this spring.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to propose the first U.S. rules on proxy-advice companies following an organized campaign by public companies that think proxy-advisory firms have too much sway over shareholder proposals.

Lobbying and advocacy groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, and stock exchanges, such as the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, have mounted a well-funded offensive against the industry, which is dominated by two firms. The groups have purchased advertisements targeting proxy advisers, sponsored a Washington think-tank event and testified at multiple Senate committee hearings on the issue.

Corporations say the advisory firms which make recommendations to shareholders on how to vote on corporate governance issues have too much sway over corporate decision-making. Companies argue that they spend too much time and money fighting proposals they think would be detrimental to their overall performance.

"Proxy advisory firms are putting your 401K at risk," warns a website set up by the Chamber of Commerce and NAM to press policy makers to rein in the companies.

More than 300 companies, including Chevron Corp. , Boeing, and Yum Brands Inc., signed on to a February Nasdaq, Inc. letter calling for the SEC to take "strong action to regulate proxy advisory firms."

The push is aimed at proxy-advisory firms such as Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis & Co., which dominate the industry with a 97% market share. The firms say institutional investors rely on their research and recommendations to make informed decisions about how to vote their clients' shares.

"We're hopeful that to the extent any changes are made, that they're made with sensitivity to all the stakeholders," said Steven Friedman, ISS's general counsel.

Glass Lewis declined to comment. In a November 2018 letter to the SEC, Glass Lewis CEO Katherine Rabin said, "arguing that proxy advisers exert undue influence on investors is simply untrue."

The SEC began work on the issue last year, holding a roundtable on the corporate proxy process. It is expected to release a proposal on proxy advisers as early as this spring.

On Monday, SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman, who is leading the SEC's overhaul, said the commission should reassess whether asset managers need more guidance about how to use the services of proxy advisers. He also questioned whether it was appropriate for the SEC to exempt proxy advisers from some regulations on investment advice, including whether they can both advise a company and make recommendations to its shareholders at the same time.

Proxy advisory firms have been subject to increased scrutiny outside the U.S. in recent years. In 2015, Canadian securities regulators required a set of best practices for the firms following a similar effort in Europe in 2013.

Corporate groups are pushing the SEC to allow companies more leeway to address the firms' recommendations before they are sent to shareholders, a process that would also allow them to flag any errors in the recommendations. Some corporate groups, including NAM, want the SEC to consider new registration requirements for proxy advisers and add new disclosure requirements related to possible conflicts of interest.

"It's low hanging fruit that could help sustain the growth the economy has seen over the past several years," said Ed Knight, executive vice president at Nasdaq.

"Our experience has been that in most years &we seem to have at least some sort of concern with the accuracy of the numbers used in the reports, their reliability, and we're forced to go out to our shareholders to correct the report," said Rob Hays, chief strategy officer of Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc.

Braemar has been in a multiyear battle with ISS over board composition and other issues, Mr. Hays said. The company decided to speak out because of the amount of time and money spent each year battling proxy advisers.

Mr. Friedman, of ISS, said that claims about inaccuracies in recommendations are "overstated and misstated," and added that "there is ample opportunity for issuers to give counterpoints on proxy advisory opinion."

The SEC also is considering acting on another corporate boogeyman: shareholder proposals. The agency is looking at whether to raise the minimum ownership stake required to bring a matter up for a vote at a company's annual meeting. The SEC also is considering whether a proposal that doesn't attract much support can be resubmitted the following year.

Republican members of the agency have been critical of many of these shareholder proposals and the groups that support them, while Democratic members have defended them as a vital tool for shareholders.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in a March speech said many "environmental, social, and governance" proposals "promote a tiny group of shareholders' personal political and social preferences."

Goldman Sachs Implements Its Own  Rooney Rule' in Diversity Push

By Liz Hoffman

Managers at Goldman Sachs Group"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-implements-its-own-rooney-rule-in-diversity-push-11552938901?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" to interview two diverse candidates for any open job, a push the firm hopes will change its heavily white, male workforce.

The requirement is Wall Street's version of the "Rooney Rule," which requires National Football League teams to interview a minority candidate for head coaching jobs, and is part of new diversity targets Goldman rolled out Monday that include hiring more black and Hispanic employees.

The bank previously set a goal of 50% women in its 2021 class of incoming analysts, and said Monday it was nearly there.

The new targets, though, don't include a time frame, suggesting that racial imbalance is a tougher problem to solve.

The elite colleges that feed Wall Street's recruiting machine are now equally divided between men and women. But black and Hispanic students are still underrepresented, particularly in the finance and technology tracks from which big banks hire.

Goldman doesn't have a network of retail branches where employees tend to be more diverse and reflect their surrounding communities. And like all banks, it is adding engineers by the wagonload, an industry where women and some minority groups are less easily found.

A 2017 report by Bloomberg News found black representation was falling at Goldman, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on data submitted to the U.S. government.

Fewer than 20% of Goldman's 400-plus partners are women, and just a handful are black. Seven of the 30 executives on the firm's management committee are women, four of whom were added last year.

Citigroup Inc. aiming to have its pool of mid-to-senior-level employees be 40% women and 8% black by the end of 2021. The challenge is tougher in banks' highest ranks, where outside hiring is discretionary, positions tend not to be widely advertised and the competition for promotion is more cutthroat.

Goldman said Monday its recent push to bring in executives from outside the firm has hurt its diversity at senior levels. The bank has hired more than a dozen bankers as partners over the past two years, most of them white men.

Fidelity National Information Services to Buy Worldpay for $35 Billion

Fidelity National Information Services said it has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-national-information-services-to-buy-worldpay-for-35-billion-11552895935?tesla=y&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" Worldpay for about $35 billion in cash and stock. The deal would create a global giant in payments and back-office financial services in a bid to reach more customers as transactions move increasingly online.

The deal marks one of the biggest transactions in the fast-consolidating payments sector that is under pressure to cut costs, develop new products and add customers. It comes at a time of greater regulatory scrutiny and rising competition from technology startups that are squeezing fees. In 2017, Worldpay Group PLC, the predecessor company of Worldpay, was itself acquired by U.S. rival Vantiv Inc. for 8 billion ($10.6 billion).

For Fidelity National Information Services, widely known as FIS, the acquisition would also be by far its biggest bet since it acquired rival financial software company Sungard for $5.1 billion in cash and stock in 2015.

Under the deal, shareholders of Worldpay, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, will receive 0.9287 in FIS shares and $11.00 in cash for each share of Worldpay. That values Worldpay's shares at $112.12 each, representing a takeover premium of almost 14% to Worldpay's stock price based on Friday's closing prices for each company in New York, or a 32% premium to Worldpay's average price over the past three months.

FIS shareholders will own about 53% of the company and Worldpay shareholders will own about 47%.

The payments sector has seen a wave of new stock-market listings, strategic takeovers and private-equity buyouts in recent years after the traditional managers of payments, mainly retail banks, began to unload these operations and more small, technology driven startups started to appear. Earlier this year, U.S. technology and services company Fiserv agreed a $22 billion takeover of First Data, the U.S. payments group that is still part-owned by private-equity firm KKR & Co. Other deals in recent times include PayPal's $2.2 billion takeover of startup iZettle and private-equity buyouts of European groups Nets and Paysafe.

Shares in several European groups rose on Monday in expectation of more deals. One of the strongest risers in early trade was French Group Worldline. Its parent company, software group Atos, cut its stake to 23% from more than half in January to give Worldline more freedom to do deals in the sector.

Life & Arts: Can Social-Media Posts Drive Up Insurance Costs? --- Oversharers beware: Insurers, and not just friends, could be checking out your risky behavior

By Ellen Byron and Leslie Scism

Did you document your hair-raising rock-climbing trip on Instagram? Post happy-hour photos on Facebook? Or chime in on Twitter about riding a motorcycle with no helmet? One day, such sharing could push up your life-insurance premiums.

In January, New York became the first state to provide guidance for how life insurers may use algorithms to comb through social-media posts -- as well as data such as credit scores and home-ownership records -- to size up an applicant's risk. The guidance comes amid expectations that within years, social media may be among the data reviewed before issuing life insurance as well as policies for cars and property.

New York set a high bar, requiring insurers to prove that any social-media data used in underwriting is actuarially justified, logical for use and doesn't unfairly discriminate against certain customers.

"We're going through a period now where most life insurers are exploring using all types of data, not just data they get directly from the customer proactively, but other external sources of data -- social media being a big one," said Ari Libarikian, a senior partner at McKinsey & Co. in New York.

He anticipates that someday, underwriters will assess potential customers with automated reports based in part on their social-media use. "It's here to some degree, and it's coming in the next couple of years," Mr. Libarikian said.

Here, insurance and data experts offer insight and advice:

If I post photos of potentially risky behavior, will my life-insurance premiums go up?

The time and effort to monitor an applicant's online presence can be costly, so few if any insurers are doing it yet in detail or at scale, says Jacques van Niekerk, chief executive of Wunderman Data, a unit of WPP Group. To spend resources figuring out that a policyholder went to Saint-Tropez and paraglided without a helmet for purposes of boosting a premium rate "could be bad and misguided," he said.

What should I avoid posting on social media?

Given how digital histories can linger, people should go easy on photos of risky behavior such as smoking and instead play up boasts about healthy activities, like recent cycling trips or marathons, said Mike Vogt. He is executive director of data and analytics for SPR, a firm whose services include using artificial intelligence and social-media accounts to help insurers process claims.

"Paragliding, ice-climbing, riding a motorcycle while drinking a beer: They are a little over the top, but honestly, I've been surprised at what people post," he said. "That history never goes away, even if you remove the post a few hours later."

Could my digital habits help my insurance costs go down?

Some life and car insurers are exploring whether consumers will share real-time health or driving data. Remember, a life insurer who took blood and urine samples already knows a lot about the customer. To develop friendly relationships, some insurers are offering perks like gift cards in exchange for reaching milestones in exercise and providing details about sleep. "If you live a healthy life, why not share that?" Mr. van Niekerk said.

However, such sharing isn't for everyone and some privacy experts caution against trading personal data for perks.

In the future, social-media data and other information sources could make life insurance cheaper and less of a hassle to secure. "What if you didn't have to go to the doctor and give blood?" Mr. Libarikian said.

On the car-insurance side, many people are using mobile apps that track their driving habits, such as how often they slam on the brakes. "Consumers are going to get more and more benefits offered to them -- like reduced premiums or better risk advice," Mr. Libarikian said, "if they share some of their data on social media or elsewhere."

How are insurers using social-media data right now?

Some insurers are using social media in handling claims. Insurers can check explanations of auto claims against Facebook testimonials about an accident. And they could challenge disability claims if photos posted from a ski trip, for example, contradict a claim of impairment or illness.

What is holding back the use of social media in underwriting?

The technology to study individuals' social-media accounts to make underwriting decisions is underdeveloped but likely inevitable, consultants and data scientists say. "We know that underwriting is the next big thing" to mine online postings, SPR's Mr. Vogt said.

But until and unless the technology is perfected, it generally isn't cost-efficient for insurers to assign staff to look at Facebook pages and tweets. Verifying identifications on social media, tracking oft-changing accounts and converting the information into usable, predictive data isn't yet scalable or cost-effective, companies said.

Also, insurers aren't yet confident that information from social media is better than traditional sources, such as answers to questions on applications, prescription-drug databases and blood and urine samples -- though ultimately it could be easier and cheaper to get.

Do privacy settings help?

Yes, industry consultants say. Review the privacy settings on each social-media account, making sure posts are shared only among your selected network. Untag yourself from photos other people post, and ask friends not to tag you in the first place.

Ultimately, though, experts warn that if you lead an unhealthy life, your insurance company will figure it out the old-fashioned way, by asking questions and taking blood and urine samples.

Banks Turn to AI to Help Customers Juggle Expenses; New tool would alert customers when they're low on cash and suggest which bills can be delayed

Corrections & Amplifications

Digital Federal Credit Union is headquartered in Massachusetts. The story incorrectly named Moven Enterprise as Moven Enterprises. The article said that Moven was a startup and developed MySpend. Moven was founded in 2008 and developed the technology that TD Bank has branded TD MySpend. Moven sells the technology to other customers. (March 14, 2019)

Credit unions and community banks are looking to tap artificial intelligence to help their customers juggle bills, budget expenses and manage their finances.

Customers have long been able to put off paying a bill and transfer funds between accounts when money is short at the end of the month. But that could require bypassing an autopay system and coordinating with other due bills, which is laborious and time-consuming.

Such end-arounds could soon be automated through artificial-intelligence technology. Several credit unions and community banks plan to introduce a new digital tool that will alert customers when they're low on cash, suggest which bills can be delayed, and recommend other steps to manage their finances.

Digital Federal Credit Union in Massachusetts, Suncoast Credit Union in Florida and Woodforest National Bank in Texas have signed on with financial-technology startup Payrailz LLC. The three-year-old Massachusetts company offers a digital payment system that uses AI's predictive abilities to anticipate customers' cash-flow problems, assess which bills are coming due and suggest steps to get through the month.

Credit unions and community banks, with smaller budgets and an emphasis on personal services, have lagged behind large corporate banks in adopting emerging technologies, said Daniel Latimore, chief research officer at Celent, the Boston-based research firm.

The Payrailz service will function as a personal financial assistant and make budgeting suggestions that a customer can authorize through an app.

"Our platform recommends: Here's the action you should take and let us take care of it for you," Payrailz Chief Executive Fran Duggan said. "We're not taking any action without the member's approval."

One challenge for Payrailz, a company with 30 employees, is consolidating a customer's financial data from such disparate sources as credit cards, checks and share payments so that the information can be analyzed through machine learning and natural language processing.

For example, Payrailz initially won't be able to connect customers' credit-union accounts with their bank accounts to fully coordinate financial profiles, said Ted Hassenfelt, chief information officer at Suncoast Credit Union. Suncoast, the largest credit union in Florida, is testing Payrailz and expects to release it to its 815,000 customers within two months.

Another challenge is a scarcity of the information that is needed for AI, which becomes increasingly accurate as it is fed more data. Payrailz solves that problem by having credit-union customers manually enter their bank and credit-card accounts, bill due dates and other financial details into the Payrailz system, but the information also populates itself as customers engage in financial transactions.

"We want to get everything on the platform and then let them work their AI magic," Mr. Hassenfelt said. "I think it'll completely redefine the way you make payments. It removes a lot of friction from the user experience."

For the credit union, on the other hand, its challenge was establishing the trust it needed to work with a startup. Mr. Hassenfelt said he met with Payrailz officers and investors to gain assurance the company was committed to its clients and not looking to sell or at some other exit strategy.

Just 4% of banks and credit unions rank AI as their top priority, according to a January report by Celent, while 17% rank AI as a second priority. Among the biggest banks, with at least $50 billion in assets, AI initiatives were a first or second priority for 29% of the institutions, according to Daniel Latimore, Celent's head of retail banking.

AI already is changing the customer experience for bank customers, said Tiffani Montez, a senior analyst at research firm Aite Group.

In October, Bank of America introduced new personalized features for Erica, an AI-enabled virtual financial assistant. Erica can now provide a weekly snapshot of spending for the month, flag coming bills and charges, track monthly changes to FICO credit scores, and send alerts for coming due dates for BofA credit-card payments.

In addition, Moven Enterprise, a New York technology company, developed a mobile financial tool that tracks spending and cash flow and instantly updates a customer's financial profile. Moven sold the technology to TD Bank, which branded the tool TD MySpend. Westpac Banking Corp. also has bought the tool.

Payrailz also offers a consumer advocacy feature through a partnership with Boston-based Billshark, a service that assesses whether someone is paying too much for their wireless or cable bill, and assists in bill negotiation and subscription cancellation, Mr. Duggan said.

Payrailz is backed by banks including SunTrust Banks Inc., Webster Bank and Woodforest National Bank, and venture investors including First Data Corp., LiveOak Venture Partners and TTV Capital.

Few rifts in the world of mutual funds are as pronounced as the one dividing advocates of active management from those of index, or passive, investing.

For years, the flow of new assets, reflecting investor preferences, has tilted more to low-cost index and exchange-traded funds than to active funds.

Index funds have boomed in the decades since their introduction by the late John Bogle because they capture the returns of entire markets and so eliminate the "middleman," the stock-picking fund manager, with his trading costs and fees. When markets rise over time, the passive camp says, it only dilutes one's profits to pay premiums for managers who mostly, in any given year, fail to outperform the indexes of the markets in which they specialize.

But active management's supporters say the game has changed in recent years. Many active managers have had to lower their fees to remain competitive. And proponents believe that the reduced gap in expenses in many cases is more than justified by the expertise some managers offer especially in these volatile times.

Martijn Cremers, a dean and professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame and a consultant to investment management firms, argues in favor of active management. Rick Ferri, a financial analyst, investment adviser and industry consultant, argues on behalf of passive investing.

YES: Lower fees and rising volatility make active management more competitive

Now is the time for actively managed funds, as long as they are truly active. The explosion in passive investing in recent years has led many active managers to lower their fees, making their services more affordable. Active management takes advantage of mispriced securities, and in the process mitigates the mispricing. Thus with fewer active managers there are more opportunities to find mispricings. And, for portfolios stuffed with passive products, active management provides critical diversification in this time of heightened volatility.

Recent academic evidence challenges the conventional wisdom that active management typically does not generate value for investors. New research repeatedly shows that active managers have performed better than many people realize, as I and my co-authors concluded in a recent survey "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247356" which considered the findings of more than 200 research papers. In particular, improved methodology and more data show that the typical active fund manager has skill and does not underperform after fees.

Broad generalizations of active funds, like comparisons of the average performance of large-cap active funds and an S&P 500 index fund, are noisy and do not lead to any strong conclusions. Rather than using the average performance of actively managed funds as a basis of comparison, as critics like to do, more-detailed distinctions among active funds lead to insights with more statistical confidence. A "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247356" I co-wrote introduced active share, the proportion of a fund's holdings that differs from the fund's benchmark, to distinguish between truly active funds and those closely matching their benchmark indexes. We found that when active funds have holdings that significantly overlap with their benchmarks with active shares below 70% they tended to underperform their passive benchmarks. In contrast, high-active-share funds did not underperform after fees.

Fees matter, especially for funds with lower active share. Active funds earn back their fees by being distinct from the market that is, through the active share of their portfolio that differs from their benchmark holdings. My main advice is to avoid funds with active share below 70% unless they have low annual fees (say below 60 basis points).

On the other hand, funds with high active share and patient strategies have outperformed their benchmarks after fees in the long run. As it is hard to be patient in today's impatient world, the combination of patient and high-active-share investing requires substantial conviction and trust. But high conviction acts like a constraint preventing too much capital from flowing into such strategies and diluting results.

(I make my academic data on active share and manager patience for U.S. equity funds freely available on my website "http://activeshare.info".)

Active management also provides protection in volatile markets. Indexed products tend to be highly correlated with markets, and with each other. Active managers, by contrast, can provide not only useful diversification but also increased downside protection. A "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12084" published in 2013 in the Journal of Finance introduced methodology to find the 25% of active fund managers who perform well no matter how the market is doing. These managers do well at stock picking during booms and at market timing during recessions, significantly outperforming other active funds and passive benchmarks.

Critics of active management like to cite what Alan Greenspan said in 1998 about the folly of attempting to build "a better mousetrap that could consistently extract abnormal returns from the financial markets." Mr. Greenspan was referring to the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, which used active management. But LTCM was overly dependent on leverage and thus sensitive to collateral or liquidity constraints. Many active managers follow prudent strategies without high leverage or collateral/liquidity constraints. Truly active funds with high-conviction strategies help investors in the long run.

NO: Despite fee cuts, history is on the side of passive investing

Active managers don't get smarter when markets become volatile. They don't pick better stocks, they don't time markets better and their fees are not lower. In fact, the fees go higher.

Will active managers outperform in 2019? I can't answer that question. But history doesn't put the odds in their favor.

I compared the returns of actively managed mutual funds in the Morningstar large-cap-blend category against the Vanguard 500 Index Fund from 1979 through 2018. During any given year over the past 40 years, the Vanguard fund, which tracks the S&P 500 index, held the advantage about 60% of the time. In 10 of those years, stock prices declined; the Vanguard fund outperformed in half of those years, and active management won the other half. In the most recent three years when prices fell, the Vanguard fund outperformed in each year. Hardly a reason to switch to active management now.

Single years are interesting but not the whole story. Based on the latest S&P Dow Jones Indices SPIVA U.S. Scorecard, which compares returns of indexing versus active management, the return of the S&P 500 floated higher over time due to the benefit of compounding. Over a five-year period, the S&P 500 outperformed 80% of its active peers, and over a 10-year period it outperformed 90%.

While it is true that index-fund fees have forced down active-management fees, active management is still 10 times more expensive than low-cost, passive-index investing, which drags down the return on the active funds. Meanwhile, even with lower fees, the number of active managers outperforming has not changed. And when you dig into the managers that have outperformed, it isn't the lower-cost active managers. The ones who have outperformed have medium costs.

If anything positive can be said about active funds during past periods of poor market return and higher volatility, it's that managers raise cash out of necessity for shareholder redemptions. I do not consider raising cash for redemptions as skilled market timing, though it can provide a small cushion in poor market years. But this doesn't happen in every bear market. During 2008, the worst year for stock prices in 50 years, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund still outperformed its peer group.

There are many studies that claim some active managers have some skills when measured in unique highly quantitative methods that individual investors do not use or consider. The information might be useful for large institutions that are looking for niche coverage, but it's not useful for individual investors who compare performance to known market benchmarks.

There will always be active managers who outperform. No one is disputing that. What isn't known is which ones will outperform in the future and by how much. That cannot be known. In the long run, most active underperformers lag by a bigger margin than the few outperformers win by. So, you take big risks for little gain.

Has anything changed in 2019? Factor funds, which use algorithms to select securities based on market trends, may lower active-management costs, and this may tilt the odds. Or perhaps there is hope in new artificial-intelligence funds. I'm always skeptical. Every time I hear, "This time it's different", I think of Alan Greenspan testifying before Congress in 1998 after the failure of Long-term Capital Management:

"This decade is strewn with examples of bright people who thought they built a better mousetrap that could consistently extract abnormal returns from the financial markets. Some succeed for a time. But while there may occasionally be misconfigurations among market prices that allow abnormal returns, they do not persist."

Indexing isn't perfect all the time, but it has beaten active management over time. There's no reason to believe this will change in 2019 or beyond.

Good day. Madness. That's what many observers have said about the idea of virtual-reality entertainment as a viable consumer market.

Now madness of another kind is at hand: March Madness. The annual tradition of the NCAA national basketball tournament returns this week. And for people who are serious fans of college hoops as well as a little curious about VR and sports, there will be virtual madness.

CBS and its broadcast partners will provide live VR coverage of the tournament for people using Oculus and Gear VR headsets. If this experience is as compelling as some critics have suggested, this could mean a lot more excitement about home VR possibilities. And a lot more madness, too.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Seed to weed: A new chapter is taking shape for a once-taboo slice of the venture ecosystem.

The presence of three cannabis businesses in Y Combinator's cohort of roughly 200 startups signals a shift in Silicon Valley.

Until now, major venture-capital firms eschewed the "plant-touching" category, betting instead on startups that don't actually handle marijuana crops or processed plants.

Venture-backed companies such as Eaze Solutions LLC, an online marketplace for cannabis products not funded by Y Combinator, have been the model for VC firms whose charters barred them from backing "plant-touching" businesses.

"We are definitely plant-touching, and most big-name investors are still scared of that," said cannabis distributor Nabis LLC Chief Executive Vince Ning. "YC is the first one that took that bet." WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

Ready for Lyft-off: Lyft Inc. plans to peg its valuation at between $21 billion and $23 billion when the ride-hailing service kicks off the roadshow to market its initial public offering Monday, according to people familiar with the matter.

The range, equating to between $62 and $68 a share, is preliminary and could change by the time the shares start trading around the end of next week, the people said.

Lyft plans to raise up to $2.09 billion in the offering, according to an amended prospectus filed Monday morning.

A final IPO price will be based on feedback from investors in the roadshow. The WSJ's Maureen Farrell has the exclusive.

Street duty: As Andreessen Horowitz gets ready for Lyft to go public, another one of its portfolio companies is following suit.

PagerDuty Inc., which helps companies manage their web operations, has unveiled its paperwork to hold an initial public offering.

Andreessen Horowitz is the company's largest shareholder, owning 18.4%. Accel is next at 12.3%, followed by Bessemer Venture Partners with 12.2%.

San Francisco-based PagerDuty has raised about $173 million in private capital since it was founded in 2009 and was valued at $1.3 billion in a funding round last year. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the story.

Gormley's Take: In Biotech IPOs, Former Danger Signal is Now Sign of Strength

By Brian Gormley

Biotech IPO buyers once viewed heavy insider participation with suspicion a sign the company can't attract new investors. Now they see it as an endorsement.

Instead of depending on venture capitalists, more entrepreneurs also are bringing public-market investors into venture rounds.

Last year, insiders purchased shares in 77% of health-care IPOs, which were predominantly biotech stock sales, according to law firm Proskauer Rose LLP. Existing investors bought shares in 25% of all other IPOs.

"The market has become much more comfortable seeing insiders purchasing a higher percentage," said Daniel Forman, an attorney who advises Proskauer clients on IPOs and other deals. "If you were to see that five and definitely 10 years ago, it would have been a red flag."

Sports media and technology platform Minute Media acquired The Big Lead, a digital sports and news publication, for an undisclosed sum. New York- and Tel Aviv-based Minute Media is backed by investors including Battery Ventures, Dawn Capital, Gemini Ventures, Goldman Sachs, Qumra Capital, Remagine Ventures and Vintage Investments.

VC Funds

Accel has raised about $2.5 billion for three new funds, including $525 million for Accel XIV LP, $500 million for Accel Leaders Fund II LP and $1.5 billion for Accel Growth Fund V LP. WSJ Pro previously wrote about Accel raising the funds.

Mortgage Providers Look to AI to Process Home Loans Faster; The technology is speedier than manually processing mortgage applications, but some worry it also is more prone to errors

The home loan industry is looking to artificial intelligence to shorten the wait times for a mortgage approval, from a month or more to a tolerable week or two.

A speedy loan turnaround not only moves capital for banks and investors; it also reduces the reliance on costly human labor.

"Mortgages take forever to close," said Al Pascual, senior vice president of research at Javelin Strategy & Research in Pleasanton, Calif. "If they can cut a week off the mortgage process, that's meaningful."

The industry took a step in that direction last month, when Ellie Mae Inc., a major player in home loans, started offering an AI option to its 3,000 customers banks and other lenders to speed-read mortgage applications for accuracy and completeness.

Ellie Mae, a Pleasanton-based software and services company that processes about 40% of all U.S. home mortgage applications, selected an AI technology developed by Wakefield, Mass.-based home loan data automation outfit AI Foundry.

"They will market their services directly to our customers," said Joe Tyrrell, Ellie Mae's executive vice president for strategy and technology.

While AI is light years faster than people in reading documents, human loan analysts will be necessary to manually validate the loan documents that intelligent machine can't decipher. And in the home-loan business, there will never be a shortage of crumpled, corrupted or esoteric documents.

Ellie Mae's loan platform makes sure the loan packet is complete and properly filled out, so that lenders can act on it. The company has been using automation to read credit reports, title reports and home appraisals, which are submitted by institutions and come in standardized formats.

The average loan takes 52 days to process, but Ellie Mae has been able to reduce that to 30 days, Mr. Tyrrell said. The company hopes to reduce that to 10 days by further harnessing AI, he said.

But the loan industry has been constrained by a missing link in its AI initiatives: reading personal documents submitted by home buyers. These include W2 forms, pay stubs, tax forms, divorce decrees, bank statements and other documents that validate the buyer's finances. Many of these documents are irregular and have been more difficult to automate.

AI Foundry's technology, called Agile Mortgages Solution, currently is being used by about a dozen banks and lenders, said Steve Butler, the company's founder and general manager. It takes less than five minutes to read several hundred pages of documents that a human would need an hour to slog through, he said.

"The mortgage industry is ripe for this because it is so document intensive," Mr. Butler said. AI Foundry is a three-year-old business unit of Kodak Alaris Holdings Ltd.

Still, the system also needs some human help. Users have to train the AI to recognize when it can't read a loan document, or to ask for help when its confidence level is shaky, so that a person can intervene.

Mortgage processing takes so long in large part because lenders must comply with safeguards established after the subprime mortgage crisis and 2007-09 recession, said Craig Focardi, a senior analyst in the banking practice of Boston-based research firm Celent.

Problematic paperwork is a concern for more than just regulators. Institutional investors who buy the bundled loans on the secondary market are aggressive about spotting defects in documents on loans that have defaulted.

"The big risk is being told by someone who bought the [defaulted] loan that now you have to buy it back," Mr. Tyrrell said. "The investor can look at the documents for anything that was missed. There's a lot at stake if the [originating lenders] get it wrong."

Mr. Butler said the mortgage papers come in as "one huge PDF, all connected." So Agile Mortgages must first learn how to identify, separate and classify the incoming documents. Then AI has to read the files, extract the relevant data from the appropriate line or box, and enter it into the bank's system.

One of the first AI Foundry customers, Radius Financial Group Inc. in Norwell, Mass., has been using Agile Mortgages since 2017. Keith Polaski, chief operating officer at Radius, said it took about six months to train the AI on three years of mortgage applications, spanning 180 different types of documents. After 20 months of ingesting data, Agile Mortgages has improved its accuracy rate to about 85% from 40% of documents it can recognize and read correctly, Mr. Polaski said.

Humans are about 97% accurate, based on industry data. Mr. Butler said the ultimate goal for Agile Mortgages is to match human performance. Mr. Polaski said it is only a matter of time until Agile Mortgages is so reliable it will be able to approve and issue some portion of home loans without human assistance.

The volume of paperwork Agile Mortgages can process in one year for Radius is equivalent to the labor of 10 loan analysts performing 6,500 hours of work, at a combined cost of $227,500, for classification and indexing. Agile Mortgages has "freed them up by two hours per day to do human brain power things," Mr. Polaski said.

AI won't attain perfection anytime soon. Radius doesn't train Agile Mortgages on about 50 types of mortgage documents that are so uncommon they will always have to be handled manually, Mr. Polaski said. They include payout verifications from wills, insurance, lotteries and casinos.

ANALYSIS STANDARD LIFE ABERDEEN

ACTIVE MANAGEMENT Co-leadership is axed but group's problems show no sign of abating

M artin Gilbert's decision to step down as cochief executive of Standard Life Aberdeen last week ended one of the longest reigns in European asset management.

After setting up Aberdeen Asset Management in 1983 and merging it with Standard Life in 2017, Mr Gilbert is now vice-chairman of the group and chairs its investment division. Keith Skeoch, who led Standard Life into the merger, is sole chief executive.

But the change, which followed shortly after the arrival of Douglas Flint as chairman, will do little to appease shareholders. Since the merger their paper losses, taking into account the 1.3bn returned to shareholders, are 36 per cent.

One investor said the announcement was "delusional" and "depressing" for shareholders. He said: "The market wants both to go ... and [to see] an external appointment."

Two shareholders that were big backers of the merger have given up on the project, which analysts viewed as a defensive tie-up of midsized active managers that were struggling to compete against passive funds.

Lloyds Banking Group owned 9.9 per cent of Aberdeen before the union but sold its final stake in June after a quarrel over a 109bn investment mandate. Arbitration in that dispute should conclude this month.

SLA's biggest investor, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation of Japan, offloaded its stake five weeks ago. It had once owned 19.9 per cent of Aberdeen.

The loss of these two Aberdeen investors harmed Mr Gilbert's claim to the throne. His roles outside SLA had also raised eyebrows. Last year he took leave of absence from the board of Glencore, the miner, after violating UK governance rules on "overboarding" directors holding too many posts. At the time he was deputy chairman of Sky and coordinating its sale to Comcast. After leaving Sky, he resumed his job at Glencore. Giving up the role of co-chief executive at SLA has freed time for Mr Gilbert to take other positions. Last week Revolut, the digital bank facing questions over how it is managing its rapid growth, named him as an adviser to chief executive Nikolay Storonsky.

Mr Gilbert has other non-corporate roles and may add to his job portfolio as he nears retirement.

Overboarding is a controversial issue and several large shareholders including BlackRock, SLA's biggest, and Norway's sovereign wealth fund, a top-20 holder increasingly take a hard line.

While Mr Gilbert's jobs caused controversy, the issue did not affect Mr Skeoch, whose only significant position outside SLA is on the board of the soon-to-be-defunct Financial Reporting Council.

Meanwhile, shareholders resent Mr Gilbert's financial package in his new positions at SLA. His base salary will stay at 600,000 while his bonus potential is cut to 350 per cent from 600 per cent. "Gilbert staying on doing what he does and getting paid [that amount] is incredible," a shareholder said.

At the same time SLA's problems show no sign of abating. It had been hoped the merger would staunch outflows from flagship products, especially Standard Life's multi-asset Global Absolute Return Strategies (Gars) product and Aberdeen's emerging market equity funds, but redemptions accelerated as poor performance continued.

SLA bled a net 40.9bn in 2018, equivalent to 7 per cent of its assets at the start of the year, with most of the money flowing from equity and multi-asset funds.

The exodus of money affected revenues, and pre-tax profits for the group's core asset management business, excluding its stake in insurer Phoenix Group and joint ventures, fell by 15 per cent last year.

Industry observers expect outflows from the flagship products to continue. Gars in particular is challenged by the market environment, which has also taken a toll on rival absolute return products offered by Aviva Investors and Invesco.

After SLA announced its 2018 results last week, Mr Gilbert said the coming months would be a "tough time for asset management", adding: "We need to weather the storm."

Mr Skeoch said SLA was "working hard to deliver what is within our control". The company is investing in new asset classes, such as private markets; it launched 32 funds last year and made four bolt-on acquisitions.

SLA is also trying to improve performance, notably by implementing a new suite of risk-analytics tools and an integrated research platform. It is unclear how successful these efforts will be in the medium term. Analysts doubt SLA will be able to turn around the flagship products' performance or seed strategies that will quickly replace them as a revenue source. "It's a managed decline for the next few years, " says one analyst, speaking anonymously.

Gordon Aitken, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, notes that the My Folio multi-asset retail product has been successful but comes nowhere near to rivalling Gars, which at its peak managed 48bn.

Another lever SLA can pull is cost cuts. The company has already delivered most of the 350m annualised savings it promised as part of the merger and made 56m worth of extra cuts last year.

Yet these go only so far. As SLA's asset base falls, it will have to slash harder to make a difference.

Mr Aitken says SLA lost from the sale of its insurance business to Phoenix last year. SLA retains a 20 per cent stake in Phoenix and said in its results that it benefited from changes the insurer made to life expectancy assumptions.

RBC estimates that half the assumption changes were in the business acquired from SLA. "If SLA had continued to own [the insurance business] it would have benefited from 50 per cent of these rather than 20 per cent," says Mr Aitken.

SLA has begun to offload stakes in other side-businesses, such as HDFC, its Indian life insurance company. If it sells these entities in their entirety, it could invest the proceeds in its core business. Shareholders will watch with interest.

It is delusional and it is depressing. The market wants both to go ... and to see an external appointment MAJOR INVESTOR

The coming months will be a tough time for the industry ... we need to weather the storm MARTIN GILBERT

EXCHANGE --- Volume Soars Amid 'Quad Witching'

By Asjylyn Loder

Friday was the busiest trading day so far this year.

The session marked a quarterly collision that traders call "quad witching," when equity and index futures and options expire. Adding to the fun, dozens of S&P indexes, including the popular S&P 500, were scheduled to rebalance their holdings at the end of the day.

That means exchange-traded funds and other index traders needed to realign their portfolios to match their updated benchmarks, buying companies that were added and selling stocks that dropped out. By some estimates, ETFs needed to complete $100 billion in combined buying and selling.

"It's one of the five biggest rebalancing days of the year," said Josh Lukeman, a managing director at Credit Suisse.

Index changes often drive heavy trading volumes, especially at the end of the day, because portfolio managers want to make sure they achieve the same performance as their benchmark. When FTSE Russell's widely followed stock indexes rebalanced in June, a record 1.2 billion shares, worth more than $39 billion, traded in less than one second in Nasdaq's closing auction. At the time, $9.2 trillion were pegged to Russell benchmarks.

Heavy trading doesn't necessarily mean major price moves. The changes are broadcast well in advance, and traders and index funds have ample time to prepare. Major indexes started Friday with small gains and then drifted higher throughout much of the afternoon, buoyed by rallying technology shares.

The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to close at a fresh high for 2019, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.8%. Both indexes posted weekly gains, with analysts attributing some of the moves to bets that central banks will suspend monetary tightening while they gauge the softening across the global economy.

It was a sharp contrast from Dec. 21 quad witching, when the index dropped more than 2%. On Friday, more than 10.4 billion shares traded, the most since then. Volume was 37% above the 60-day average.

"It tends to be quite orderly," Mr. Lukeman said.

In September, quad witching coincided with major changes to several popular ETFs pegged to sector indexes. S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc. reclassified tech companies including Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. into a new "communication-services" segment. The move affected 23 S&P companies worth a combined $2.7 trillion.

For ETFs, conforming to these index changes might look to investors like a surge in new money piling into certain ETFs, followed a few days later by that same amount of money coming right back out. Such fund flows look a lot like the peaks and valleys on an electrocardiogram, earning them the nickname "heartbeat flows."

In the week leading up to last year's March witching, U.S. ETFs raised $45 billion, a weekly record. Some analysts mistook it as a sign that bullish sentiment had returned to the U.S. stock market. But more than half of the money came back out again within days.

For example, BlackRock Inc.'s iShares Select Dividend ETF saw a record single-day inflow of $3.6 billion on March 15, 2018, according to FactSet. The money came back out on March 19. There were similar flow patterns for the iShares Core S&P Small Cap ETF, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF.

The ebbs and flows of cash offer a window into the behind-the-scenes mechanics of ETFs. Called "kickers" or "friendlies," these sizable trades are typically arranged between portfolio managers and some of the largest market makers on the street, often big banks that are comfortable tying up billions of dollars over several days.

The trades serve a twofold purpose. First, portfolio managers use them to realign the ETF's holdings with any changes in the underlying index. Second, they help the fund shed shares that might otherwise trigger a taxable gain.

But the trades come at a cost, said Elisabeth Kashner, head of ETF research and analytics at FactSet. Traders get ahead of coming index changes, and can drive up the price of stocks being added to the index and depress prices of the deletions, she said. To match the closing price on index-rebalancing day, funds are forced to buy high and sell low. The risk is low for big, heavily traded stocks but can be significant in smaller, thinly traded markets. Ms. Kashner estimated that the rebalance trade of one ETF last year cost the fund's investors 0.06%.

"Rebalances are not free," Ms. Kashner said. The cost is largely invisible to investors, since the fund matched its index, she said. Moreover, it is usually well worth it. "To the average investor in a taxable account, the cost that they give up in slippage is a pittance in comparison to what they're saving in tax liability."

Group s problems show no sign of abating after controversial co-leadership is axed

Martin Gilbert s decision to step down as co-chief executive of Standard Life Aberdeen this week ended one of the longest reigns in European asset management.

Good day. A coming wave of tech IPOs means a lot to the early investors and employees of the companies going public.

It's also shaping up as a huge potential source of revenue for the city of San Francisco, home to the likes of Lyft Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc.

City officials are scrambling to size up what kind impact the city should expect when there's a sudden minting of thousands of new millionaires. But that could be just the beginning. Collecting a tax on people's stock options is a popular idea among some San Franciscans who want to fund more affordable housing in a city famous for its sky-high prices.

At least one local politician, city Supervisor Gordon Mar, is investigating the possibility. Maybe San Francisco will get a cut of some of the year's biggest deals.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Foreigners' funds reconsidered: Startups are used to having ready access to foreign capital. Now they are learning to examine fundraising sources more closely, as Chinese investments come under increased scrutiny in the U.S.

Concern that Chinese investment in U.S. companies could pose a national-security threat prompted lawmakers last year to boost the government's authority to block transactions involving foreign firms.

Among the newly identified technologies that could be under scrutiny are biotech, artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics.

Startups in certain cases must now declare their intention to fundraise from foreign investors 45 days before the deal closes or face fines of up to the value of the investment.

So far, Chinese investment in U.S. startups has held up, according to a new report from research firm Rhodium Group. But that could change. The rules are yet to be fully implemented. And some entrepreneurs say they would think twice before fundraising from Chinese firms.

Says Ray Rothrock, chief executive of cybersecurity startup RedSeal Inc.: "I'd be smart about it. It doesn't necessarily stop people from doing things, but it is part of the conversation for how you capitalize [a] new business." WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has the story.

Change at Tiger Global: A top venture and private-equity player is losing its leader. Lee Fixel is leaving Tiger Global Management LLC after a 13-year run.

Mr. Fixel, head of the group's private-equity and growth investing, is staying until June 30, according to the New York-based firm.

He will be replaced by Scott Shleifer, who co-founded the firm's private-equity arm.

In recent years, Tiger Global's investments include Postmates Inc., Stripe Inc. and Coinbase Inc. The firm closed a $3.75 billion investment fund last fall.

Delivery Wars, the recap: This week the WSJ's "Delivery Wars" series examined the promise and the problems surrounding the push to automate and otherwise digitize deliveries from restaurants and grocers. In case you missed it, here is each installment:

Industry News

Leonardo DiCaprio, the Oscar-winning actor and environmental activist, is taking on a different kind of supporting role as an adviser to growth-equity firm Princeville Capital. The 44-year old actor, who is also known for his environmental advocacy work, will become a senior adviser to Princeville Capital's new unit that targets investments in technology companies that seek to address climate change. Princeville is seeking $150 million for a new climate technology fund, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the fund is expected to reach $250 million or more, according to people familiar with the offering.

Private-equity firm TPG ousted William McGlashan Jr., founder of its growth investment unit and head of the firm's impact investment team, on Thursday after he was charged in this week's wide-ranging criminal college admissions scandal. TPG said Mr. McGlashan's firing is effective immediately.

As Andreessen Horowitz gets ready for Lyft Inc. to go public, another one of its portfolio companies is following suit.

PagerDuty Inc., which helps companies manage their web operations, has "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568100/000162828019003003/pagerdutys-1.htm#s45F12E1F6A26E3F58749AD9664B34102" to hold an initial public offering.

Andreessen Horowitz is the company's largest shareholder, owning 18.4%. Accel is next at 12.3%, followed by Bessemer Venture Partners with 12.2%.

San Francisco-based PagerDuty has raised about $173 million in private capital since it was founded in 2009 and was valued at $1.3 billion in a funding round last year.

PagerDuty posted a loss of $38.1 million on revenue of $79.6 million in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2018, according to its prospectus, which didn't include results for the year-earlier period.

The company reported results for the first nine months of its most recent fiscal year, showing that its revenue grew 48% to $84 million from $56.6 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. Losses widened to $34.5 million from $29.8 million.

In its filing, PagerDuty said it seeks to raise $100 million, a placeholder amount that is subject to change.

PagerDuty says it works with scores of Fortune 500 companies to manage digital security, information technology and customer support with more than 10,000 clients including Slack Technologies Inc., Okta Inc. and Box Inc.

Jennifer Tejada took the helm of the company in 2016, becoming one of the enterprise software sector's few female chief executives. She previously served as CEO at cloud-analytics specialist Keynote Systems Inc., which was acquired by Dynatrace LLC in 2015.

The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PD.

Banking & Finance: Leveraged Oil ETFs Are Lucrative but Risky

By Asjylyn Loder

Oil funds that use leverage to juice returns have been among the top-performing exchange-traded funds of 2019, gaining almost 90%.

Yet investors have pulled $325 million from the two biggest exchange-traded products that seek to double or triple the daily return of U.S. crude futures contracts, a sign there is more than meets the eye in this obscure and risky market.

Part of the reason is that profiting from leveraged exchange-traded products is harder than it looks.

The products are pitched as tools for daily trading and can be disastrous for buy-and-hold investors who don't understand the mechanics. Correctly predicting oil prices will rise is just one part of the equation.

So far this year, crude has been a juggernaut. U.S. futures have gained more than 28% as fears of a global glut diminished. This week, oil got another boost as supplies from Venezuela tightened and Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, signaled it would continue curbing oil production and exports. After a government report Wednesday showed a decline in U.S. stockpiles, oil futures rose to a four-month high, closing at $58.26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Given oil's rise, doubling or tripling down on oil looks like a smart wager. The VelocityShares 3X Long Crude Oil exchange-traded note, which seeks to triple the daily return of U.S. crude futures, is up 89% this year, and the United States 3X Oil Fund has gained 88%, according to FactSet. The ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF, which aims for double the daily performance, has gained 54%.

Triple-leveraged bullish funds typically do well in a steadily rising environment, but they amplify losses when the market reverses.

Adding to the confusion, the funds need to rebalance daily, which can erode returns even when oil prices have risen, especially in choppy markets.

Unexpected losses can be a rude awakening for investors who don't understand the mechanics.

"To do well, you need to get two calls right," said Elisabeth Kashner, head of ETF research and analytics at FactSet.

"The first is the overall market direction, and that's the call that's obvious to most investors. The not obvious piece is that you also have to get the path the price takes right, the consistency of the move," she said.

Say oil prices gain 5% in a single day. A $100 investment in a triple-leveraged oil ETF would be worth about $115 at the end of the day. The fund then buys more oil futures to reset its leveraged exposure for the next day, which means the investor now has $115 riding on oil prices. If oil drops 5% the following day, the investor loses $17.25, ending up with $97.75 -- less than the initial wager made two days before.

"If you get a whipsaw pattern, even if it's moving overall in the direction that you pick, you could find yourself unpleasantly surprised because of all the buying high and selling low you did along the way," Ms. Kashner said.

Over time, the divergence can be significant. In the past year, for example, triple-leveraged products have lost almost 40%, while oil prices are down just 7%, according to FactSet.

Those unpleasant surprises are part of the reason some brokerage platforms like Charles Schwab Corp. and Vanguard Group impose guardrails on investors trying to buy leveraged products. The SEC warned brokers in 2012 that leveraged ETFs are potentially "unsuitable for long-term investors."

Worldwide AI Spending to Hit $35.8 Billion in 2019; International Data Corp. also projects spending will more than double to $79.2 billion by 2022

Global spending on artificial intelligence is expected to hit $35.8 billion this year, up 44% over last year, with retail and banking leading the way, according to International Data Corp.

The AI market shows no sign of slowing down, with AI spending projected to more than double to $79.2 billion by 2022, a compound annual growth rate of 38%, IDC said. The company increased its AI spending projection from September, the last time it looked at the market, when it anticipated AI outlays to hit $77.6 billion by 2022. The U.S. will be responsible for nearly two-thirds of all AI spending this year.

IDC's AI spending forecast is based on surveys of IT executives, analysts' research and other proprietary and secondary information sources.

The reason the market is growing so quickly now is that the infrastructure, the big data, and the analytics to build AI applications has finally come together, said Marianne Daquila, research manager of customer insight and analysis at IDC. "And that's only going to continue to get better over time," she said.

Breaking it down by industry sector, retailers this year will spend $5.9 billion on automated customer service agents, expert shopping advisers and product recommendations, and other artificial intelligence applications. Banks will invest $5.6 billion in automated threat intelligence and prevention systems, fraud analysis and investigation systems, and other AI systems, according to IDC. Other big AI budgeters include discrete manufacturers, health-care providers and process manufacturers.

Indeed, retailers are embracing AI, according to survey of more than 300 industry executives that was done by research firm Oxford Economics Ltd. for consumer financial services company Synchrony Financial. Although cautious about all the hype surrounding the technology, nearly three-fourths of the respondents said AI will be a competitive necessity in the next five years.

"Everybody says it going to be a competitive necessity But it's a very grounded response:  We know what it does. We get what it doesn't do. We're realistic about the expectations,'" said Edward Cone, Oxford Economics' technology practice lead, summing up the survey response.

Among the specific technology retailers are deploying are machine learning, chatbots and virtual assistants, according to the Oxford Economics and Synchrony survey. More than half, 55%, said they realized a substantial increase in revenue growth from the AI implementations.

Retailers see the primary benefits from AI as more relevant, customized marketing; an improved in-store experience; an improved online experience; better merchandise selection; improved products and service, according to the findings from Oxford Economics and Synchrony.

"Retail is a really great case of having automated customer service agents, expert shopping advisers and product recommendations, and merchandising for omnichannel operations," said IDC's Ms. Daquila. "I mean, it's very, very easy to see how retail benefits from AI."

Across all sectors, the AI projects that will receive the most funding this year, according to IDC, will be automated customer service agents, at $4.5 billion world-wide; sales process recommendation and automation, at $2.7 billion; and automated threat intelligence and prevention systems, at $2.7 billion. Other popular applications include automated preventive maintenance, diagnosis and treatment systems, fraud analysis and investigation, intelligent process automation, and program advisers and recommendation systems.

This year, $13.5 billion will be spent on AI applications and software platforms and $12.7 billion will be invested in hardware, with servers taking up a big portion of that spending, as companies build the infrastructure needed to support their AI systems. Spending on AI-related services is projected to match hardware spending, according to IDC.

South Korean cash finds a home in European prime property

Regulatory changes prompt spending spree on commercial real estate

When 6,000 staff of Goldman Sachs move into their new London office in the city s financial district this summer, many may be unaware that the 826,000 square foot Plumtree Court building is owned by a South Korean pension fund.

South Korea s state-run National Pension Service (NPS) bought the new, unfinished European headquarters of the US bank for 1.2bn in August in the largest deal for a London office building last year. Goldman Sachs has taken a 25-year lease on the 10-storey building.

The big-ticket purchase is part of surging interest in European buildings by South Korean investors, who are attracted by cheap financing, high yields and currency hedging premiums, according to property agents.

They have become leading buyers of prime buildings in Europe after domestic regulatory changes in 2015 made it easier for South Korean institutions to invest abroad.

Specifically Seoul revised legislation to allow securities companies with at least Won4tn ($3.6bn) of capital to deploy new financing channels.

The spending spree has been led by state-run pension fund NPS and sovereign wealth fund Korea Investment Corp (KIC), followed by securities companies and asset managers.

Despite Brexit concerns, London was this sort of investor s favourite property investment target last year, followed by other European gateway cities such as Frankfurt, Brussels and Paris, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

Last year set a record for South Korean investment in Europe s commercial property market, with volumes rising nearly sixfold over the past five years to  7.3bn in 2018, according to property group Cushman & Wakefield. The UK attracted more than 40 per cent of South Korea s investment in Europe s commercial property, with London receiving the bulk.

 The wave of Korean capital that flowed into the European real estate sector over 2018 was remarkable,  says Jonghan Kim, Head of Korea at Cushman s EMEA capital markets team.

South Korean groups invested 2.3bn in London property last year, accounting for 12 per cent of total property investment volumes in the UK capital, lagging only Hong Kong s 2.5bn invested in London property in 2018.

 The preference for London is borne out of the city s unrivalled liquidity and attractive pricing relative to compressed yields in key European cities such as Frankfurt and Paris,  says Jaewon Yoon, head of outbound investment at Savills Korea.

Although Chinese investors, especially from Hong Kong, have been the prolific overseas investors in Europe over the past few years, Beijing s clampdown on outbound capital has given South Koreans a chance to snap up prime buildings in London.

Other South Korean investments in Europe include the  670m purchase of Frankfurt s Trianon Tower by Hana Financial Investments and IGIS Asset Management. In London, 125 Shaftesbury Avenue was bought for $348m by a consortium led by KB Securities, and Mirae Asset Global Investments purchased 20 Old Bailey from Blackstone for 340m.

 Korean investors 	. 	. 	. 	look for assets with a stable income and tenants with a good investment grade,  says Mr Kim.

Last year, South Koreans bought $8.4bn in income-producing assets and development sites abroad, with three-quarters of this outbound capital going to Europe, up from 59 per cent in 2017, according to Real Capital Analytics.

 [Korea s] domestic market has been tight, characterised by rising prices, sharp yield compression and a competitive business environment,  says Petra Blazkova, senior director of analytics for Asia Pacific at Real Capital Analytics.

Market watchers expect South Korean capital to continue flowing into Europe, with Paris likely to be their most popular destination this year.

 We plan to gradually increase our exposure to overseas properties but will be more careful and selective about investing in the UK until Brexit worries are resolved,  says Heenam Choi, chief executive of KIC.

News Corp set to bid for Mergermarket owner

Axel Springer, rating agencies and buyout groups also said to be eyeing Acuris

Traditional media companies, including Rupert Murdoch s news business, and the world s largest rating agencies are set to enter a bidding war to acquire Acuris, the owner of Mergermarket, as an auction gets officially under way this week, people involved in the process said.

Mr Murdoch s News Corp and German media company Axel Springer are among the media groups that have recently expressed interest in the financial news company, which could fetch more than 1bn in a sale, said multiple people briefed about the matter.

Separately, Fitch, Moody s and S&P Global have also expressed an interest in the subscription-based information group after its owner, BC Partners, appointed bankers for a sale.

Buyout groups, including KKR, Advent International and Hellman & Friedman in the US, and EQT in Europe are also exploring bids for the owner of Mergermarket and Debtwire news and data services.

All companies declined to comment.

People involved in the process cautioned that it was still early days and too soon to tell which company was in pole position to acquire the business known for its coverage of mergers and acquisitions and debt market news.

Acuris is considered an attractive asset because its subscription-based model, which can draw a steady stream of fees from its 190,000 subscribers, leaves it with a sticky customer base. The business has a renewal rate of 95 per cent, according to a person with direct knowledge of its finances.

BC Partners bought the business from Pearson   the former owner of the Financial Times   for 382m. It has since more than doubled in value after Singapore s GIC bought a 30 per cent stake valuing the business at about 1bn.

Since being acquired by BC Partners, Acuris has seen double-digit growth and has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 75m, a person with direct knowledge of its performance said.

The private equity group has also cut or sold lossmaking units and introduced new products to expand the business since it bought Acuris in 2013.

If a sale goes through, the business will be worth more than the 844m that Nikkei, Japan s largest newspaper company, paid Pearson for the Financial Times four years ago.

Interest in Acuris comes at a time when private equity groups  competition for assets has intensified as they raise record funds and come under pressure to put capital to work.

A potential sale follows a string of acquisitions of subscription-based data companies.

Last year, US buyout group Warburg Pincus bought a majority stake in Reorg Research, a bankruptcy analysis and deal intelligence start-up, in a $375m to $400m deal.

In 2017 Moody s bought Bureau van Dijk, a Dutch data analytics group, for  3bn.

Chinese insurer Ping An plans share buyback while growth slows

Financial services group s full-year net up a fifth yet new business falters

Ping An, the world s largest insurer by market capitalisation, announced plans to buy back its own shares and reported that full-year net profit rose by about a fifth, a slower pace of growth than previously, hit partly by less valuable new business at its biggest unit.

The Chinese financial services group s plans a buyback of Rmb5bn-Rmb10bn. Its net profit rose about 20 per cent to Rmb107bn ($16bn), while total revenues rose at the slower pace of 11 per cent to Rmb1.08tn, compared with a 25 per cent growth rate the year before.

 We think our shares are considerably undervalued,  said James Garner, chief strategist and head of investor relations at Ping An, in reference to the buyback.

The company operates a broad range of financial services businesses besides insurance, such as banking, securities broking, an asset manager and trust company. But in recent years Ping An has invested heavily in the development of new technologies including artificial intelligence, facial recognition and cloud computing.

In doing so it has attracted a vast number of customers and users to its online platforms. Users on its internet platforms rose by 100m last year to more than 538m. Retail customers climbed to 183m from about 165m in 2017.

Life and health insurance, the largest part of Ping An s business, showed slowing growth in the value of new business, a gauge on projected future profits. Value of new business came to Rmb72.3bn in 2018, up about 7 per cent on the year before but a significant deceleration from past years when the company posted growth above 30 per cent. Mr Garner attributed that to a poor first quarter.

Financial technology and health technology has helped Ping An gain some international attention but that part of the business remains small but still notched high growth. Operating profit for that part of the business was Rmb7.7bn, up about 40 per cent on last year.

Its online wealth management business Lufax has completed another round of fundraising that valued it at $39.4bn, with Qatar Investment Authority a major investor. Ping An plans several initial public offerings of companies such as Lufax.

Under the direction of its chairman and chief executive, Ma Mingzhe, who goes by the English name Peter, the company has expanded rapidly, although mainly within China. Assets increased to Rmb7.1tn in 2018, up 10 per cent from the year before.

The company once counted HSBC as a large shareholder but is now the largest shareholder in the UK bank. Unlike some of its peers in China, the company has not made an aggressive overseas acquisition binge. Mr Ma told the Financial Times last year that he was not looking to buy up assets abroad for the time being.

Chipmaker Nvidia beats Intel to buy rival Mellanox to buy rival

Technology

Nvidia yesterday agreed to buy rival Mellanox Technologies for $6.9bn, including debt, in the biggest deal ever for the US semiconductor company as it seeks to bolster its business in data centres.

The all-cash deal would help Nvidia shift its focus away from the gaming industry, which has been hit by slowing economic growth in China and the waning cryptocurrency fervour. Nvidia said it would pay $125 a share for Mellanox, a 14 per cent premium to the group's closing share price on March 8. The chipmaker beat Intel in a competitive race to secure Mellanox, which is based in both the US and Israel, said one person involved in the bidding process.

Intel is one of the biggest foreign investors in Israel. Just two months ago, the chipmaker announced plans for an $11bn production and research facility in the country. The company bought Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based maker of sensors and cameras for computerassisted and autonomous driving, for $15.3bn in 2017.

Mellanox, which reported sales of $1.1bn last year, makes cables and switches that transfer data between servers, storage systems and infrastructure equipment.

The technology will complement Nvidia's graphics processors, which despite their origins in visual effects and computer games, are increasingly used in machine learning systems.

"The emergence of [artificial intelligence] and data science, as well as billions of simultaneous computer users, is fuelling skyrocketing demand on the world's data centres," said Jensen Huang, the founder and chief executive of Nvidia.

"This type of workload is simply too big to fit on any one computer ... Thousands of computers have to be networked together."

The two companies said the combined entity would serve every big provider of cloud computing services and power more than half the world's fastest supercomputers.

Nvidia and Mellanox have collaborated for several years, but acquisition talks began only recently, Mr Huang said on a conference call yesterday.

"We would like to accelerate growth into data centres by being able to architect across both the compute as well as the network fabric," he said, adding that the deal was part of a broader strategy to change Nvidia "from a chip and system-level company to a data centrescale company".

The deal is expected to complete this year and will be funded by cash on Nvidia's balance sheet. It will require regulatory approval in the US, China and other jurisdictions, Nvidia said.

Nvidia generated roughly a quarter of its $11.7bn of revenues from its data centre business last year, which was dwarfed by its sales to gamers who want to supercharge their PCs. The company faced a turbulent end to 2018 as its gaming division's sales slid, driven in large part by a fall in sales of graphics cards to cryptocurrency miners.

Nvidia expects to return to growth in its core gaming business in the quarter ending in July, but warned of limited visibility among cloud computing clients.

Your essential weekly fintech briefing

Who would you rather talk to, a virtual banking assistant whose life goal is  helping people overcome drama with style and a pout , a  born charmer  chatbot whose special skill is  modelling a zillion looks in one paparazzi flash  or a  fast n  curious  AI who wants to  bridge the gap between humans and bots  and  can type faster than the speed of light ?

Liv, the two-year-old  digital lifestyle bank  spun out of Emirates NBD, put all these choices and more to their customers in a bid to create something that has eluded virtually every other bank   a chatbot their customers actually want to deal with, instead of one that s viewed as a job-stealing menace to be endured in the name of progress.

Close to 60,000 people watched aFacebook videoof Liv's management interviewing  the five potential chatbots. Viewers were then encouraged to vote, via the comment stream, for who should be hired (an offer thataround 600 of them took up, lured in part by the chance to win $140).



Jayesh Patel,head of Liv, admits that the game was rigged. Olivia, the empathetic but fun bot with the lightning-fast typing skills, was the one who'd been developed for deployment, and the others gave such obviously inappropriate answers at their  interviews  that they were unlikely to win the popular vote. Liv was never going to unleash  born charmer  Matchio Bot or  geeky cheeky  Gizmo Bot to its 210,000 customers (though Matchio was a surprising hit with some Facebook commenters).

The integrity of the voting process was secondary to the true purpose of the process of engagingLiv s customers, making them feel like they were active participants in their bank s decision to transfer the handling of their day-to-day queries from real-life humans to a machine.

Some 3,000 of those Liv customers signed up to  mentor  Olivia by engaging with her and helping her to learn the skills she'd need to serve them when she finally began work this week. (The customers also get the chance to win prizes including an iPad for their participation).

Olivia wasn t starting from scratch. She s built on Kai, the artificial intelligence platform built by cutting-edge US AI firm Kasisto, which is already in use across eight global financial institutions including Singapore's DBS, Standard Chartered, JPMorgan Chase, TD Bank and Wells Fargo.

Zor Gorelov, head of Kasisto, said this project was different because Liv doesn t see itself as a bank in the traditional sense.  The idea is lifestyle assistant first, banking assistant second, that s the vision that the bank has and that s what we helped them execute on.  Or, as Mr Patel puts it,the key is  positioning Olivia as a buddy that our customers rely on, like and trust .

For Mr Gorelov and his team, that meant teaching Kai about spending habits, saving habits and goal setting, and developing a visual and conversational way of presenting the information.

The build-up for Olivia was also unique.  What they ve done is 	. 	. 	. 	groundbreaking in many ways,  said Mr Gorelov, who expects to roll Kai out across another eight banks in the next year.  We re watching the space very carefully. 

Mr Patel is refreshingly upfront about the fact that using Olivia means fewer human jobs. The man versus machinetension is an easier one at Liv, which has a headcount of just 63 and is acquiring new customers faster than any other bank in the UAE, than it is at massive banks that employ tens of thousands in their call centres and are growing slowly.  We will not hire as many new agents,  said Mr Patel.  We still have a lot of growth. 

The initial feedback from users testing Olivia has been so positive that Mr Patel sees her as a  prime contender  to provide similar servicesat Liv's parent bank, Emirates NBD, though likely under another name. Whether they'll go for an X-Factor style contest to find that name is anybody's guess.

One to watch: Raisin

Raisin, the German group that raised $114m in funding from PayPal last month to become one of the best-financed fintechs in Europe, announced on Thursday its purchase of its longtime German service bank, MHB.

A retail banking marketplace, Raisinlets customers place their money in international banks to take advantage of global interest and currency rates,writes Madison Darbyshire in London. It calls itself a  schengen experience  for banking, and has rapidly ballooned to 165,000 customers across nearly 70 European banks. The tie-up with MHB, Raisin hopes, will accelerate plans for expansion.

When Raisin was founded, interest rates were poised to rise from their record low levels, but the ECB has pushed back, forcing Raisin to look for other ways to drive growth.

The young company wants to end its dependency on service providers, acceleratingthe implementation of its technology and speeding up processing.  It s good to have full influence on the payment and customer due diligence side,  Raisin co-founder Tamaz Georgadze said.

Raisindidn't disclose what it paid for MHB (your estimates welcome!). However, the bank purchase, Mr Georgadze said, allows Raisin to utilise the bank'slicences. Previously it relied on its partner banks, primarily challenger banks Starling and Keytrade, to fill the void.

 We didn t have financial institutions licence that would allow us to work across Europe,  Mr Georgadze said.  The driving factor was the increasing complexity in our business model. We needed a licence to operate other than [a] brokerage licence. 

MHB is not a bank the Raisin customers place assets with; Mr Georgadze brushes off questions about competition among the banks on its marketplace.

On the MHB s price tag, Mr Georgadze joked that MHB thinks they overpaid, and Raisin thinks they underpaid.  We are a happy buyer,  he said.

Further fintech fascination

Crypto chronicles:#fintechFT s friends over at Alphaville are arch crypto-sceptics, and we detect a little schadenfreudein their reportthat blockchain firm Setl has appointed administrators. Along with developing blockchain software, Setl has been building a securities depository and a fund record keeping platform. Companies involved in market infrastructure need to hold regulatory capital, however. When that became hard to fund, the company decided to sell the latter two businesses. That has proven difficult to do, and the two units have been handed over to administrators, who'll sell them on behalf of creditors. Setl was founded by Peter Randall, who also founded the Chi-X alternative equity exchanges; several big shots of traditional finance sit on its board.

Regulators' advance:On Thursday the UK s Financial Conduct Authoritypublished researcharguing that many customers don't know what they're buying when they purchase cryptocurrencies. Those interviewed were often looking for a way to  get rich quick , citing external influences such as social media, and often performed little to no research before purchase. Shocking absolutely no one, the most likely to know what a crypto asset was, of UK residents, were men aged 20 to 44. The FCA is looking to address the potential harm of cryptoassets on a public that understand little about them.

Trend watch:Islamic finance keeps on keeping on. On Thursday TheCityUK and Borsa, the Turkish stock exchange, released a joint report examining the market s potential. The World Bank estimates that 6 per cent of the world s population opt out of the financial system for religious reasons, a number that is dramatically higher in Islamic countries   as high as 19 per cent in Turkey. Yet two-thirds of the unbanked have smartphones. This is an opportunity for fintechs offering Shariah-compliant products   those that, among other things, charge no interest, make no investments in gambling or alcohol, and relyon equity rather than debt.

South Korean cash finds a home in European prime property

Regulatory changes prompt spending spree on commercial real estate

When 6,000 staff of Goldman Sachs move into their new London office in the city s financial district this summer, many may be unaware that the 826,000 square foot Plumtree Court building is owned by a South Korean pension fund.

South Korea s state-run National Pension Service (NPS) bought the new, unfinished European headquarters of the US bank for 1.2bn in August in the largest deal for a London office building last year. Goldman Sachs has taken a 25-year lease on the 10-storey building.

The big-ticket purchase is part of surging interest in European buildings by South Korean investors, who are attracted by cheap financing, high yields and currency hedging premiums, according to property agents.

They have become leading buyers of prime buildings in Europe after domestic regulatory changes in 2015 made it easier for South Korean institutions to invest abroad.

Specifically Seoul revised legislation to allow securities companies with at least Won4tn ($3.6bn) of capital to deploy new financing channels.

The spending spree has been led by state-run pension fund NPS and sovereign wealth fund Korea Investment Corp (KIC), followed by securities companies and asset managers.

Despite Brexit concerns, London was this sort of investor s favourite property investment target last year, followed by other European gateway cities such as Frankfurt, Brussels and Paris, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

Last year set a record for South Korean investment in Europe s commercial property market, with volumes rising nearly sixfold over the past five years to  7.3bn in 2018, according to property group Cushman & Wakefield. The UK attracted more than 40 per cent of South Korea s investment in Europe s commercial property, with London receiving the bulk.

 The wave of Korean capital that flowed into the European real estate sector over 2018 was remarkable,  says Jonghan Kim, Head of Korea at Cushman s EMEA capital markets team.

South Korean groups invested 2.3bn in London property last year, accounting for 12 per cent of total property investment volumes in the UK capital, lagging only Hong Kong s 2.5bn invested in London property in 2018.

 The preference for London is borne out of the city s unrivalled liquidity and attractive pricing relative to compressed yields in key European cities such as Frankfurt and Paris,  says Jaewon Yoon, head of outbound investment at Savills Korea.

Although Chinese investors, especially from Hong Kong, have been the prolific overseas investors in Europe over the past few years, Beijing s clampdown on outbound capital has given South Koreans a chance to snap up prime buildings in London.

Other South Korean investments in Europe include the  670m purchase of Frankfurt s Trianon Tower by Hana Financial Investments and IGIS Asset Management. In London, 125 Shaftesbury Avenue was bought for $348m by a consortium led by KB Securities, and Mirae Asset Global Investments purchased 20 Old Bailey from Blackstone for 340m.

 Korean investors 	. 	. 	. 	look for assets with a stable income and tenants with a good investment grade,  says Mr Kim.

Last year, South Koreans bought $8.4bn in income-producing assets and development sites abroad, with three-quarters of this outbound capital going to Europe, up from 59 per cent in 2017, according to Real Capital Analytics.

 [Korea s] domestic market has been tight, characterised by rising prices, sharp yield compression and a competitive business environment,  says Petra Blazkova, senior director of analytics for Asia Pacific at Real Capital Analytics.

Market watchers expect South Korean capital to continue flowing into Europe, with Paris likely to be their most popular destination this year.

 We plan to gradually increase our exposure to overseas properties but will be more careful and selective about investing in the UK until Brexit worries are resolved,  says Heenam Choi, chief executive of KIC.

Goldman Sachs to Open Up In-House Moneymaker to Outside Investors; Bank plans to raise outside money for its special-situations group, one of its most profitable businesses

A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. profit machine that has invested the bank's own money in Asian property, African startups and troubled U.S. retailers, among other ventures, is opening up to outside investors.

Goldman plans to raise outside money for its special-situations group, according to people familiar with the matter. Also under discussion is a broader reorganization of the firm's various private investing activities into a new unit that would seek to raise new funds across a variety of strategies, the people said.

The special-situations group has been run since 2013 by Julian Salisbury, a detail-oriented Brit who joined the firm's management committee two years ago. It has grown from about $20 billion on the eve of the crisis to about $30 billion today, people familiar with the matter said.

In the early 2000s it pioneered the sort of go-anywhere investing that has caught on at private-equity firms such as TPG and Blackstone Group LP, and it remains one of the most profitable businesses at Goldman.

It will likely be combined with Goldman's merchant-banking group, the historical home of the bank's private-equity investing.

"Based on our track record, there is an opportunity to raise additional third-party funds across equity, credit and real estate," Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon told analysts earlier this year. "We have a world-class alternative investing franchise, which has generated strong returns over three decades [and] presents us with extraordinary opportunities to partner with clients to invest their capital alongside our own."

In a memo to employees last week entitled "Our Forward Strategy," Mr. Solomon said growing the bank's alternative asset-management business is a priority.

The discussions show how much has changed on Wall Street since the financial crisis. In Goldman's last big push into private equity, in the 2000s, it put billions of dollars of its own money into megabuyouts. Now it seeks raise money from outside investors like pension funds and clip steady fees for managing it. Shareholders today value steady, low-risk businesses like money management, setting off an asset-gathering race across Wall Street.

The reorganization also shows Mr. Solomon busting up silos in an effort to modernize and streamline the firm. Under a "One Goldman" banner, he has launched a firmwide effort to better cover top clients.

Scattered across Goldman are at least a half-dozen units tasked with making investments, built over decades of ad hoc planning and guarded jealously by their owners. Their results are comingled in an "investing and lending" reporting segment that shareholders tend to dismiss as opaque and unpredictable.

Merging them will create a unit resembling a smaller version of KKR & Co. or Blackstone that executives hope will be better understood and more richly valued by shareholders. The move may eventually change how Goldman publicly reports its earnings, some of the people said.

The firm weighed such a combination once before, in 2008 as the crisis deepened, but the endeavor fell apart due to personality clashes, a person familiar with the matter said.

Most banks spun off their private-equity arms after the 2010 passage of the Dodd-Frank financial law, which banned banks from investing their own money into buyout funds and slapped heavy capital charges on illiquid portfolios. Goldman held on more tightly, betting that it could navigate the new rules.

It started doing deals straight off its balance sheet, sidestepping the ban on funds.

In 2017 Goldman raised its first buyout fund since the crisis, a $7 billion pool that includes only a small amount of the bank's own money.

The special-situations group has wide leeway to invest wherever it sees an opportunity. In the late 1990s, it made a killing in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. These days it is more of a middle-market lender, serving midsize companies that have trouble borrowing elsewhere. It has invested in a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-c-o-d-and-goat-promotions-jumia-aims-to-be-africas-alibaba-1527073200", bought troubled commercial real-estate loans in New Zealand and backed Mexico's fastest-growing fintech lender.

It commonly lends to distressed companies, exacting terms that boost its profits and limit its potential losses. A recent loan to a struggling California turbine maker carries a 13% interest rate and requires the company to set aside $12 million in cash as collateral 40% of the value of the loan.

Nvidia to Buy Networking Firm --- With Mellanox deal, chip maker seeks to bolster its position in cloud computing

By Asa Fitch

Nvidia Corp. agreed to acquire networking firm Mellanox Technologies Ltd. for about $6.9 billion, its largest deal by far as it bolsters its bet on cloud computing after a stinging sales drop in its core graphics-chips business late last year.

The combination, announced Monday, marks the latest foray by Nvidia beyond chips known as graphics processing units. While Nvidia has pushed into artificial-intelligence applications and grown its data-center business in recent years, much of its growth has been rooted in finding new uses for its chips rather than venturing into entirely new areas.

With Mellanox, Nvidia is buying a maker of Ethernet switches and adapters that connect computers to each other, wiring together networks where users can rapidly exchange information. The company is a major supplier of equipment that conforms to the so-called InfiniBand networking standard widely used in supercomputers.

Nvidia's acquisitions outside the graphics-chip arena have been few, and none of its deals are in the same financial orbit as Mellanox's. It paid $367 million in 2011 for the modem-technology company Icera, its largest disclosed acquisition before the Mellanox deal, a spokesman said. Nvidia wound down that business in 2015.

"We rarely do deals, and the reason is on balance we really prefer to build" new businesses, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in an interview.

Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will pay $125 a share in cash for Mellanox, a 14% premium to the company's closing price Friday of $109.38.

Shares of Nvidia, which have been battered in recent months, rose 7% to $161.14 on Monday. Mellanox shares rose 7.8% to $117.89.

The transaction, expected to close by the end of 2019, would immediately add to Nvidia's gross margin and bottom line once completed, the company said. On a call with analysts, finance chief Colette Kress said Nvidia doesn't expect to change its plans to return $2.3 billion to shareholders in its current fiscal year on top of what it already has done.

Nvidia's chips, long designed to enable advanced graphics for videogames, have proven well-suited to difficult computing tasks, and are widely used in high-performance computing and cloud infrastructure by companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.

The rise of cryptocurrency mining and artificial-intelligence applications that also made heavy use of Nvidia's chips propelled the company's sales in recent years and sent its stock price soaring.

But Nvidia suffered a reversal last year, in large part because cryptocurrency prices fell sharply and mining became unprofitable.

Mr. Huang had called Nvidia's most recent quarter "a real punch in the gut" after revising quarterly revenue guidance downward by $500 million due to slow sales of its latest graphics chips for videogames and the hangover from the cryptocurrency bust. The company's shares fell from almost $290 in October to around $151 at Friday's close.

The Mellanox acquisition likely will add modestly to Nvidia's profit and could be a good strategic fit, according to Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, though he said some investors might scratch their heads about the timing of the deal.

Mr. Huang said the deal meshed with Nvidia's view that the future is about constructing a fast, interconnected fabric of computing power in data centers. "We have some short-term challenges that are largely behind us," he said. "Our investment thesis -- our company's thesis -- remains intact."

Mellanox, which has operations in the U.S. and Israel, has been up for sale since last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Its market capitalization was around $5.9 billion as of Friday's close.

Is Your ETF Conflicted? Advisory firms must make potential conflicts of interest clear in disclosures

How can you tell if your exchange-traded fund is subject to potential conflicts?

Investors can find disclosures in brochures that advisory firms file with the SEC, known as a Form ADV Part 2. There are several JPMorgan business entities that file a Form ADV Part 2. The one for JPMorgan Private Investments, one of the business units that is a top owner of its ETFs, is 47 pages long. It reads, in part: "Conflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan has an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of clients' portfolios to act in a way that benefits JPMorgan."

It goes on to say, "It is important to note that JPMorgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included," and that JPMorgan "expects the proportion of JPMorgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100%)" in some strategies.

Failing to make such conflicts clear has gotten JPMorgan in trouble before. In 2015, the firm agreed to pay $307 million to settle charges that the bank improperly steered clients into its own mutual funds and hedge funds without disclosing conflicts of interest.

Northern Trust's Form ADV Part 2 says "it is expected that the proportion of Northern Trust investment products held in client accounts may be high (in fact, up to 100%)," and that "Northern Trust will receive more overall compensation when Northern Trust managed products are used."

Affiliates aren't the only potential conflict of interest. Any large financial company has business ties that present conflicts ranging from who underwrites their bonds to where they route their trades. The ETF industry is no different. For example, ETF providers including BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and WisdomTree Investments Inc. pay to trade commission-free on brokerage platforms like Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade, giving them a substantial advantage over competing providers that can't or won't pay for prime shelf space.

Vanguard Group is an exception. The Malvern, Pa., investment firm has a longstanding policy against paying for distribution. And as of last year, ETFs from every provider, including its competitors, trade commission-free on Vanguard's online brokerage.

Good day. And welcome to the food-delivery wars.

Companies large and small are experimenting with autonomous delivery to reduce the high costs and headaches of door-to-door service. But the robots aren't riding to the rescue anytime soon.

Winning over public sentiment at a time of growing hostility about the power and reach of technology in everyday life is also creating a challenge for the startups to make their robots which until now have largely been confined inside warehouses, factories and ports appear non-threatening, say venture capitalists examining the sector.

The new crop of sidewalk robots is likely to face resistance from regulators and ordinary people alike.

Says Steve Westly, managing director at venture firm Westly Group, which passed on investing in the sector: "Robots bumping into you on the sidewalk it's a weird, scary, odd thing." WSJ's Mike Colias and Marc Vartabedian have the story.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Citybound VC firms: San Francisco's office rents may be the priciest in the nation, but that isn't deterring Silicon Valley's venture-capital stalwarts from putting down stakes there.

The latest prominent venture firms slated to open large offices in the city include Andreessen Horowitz, which has signed a lease in the city, according to people familiar with its plans, and Y Combinator, which said on Friday it is looking for the right space.

The expected moves would shift the center of gravity for the tech industry further away from its historic origins in Silicon Valley. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the exclusive.

Speaking of YC: Sam Altman is stepping aside as president of the famed Silicon Valley accelerator that has spawned some 1,900 companies.

Y Combinator said in a blog post Mr. Altman will shift to the role of chairman, enabling him to devote more time to OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial-intelligence research group he created with Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk.

Mr. Altman has served as Y Combinator's president since 2014, when he was tapped to succeed co-founder Paul Graham.

Adds Mr. Altman: "I'll still have a voice at that table." WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

Roof's Take: Silicon Valley's IPO Parade Could Showcase Chasm With Wall Street

By Katie Roof

Silicon Valley and Wall Street could soon be set for another clash.

A slew of high-profile technology IPOs from the likes of Pinterest Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc. and Postmates Inc. are coming up in 2019. As in past cases when household name-brand tech companies went public, this incoming freshman class could highlight how Wall Street values consumer-tech companies very differently from the way private investors bid up billion-dollar startups.

Venture capitalists tend to take a long-range view, placing bets on the belief that there could someday be a significant market opportunity. By contrast, Wall Street emphasizes how the company is performing today, in addition to its growth potential.

That chasm seems set to once again be on display as investors gauge whether the coming crop of closely watched tech IPOs will succeed or stumble out of the gate.

Lise Buyer, a former Wall Street analyst who is now a partner at the IPO advisory firm Class V Group, says institutional investors often rely on concrete metrics such as profitability because they "have an obligation to justify the prices they are paying today."

Fannie, Freddie Get New Rivals for Loans

By Ben Eisen

11 March 2019

Private investors are directly buying a small but growing share of loans that have long been the domain of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a sign of the changing dynamics in the $11 trillion mortgage industry.

More mortgages that meet the standards for Fannie and Freddie to buy are instead flowing into the private market, where banks and other financial institutions pool them into bonds and sell them to investors without government backing. Firms that have recently issued these so-called private-label securities with a significant amount of such loans in them -- some up to 100% -- include Chimera Investment Corp. and Redwood Trust Inc., both real-estate investment trusts, as well as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Flagstar Bancorp Inc.

Fannie and Freddie perform a similar middleman role in moving mortgages from lenders to investors, though in those instances the government takes on some of the risk. In the past year or so, investors have proven increasingly willing to forgo the government backstop and buy private mortgage bonds, indicating they have grown more comfortable taking risk for more potential return. The fact that more investors want to buy these securities means banks and other firms can package these deals more profitably, which in some cases lets them offer better bids than the agencies.

"I think there's a number of investors interested in playing and engaging in this market," said Kristy Fercho, president of the mortgage business at Flagstar. The company put together two deals last year made up largely of conforming loans -- or loans that meet Fannie's and Freddie's standards -- for investor properties.

Though the proportion of loans securitized by private buyers remains just a speck in the broader market, it is growing. Last year, $3.9 billion of Fannie- and Freddie-eligible loans went into private-label securities, and the year before $4 billion did, both roughly tripling 2016 levels, according to broker-dealer Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.

Don Layton, chief executive of Freddie Mac, said in a recent interview that the agency is watching the trend, but that it doesn't affect most of the loans the agency guarantees. "It's stuff at the margins for us," Mr. Layton said.

The private market was a formidable rival to Fannie and Freddie before the financial crisis, but efforts to restart it since then have largely failed. If the latest activity is the start of a bigger shift, then Fannie's and Freddie's role in housing finance could shrink through market forces rather than congressional action.

Shrinking Fannie and Freddie is the goal of some lawmakers and policy makers, including Republicans who want the government to play a smaller role in housing. Lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to remake the agencies since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Some industry watchers think Mark Calabria, a sometime critic of the agencies who has been nominated to run their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, could try to encourage the private market's growth as a backdoor way to diminish the government entities, which guarantee nearly half of mortgages issued in the U.S.

"In effect, this effort to reduce the footprint is well under way," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It's happening and it is consequential."

About 45% of mortgages originated in the January-to-September period last year went into Fannie and Freddie securities, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank. At its most recent peak in 2008, that proportion was 65%.

In the first nine months of last year, 1.9% of mortgage originations went into private-label securities, according to the Urban Institute. At the trough in 2009, essentially zero did. The rest are held by the lenders who made them or securitized by Ginnie Mae, the government-owned mortgage corporation that guarantees loans to many first-time buyers and veterans.

The recent moves stem from the changing calculus for lenders deciding where to sell their loans. Fannie and Freddie charge guarantee fees that erode lenders' haul from selling loans. When the fees are high enough, it can be more efficient to sell to the private market, which can be more nimble in its pricing.

When San Diego-based Guild Mortgage Co., for example, wants to sell Fannie- and Freddie-eligible loans, it collects bids from about a dozen private-market buyers and then compares those options with pricing offered by the agencies. Recently, private buyers have offered better deals on some loans. Like many lenders, Guild has found private-market pricing particularly attractive for loans for which the agencies charge higher guarantee fees, including those financing investment properties, as well as loans with high balances.

It isn't certain to stay this way. The growth in private buyers has forced them to also compete with one another, analysts say, and the share of private-label securities made of agency-eligible loans dropped at the end of last year.

Some lenders say Fannie and Freddie have flagged to them the recent market dynamics, reminding them that a lender is supposed to sell a representative sample of its loans to the agencies. They have interpreted that as a directive to not to sell their highest-quality loans to the private market while handing lower-quality ones to the government entities.

"They will fire a friendly shot across the bow" for lenders around the market, said David Battany, who oversees capital markets at Guild Mortgage.

In some instances, those in the market have noticed Fannie and Freddie adjusting their pricing, making them more competitive with the private market.

Amherst Pierpont estimated that about 10% of Fannie- and Freddie-eligible loans issued in September 2018 could be more cheaply pooled into private-label deals.

"Ultimately mortgage originators are in the business of best execution," said Chris Helwig, a managing director at Amherst Pierpont.

Cyber Daily: Information Security Chiefs Gain Stature; Citrix Attacked; U.K. Girds for Election Interference

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. Chief information security officers are gaining stature, influencing business strategy as companies build products and services that rely on technology. Many CISOs now report to the chief executive. Being out from under the direct control of the chief information officer gives the CISO more freedom to assess the security of a company's technology, WSJ Pro's Catherine Stupp reports.

Also today: The FBI tells Citrix Systems Inc. of a cyberattack against it, the U.K. government adds cyber expertise to prepare for next election and Facebook Inc. fixes Messenger bug.

Chief Information Security Officers Are Taking On More Prominent Roles, Reporting To CEOs

By Catherine Stupp

Chief information security officers report to chief executives more often than to any other senior leader, according to new research from Deloitte & Touche LLP.

In a poll of 100 CISOs, 43% said they report directly to the CEO, while 37% said they report to the chief information officer. Deloitte surveyed 500 C-level executives in January about cybersecurity issues, including hierarchy, budgets and the outsourcing of security tasks.

Cybersecurity leaders are becoming more important as companies shift to business models built on technology, experts say. That includes the Internet of Things as well as data analytics products and services. CISOs also gain stature as boards get involved in monitoring cybersecurity.

"The biggest driver is the number of public breaches and the visibility that came with those breaches and then, to some degree, panic that ensued from corporate boards," said Emily Mossburg, a principal in Deloitte's risk & financial advisory.

Credit ratings firm Equifax Inc., after revealing a breach in 2017, hired its first CISO, Jamil Farshchi, in February 2018. Mr. Farshchi reports to Equifax's CEO. Before the breach, Equifax's chief security officer reported to the company's general counsel. An Equifax spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment about its reporting structure.

CISOs need authority over budgets and to ensure members of their staff are present in crisis meetings about security issues, Ms. Mossburg said.

Out from under the CIO

Big data companies and other technology firms are more likely to have CISOs who report directly to CEOs, according to Phil Schneidermeyer, a partner at executive search firm Ward Howell International Ltd.

Most other CISOs who Mr. Schneidermeyer encounters report to their companies' CIOs. That structure can present a conflict of interest because CISOs audit the security of their company's technology systems, which CIOs manage, he said.

"How do you tell your boss his or her organization isn't keeping up?" he said.

Jadee Hanson, CISO at software company Code42 Software Inc., reports directly to the company's CEO. She briefs the CEO weekly about security risks and any investigations into cyber threats. She also meets with the company's board once per year.

"You're not fighting with a CIO in order to get risk discussions at that executive level," Ms. Hanson said.

Many CISOs are learning to interpret cyber risks for their executive counterparts, highlighting their consequences to the business, according to Ms. Hanson, who previously worked as a director of information security at Target Corp.

"As long as the CISOs can make the shift to that spot and really talk about risk in a way that resonates with the CEO and impacts the bottom line, that's when they get heard and when they find a spot at the executive table," she said.

High-profile data breaches have alerted many CEOs to the risks such incidents could pose to their companies and their own jobs, said Greg Touhill, president of the federal group of security infrastructure company Cyxtera Technologies Inc. He previously served as the federal government's CISO.

"CEOs like to have the people in organizations that are the most important close to them," he said.

Y Combinator's Sam Altman Stepping Aside as President; Altman will become chairman, allowing him to devote more time to OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial-intelligence  research group he created with Elon Musk

Sam Altman is stepping aside as president of Y Combinator, the famed Silicon Valley accelerator that has spawned some 1,900 companies.

Y Combinator said in a blog post Mr. Altman will shift to the role of chairman, enabling him to devote more time to OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial-intelligence research group he created with Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk.

Mr. Altman has served as Y Combinator's president since 2014, when he was tapped to succeed co-founder Paul Graham. The firm said in a blog post that little will change in the daily administration because it is run "as a partnership."

In a brief interview on Friday, Mr. Altman said he would still play a role guiding the strategic direction of Y Combinator as one of its partners, adding, "I'll still have a voice at that table."

The decision is the latest in a string of leadership changes within Y Combinator over the past few years. In 2016, Mr. Altman handed most of the day-to-day operations over to Michael Seibel, a longtime adviser at Y Combinator who is now chief executive.

Since then, the firm has launched several new programs including Startup School, the Series A program and YC China. Y Combinator said its network now has more than 4,000 alumni of founders.

Y Combinator's announcement comes less than two weeks ahead of its Demo Day. With 200 companies, the event will feature the largest cohort to date and will take place in San Francisco rather than the accelerator's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. To accommodate the larger operations, the organization said it is looking for space in San Francisco to be its new headquarters.

Water-Damage Claims Flood Home Insurers

By Leslie Scism

More American homes are flooding from the inside.

Old pipes and valves, worn-out hoses on second-story washing machines and faulty connections for a proliferation of water-using appliances are causing a surge in increasingly expensive damage reported to insurers. The increase has occurred even as many other types of claims -- including fire -- have declined in frequency, industry figures show.

One in 50 homeowners filed a water-damage claim each year between 2013 and 2017, the latest data analyzed by Verisk Analytics' ISO insurance-analytics unit. It crunches industry data on a five-year rolling basis. The 2.05% frequency rate is up from 1.44% annually between 2005 and 2009.

The bottom line is a $13 billion water-damage bill for companies that insure homes in 2017. Claims average about $10,000, ISO says.

"Wildfires, hurricanes and tornadoes catch headlines, but the reality is that the No. 1 kind of risk that the everyday consumer has is a water claim," said Jon-Michael Kowall, an executive in the property-insurance business of USAA, one of the nation's biggest home insurers.

"It is lurking in the house," he said.

To tackle the problem, Texas-based USAA has 6,000 policyholders testing water-detecting sensors in a multiyear pilot project. This type of experimentation, where devices are installed to spot potential water damage, has morphed into one of the hottest corners of InsureTech, innovation focused on the insurance sector.

Chubb Ltd., one of the biggest insurers of high-end homes, said the number of annual water claims costing more than $500,000 has doubled since 2015, and those over $1 million have tripled.

Industry executives said there are myriad factors driving the costs higher.

The rise in overall claims is due partly to aging homes. A postwar building boom in the 1950s gave way to other booms, meaning much of America lives in houses that are decades old and become likelier candidates for plumbing failures. Even homes built during the real-estate bubble of the early 2000s can generate claims as they often have far more appliances with water connections.

In addition, more homeowners today want their laundry room on an upstairs floor.

"In the old days, if the washing machine had a leak, you'd get a mop" and scrub a concrete floor and be done with it, said Chubb Executive Vice President Paul Krump.

The damage can be particularly stunning in expensive homes.

Developer George Fermanian had always been more concerned about the ocean potentially damaging his two-decade-old oceanfront property in Southern California. The property even has a 12-foot sea wall.

But last year, a second-story toilet tank cracked and spilled water in the house for an unknown, extended period when he was away. Oak floors, walls, artwork, electronics gear and seats in a home theater were damaged.

"Walls are gypsum, wood absorbs water, insulation absorbs water, your cabinets absorb water," said Mr. Fermanian. Repairs on his property took eight months and cost Chubb just over $1 million.

Chubb also paid for installation of a water-shutoff system that detects unusual flows of water through the plumbing and can be set to shut off within a minute of such activity, Mr. Fermanian said.

In luxury homes, wet bars, water-filtration systems, hot- and cold-water taps, extra bathrooms and other features typically create 40 points of connection into the plumbing system, said Stephen Poux, a senior executive at American International Group Inc.

"That's a lot of opportunity for a valve or a connection . . . to spring a leak," he said.

Mr. Poux regularly meets InsureTech entrepreneurs and tests problem-detecting products. "I've personally piloted several devices," he said. "They don't always work."

AIG and some other insurers offer premium credits for policyholders' use of technology deemed effective.

Though insurers' payments are growing, it doesn't mean they pay every water claim. Since the 1960s, standard homeowners policies have excluded storm surge and river flooding. And in general, homeowners' policies cover "sudden and accidental" damage, not routine maintenance.

So homeowners who neglect an obvious slow leak for months before serious damage occurs could end up in a coverage dispute, insurance executives and lawyers said.

Among participants in USAA's pilot project is Mark Fredriksen, who placed sensors near the water heater and washing machine and under kitchen and bathroom sinks, in his Smithtown, N.Y., home.

So far, they have averted two potentially costly claims, he said. One sensor detected dripping from an old bathroom valve. On another occasion, as he was putting his children to bed upstairs, the kitchen sensor chirped. Water was spitting out from a dishwasher hose.

Banking & Finance: Robots Drive 5 ETFs Launched by Goldman

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. launched five new exchange-traded funds that rely on indexes built with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The New York investment bank is working with Motif Investing Inc. to identify companies that fit with broad themes that Goldman's money managers think will drive growth, like "finance reimagined" and "data-driven world."

Goldman's foray into computer-driven ETFs is the latest sign of Wall Street's increased reliance on sophisticated automation. Computers can read far faster than a legion of analysts, sifting company reports, news stories and regulatory filings for clues to a company's future. Two years ago, BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager by assets, announced that it would overhaul its actively managed equities business to rely more on robots than humans.

"With machine learning, you can get the benefits of hundreds of stock pickers in a low-cost quantitative way," said Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. "You can create indexes that evolve based on shifts in data."

Recent years have seen the proliferation of a new breed of indexes that veer even further from plain-vanilla benchmarks. ETF issuers have designed funds that try to pick companies that are less volatile, higher quality or more socially responsible.

Further blurring the line between active and passive investing, many of the smart index funds are really just attempts to codify trading strategies that active money managers have employed for decades. Indexes aren't all that different from robots. They follow their methodology -- essentially their programming -- to pick stocks and rebalance their portfolios at scheduled intervals.

The goal was to define themes that have mass appeal and staying power and avoid the downfall of being so narrowly defined that investors lose interest, said Michael Crinieri, global head of ETF strategy at Goldman.

Data mining and language processing help companies like index provider MSCI Inc. quantify how companies perform on environmental, social and governance criteria. Motif uses web crawlers to scan patent databases and academic journals as well as company financial filings.

"What AI allows you to do is to be more dynamic and data driven, and remove the human bias," said Art Amador, chief operations officer and co-founder of EquBot Inc., in San Francisco. "We think it will help you perform more consistently through different markets."

EquBot has two AI-driven stock ETFs with more than $150 million in assets and runs separately managed accounts for investors.

Money piles into sector as traditional agricultural and food industries come under pressure

The amount of money invested worldwide in agricultural and food technology jumped by more than 40 per cent in 2018, to $17bn, according to new industry figures.

According to AgFunder, an online venture capital platform, the number of deals also rose 11 per cent year-on-year, to 1,442. Nearly half of the fundraising took place in the US, while China was the second-biggest market, followed by India.

Entrepreneurs and technology experts have piled into  agritech  in recent years as the agricultural and food industries come under pressure from a growing global population, environmental concerns, labour shortages and changing consumer tastes.

At the same time, low commodity prices and significant technological developments, from machine learning to material science, are providing opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors to reinvent the food system.

S2G Ventures, a venture fund focused on investments in food and agriculture, was the most active investor in the sector last year, with 20 investments, according to AgFunder.

Sanjeev Krishnan, managing partner at S2G, said:  We have never seen the tectonic plates shifting as much as they are now, from the farmgate to the fridge. 

Most of the funding recorded by AgFunder in 2018 went to restaurant and grocery delivery services, as consumer demand for convenience and on-demand food grew across the globe. Restaurant food delivery deals almost doubled during the 12 months, to $3.9bn. Naspers, the South African investor, led a $1bn funding round in Indian food-delivery service Swiggy, while in the US, SoftBank led a $535m round in DoorDash, the San Francisco-based start-up.

Meanwhile, investments in biotechnology increased more than 50 per cent, to $1.5bn, in 2018. Indigo Ag, the Boston-based start-up that connects sellers and buyers of crops through a mobile app, raised $250m, bringing its estimated value to more than 3bn. Pivot Bio gained backing for its nitrogen-fixing microbes from Breakthrough Ventures, a billionaire investor syndicate fund with investors such as Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg.

Funding for  novel farming systems , such as indoor agriculture systems and insect farms, dropped, with 8.6 per cent fewer dollars in financing at $596m.

The innovative food category, which includes alternative meat, also saw funding fall 4.7 per cent to $502m, even as Impossible Foods, one of the most mature plant-based meat start-ups, raised $114m from investors including Singapore s Temasek.

Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT s daily deals briefing

FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.

Insurance brokers are supposed to help you to prepare for the unexpected. But Aon, the industry s number two player, caught the market off-guard on Wednesday when it said it had abandoned plans to buy Willis Towers Watson in an all-share transaction.

How long did it take for Aon to change its mind? Less than 24 hours from when it confirmed its interest.

To be fair Aon never even got close to combining with Willis Towers, the third-largest broker. On Tuesday afternoon it was forced admit it was considering a tie-up with its rival Willis, a deal that would have created the largest player in the industry. By Wednesday morning another statement landed:the potential all-share bid was being withdrawn.

What prompted Aon s quick about face? Here are some reasons:

*

the prospect of a lengthy, market-by-market examination of where the two compete by the antitrust regulators;

*

the share price reaction after the leak, which saw Aon s shares drop sharply. It recovered most (but not all) of the lost ground on news that the idea was dead;

*

the challenges associated with smashing together the cultures at two big, people-dependent businesses. DD understands that is was highly unlikely Willis boss John Haley(pictured below) would have been keen. He may have forcefully got that message across to Aon last night.

It was just last year that the UK s competition regulator investigated whether insurance brokers were engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.

The Competition and Markets Authority looked at whether some of Britain s largest investment consultants   including Willis Towers Watson and Aon   should be forced to split off their consultancy and fiduciary management businesses.

It eventually determined that it wasn t necessary to force a split but it said trustees should try to secure better prices.

The incident does leave Aon with questions to answer though, not least why it was looking at such a big and risky deal.

In an interview with the FT less than a year ago, chief executive Greg Case (pictured below) said he was keen to build up the company s data and analytics capabilities. He mentioned nothing about bulking up in traditional insurance broking, which is what a Willis Towers Watson deal would have done.

Marsh & McLennan   the world s number one insurance broker   bulked up last year with the 4.3bn acquisition of UK based Jardine Lloyd Thompson. Marsh boss Dan Glaser can now watch from the sidelines as his rivals work out how to respond.

Credit default swaps get a spring clean

GSO. Those three letters mean a lot in the world of credit, and yesterday we took DD readers behind the scenes of the latest palace intrigue at Blackstone s $130bn debt investing unit.

The private equity giant has slapped golden handcuffs on Bennett Goodman   the G in GSO   in a bid to prevent the co-founder of their powerhouse credit business from following his two original partners out of the door.

While Mr Goodman s firm likes to present itself as diversified and wide ranging credit investor, GSO has unfortunately become best-known for one highly controversial practice using credit default swaps: the manufactured default.

The FT last year took a deep dive into this sharp-elbowed trade pioneered by GSO, which caused an uproar even in the aggressive world of distressed debt trading.

But now trading powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs and Apollo Global Management have worked with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in a bid to close the loophole that Blackstone s credit unit so ruthlessly exploited.

CDS geeks can read the full textof these proposals here. But for the rest of us, there s one key point worth noting: in the recent internal shake-ups at GSO, the senior executives who helped pioneer this aggressive CDS ploy have left the firm.

GSO s once-fearsome distressed debt unit has seen a string of senior departures over the past year, as Blackstone has looked to move away from these highly contentious and public spats. It seems Mr Goodman may have a much quieter time over the next few years as his $200m share award vests.

Italy s attempt to save Alitalia may not fly

Trains, planes and err 	. 	. 	. 	well in Italy that combination is enough to cause concern.

In one of the odder industrial combinations being contemplated in Europe, travellers in Italy may soon find out what happens when you put together the country's flag carrier with its state-backed railway operator.

Policymakers in Rome have been wrestling with a way to rescue Alitalia, the perennially lossmaking flagship Italian airline. The leading option: merge it with Italian railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane alongside co-investors easyJet and Delta.

It is a plan that is raising eyebrows and that could ultimately end in tears. While Alitalia would get badly needed funds, it would not fix the structural issues plaguing it: namely overcapacity across Europe, which has driven down fares. Add in a probe by the European Commission into a loan Alitalia received from the government, as well as large unionised and pension holding workforce, and there's a good question on how Delta and easyJet would help the airline reduce its cost base.

For any DD readers who are not following the situation (or if you're not planning a summer flight to Bologna or Verona), there s something else at stake that should get your attention. Any deal between Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane and Alitalia would signal a growing willingness by Italy s populist coalition to intervene in the economy.

ECB's Dour Growth Forecast Gives Investors the Jitters; Banking stocks drop and government bonds rally as the ECB doubles down on a key lending program

By Avantika Chilkoti and Joe Wallace

European bank stocks fell sharply and government bond yields plumbed recent lows as investors came to terms with the European Central Bank's dour outlook on growth and fresh efforts to boost lending.

ECB President Mario Draghi surprised investors by "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-to-launch-new-stimulus-measures-11551963228", pledging to provide "significant monetary stimulus" and saying the bank stood ready to adjust all instruments at its disposal to support the regional economy.

"The weakening in economic data points to a sizable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that will extend into the current year," Mr. Draghi said, pointing to geopolitical risks like the threat of protectionism and fragility in emerging markets.

Germany's 10-year bond yields fell to 0.07% from 0.13% the day before, the lowest level since October 2016, when Europe's economy was just getting back on its feet following a yearslong debt crisis. The rally in bonds spread to the U.S., with 10-year Treasurys falling as low as 2.63% from 2.7% earlier in the day.

"The downgrade to growth is pretty big, probably more than most anticipated and I think they have just responded appropriately by being pre-emptive," said Karen Ward, chief market strategist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "Pre-Draghi, the ECB wasn't seen to be the most pre-emptive or reactionary central bank and he has certainly dispelled that image to some degree."

The biggest surprise for many investors was the change in expectations for rate policy, with Mr. Draghi signaling that the ECB's benchmark rates, currently negative, would be held steady through 2019 rather than just through the summer.

Bank stocks dropped sharply when Mr. Draghi announced lower growth forecasts for the region. That reversed a short-lived rally earlier in the day after the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecbs-latest-stimulus-will-help-banks-more-than-the-economy-11551973338", or TLTROs, which have benefited lenders in Europe's more precarious economies.

Shares in Deutsche Bank AG fell 5.3%. Spain's Banco Santander SA was down 4%. UniCredit SpA, Italy's biggest bank by assets, was down 2.2% and France's BNP Paribas SA lost 1.9%.

The euro was down 0.7% against the U.S. dollar following Mr. Draghi's comments, its lowest since November, with one euro buying $1.12.

The central bank slashed its forecast for real gross domestic product growth this year to 1.1%, from 1.7% just three months ago, and its forecast for consumer-price inflation to 1.2% from 1.6%. Lower growth and inflation expectations suggest interest rates will remain lower for longer, which could hurt bank earnings by squeezing net-interest margins.

Investors expected "https://www.wsj.com/articles/markets-warm-to-the-prospect-of-an-ecb-funding-boost-for-banks-11550656802" but the timing of Thursday's announcement, and the inclusion of details about the program, were a surprise. The program allows banks to borrow at much cheaper rates than those available in the bond market. The aim is to encourage banks to lend money to companies and consumers on more generous terms, getting credit to flow through the economy.

This funding follows two earlier batches, which ran from 2014 to 2017 and formed one prong of the ECB's extraordinary efforts to revive the eurozone economy after the sovereign-debt crisis. Eurozone banks still owe the ECB  722 billion ($811 billion) under the previous programs. Mr. Draghi said the new round will start in September and has been designed to avoid stress in bank funding markets as the loans from the existing program come due over the next two years.

"This helps at the margins by keeping the cost of credit cheap, but the issue in Europe has been demand for credit," Nick Wall, a fund manager at Merian Global Investors, said in a written comment. "For money demand to increase, Europe will be looking for an upswing in Chinese growth to boost its exports and for governments to boost spending."

The new TLTRO program is good news for bank financing, according to Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit, but the wider impact on the economy is "difficult to assess" as the central bank has yet to give full details on the cost of these loans.

Italian banks, a weak point in the eurozone economy, benefited most from earlier rounds of funding and were seen as particularly vulnerable if the ECB didn't release more loans. They borrowed 33% of the second TLTRO program, according to Haver Analytics ahead of Spanish and French banks with 23% and 16%, respectively.

Good day. In 2014, General Catalyst Partners' Hemant Taneja teamed up with Glen Tullman, the former chief executive of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. on a new project. Their plan was to create a cloud-based glucose-monitoring platform for diabetics. Just a few years later, their creation, Livongo Health Inc., is aiming for its initial public offering as soon as the third quarter, the WSJ reports.

Livongo has raised about $240 million from investors including General Catalyst, Sapphire Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. Its last funding of $105 million valued the company at $800 million. Now it is expected to seek a public valuation of more than $1 billion.

And now on to the news...

Mack's Take: Cannabis Entrepreneurs Who Know What Women Want

By Heather Mack

Consumers have spoken: They want high-quality products made by companies with diverse leadership, supply-chain transparency and targeted messaging that speaks to them on a personal level.

That's a lot of boxes to check. But plenty of startups in the burgeoning cannabis sector launched with these qualities already baked-in, meaning they are uniquely poised to build brands that resonate with modern consumers, and women in particular.

Compared with other industries, the cannabis sector boasts a relatively high number of female founders and leaders who are in a position to craft authentic, female-focused narratives around high-end products ranging from beautifully packaged pre-rolled joints to cannabidiol-infused face masks.

"Women already make most of the household purchasing decisions like food, clothes and cleaning products," said Nidhi Handa, founder and chief executive of cannabis startup Leune. "They are most certainly going to be the ones purchasing the cannabis."

Cyber Daily: Fear and Gloating at RSA; Zuckerberg's Encryption Vision; Iranian Hackers

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. The RSA Conference this week in San Francisco hosts more than 40,000 cybersecurity professionals, law enforcers and industry executives looking to discuss the latest in offensive and defensive technology and practices. Reporter Adam Janofsky is on site.

Topics range from talk about the potential of a geopolitical cyberattack, to pitches for the latest and greatest technology to fight hacks. One CISO discussed using machine learning to analyze security alerts on a daily basis.

Also today: Iran is fingered in attacks on 200 organizations world-wide, and Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg explains his encryption plans.

NSA Chief: Huawei's Involvement In 5G Networks  Concerns Me a Lot'

By Adam Janofsky

SAN FRANCISCO The U.S. and its allies should be concerned about letting Huawei Technologies Co. help build 5G networks because of the potential for the company to be used as a tool by the Chinese government, said Gen. Paul Nakasone, director of the National Security Agency, on Wednesday.

"[China] has very strong and deliberate ties to its private sector, and that concerns me a lot," he said during a keynote at the RSA Conference.

Huawei has denied allegations that it would spy on behalf of any government.

The U.S. has tried to persuade allies including Germany, Italy and Japan in recent months to limit their use of Huawei telecommunications equipment due to fears that it could be used to spy on communications or disrupt networks, The Wall Street Journal reported.

But not everyone is alarmed. Last month, German officials said the government was leaning towards letting Huawei participate in its high-speed internet infrastructure plans.

Gen. Nakasone remains steadfast in his opposition to Huawei in 5G infrastructure. "Are we comfortable with a nation that doesn't share our rule of law, that doesn't share our norms, that doesn't have due process having that much control over our communications [infrastructure]?" he asked.

Mr. Nakasone's comments suggest that the U.S. will continue to seek to block Huawei from 5G rollouts even as the company tries to assuage governments and consumers with ad campaigns and flashy displays of the trustworthiness of its technology.

"This is going to be a discussion that's going to continue for some time," he said.

Aflac's Machine Learning Tools Interpret Barrage of Security Alerts

By Adam Janofsky

It's easy for companies to gather vast amounts of data about attempted cyberattacks on their systems and networks. It's harder to interpret the information and use it to formulate effective responses.

Machine learning can help, according to Aflac Inc.'s chief information security officer, Tim Callahan.

Aflac uses machine learning and automation tools to help process the flood of data it collects from its firewalls and attack mitigation services as well as threat intelligence data it purchases from security vendors. Also in the mix are alerts from the Department of Homeland Security and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

"The problem most companies have is they are overwhelmed by the amount of information they have and can't do anything with it," he said.

How it works

Aflac's technology, which is a customized version of tools from commercial vendors, sorts alerts based on the likelihood they will impact the company's computer systems. It assigns each alert a confidence score depending on whether it has been a reliable indicator in the past. Repeated password attempts, for example, would generally be given a low score because the culprit is likely a user who forgot a password, not a hacker.

Malware signatures examined by Aflac's security researchers would be given a high score because the company trusts its researchers to verify whether the code is malicious or not, Mr. Callahan said.

The approach -- sometimes referred to as security orchestration, automation and response, or SOAR -- was implemented partly out of necessity. The company's security team was bombarded by the ever-increasing amount of threat data it collected, and investigations were often time consuming and unnecessary.

Machine learning and automation tools have allowed a five-person threat-management team to analyze and respond to thousands of alerts each day, Mr. Callahan said. The company employs about 300 security workers globally, with most in the U.S. and Japan.

About 15% of organizations will adopt SOAR technology by 2020, up from 1% in 2017, according to Gartner Inc.

Since Aflac implemented the SOAR system in September 2015, it has blocked more than 50 million malicious domains. There have been less than a dozen false positives, in which a legitimate user or website was accidentally blocked, Mr. Callahan said.

More Cyber News

Also at RSA: Agency in  deliberative process' over metadata surveillance. Gen. Nakasone also said the NSA is considering the future of its controversial surveillance program that collects domestic phone metadata, writes WSJ's Dustin Volz. The program is up for congressional renewal at the end of the year. The NSA will work closely with Congress and the White House to determine the program's fate.

NSA to offer free tool for malware analysis. Rob Joyce, a senior advisor at the NSA, said the agency plans to release an open-source software tool companies can use to reverse-engineer malware. Called Ghidra, the tool has helped the NSA for more than 10 years, ZDNet reports.

Iran linked to cyberattacks on about 200 organizations. Iranian hackers have hit hundreds of companies in past two years, WSJ reports, citing research from Microsoft Corp.

What happened: The campaign, the scope of which hadn't previously been reported, caused damages estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity. It affected oil-and-gas companies, heavy-machinery manufacturers and international conglomerates in countries including Germany, the U.K. and the U.S., Microsoft said. Italian oil company Saipem SpA was also hit by the hackers.

The attackers. Microsoft traced the attacks to a group it calls Holmium. The group targeted more than 2,200 people across nearly 200 organizations with phishing emails that, if clicked, can install code that steals information or wipes data from computers on the victim's network, Microsoft said. In the past, Iran has denied involvement in such cyber activity. A spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations didn't return messages seeking comment.

Facebook plans encrypted messaging, eventually. Facebook Inc. is betting that the future of social media will be private messaging and chats in small groups, rather than the public sharing of photos and messages that the company pioneered, WSJ reports. In an interview Wednesday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said people increasingly prefer to communicate in small groups or one to one.

Encryption coming: Facebook won't roll out significant encryption features this year, Mr. Zuckerberg said, because it wants to talk with privacy experts, regulators and law-enforcement entities around the world about how best to implement its technology and privacy goals.

Cyber tax scams about to take off. Phishing and other cyber scams targeting tax filers are increasing, the Internal Revenue Service warned this week. Data breaches at Marriott International Inc., Facebook Inc., Quora Inc. and other organizations have exposed personal data for millions of people, giving cyber criminals rich information to use in tax schemes, FedScoop reports.

Insurers Turn to AI to Better Assess Risk; Property and casualty insurers AXA XL and QBE hope AI can help in pricing policies

Property and casualty insurers are starting to deploy artificial intelligence to assess insurance risks with the goals of improving policy pricing and finding new business opportunities.

AXA XL, the Bermuda-based subsidiary of global insurer AXA SA, is testing a natural language processing program that can analyze hundreds of property-loss prevention reports in minutes, a task that would take a human risk analyst days or even weeks to complete. The reports, prepared by field engineers from on-site visits, contain details such as structural features and potential risks like hazardous materials.

The project is still in pilot phase and requires modifications to adjust for errors, but the company already is looking at replicating the program in other languages for use in multiple countries, said Scott Ewing, AXA XL's Americas engineering leader.

QBE Ventures, the investing arm of Australia-based QBE Insurance Group, has invested an undisclosed amount in AI startup Cytora, which develops machine learning and natural language processing. Cytora's technology can analyze building permits, news articles and satellite imagery, as well as insurer's internal data, to find hidden risks in its commercial insurance portfolio. The building permits, for example, include details about code violations, additions and modifications that provide clues about insurance risk. After a yearlong pilot, QBE's underwriters began making decisions based on the AI data this year, said Ted Stuckey, managing director of QBE Ventures.

"There's a lot of noise, a lot of promises made, a lot of big numbers put in front of you," Mr. Stuckey said about AI technology proposals. "The only way to prove if there's any potential is to run a pilot."

QBE also is experimenting with another AI application, a texting assistant for processing home insurance damage claims. Named Hi Marley, it is undergoing testing in the U.S. Hi Marley speeds up claims processing by allowing customers to interact with the program and send pictures, invoices and other documents at their convenience, not when an insurance rep is available on the phone, Mr. Stuckey said.

AI deployment among insurers, according to Boston-based research firm Novarica, is still low, but the earliest pilot programs are beginning to show promise. Among property and casualty insurers, 29% are using or testing machine-learning programs and unstructured text programs to analyze data. Unstructured text takes the form of narratives and notes, as opposed to more organized information typically in databases.

One reason for the slow AI adoption: The change can take a year or more because risk analysts have to train AI how to interpret construction permits, police reports, doctors' notes and other records. Then they have to fine-tune their programs to exclude irrelevant information and spot gaps in the data.

On top of the technological implementation challenges, insurers face cultural hurdles in transitioning to AI-derived solutions. At QBE, for example, the human underwriters still make the final decisions on risk and pricing of commercial properties, with the aid of the Cytora risk score. Over time, as the company becomes more proficient with AI, the technology could assume greater responsibility.

At AXA XL, the AI program is still prone to error, which has to be manually fixed. But the system is being refined with each iteration and is improving, Mr. Ewing said.

A wave of AI adoption could be under way, as most insurers say they have an interest in applying AI, even if they aren't currently testing it, according to a January report from Novarica.

Research firm Celent, based in Boston, said in an August report that most AI investment by insurers will support core insurance activities, such as underwriting and sales, as opposed to back-office functions.

AXA XL is a case in point. Its commercial portfolio comprises bundles of properties that contain hundreds or thousands of facilities in each bundle. Historically, the company's risk consultants only sampled a fraction of the properties in each bundle, leaving most properties unanalyzed.

Using AI, the insurer now analyzes all the properties in each bundle for a better understanding of its risk exposure. Mr. Ewing said the program is becoming more accurate as the software is tweaked, but it is too early to assess the cost implications of AI.

At QBE, the AI program passed the test and is now in use, and the expected result is more precise pricing of insurance policies. The company spent months aggregating, formatting and standardizing legacy data from numerous systems into one AI program, and validating that it worked.

"We believe we'll see a decrease in our loss ratio because we're underwriting with a much more comprehensive view of what the risk really is," Mr. Stuckey said.

The U.S. private sector added 183,000 jobs in February, according to a report released Wednesday, although the gains were smaller than expected as job creation slowed from a strong performance in January.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting the addition of 185,000 jobs last month.

The ADP National Employment Report revised the number of private-sector jobs added in January to 300,000 from 213,000.

The ADP Research Institute and Moody's Analytics produce the monthly report using ADP payroll data to measure the change in seasonally adjusted nonfarm private-sector employment.

"Job gains are still strong, but they have likely seen their high watermark for this expansion," Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in prepared remarks.

Most of the jobs added in February 139,000 were in the service sector, while the rest were in the goods-producing sector.

Medium-size businesses, or those with between 50 and 499 employees, had the strongest job growth last month, adding roughly 95,000 jobs, followed by large businesses with 77,000 and small businesses with 12,000.

Small-business growth has declined as such companies struggle with offering competitive wages and benefits, said Ahu Yildirmaz, ADP Research Institute co-head and vice president, in prepared remarks.

The professional and business-services sector had the largest job growth within the broader services category in February at 49,000, the report says. It was followed by health services and education, which added 37,000 positions, though all of those gains were due to growth in health and social-assistance jobs.

Construction companies added 25,000 jobs in February, while manufacturers created 17,000 positions, according to the report.

Venture Investors Express Disappointment at Resignation of FDA Commissioner Gottlieb; Gottlieb, a former venture capitalist, pushed for more consistent dealings with industry, investors say

Less than two years ago venture capitalists saw one of their own, Scott Gottlieb, take over as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.

Now, they are waving him a wistful goodbye.

Dr. Gottlieb, a medical doctor and former venture partner with New Enterprise Associates, became FDA commissioner in May 2017. On Tuesday the agency said he "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-chief-scott-gottlieb-to-leave-agency-11551816541", to the disappointment of venture investors who saw him and his priorities as positive for their industry and the medical system.

"It is really bad news for health care in our country," Steve Kraus, a partner with Bessemer Venture Partners, said in an email. "He [was] a clear, once-in-a-generation civil-servant star."

Dr. Gottlieb's initiatives affected companies across several industries. He sought to revamp clinical trials, speed approval of generic medications and reduce nicotine in cigarettes. The agency also made an impact in digital health, last year approving a medical device that uses artificial intelligence to detect the eye disease diabetic retinopathy, the first such screening technology that doesn't require a medical professional to interpret the results.

Among venture investors, the more significant change he encouraged was cultural. For years before his appointment, venture capitalists complained the agency was inconsistent in its dealings with industry, something that has been changing more recently, investors say.

"He is a very fair person and he understands the [challenge] of being a drug innovator," said Jay Lichter, managing director of Avalon Ventures. "You've seen some really good changes at FDA a lot more collaboration, a lot more willingness to listen and solve the problem together."

The FDA last year approved a record 59 new drugs, encouraging the view that the agency has been an ally of medical innovation. But in an interview last summer, Dr. Gottlieb said he didn't measure success by the number of new products approved, looking instead at how efficient the agency is in making decisions and providing feedback.

Investors say he succeeded on that last score.

"Scott was a great forward-thinking leader and understood the importance of working with industry to advance innovative medicines," said Atlas Venture Partner Bruce Booth in an email. "Hopefully, the next FDA commissioner will be as much of a champion of innovation as Scott has been."

Group looks to strengthen balance sheet, citing  political uncertainty 

Insurer Direct Line has bolstered its balance sheet and cut payouts to shareholders as it braces itself for Brexit.

Like other insurance companies, Direct Line holds a large amount of bonds which could be vulnerable to economic turbulence.

The company on Tuesday said that its overall payout to shareholders for 2018 would be 17 per cent below the previous year as the size of the special dividend   which Direct Line has paid in each of the past six years   was cut sharply.

Penny James, chief financial officer, said the insurer had decided to strengthen its capital base because of  political uncertainty .

Direct Line s solvency ratio   a measure of capital available as a proportion of the minimum required   stood at 170 per cent at the end of last year, up from 162 per cent a year earlier.

Ms James is due to become chief executive later this year, taking over from Paul Geddes who will step down after 10 years. The two told investors that they would keep the capital base under constant review and would consider the best ways of returning any excess capital to shareholders.

The results were the last for Mr Geddes.  It s good for me to be bowing out on a strong set of results in competitive markets,  he said.

Overall premiums slipped 5 per cent as partnerships with Nationwide and Sainsbury s came to an end, but premiums from the company s own brands rose.

Pre-tax profits increased 8 per cent to 583m though, as lower investment profits and reserve releases were more than offset by lower finance costs.

The regular dividend rose 3 per cent, but the special dividend was cut by 45 per cent, leading to a total payout for the year of 29.3p per share, against 35.4p for 2017.

Analysts said the results were slightly ahead of expectations.

Andreas van Embden, at Peel Hunt, said:  Paul Geddes has successfully steered Direct Line back to a pre-eminent position in the UK insurance market and he leaves [the company] in a strong position. 

The company s shares were flat on Tuesday at 355p, more than double the price at which Mr Geddes floated the company in 2012.

Ms James said her priorities for the next couple of years were to deliver a range of technology improvements that would allow the company to improve its pricing and customer service, and to cut costs.

She also said Direct Line would launch a brand called Darwin, which would be rolled out on price comparison sites.  It is a little like building your own start-up,  she said.  It will use different pricing techniques based on machine learning. 

According to Citi analyst James Shuck, Direct Line s market share in motor insurance sold on price comparison sites is just 6 per cent, which is well below its share of the wider motor market.

Technology

Four in 10 of Europe's "artificial intelligence" start-ups use no artificial intelligence programs in their products, according to a report that highlights the hype around the technology.

The research by MMC Ventures, a London-based investment firm, could not find evidence, based on public information and interviews with executives, of artificial intelligence applications at 40 per cent of 2,830 "AI" start-ups in Europe.

Nevertheless, the companies are often described as AI-focused, said David Kelnar, MMC's head of research, who added that many start-ups had plans to develop machine learning programs in the future.

Skyscape, for example, a Londonbased start-up that analyses rooftops to find space for drone landings, urban farms and other projects, does not use machine learning or artificial intelligence, but is classified as an AI start-up. "Our work today is increasing our data and knowledge to allow the implementation of AI," said Brandon Bell, chief executive and founder. "It's not as easy as just switching on AI. A lot of preparation work is required."

The start-up's website says: "Skyscape uses AI to analyse rooftops and identify opportunities to maximise utilisation and address urban challenges".

Companies branded as "AI" businesses have historically raised larger funding rounds and secured higher valuations than other software businesses. The median funding round for an "AI" start-up last year was about 15 per cent higher than for a software start-up, the research showed.

"A lot of venture capital groups in Europe are responsive to companies that are interested in raising money [for AI]," Mr Kelnar said.

The term "artificial intelligence" has been applied to a variety of technologies, from simple computer programs that automate tasks to more complex neural networks, which are systems for processing data, and machine learning algorithms.

The widespread use of the term has made it difficult for venture capital investors to distinguish between actual and purported "AI" businesses.

"There are different levels of sophistication when it comes to building these algorithms and many hype up the claims of what they're actually building," said Ophelia Brown, a partner at Blossom Capital. "It's the responsibility of the investor to do due diligence on the company ... but a lot of firms are not able to do it."

Politicians have contributed to enthusiasm for companies that work in "AI" by touting artificial intelligence success stories and ringfencing funds for the sector.

European countries have become particularly well known for nurturing AI businesses and seen an explosion of start-ups targeting health, finance and the media.

Almost 8 per cent of European startups founded last year were AI companies, up from 3 per cent in 2015, MMC's research showed, with the UK taking the lead.

One Equity Partners' software developer Orion Systems Integrators LLC is acquiring outsourced product development provider MERA Group.

The merger would nearly double the roughly $30 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Orion had at the time of One Equity's original investment, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Zurich-based MERA Group specializes in customized software services, including product architecture, design, implementation, integration and product management.

Edison, N.J.-based Orion provides outsourced software development services, including information technology architecture, application development and support, data analytics, testing and assurance, managed services and project management. Its clients operate across industries that span financial services, education, health care, communications, professional services and sports operations.

MERA generally works with companies in industries that include telecommunications equipment providers, automotive and transportation as well as financial technology.

Chip Schorr, a senior managing director at One Equity Partners, said the firm began looking at MERA around the same time it started considering an investment in Orion. The deal for Orion closed last October and One Equity started talks with MERA last summer.

Mr. Schorr said the marriage of the companies provides "two pillars" of outsourced software development for its customers. Orion specializes in automation, while MERA focuses on outsourced product development.

"One of the things we love about it is every business in the world is consuming more and more software to sell to their customers or [to] consume internally to automate processes," Mr. Schorr said.

New York-based One Equity invests in companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between $10 million and $70 million. It focuses on companies in the health care, technology and technology services as well as industrials and related services industries.

The firm announced in February that it was combining Merfish Pipe & Supply Inc., a carbon steel standard pipe distributor the firm backed in 2013, with United Pipe & Supply Co., another provider of the same kind of pipes.

AI Speeds Up Reimbursements at Auto-Glass Company; Safelite is launching a system that is expected to improve the process used to repay shop owners for parts they buy

Safelite Group Inc., a company best known for its vehicle glass repair and replacement service, is integrating artificial intelligence with robotic process-automation tools to speed up and improve the way it reimburses shop owners for the parts they buy.

Safelite operates 720 facilities around the country and runs a mobile unit that travels to customer locations to perform repairs. But another part of Safelite's business is handling third-party claims on behalf of more than 200 car insurance carriers and it works with a network of 7,500 glass-replacement companies that handle windshield, car window or other repairs.

The network shops buy replacement parts and send in proof of purchases to Safelite, which then matches the receipts with the insurance claim reference numbers and pays the repair shops.

The entire process is labor intensive. The shops email or fax purchase receipts to Safelite for reimbursement. The receipts from parts providers come in different formats and shop owners often write in the customer reference numbers on the purchase order. Safelite customer-service representatives have to decipher the handwriting on the receipts before matching it with a claim.

"A really monotonous and repetitive thing that they have to do," said Bruce Millard, Safelite's vice president of digital and customer innovation.

To improve the process, Safelite looked to a combination of robotic process-automation technologies, which automate repetitive business tasks; Google Cloud Vision API image recognition; and Google Cloud Natural Language text analysis. Development was done in the fourth quarter of last year and Safelite is currently launching the system.

With the new system, proof of purchase documents are emailed to Safelite and directed to the system, which automatically opens the emails, pulls down any attachments, and passes proof of purchase documents on to the Google services. The Google services work together to read the proof of purchase images, detect the handwritten reference numbers and then match those numbers to an open claim to make a match.

Safelite found in testing that the system was able to perform a match 90% of the time, Mr. Millard said. With the new setup, the customer-service team will be able to spend their time reviewing the proof of purchases to ensure the charges are valid.

"This is getting the mechanics stuff in place where the humans can do the value-added work that needs to be done," Mr. Millard said.

More companies are starting to integrate AI and robotic process automation, said JT Kostman, leader for applied artificial intelligence and frontier technologies at Grant Thornton LLP. The audit, tax and advisory firm last month released the findings of a chief information officer survey that found that these executives are looking to AI and RPA as key technologies for future deployment.

"Within the last year to two years we've seen more of a change than we've seen collectively in the history of the time we've been doing RPA," Mr. Kostman said.

Still, there are steps companies need to take to ensure a smooth implementation.

For Safelite, Mr. Millard said, "the biggest challenge is getting the core IT team comfortable working with this new technology."

He said the key was getting the staff to understand what they needed to know and what they didn't about the system. Some wondered if they would be required to become data scientists. But Mr. Millard assured them that they didn't since Safelite decided to go with off-the-shelf technology.

Discover's Robots Screen Borrowers

Discount-store shoppers may soon get an unexpected benefit: better odds when applying for personal loans from Discover Financial Services.

Discover, best known for its credit cards, plans to use artificial intelligence to assess hundreds of unusual characteristics about personal-loan applicants in an attempt to get its rising losses under control.

A history of discount-store shopping, for example, will boost an applicant's chances of getting a personal loan, according to people familiar with the matter, while writing the full legal name of an employer on a loan application will lower it.

Applicants who report high incomes will be flagged as potentially more risky, the people said.

The new methodology will apply to U.S. consumers who apply for personal loans starting around the second half of the year, they added.

Lenders for decades primarily used information found on consumers' credit reports and scores to assess potential borrowers. In recent years, however, more lenders have been using more data -- such as bank-account balances and utility payments -- when making credit decisions. The lenders largely are looking for information that will allow them to approve more borrowers without taking on significantly more risk.

Discover has an additional reason for turning to new data sources: It is trying to get a handle on losses on personal loans. The lender has tightened underwriting standards and cut back on approvals, denying a larger percentage of applicants who didn't receive a solicitation from the company. Yet losses have continued to pile up.

Borrowers use these unsecured loans -- a fast-growing slice of the consumer-credit business -- to fund home renovations and vacations, among other things. The loans aren't secured by a house or car, so lenders have little recourse if borrowers stop paying.

The personal-loan market remains small compared with credit cards, auto loans and student loans, which each top $1 trillion in outstanding balances. Personal-loan balances totaled a record $138 billion at the end of 2018, according to TransUnion.

Discover wrote off 4.5% of personal-loan balances in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.2% and 2% of credit-card and private student-loan balances, respectively. Personal loans are the worst performer among the company's credit offerings.

The company also is trying to root out swindlers applying for credit with fake identities and made-up or stolen information.

Industrywide, $32.7 million of personal loan balances were owed by suspected fake identities as of the second quarter of 2018, up about 23% from the end of 2017, according to TransUnion. A Discover spokesman declined to comment on the company's fraud rates.

"We're looking for people who won't pay us back. It could be because they can't afford to or that it was fraudulent from the beginning," Discover Chief Executive Roger Hochschild said in an interview.

ZestFinance, which develops AI software for financial companies, is working with Discover on the effort.

Hundreds of data points gathered from loan applications and elsewhere will be considered in the underwriting process, according to people familiar with the matter. Among those who will be viewed with more suspicion: applicants who claim income in the low six figures or higher -- well beyond the median for U.S. households -- and those who list an employer's full legal name, a possible sign a swindler is copying and pasting information, the people said.

On the other hand, applicants who call Discover from a landline or cellphone, rather than Skype or other internet-phone services, will be considered safer bets because they're easier to trace back to an individual, the people added.

The new underwriting process also could help Discover approve applicants it might have previously denied.

ZestFinance tested the new methodology last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Discover gave the company a batch of loan applications from prior years, and ZestFinance ran the applicants through a new underwriting process, the person said. Using the additional data, ZestFinance was able to identify some approved applicants who ultimately defaulted, the person added.

"We're at an inflection point in the use of data for underwriting," said Douglas Merrill, CEO of ZestFinance and a former chief information officer at Google.

INTERVIEW State governor wants fund to pay out more to help recession-hit economy

Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation Assets $65bn Employees 61 Established 1980 (the fund itself was created in 1976 and the initial investment made in 1977) Headquarters Juneau As chief executive of Alaska's sovereign wealth fund, Angela Rodell leads an organisation that has a vital role in sustaining North America's last frontier state. The $65bn Alaska Permanent fund, which was established with just $734,000 in 1977, was created to channel state royalties earned from oil and mining activities into financial investments to benefit future generations.

Alaska's oil-rich economy, however, is mired in recession and politicians want more help from the fund, which pays an annual cash dividend to all eligible citizens.

Mike Dunleavy, the state governor, has proposed that larger dividends should be paid over the next three years to make up for cuts introduced in 2016. This plan is under debate in Alaska's legislature so Ms Rodell treads carefully when I ask if she favours a higher payout.

"Alaska has been in recession for the last three years. Many citizens feel that an unchanged dividend could have helped to alleviate the economic downturn," she says.

Alaska Permanent is structured as two pools. A $46bn protected principal pool and an $18.7bn earnings reserve account (ERA), which can be spent on dividends and other government activities. With Alaska's deficit forecast to reach $1.6bn in the year ending June 2019, pressure is growing for the fund to contribute more.

Annual withdrawals are scheduled to rise over the next three years to about 5.25 per cent of the fund's assets, more than double the previous rate. It is yet to be decided how those withdrawals will be split between dividend payments and other priorities. "The withdrawals should be manageable but it does mean that the fund will not grow at the same rate as in the past. However, if the rules on withdrawals continue to be rewritten, then the fund could become depleted," cautions Ms Rodell.

Further changes in the withdrawal rules may also impinge on the fund's investment policies. "We cannot commit to the 10-year illiquid alternative investments which have performed so well for the fund if we have a debate every year about withdrawals," she notes.

The fund has delivered annualised returns of 8.9 per cent since its inception. Recent performance has improved. Helped by larger allocations to private equity, the fund has generated returns of 2.1 percentage points above its passive benchmark in the five years up to June 2018, creating an additional $4.7bn in value. "We can show where the investment teams have added alpha but we have to work on keeping talent if we want to maintain this level of performance. We can't take it for granted," Ms Rodell says during a visit to London in February.

Even so, Alaska Permanent faces a wage and hiring freeze that is already in place in other branches of the state's government. Ms Rodell worries that this could hit staff retention. Plans to introduce an incentive compensation scheme for investment staff have been scrapped. "We were not proposing million-dollar bonuses but the compensation scheme is dead in the water," she says.

MSCI, the indices and data analytics provider, poached Russell Read, the fund's chief investment officer, in 2018. "We have been successful at finding talent that wants a certain lifestyle but the industry is a global playing field," says Ms Rodell.

Life in Alaska appeals to the 51-year old who, outside of work, enjoys walking her Labrador retriever. "He's a 'climb any mountain, jump on any boat' kind of dog. Ten minutes down a trail from Juneau and there's no mobile phone signal."

The hiring freeze will disrupt plans to bring more investment management in-house. Most of its fixed-income portfolios are run internally, which saves $15m a year in fees.

Dressed casually in a white denim jacket, Ms Rodell was speaking after a flight from Dubai where she met potential partners for the Middle East, Africa and South Asia-focused fund created by Alaska Permanent in 2017. Although jet-lagged, she was comfortable answering questions without any PR staff present.

An eye-catching initiative agreed last year was a joint venture with RPMI Railpen, the pension fund for UK railway workers, and Wafra Capital Partners, a New York manager acting on behalf of the Public Institution For Social Security of Kuwait. The three have together allocated an initial $700m into Capital Constellation which will invest in promising private equity and alternatives managers.

Efforts to internationalise Alaska Permanent's investments stand in contrast to its policies in its home territory, where its only asset is the headquarters building in Juneau. An ex-employee who declined to be named says more assets should be invested in Alaska, following the example set by sovereign wealth funds in Singapore and Abu Dhabi.

Ms Rodell's reluctance to change the policy on in-state investments has led to tension between her and the board, he says. Pressed on this point, Ms Rodell responds that the CEO alone cannot set the fund's investment policy. The statutes also prohibit it from considering non-economic interests, such as job creation, and required that any in-state allocations must provide the same return and risk profile as non-Alaskan investments.

Climate change poses a threat to Alaska's fragile environment but the fund has decided against adopting the objectives of the 2015 Paris conference. Ms Rodell defends this position, noting that much of the fund's income has derived from royalties from mining and oil companies.

It is set to allocate $200m to upand-coming managers and some of this could go to companies developing alternative energy technologies to benefit Alaskan citizens.

"We are also looking at the opportunities presented by Arctic ice melt in logistics and shipping," she says.

A bigger debate about the fund's future lies ahead, most probably in state elections next year. "There has to be a deeper conversation about the fund and its objectives to ensure that it continues to serve the interests of all Alaska's citizens," says Ms Rodell.

Alaska Permanent chief navigates political demands

Angela Rodell talks about withdrawals, keeping her staff and climate change

As chief executive of Alaska s sovereign wealth fund, Angela Rodell leads an organisation that has a vital role in sustaining North America s last frontier state.

The $65bn Alaska Permanent Fund, which was established with just $734,000 in 1977, was created to channel state royalties earned from the mining and oil sectors into financial investments to benefit future generations.

Alaska s oil-rich economy, however, has been mired in recession and politicians want more help from the fund, which pays an annual cash dividend to eligible citizens.

Mike Dunleavy, the state governor, has proposed that larger dividends should be paid over the next three years to make up for cuts introduced in 2016. This plan is under debate in Alaska s legislature so Ms Rodell treads carefully when I ask if she favours a higher payout.

 Alaska has been in recession for the last three years. Many citizens feel that an unchanged dividend could have helped to alleviate the economic downturn,  she says.

Alaska Permanent is structured as two pools. A $46bn protected principal pool and an $18.7bn earnings reserve account (ERA), which can be spent on dividends and other government activities.

With Alaska s budget deficit forecast to reach $1.6bn in the fiscal year ending June 2019, pressure is growing for the fund to contribute more.

Annual withdrawals are scheduled to rise over the next three years to about 5.25 per cent of the fund s assets, more than double the previous rate. It is yet to be decided how those withdrawals will be split between dividend payments and other priorities.

 The withdrawals should be manageable but it does mean that the fund will not grow at the same rate as in the past. However, if the rules on withdrawals continue to be rewritten, then the fund could become depleted,  cautions Ms Rodell.

Further changes in the withdrawal rules may also impinge on the fund s investment policies.

 We cannot commit to the 10-year illiquid alternative investments which have performed so well for the fund if we have a debate every year about withdrawals. That uncertainty probably mean investing more in low-yielding fixed-income assets,  she notes.

The fund has delivered annualised returns of 8.9 per cent since its inception. Recent performance has improved. Helped by larger allocations to private equity, the fund has generated returns of 2.1 percentage points above its passive benchmark in the five years to June 2018, creating an additional $4.7bn in value.

 We can show where the investment teams have added alpha but we have to work on keeping talent if we want to maintain this level of performance. We can t take it for granted,  Ms Rodell said during a visit to London in February.

Even so, Alaska Permanent faces a wage and hiring freeze that is in place in other branches of the state s government.

Ms Rodell worries that this could undermine morale and hit staff retention. Plans to introduce an incentive compensation scheme for investment staff have been scrapped.

 We were not proposing million-dollar bonuses but the incentive compensation scheme is dead in the water,  she says, adding that the staff are  mission-focused .

MSCI, the indices and data analytics provider, poached Russell Read, the fund s chief investment officer, in 2018.

 We have been successful at finding talent that wants a certain lifestyle but the finance industry is a global playing field with competition from London, Hong Kong and the Middle East,  says Ms Rodell.

The outdoor Alaskan lifestyle appeals to who the 51-year-old, outside work, enjoys walking her Labrador.  He s a  climb any mountain, jump on any boat  kind of dog. Ten minutes down a trail from Juneau and there s no mobile phone signal. 

The hiring freeze will disrupt plans to bring more investment management capabilities in-house. Most of its fixed-income portfolios are run internally, which saves about $15m a year in fees.

 We would like to bring more in-house to help lower the cost of investing. It also promotes a better alignment of interests in decision-making, especially in alternatives, which in turn generates better returns,  says Ms Rodell.

Dressed casually in a white denim jacket, Ms Rodell was speaking after an overnight flight from Dubai where she met potential partners for the Middle East, Africa and South Asia-focused fund created by Alaska Permanent in 2017. Although jet-lagged, Ms Rodell was upbeat and comfortable answering questions without any public relations or media staff present during the interview.

An eye-catching initiative agreed last year was a joint venture with RPMI Railpen, the pension fund for UK railway workers, and Wafra Capital Partners, a New York manager acting on behalf of the Public Institution for Social Security of Kuwait. The three partners have together allocated an initial $700m into Capital Constellation, which will invest in promising private equity and alternatives managers.

These efforts to internationalise Alaska Permanent s investments stand in contrast to its policies in its home territory, where its only asset is the headquarters building in Juneau, the state s capital.

A senior ex-employee who declined to be named said that more of the fund s assets should be invested in Alaska, following the example set by sovereign wealth funds in Singapore and Abu Dhabi.

Ms Rodell s reluctance to change the policy on in-state investments has led to tension between her and the board, he says.

Pressed on this point, Ms Rodell responds that the chief executive alone cannot set the fund s investment policy. The fund s statutes also prohibit it from considering non-economic interests, such as job creation, and require that any in-state allocations must provide the same return and risk profile as non-Alaskan investments.

Climate change poses a profound threat to Alaska s fragile environment but the fund has decided against adopting the objectives on limiting global warming agreed at the landmark Paris conference in 2015 as part of its investment framework.

Ms Rodell defends this position, noting that much of the fund s income over the past 40 years has derived from royalties from mining and oil companies.

The fund is set to allocate $200m to up-and-coming managers and some of this could go to companies developing alternative energy technologies to benefit Alaskan citizens.

 We are also looking at the opportunities presented by Arctic ice melt in logistics and shipping,  she says.

A bigger debate about the fund s future lies ahead, most probably in state elections next year.

 There has to be a deeper conversation about the fund and its objectives to ensure that it continues to serve the interests of all of Alaska s citizens,  says Ms Rodell.

European Banks Tighten Belts to Fund Compliance Investments; Financial institutions are investing in technology and adding staff as regulators increase scrutiny

European banks are investing more resources in staff and technology to spot financial crime following a recent string of money-laundering scandals. In some cases, they're cutting costs elsewhere in the enterprise to fund the initiatives.

In recent weeks, ABN Amro Group NV in Amsterdam and Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt voluntarily disclosed, for the first time, details about increases in spending on anti-money-laundering compliance. Amsterdam-based ING Groep NV, meanwhile, said it boosted investments in its defenses in part by using cash freed up from expense cuts elsewhere.

Banks with global operations, not just in Europe, have been spending more on compliance-related technology, including systems powered by artificial intelligence, and hiring employees with advanced training in areas such as data science, said Walter Mix, managing director at Berkeley Research Group, who advises banks on anti-money-laundering regulations. The investments have put pressure on banks' bottom lines, he said.

Banks in Europe "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-ends-scandal-plagued-2018-with-plan-to-target-money-laundering-11545926517"to demonstrate they have strengthened their money-laundering detection tools. Europe has been rocked by high-profile money-laundering scandals over the past year, including"https://www.wsj.com/articles/danske-banks-finds-more-than-200-billion-in-transactions-at-branch-suspected-of-money-laundering-1537345254"by Denmark's Danske Bank A/S that it allowed  200 billion ($230 billion) in Russia-linked transactions to flow through a small branch in Estonia.

Incidents such as these have elevated scrutiny on the systems European banks are using to monitor transactions and assess risk. That could prompt more lenders to disclose their compliance investments in the future, said Robin van den Broek, an analyst with Mediobanca SpA.

"With the regulator putting more focus on this and reputation and high fines at risk, I think it makes sense to expect a reaction in the form of more disclosure," he said.

Regulatory scrutiny was a factor behind ABN Amro's decision to accelerate its planned investments in customer due diligence, Kees van Dijkhuizen, the company's chief executive, said during the bank's earnings call this month.

ABN Amro took an  85 million provision during the fourth quarter to cover the cost of technology and staff that will help the bank verify customer information and spot suspicious transactions. That's in addition to at least  100 million ABN Amro had already budgeted for in 2018, according to the company.

"Down the road this year, we might have other provisions," Mr. van Dijkhuizen said during the call. Since 2013, ABN has tripled the number of employees who work on client due diligence, to about 1,000, he said.

Commerzbank, meanwhile, said it has spent an additional  600 million on compliance since 2015, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/commerzbank-to-settle-u-s-allegations-of-sanctions-and-money-laundering-violations-1426177346"by U.S. authorities into allegations of sanctions and money-laundering violations. The bank agreed to install an independent monitor as part of the settlement.

The investments, made under the guidance of the bank's U.S. monitor, have gone toward implementing a more robust model for managing risks, as well as an enhanced transaction-monitoring and sanctions-screening system. Commerzbank said it also plans to invest in automation within its compliance division.

The additional compliance spending was financed in part by belt-tightening and job cuts elsewhere in the bank, the company said during a Feb. 13 call with analysts.

"This is a price worth paying and is money well spent," Stephan Engels, Commerzbank's chief financial officer, said during the call.

ING's spending on financial-crimes controls has also increased, as it adds staff to strengthen the systems it uses to verify customer identities and information, the bank said this month. ING didn't provide details on costs. Total operating expenses, however, declined 2% from a year earlier, to  2.6 billion.

ING in September"https://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-goes-harder-on-money-laundering-with-record-ing-fine-1536072973" to settle an investigation by Dutch prosecutors into alleged failings in its anti-money-laundering controls.

VC Daily: Meet Lyft's Earliest VC Backer | Seed-Stage Startups Adjust to Smaller Rounds

Good day. Lyft Inc.'s filing to go public has finally arrived, bringing with it a rundown of its top shareholders. Did you know one its first venture backers remains a key institutional owner, including holding a board seat? WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron's piece today will tell you who that is, along with the back story of the company's earliest funding rounds.

And now on to the news...

In the News

From Zimride to Lyft-off: When seed-stage firm Floodgate invested in what is now Lyft in 2010, the startup was called Zimride and its main customers were ride-sharing college commuters.

The firm invested out of its maiden $35 million fund at a $5 million valuation, as Floodgate was one of the first two venture funds to back the company.

For Floodgate, based in Palo Alto, Calif., the investment in Lyft was meaningful on several levels. It gave the firm a feather in its cap as it sought to raise future funds and take stakes in other startups. Floodgate has gone on to raise four more funds, including its latest in 2017, a $131 million vehicle.

The firm sold a sizable portion of its stake several years later to lock in gains, according to a person familiar with the matter. Floodgate still holds about 1.5 million shares, according to Lyft's IPO filing Friday. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has the scoop.

But one of the biggest beneficiaries of Lyft's IPO lies across the Pacific, writes WSJ's Jacky Wong.

NEA's fresh start: One of the nation's largest venture firms is attempting to raise its biggest fund to date following a string of changes to its investment team.

New Enterprise Associates is looking for $3.6 billion for its New Enterprise Associates 17 LP fund, according to a regulatory filing. At that level it would be second only to Sequoia Capital, which raised $8 billion last year for its new global growth fund.

New on NEA's roster of general partners is Carmen Chang, who joined the firm in 2012, and serves as its chairman and head of Asia. Longtime NEA health-care investors Ali Behbahani and Paul Walker are also listed as GPs on the new fund, while they weren't previously. An NEA spokeswoman declined to comment on fundraising. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the story.

Brain train: A term like "brain-computer interface technology" might not roll off the tongue as easily as "AI" or "robotics." But that may change before long.

Investors who are active in the nascent field say so-called BCI companies just got a big boost now that regulators are pushing to speed this futuristic technology out of the lab and onto the medical-device market.

Advances in technology and biological understanding in the past few years have paved the way for broader investor interest in BCI startups such as Paradromics Inc. and Kernel Co., said Enke Bashllari, who heads Arkitekt Ventures, a backer of Paradromics.

Adds Ms. Bashllari: "Neuroscience, computing power and hardware are all coming together now as the next big industry, and I predict in the next three years, it will be just as buzzy as artificial intelligence has been." WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

Gormley's Take: Startups Make Do With More Modest Fundraising

By Brian Gormley

Venture capitalists are playing things safer when betting on innovations in eye care.

That's forcing leaders of early-stage companies in the sector to adapt by making do with smaller chunks of capital.

Venture investment in ophthalmology businesses topped $1 billion in 2018, but mature companies drew more interest than raw startups, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones & Co.

That means early-stage companies must fight for funding, and often tap sources other than venture capitalists.

"They have to be scrappy and resourceful to get access to adequate capital," said Bill Link, managing partner of ophthalmology-focused investment firm Flying L Partners.

Not long ago, there was more funding for the earliest-stage startups developing treatments for eye conditions, but recently capital has flowed more readily to companies with products on the market. In each year since 2011, the largest category of vision startups raising venture capital has been revenue-generating companies, according to VentureSource.

More in Gormley's Take

Exits

Verizon Communications Inc. acquired ProtectWise Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Denver-based ProtectWise provides a cloud-delivered enterprise security platform for threat detection and other security issues. The company was backed by investors including Arsenal Venture Partners, Top Tier Capital Partners and Tola Capital.

New Money

Scooter wars continue to heat up abroad. Voi Technology, a Stockholm-based electric-scooter startup, raised a $30 million from investors including European firms Vostok New Ventures and Balderton Capital, with participation by San Francisco-based Raine Ventures.

U.S.-based Lime and Bird compete with Voi in European cities such as Paris and Madrid. In October, Berlin-based Tier Mobility raised a roughly $27 million round led by Stockholm's Northzone Ventures and has moved into several European cities in recent weeks, including Madrid. Tier already competes with Lime and Bird in Vienna, Austria.

Kuli Kuli Inc., an Oakland, Calif.-based maker of snacks with the superfood moringa, raised $5 million in Series B funding. Griffith Foods and eighteen94 capital led the round, with participation from investors including InvestEco and S2G Ventures. "https://www.kulikulifoods.com"

Breathe Life, a Montreal-based insurance software startup, landed 4.5 million Canadian dollars ($3.4 million) in seed funding. Diagram Ventures led the round and was joined by Real Ventures. "https://www.breathelife.com"

Coin Metrics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based provider of cryptoasset market and network data, closed a $1.9 million seed round. Castle Island Ventures led the investment, with participation from Fidelity Investments, Highland Capital Partners and Dragonfly Capital. "https://www.coinmetrics.io"

People

ExecThread Inc., a New York-based peer-to-peer job sharing network, appointed Ryann Richardson as president. Ms. Richardson joins the company from on-demand private jet marketplace Victor, where she was vice president of North American marketing.

Impossible Foods named Vanessa Wittman to its board of directors. Ms. Wittman previously held chief financial officer positions at Oath, Dropbox, Motorola Mobility and Marsh & McLennan Cos.

Cambridge, Ontario-based eSentire raised an additional $47 million from Warburg Pincus and minority investors Georgian Partners and Edison Partners. Warburg Pincus became a majority backer in the company through an investment made in 2017.

Founded in 2001, eSentire offers managed detection and response services to roughly 700 organizations. It monitors network data, identifies security threats and shuts them down when detected.

The company will use the new capital largely toward investing further in its technology platform, said eSentire Chief Executive Kerry Bailey, who previously worked at Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP and Terremark Worldwide Inc. It will also consider potential acquisitions to boost its technology offerings and geographic footprint.

"The security industry is at a tipping point right now," he said, adding that the digitization happening across the technology sector has forced traditional security businesses to rethink their operations.

The cybersecurity sector is increasingly shifting toward services from products and such disruption is fueling private-equity investment in newer security companies, Mr. Bailey explained. ESentire is among those riding the wave, with revenue growing at 50% annually. The company itself bought artificial intelligence business Versive Inc. in October.

Recent deals in the space include CACI International Inc.'s $750 million purchase of LGS Innovations from Madison Dearborn Partners and Battery Ventures' $29 million investment in Guardsquare NV.

New York-based Warburg Pincus has been an active backer of cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike Inc. and Contrast Security Inc. The private-equity firm invests across a wide range of sectors: energy; financial services; health-care and consumer; industrial and business services; and technology, media and telecommunications.

Chief David Schwimmer says he will prioritise investment for longer-term growth

The London Stock Exchange Group is to cut 250 jobs as its new chief executive David Schwimmer reset earnings targets and signalled he would prioritise making investments for longer-term growth.

In his first set of earnings since taking over in August last year, Mr Schwimmer said the LSE s businesses continued to perform well and it was  very well prepared for whatever comes from a Brexit situation .

The cuts cover about 5 per cent of the LSE s workforce and will be global. Contracting jobs as well as full-time employees will be affected. The LSE will also reduce the number of offices in New York, and the programme is expected to cost about 30m to implement, while generating annual savings of about 30m.

Mr Schwimmer, who has been largely silent since taking over the role from his predecessor Xavier Rolet, stressed the job cuts had nothing to do with the UK s planned departure from the EU in four weeks  time.

 It s a broader efficiency initiative we re working on,  he said. After a series of deals in recent years,  we have found some duplications .

He also used Friday s annual results to announce the LSE was abandoning targets on earnings margins in favour of further investment in its post-trade and data and analytics businesses.

In 2017 Mr Rolet had set the group targets of making earnings before interest, depreciation, amortisation margins of 55 per cent this year; in 2018 the LSE hit 49.9 per cent.

 Inevitably there s a balancing act between investing for incremental growth and trying to drive for efficiencies. We are still aiming for that target but I m not giving a specific timeframe for it,  he said.

In Mr Schwimmer s first few months the LSE has bought a 4.9 per cent stake in Euroclear for  279m, giving it a minority stake and seat on the board in the Brussels-based central securities depository. It also tightened its grip on LCH, the clearing house, paying  424.5m (382m) to a group of selling banks and exchanges, to raise its stake by 14 per cent to 82.6 per cent.

Chris Turner, analyst at Berenberg, said dropping the target was  disappointing but widely anticipated by investors, and is unlikely to be taken particularly negatively . Shares in the group rose almost 3 per cent to 46.36.

Other growth targets set in 2017, such as turnover for the group and subsidiaries such as LCH and FTSE Russell, the index business, remain.  Overall we suspect 2020 numbers won t move much at all and, given investors usually buy the LSE for revenue growth, this strikes us as fine, if a bit frustrating,  said Philip Middleton, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Mr Schwimmer also said the LSE was prepared for a no-deal Brexit. Rival Deutsche Brse has tried to pull clearing of euro-denominated swaps from London to Frankfurt, but to little success.

 Brexit has provided an interesting marketing opportunity for our competitors 	. 	. 	. 	but there has been no discernible change in our position or market share,  he said.

For the year to December 31 total revenues at the LSE rose 8 per cent to 1.9bn while operating profit rose 14 per cent to 751m on a constant currency basis.

GE CEO Letters Decoded: Shrinking Ambitions and Disappearing Buzzwords; A look at how Larry Culp's first shareholder missive compares with ones written by Jeff Immelt and John Flannery

By Inti Pacheco and Stephanie Stamm 
1,315 words

Larry Culp's first shareholder letter as General Electric Co.'s CEO was relatively brief and deployed less frequently some words and phrases that longtime leader Jeff Immelt often used to define the goals of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-powered-the-american-centurythen-it-burned-out-11544796010".

The shorter missive reflects changes in GE itself, which has had three CEOs in three years, can only afford to pay a token dividend and is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-to-sell-biopharma-business-to-danaher-for-21-4-billion-11551096661". The company lost some $200 billion in market value over two years and was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year.

Here's a look at how Mr. Culp's letter, released this week, compares with ones written by his two immediate predecessors: Mr. Immelt, who left in 2017, and John Flannery, who was replaced in October after 14 months.

LENGTH

The biggest difference is length. Mr. Immelt's last letter was 7,760 words and discussed his vision for GE as well as political and economic forces. "Your company delivered in a year of sluggish growth and geopolitical surprise," Mr. Immelt wrote as he looked back on 2016. The letter was his last after 16 years as CEO but was released before the depths of GE's problems were known. "The investments we are making to become a Digital Industrial will create the next level of growth."

Mr. Flannery's only such annual letter as CEO, which came in early 2018 after he had slashed GE's dividend but was still debating whether to break apart the conglomerate, was just under 5,000 words. He focused on the challenges the company faced and changes they required. "GE had a very tough year," wrote Mr. Flannery, who spent three decades at GE before getting the top job. "There are things we need to fix. But we can. We know how to. And we will."

Mr. Culp, an outsider who took over as CEO in October 2018 and is moving ahead with plans to shrink the company, came in at 2,788 words. He wrote about room for improvement and needing to get on firmer financial footing. "We are embracing our reality and executing the plan we've laid out," he wrote, "Now it's more about what we do than what we say."

BUZZWORDS

Mr. Immelt used catchphrases such as "industrial internet" and "additive manufacturing" to describe ideas that he saw as key to GE's future. But some of those concepts and others such as the GE Store, where business units would tap central research and sales groups were mentioned less frequently over time, as was the data-analysis software Predix. Neither Mr. Flannery nor Mr. Culp mentioned the GE Store.

Some of those terms are remnants of GE Digital, a software unit outside San Francisco that was touted by Mr. Immelt but drastically scaled back after his exit. GE reached a deal last year to sell part of its digital business and plans to move the rest into a newly created company. Neither Mr. Flannery nor Mr. Culp referred to GE as a "digital industrial" company, a phrase used seven times by Mr. Immelt in 2017.

WORD FREQUENCY

Excluding generic terms like "GE" and "business," Mr. Culp's most-commonly used words were "need" and "improve." And he used both of them more frequently than his successors. "We need to radically change how we operate across GE," Mr. Culp wrote. "We need to shift our lens back to the customer and work backward to improve what matters to them."

Mr. Flannery used the word "team" far more often than either Mr. Culp or Mr. Immelt once every 180 words, on average, compared with every 250 words in Mr. Culp's letter and every 450 words in Mr. Immelt's longer letter. "Our leadership team, board and employees have devoted meaningful time to identifying lessons we ought to learn and how we ought to be applying them," Mr. Flannery wrote.

For Mr. Immelt, the words "global" and "growth" stood out, appearing far more frequently in his letter than those of his successors, even after adjusting for the length of his letter. "We see many giving up on globalization, that means more for us," he wrote, shortly after President Trump's election.

DIVISIONS

As business conditions changed, so did the parts of GE that got the most attention from the boss in his annual missive.

GE Power has been saddled with excess inventory and manufacturing capacity as global demand slowed. It also struggled with the integration of Alstom, a French rival acquired in 2015. Mr. Immelt mentioned Alstom nine times; his successors barely mentioned it, even as they detailed "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-power-has-a-92-billion-backlog-for-new-boss-thats-a-problem-11550068479" that triggered a $22 billion write-down in 2018.

In his letter, Mr. Immelt wrote about Alstom improving the power division. A year later, Mr. Flannery dedicated an entire section to the new strategy he planned for the troubled unit. "Reset, Refocus, and Renew GE Power," he wrote. This year, Mr. Culp said the division faced challenges in 2018 and it was necessary to run it better.

If there is one thing that all CEOs agreed on, it is on making GE Capital smaller, which has been a theme at the company for more than a decade. Though shrunken, the lending business has been a drag on results after GE uncovered shortfalls in a legacy insurance unit that forced it to boost its reserves by $15 billion.

In his letter, Mr. Culp wrote about a strategy to reduce risk on the balance sheet of GE Capital. Mr. Flannery expressed disappointment in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ges-capital-dilemma-keep-or-sell-jet-leasing-business-11548846000", talking about cuts to the company's dividend and employment, and Mr. Immelt before him highlighted the sale of the division's assets.

SENTIMENT

The text in each letter was analyzed using a natural language processing tool that assigned each sentence a score for sentiment. All three CEO letters skewed positive, with less than 15% of sentences getting negative sentiment scores. Here are some of the sentences that received very positive and negative scores from each CEO's letter.

Immelt

Positive:

"We win by being a valuable, global company and by engaging members of every community we operate in all over the world." (score=1.0)

Negative:

"Many fears of the American workforce are created by a lack of competitiveness." (score=-0.5)

Flannery

Positive:

"The best people, the best culture this is what makes everything else possible." (score=0.7)

Negative:

"As difficult as 2017 was for everyone connected with GE, it was also a chance to reflect on what this company means and why it exists." (score=-0.5)

Culp:

Positive:

"What I found were talented colleagues from all over the world with grit, resolve, and intelligence." (score=0.7)

Negative:

"We also took the painful but necessary action of reducing GE's dividend, allowing GE to retain approximately $4 billion of cash a year compared with the prior payout level." (score=-0.2)

METHODOLOGY:

The Wall Street Journal analyzed the shareholder letter portion of GE's annual report using natural-language processing libraries for Python, including TextBlob, NLTK, spaCy and vaderSentiment.

To determine word frequency, the analysis omitted so-called stopwords containing little information (such as "the", "a", "an" and "in"). The remaining words were each stemmed (to remove suffixes) using the Porter Stemming Algorithm, and variants of the same word were grouped, such as "improve" and "improving."

To analyze sentiment, the Journal used TextBlob and vaderSentiment, which are often used for opinion mining, to assign each sentence in the text a polarity score ranging from 1 (most positive) to -1 (most negative). The Journal selected examples from the 10 highest- and 10 lowest-scoring sentences.

Business News: Investors Ask Firms to Disclose Climate Risks

By Gabriel T. Rubin

Companies are under more pressure than ever to disclose their exposure to climate-change risks.

In the coming annual-meeting season, companies are projected to face a record 75 or more climate-related shareholder proposals, up from 17 in 2013, according to ISS Analytics, the data-intelligence arm of Institutional Shareholder Services. Investing powerhouses such as BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group are separately backing voluntary climate-change reporting standards for public companies and hope to prompt an uptick in disclosures this spring.

Annual meetings, which typically take place in the spring, are an opportunity for activist shareholders to put pressure on companies because of a process that allows them to submit proposals for a shareholder vote.

DowDuPont Inc., for instance, received a proposal for its 2019 proxy ballot that asked for more disclosures about risks from expanding chemical-plant operations near the Gulf of Mexico. Major storms there, such as Hurricane Harvey, can cause damage and spills. A spokesman for DowDuPont declined to comment.

Starbucks Corp. is facing pressure from both shareholders and its own environmentally conscious consumer base. Last year, 29% of Starbucks shareholders voted for the company to make public detailed plans about how it was going to promote reusable packaging and cut its use of plastic.

The proposal warned that Starbucks's reputation as an environmental leader could be hurt by its failure to meet its own sustainability goals. The proposal is on the company's 2019 proxy ballots. Starbucks's board of directors recommended against the proposal.

Beyond individual company initiatives, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors are among institutional investors backing the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit organization that wants to standardize and increase corporate environmental disclosures. The group in November formally released a set of voluntary standards that companies can follow.

"What we're trying to do is maximize the value of the companies in the portfolio, protect the downside, and move the needle in a direction that we think reflects important material issues company by company," Barbara Novick, a BlackRock senior executive, said in a Feb. 7 Washington speech.

The Financial Stability Board, an international consortium of regulators, is tracking voluntary climate reporting and will issue a report in June.

JetBlue Airways was an early adopter of SASB's approach, launching its voluntary disclosures in 2016. In its 2017 sustainability report, the company said a rise in interest in climate issues followed years of especially volatile hurricane seasons in the Atlantic Ocean.

"For an airline like JetBlue with a significant focus in the Caribbean, the prospect of more extreme storms raises a legitimate concern: How prepared is JetBlue to deal with changing weather patterns that may be caused by climate change?" JetBlue's report said.

Some companies are taking an additional step by making climate-related pledges. Glencore PLC, one of the world's biggest coal producers, said in February that it would cap its output of the fossil fuel. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Europe's largest oil-and-gas company, bowed to shareholder demands in December to set emission-reduction targets from the use of its products.

Some investors, Democratic politicians and environmental groups are pushing for mandatory disclosures. But the Securities and Exchange Commission so far hasn't required specific climate-related disclosures, instead telling companies to hew to broader criteria for what public companies must disclose as a material risk.

CVS Names Chief Information Officer to Lead Aetna Integration; Roshan Navagamuwa joined CVS in 2012 and over the past year served as interim CIO

CVS Health Corp. has tapped a new chief information officer tasked with integrating its information technology and data with IT systems used by Aetna Inc., which the drugstore chain acquired last year in a $70 billion deal.

Roshan Navagamuwa, who over the past year served as interim CIO, was named CIO and executive vice president of the combined health-industry giant, leading all areas of technology operations and innovation, according to a statement provided by the company. The move is effective immediately.

He reports to the firm's executive vice president and chief operating officer, Jonathan Roberts, the company said.

"We are bringing two world-class IT organizations together as part of this integration," Mr. Navagamuwa told CIO Journal in an email. "While there are opportunities to integrate enterprise systems, the most exciting opportunities are what we can build as a result of the two entities coming together," he said.

He said cloud computing was an enabling factor in the integration process, by helping the firm move quickly to take advantage of both existing and emerging software and services.

Mr. Navagamuwa joined CVS in 2012 as vice president of IT for the firm's government business unit. Within three years he became its client services leader.

As CIO, he now oversees an enterprise-technology team made up of a mix of senior IT leaders from both CVS and Aetna. In the months ahead, he will work with Meg McCarthy, executive vice president of operations and technology and former CIO of Aetna, during a transition period to bring together the two firms' IT organizations.

Among other tools, Mr. Navagamuwa said he plans to use big data and analytics to help the firm integrate and deliver care that will be easier to use, while shifting services to be more relevant and personalized and creating platforms that support health-care experts.

By combining operations and reducing corporate expenses, among other factors, CVS has said it expects savings of more than $750 million within the next two years.

Greg Schott, chief executive officer of MuleSoft LLC, a maker of programming tools that bridge diverse software applications or operating systems that was itself acquired by Salesforce.com Inc. last year, said IT cost savings from a sizable acquisition can be difficult to achieve before the firms' diverse data is brought together in a shared system.

Jeff Vail, chief executive officer at executive IT advisory firm WGroup, said that the integration process involves working with disparate systems and technologies across teams under new leadership, and while maintaining security thresholds.

"Business units, sales, marketing, corporate communications, all of the mission-critical front-line business functions will need organized data to communicate with customers, maintain confidence, and convey the upside value of the combined businesses," Mr. Vail said.

Mr. Navagamuwa's "knowledge of our business and the complexities of our operating environment" made him a clear choice to take on these and other challenges as CIO, CVS's Mr. Roberts said in a statement.

Good day. Experts say the full benefits of 5G technology are years off, in part because they will depend on completion of an expensive expansion of wireless networks now under way.

But venture capitalists have set their sights on a crop of startups working to get a jump on offering 5G applications as the networks are built out. Be sure to check out Marc Vartabedian's tour of five of the companies to watch.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Drivers' cut: As they chart a course toward initial public offerings, Lyft Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. both plan to let some of their drivers in on the deals.

The plan represents a rare move that would offer drivers access to two of the most hotly anticipated IPOs ever.

Both Uber and Lyft's IPOs will include programs that would give some of their most-tenured drivers a cash award with an option to put it toward stock in the IPOs, according to people familiar with the matter.

Uber is working out the details of a program expected to be valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars that would give a significant portion of its 3 million active drivers and couriers globally either a cash bonus or the option to use that cash to purchase shares at the IPO price, people familiar with the matter said. The WSJ's Maureen Farrell has the exclusive story.

Gene shopping: Continuing a string of acquisitions of gene-therapy companies, Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. has exercised an option to buy startup Myonexus Therapeutics for $165 million.

On Monday, Roche Holding AG said it would acquire Spark Therapeutics Inc. for $4.8 billion. Spark was the first company to introduce a gene therapy for a genetic disorder in the U.S., winning regulatory approval in 2017 for Luxturna, a treatment for a rare form of inherited vision loss.

Last year, Novartis AG paid $8.7 billion to purchase AveXis Inc. and secure a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic disease affecting voluntary muscle movement. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has the story.

Geron's Take: Ripple Gets Boost From Coinbase, But Faces Hurdles

By Tomio Geron

Coinbase, the cryptocurrency digital wallet and exchange, announced this week that the XRP token is available for trading on its Coinbase Pro product bringing some good news for investors in the token and Ripple Labs Inc., the venture-backed company that created it.

Before this decision, it was curious why the largest U.S. crypto exchange wouldn't list XRP, which has been one of the three largest tokens measured by market value. After all, Coinbase has listed 18 other tokens, including much smaller tokens such as ZRX and BAT, on Coinbase or its professional platform Coinbase Pro.

Coinbase's decision will provide more liquidity and volume for XRP and it led to an immediate bump of about 10% in the token's price soon after the news was announced. That shows the power Coinbase wields when it lists tokens on its exchange.

But questions remain about Coinbase's listing of XRP. For one, what if the Securities and Exchange Commission deems XRP a security? The crypto industry is still waiting to hear from regulators about which tokens are and which aren't securities that can be regulated as such. Critics of XRP say it isn't a decentralized token, since Ripple or its founders own a majority of the tokens in circulation and as a result the SEC could decide that XRP is a security.

More in Geron's Take

Exits

Real-estate brokerage company Compass agreed to acquire Contactually Inc., which provides customer relationship management services to real-estate agents and brokerages, for an undisclosed amount. Contactually, of Washington, was backed by investors including Rally Ventures and Grotech Ventures. In September 2018, New York-based Compass doubled its valuation to $4.4 billion after a $400 million Series F round that was co-led by SoftBank Vision Fund and Qatar Investment Authority.

Formstack LLC, a software-as-a-service company backed by Providence Equity Partners' growth-equity arm, acquired data integration provider Bedrock Data Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Boston-based Bedrock was backed by investors including .406 Ventures.

Adore Me Inc. acquired Belabumbum, which offers intimate apparel and activewear for expecting and new moms. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. New York-based Adore Me is backed by investors including Upfront Ventures, Mousse Partners, SOSV and Redhills Ventures.

VC Funds

Forgepoint Capital, the firm formerly called Trident Capital Cybersecurity, is in the market to raise a second flagship fund with a goal of raising $400 million, the firm disclosed in a regulatory filing. Its previous fund closed at $300 million. Forgepoint Cybersecurity Fund II had no committed investors at the time of the filing. San Mateo, Calif.-based Forgepoint is led by Don Dixon, Alberto Ypez and Sean Cunningham.

Boulder Food Group, a consumer-focused venture firm, has closed on its second fund with $100 million committed. The firm, led by Tom Spier, said the fund will invest in wellness and nutrition-focused startups such as its first investment, Olipop, which specializes in digestive health beverages. The firm has offices in Boulder, Colo., and Los Angeles.

ATX Seed Ventures has closed on $32 million for its second fund, and the firm said it already is planning on a third fund targeting $100 million. The Austin, Texas-base firm is led by Chris Shonk, and partners Brad Bentz and Danielle Allen.

Sunil Nagaraj, previously an investor with Bessemer Venture Partners, has launched Ubiquity Ventures, a seed-stage firm with a debut $30 million fund.

Pangea Blockchain Fund has raised $22 million toward its $200 million target, the firm said. The fund will make early-stage investments in blockchain startups around the world. Limited partners include Copernicus Asset Management SA and Bitcoin.com owner Roger Ver.

Alta Partners is seeking up to $150 million for Alta Partners NextGen Fund II, according to a regulatory filing. San Francisco-based Alta raised $130 million for Alta Partners NextGen Fund I in June 2018 to invest in biotechnology and technology-enabled startups providing health-care services.

Good day! Parting is such sweet sorrow for some private-equity firms and their portfolio companies. So, why part at all?

That's the sentiment that seems to prevail in a growing number of deals we've seen of late, as private-equity firms tap newer funds to reinvest in portfolio companies that they are cashing out of in older funds. This morning, Vista Equity Partners has done just that with software provider Aptean, which is bringing growth investor TA Associates Inc. on as a stakeholder in a deal valued at just under $1 billion, our own Laura Cooper reports this morning.

Meanwhile, Jaewon Kang has news that construction technology startup Prescient Co. is in early-stages of seeking a fresh round of funding to support its growth.

Now on to today's news...

Today's Top Stories

Vista Brings TA Associates Into the Aptean Investor Fold

Aptean, a software provider backed by Vista Equity Partners, is adding a new investor to its fold, but the Vista isn't checking out just yet. TA Associates Inc. is investing in Aptean in a deal valued at just under $1 billion, while Vista will reinvest, albeit out of newer fund than it originally used to form the company, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports.

Construction Company Prescient Seeks $100 Million Funding Round

Construction-technology provider Prescient Co. is working on a construction project of its own. The Durham, N.C.-based startup is holding initial discussions to raise $100 million in new funding, WSJ Pro's Jaewon Kang reports, citing a person familiar with the company.

Blackstone Life Sciences and Novartis to Launch Drug Company

Blackstone Group LP is partnering with Novartis AG to develop drugs to treat blood clots, the first investment by the private-equity firm's new life-sciences business, the WSJ's Miriam Gottfried reports. The companies plan to announce Wednesday that they will form a new company called Anthos Therapeutics.

Dean Foods Explores Strategic Alternatives

Dean Foods Co. said it is exploring strategic alternatives, including the possible breakup of the biggest U.S. milk producer, as pressure mounts on dairy processors facing low prices and new competition from big retailers, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Blank-Check Companies, a Hot IPO Fad, Contain Pitfalls for Investors

Blank-check companies are enjoying their highest popularity in more than a decade, raising more than $10 billion in new listings last year. But more than half of the blank-check companies that went public in 2015 and 2016 are now trading below their initial offering prices, according to the Journal.

Deals

KKR & Co. has formed an ophthalmology platform called Falcon Vision to provide financial and operational support for a range of growing ophthalmic medical device and biopharmaceutical companies. The buyout shop, which is backing the deal out of its health-care growth fund, is partnering with Flying L Partners, a partnership focused on ophtalmology companies that is led in part by Bill Link, former co-founder of health-care focused Versant Ventures.

The new platform also has backed one company, collaborating on a $93 million funding round co-led by Flying L and Invus Opportunities Fund for venture-backed Oyster Point Pharma Inc., which is developing therapies to treat dry eye disease.

KKR & Co. also has backed a deal out of its longer-term investment fund with an agreement to purchase European software provider Exact Software from its current private-equity backer Apax Partners. Exact Software, which is based in the Netherlands, offers enterprise resource management software to mid-size businesses in the Benelux region.

Online marketplace eBay Inc. and activist investors Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value LP are nearing a settlement deal that would give the activists board seats and could open the door to the company breaking itself up, the Journal reports.

Publicly-traded Newell Brands Inc. said it has agreed to sell its Rexair LLC vacuum cleaner and cleaning equipment unit to private-equity firm Rhne Capital. The carve-out deal is part of an ongoing transformation plan at Newell to streamline its consumer products portfolio. Last year, the company sold hair product unit Goody Products Inc. to private-equity buyer Acon Investments. It also divested its Pure Fishing and Josten's units to Sycamore Partners and Platinum Equity, respectively, the Journal reported in November.

Lithuanian asset manager INVL Asset Management said it has acquired a 70% stake in Lithuanian health-care clinic chain InMedica through the INVL Baltic Sea Growth Fund. The INVL Baltic Sea Growth Fund seeks to back midmarket companies in the Baltic Sea region and earlier this month held a first closing of  109 million ($123.8 million).

MedCore Partners, SunTrust Bank and Trinity Private Equity Group have closed the purchase of a 409-unit assisted living and memory-care portfolio. The $98 million deal includes three communities in Arizona and one in Utah, and represents the first tranche of a $130 million portfolio acquisition of five properties and 531 total units.

Funds

Hammond Kennedy Whitney & Co. has collected nearly $300 million so far for its latest midmarket buyout fund, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming writes, citing regulatory filings. HKW Capital Partners V LP has a $350 million goal, according to the filings.

Stockholm-based Summa Equity said it has closed its second fund with 6.5 billion Swedish Krona ($697.5 million), the latest of a line of firms capitalizing on strong investor appetite for Nordic funds. One investor that backed the new fund is AP1, part of Sweden's national pension system, according to a press release.

Strattam Capital said it has closed its second lower midmarket fund with $230 million. The final closing of Strattam Capital Investment Fund II LP was more than double the $109 million that the firm raised for its debut offering back in 2015. Strattam plans to invest Fund II in seven to nine majority stakes of business information technology companies, targeting equity investments of $20 million to $50 million each, according to a press release. The firm has already backed three companies out of the new fund, including data and analytics provider SSB and Rock Solid Technologies, a government software provider.

People

Midmarket firm Balance Point Capital has hired Eric J. Dale as a partner. Before joining Balance Point, Mr. Dale was chief legal officer and chief risk officer at publicly traded Nielsen Holdings PLC. In that capacity, he oversaw all acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures for the company, among other duties.

Cambridge Associates Inc. has promoted long-time employees to senior executive roles. Ashby Hatch, the firm's head of public investments, has become head of global investment research, while Noel O'Neill, who previously held that role, has become president and head of global investing.

Good day. Founders Fund, the premier venture firm co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2005, is regrouping after several partner-level departures, but documents show the firm continued to rack up outsize returns for its investors and kept deal flow steady.

Keith Rabois, who spent the last six years at Khosla Ventures, joins Founders Fund at a time when the firm has been delivering above-average returns in some cases, stellar returns to investors.

On paper, every dollar that Founders Fund invested from its 2011-vintage fourth fund has more than quadrupled to $4.60, as of the third quarter last year, according to documents containing firm data that were reviewed by WSJ Pro.

The industry average for funds of that vintage was $2.11 during the same period, according to market tracker Cambridge Associates. Its third fund from 2010 has seen its dollars go up to $3.80, above the average of $3.15. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the exclusive story.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Gurley's gig: Benchmark's Bill Gurley, known for making an early investment in Uber Technologies Inc., is backing a different kind of gig platform Instawork which matches restaurants and hospitality businesses with job-seeking waiters, cooks and dishwashers.

Mr. Gurley said Instawork, founded in 2015, has kept a low profile to avoid problems that can arise when a company raises too much capital and grows too fast.

"We wanted to get the model right with unit economics and customers' satisfaction right before we scale it," he said. "A lot of companies make a mistake because money is available and then they try to perfect it at a much bigger level, which I think is a mistake."

While gig work is often criticized as offering low pay and little opportunity for advancement, Instawork could provide a way for workers to find better, higher-paying jobs. The company aims to help them "learn skills to move up the ladder," said Mr. Gurley, who has joined Instawork's board. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has the scoop.

Dry-eye deal: Venture investors hope Oyster Point Pharma Inc. will be the next biotech startup to make an impact on the giant market to treat dry eye. Oyster Point recently raised $93 million to take on the disease, which affects more than 16 million U.S. adults, according to the American Journal of Ophthalmology. The company's Series B round was co-led by Invus Opportunities and Flying L Partners, in collaboration with Falcon Vision. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Chernova's Take: Big, Unanswered Question Looms Over Home-Selling Startups

By Yuliya Chernova

In recent years, venture capitalists have flocked to home-selling startups like Opendoor and Knock, partly supported by a robust U.S. real-estate market.

But this new category may be about to face its biggest test yet as home prices head into their first rough patch since the companies came on the scene.

Investor faith in home-sales startups could be at a high point. Opendoor Labs Inc., which takes homes quickly off sellers' hands, raised some $725 million last year alone. Knock, which helps consumers trade in their old home for a new one, pulled in $400 million in a combination of Series B equity and debt in January.

Asked a few weeks ago whether Opendoor would be vulnerable to a weaker market, Keith Rabois, who founded the company as a general partner at Khosla Ventures and who is joining Founders Fund, replied that there is "zero vulnerability." Not only that, he added, "We are going to do phenomenally well in a depreciating market."

That does sound very optimistic.

Just like any home buyer, companies such as Opendoor and Knock are exposed to the risk of buying high and selling low. That risk increases in a market downturn, which the cyclical real-estate market might be starting to enter.

Upstarts challenge private equity s top tier

Veritas joins once-obscure groups writing big cheques and grabbing assets from clutches of larger rivals

Before Veritas Capital teamed up with activist hedge fund Elliott Management to pull off one of the biggest private equity deals of 2018, the New York buyout firm was known for its work with niche businesses such as a manufacturer of components for satellites.

But the $5.6bn buyout of Athenahealth catapulted Veritas into a higher orbit. There, it joins half a dozen once-obscure private equity players that have broken into the industry s top tier, capable of writing large equity cheques and snatching coveted assets from the clutches of Apollo, Blackstone and KKR.

The $6.5bn takeover of analytics group Dun & Bradstreet and $4.1bn purchase of travel technology provider Travelport were sealed by buyout firms that had long focused on smaller mid-market deals, with competition for assets intensifying as investors pump billions of dollars into new PE funds, bankers and lawyers say.

The rarefied world of the biggest deals is attractive as it contains the best return prospects, according to Michael Chae, chief financial officer of the Blackstone Group. Smaller deals, in contrast, tend to have three or four groups competing and bidding prices higher.

 We think mid-market secondary buyouts have been the most crowded, competitive space where we ve seen the most return pressure,  said Mr Chae.  Larger scale primary deals, corporate sellers, corporate partners, more complex, more operational value creation potential, we think that's where the better fishing has been. 

An increasing number of firms are angling for bigger buyouts.Siris Capital, Francisco Partners and Veritas Capital are among the firms that struck deals for more than $3.5bn each last year.

 There is a longer list of private equity firms with unused equity capital highly motivated to put that capital to work,  said Chris Ventresca, global co-head of M&A at JPMorgan.  They are more willing to utilise a significant amount of equity capital and make more sizeable bets. 

For both Siris and Veritas, Elliott Management s private equity arm Evergreen Coast Capital was critical to clinch their largest deals. Elliott has ramped up its buyout efforts, which are often directed at companies that the firm has itself targeted as an activist. Founded by Paul Singer and known for its brash style, Elliott is raising $2bn to fund outright takeovers.

Marni Lerner, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher, said those efforts are fuelled by cash inflows from pensions, endowments and sovereign wealth funds, as well as a $1.2tn stockpile of committed capital that has yet to be deployed.

 You see larger firms working on mid-market deals 	. 	. 	. 	and mid-market firms are looking for larger deals,  Ms Lerner said.  Fund sizes are getting bigger, which is allowing [mid-market firms] to do larger deals. 

The fundraisings have been significant. Francisco Partners, founded by former TPG principal Dipanjan Deb, raised more than $3bn for its latest fund in 2017. So did Veritas Capital, which is where chief executive Ramzi Musallam set up shop after spending part of his career working for noted investor and hospitality heir Jay Pritzker.

Both firms exceeded their previous fundraising records by more than $1bn, according to data provider Preqin. Siris Capital, founded by two former members of the mergers and acquisitions department at Goldman Sachs, is making an even bigger leap from earlier vehicles with its latest fund, also pegged above $3bn.

Technology-focused buyout group Thoma Bravo has eclipsed all three groups with a $12.6bn fund, its largest to date. The firm is looking at clinching its biggest takeover, approaching US cyber security maker Symantec about a potential deal, which would rank among the biggest buyouts since the crisis if completed.

Chinh Chu s CC Capital has taken a different approach to raising cash, floating  blank cheque  companies on the stock market, rather than by raising traditional funds.

Mr Chu purchased Dun & Bradstreet alongside an investor consortium earlier this year. The group, founded by the former Blackstone dealmaker, has trained its sights on deals between $2bn and $15bn, said a person familiar with the matter.

Some buyout firms have also punched above their weight by tapping favoured investors for top-up capital to invest alongside their main funds. These  co-investments  are attractive for pension and sovereign wealth funds, because they are usually exempt from the private equity firm s fees, which can amount to 1.5 per cent a year of the amount invested and 20 per cent of any profits.

When Francisco Partners paid $3.6bn last year for Verifone, the payments company, it turned to the Canadian pension fund British Columbia Investment Management Corporation to help fund the deal.

In interviews with the Financial Times, executives from several firms were keen to emphasise common themes between their most recent deals and the far smaller transactions from which they earned their stripes with investors.

 There is not much difference between a $500m transaction and a $3bn transaction, other than transaction size,  said Mr Deb, chief executive of Francisco Partners.  You still have to pursue [the] same steps in diligence and deal process. 

Mr Musallam of Veritas said his team was  consistent  in its approach even if the targets  size was changing.  We don t want a far-flung enterprise where our intellectual property becomes 	. 	. 	. 	dissipated across a broader base [of industries]. 

Sharp increases in private equity deal size can ring alarm bells with investors stung by their experiences with groups such as Candover, which expanded its ambitions dramatically in the years before the financial crisis only to topple when deals soured and financing dried up.

But bankers and others who invest big pension funds on their investments say investment opportunities are so scarce, and the competition to sign up to funds so intense, that they have little choice but to go along with sponsors  plans. Lacklustre performance from other alternative investors, notably hedge funds, has propelled the shift into private equity.

The flood of capital is also contributing to higher asset valuations, forcing private equity managers to pay as much as 11 to 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for a company, higher even than the inflated prices at the previous market peak in 2007.  Everything is priced to perfection,  one leveraged finance veteran said.  There is not much room for error, or a market downturn. 

But investors are not  indiscriminately throwing money  at every mid-market private equity group seeking to raise fresh capital, said Max Justicz, head of financial sponsors for the Americas at UBS.  We are certainly seeing some signs that the new generation of leadership at some of these firms are willing to take more sizeable or concentrated investments. 

 [Investors] are extremely focused on performance and are giving the top-quartile PE firms considerably larger new fund size if they seek it,  he said.

Robots head to Nomura s trading floors

Your essential weekly fintech briefing

No one could accuse the Japanese of being backwards at coming forward when it comes to the robotic revolution. This is the country that broughtus the world's firstrobot hotel,the world's first  humanless warehouse and, more recently, arobotic petdesigned to offer its human overlords love and affection.

Now Japanese bank Nomura is getting in on the act, investing in astart-up that deploys artificial intelligence (AI) in financial markets.

Named Aim2, the start-upwas set up by Brevan Howard back in 2015 to help the hedge fund with its alpha investment strategies, ie to find ways of making money based on the particular profile of an investmentrather than through market exposures.

Nomura   which is understood to have taken a 22 per cent stake in Aim2   will use the same technology to price trades and markets in its wholesale business.

 Typically an electronic trading engine or trader makes prices based on certain tiering and logistics,  said Jez Mohideen, chief digital officer at Nomura's wholesale business, describing a pricing process that involves  using large sets of data, understanding behaviours of the market, the market impact of clients and so forth .

Machines, of course, excel at making sense of big data sets, and intelligent ones have the added edge of learning how market behaviours and trends evolve. Hence Nomura's desire to deploy AI so it can find a  probabilistic price  that will generate maximum revenue from a client while also helping Nomura to maintain its target market share.

Nomura's roll-out of its robot traders will be initially focused on its fixed income, currencies and commodities division, or FICC as its known in banking circles, since it'sfar more reliant on human traders than equities, which has been largely electronified. Within FICC, fixed income is the main target since it has been less automated than foreign exchange.

 We'd gradually look at foreign exchange and equities,  Mr Mohideen added, as he outlined a plan to deploy the robots across Nomura's trading business within two years.

While the prospect is new within Nomura, and may be greeted with concernby traders who have already seen some of their human colleagues laid off this year, bigger investment banks have been using AI in their fixed income businesses for some time.

Most banksdidn't want to go public on exactly how they use AI, but informed sources said robots have been used in some form or another in the FICC businesses at JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America for a few years now.

Europeans have been at it too. Barclays uses AI for everything from forecasting business volumes to recommendations engines that help the bank target its client pitches.Chris Purves, head of UBS's strategic development lab, says the Swiss bank is using AI across  most  of its fixed income business lines, both for executing client orders and for market making and pricing.  The key to us is that it's explainable,  he adds.  Can you say why something made the price that it did? 

Certainly, the commercial imperative is there.

Banks have had a bruising few yearsin FICC, with annual revenues across the big five US banks falling 15 per cent since 2013, and smaller playersfaring even worse. The industry's most senior executives have described the pivotal role technology will play in determining the winners and losers in FICC's next era, arguing that the biggest banks will fare best because they can invest the necessary sums for true innovation.

Nomura,a sizeable bankbut not big enough to make the global top 12 investment banks as ranked by industry monitor Coalition, is getting around the problem by investingin a cutting-edge AI firm.

Mr Mohideen expects other smaller investment banks to join them in deploying third-party technology to bridge the gap between whatthey spend on R&D and the $11bn technology budget of JPMorgan. Indeed he'd even welcome them as clients of Aim2.  The way we look at it, the toolkit is beneficial for the industry as a whole,  he said.  Going forward the world is getting to a place where that (exclusivity) is less of a concern. 

The prospect of wider deployment of robot traders raises the thorny question of what happens to the human traders. The obvious conclusion   which bank executives go to great lengths to avoid acknowledging  is another wave of lay-offs.

It might not be as bad as some fear though. Earlier this year, Japan's pioneering robot hotel admitted it hadsackedmore than half of its 243 robots because they were more hindrance than help. Humans: 1, Robots: 0.

One to watch: Hundsun Technology

RememberHundsun Technologies, the Ant Financial-backedfintech that ran intotroublefor providing software that enabled speculative margin trading by retail investors during China's 2015 boom and bust?

From that mostunlikely ofstarting points, Hundsun hascreated a booming business selling software to help financial institutions strengthen their risk control,writes Gabriel Wildau in Shanghai.

Net income rose 37 per cent to Rmb233m (approx $35m) for the first three quarters of 2018, and in a few weeks' time we'll find out if the full-year results are as encouraging.

The seeds for its growth spurt were sown in 2017, whenHundsun shifted towards technologies that match regulators  emphasis on controlling financial risk.

The crown jewel is the O32 software package that offers a comprehensive risk management systemspanning everything from monitoring irregular transactions to real-time tracking of profits and setting trading limits.

Hundsun says O32 can avoid trading errors resulting from computer errors, like the2013 incidentthat triggered a Rmb523m fine forbrokerage Everbright aftermistaken orders were placed by a trading algorithm in its proprietary trading unit. Fund managers are a key target market for O32 as well.

It's all a far cry from 2015, when Hundsun was fined Rmb400m becauseproviders of grey market finance used Hundsun's HOMS software to allow hundreds of retail investors to trade separately   and access margin loans  using a single brokerage account.

Number of the week: $8bn

The valuation of Ping An s OneConnect unit, which the Chinese insurer is preparing to list, according to Bloomberg.

Further fintech fascination

Trend watch:It's been a long time coming;now Hong Kong is finally opening up its banking industry to online competition. In the next few weeks, six of the new licences are expected to be issued to regional powerhouses in digital bankingincluding Tencent, Ant Financial and insurer ZhongAn. Western digital banks may also ultimately join the rush to win share in the potentially lucrative market, where 66 per cent of all lending is done by just four banks (HSBC, Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered).

Regulators' advance:Most countries would be glad to secure a fintech with the profile of Revolut, the foreign exchange app that's fast becoming an online financial services supermarket and commands avaluation north of $1.7bn.Not Lithuania though, where Revolut secured a banking licence last year. Senior politicians in the Baltic country are now voicing fears that its central bank has bitten off more than it can chew.

Follow the money:Funding for insurtech companies reached a record $4.1bn last year, easily eclipsing the $2.7bn raised in 2015, according tonew data from Willis Towers Watson, the insurance broker. The fourth quarter of the year was particularly busy, with $1.6bn raised in 63 deals. They included $68m raised by Germany s simplesurance, which specialises in cover for products sold online, $116m for Italian motor insurer Prima Assicurazioni and $500m in a SoftBank-backed funding round from Cambridge Mobile Telematics.

New frontiers:Want to protect yourself from losing a fortune if the head of your chosen crypto exchange dies suddenly and takes your access codes to the grave with him? Then look no further than the Lloyd's insurance marketplace, which has sold crypto custodian BitGo Inc a policy of as much as $100m for losses, including the loss of access keys, an unforeseen riskthat has left clients of Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX out some $150m.
