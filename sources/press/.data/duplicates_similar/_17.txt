What is the No. 1 thing investors shouldn't be worried about over the next few years but are? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry, academic and other thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324216004578483382771090240.html" that discussed how to face your investment fears and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Wednesday, June 5.

Charles Rotblut: Washington Isn't the Problem for Now

I would say there are two things: government and interest rates.

I know there is much frustration with the continuing partisan battles occurring in Washington, but the economy has continued to grow despite the legislative stagnation. There is no doubt that the federal debt and future spending on both entitlement programs and defense programs will need to be addressed, but they are long-term issues. I don't see them significantly impacting market direction over the next few years.

Predictions about when the Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates have been premature for four years. Eventually, those predictions will be right. But given expectations for slow economic growth both domestically and globally, I don't foresee it as a problem over the next few years. Plus, if interest rates do start to rise, they will likely be in reaction to stronger economic growth, which will, in turn, boost earnings growth.

Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

Frank Holmes: China's Imperfect, but So What?

Investors shouldn't worry about China's growth. Many mainstream reports fail to take into account the fact that the world has never experienced a population and urbanization boom like China. As the most populous country in the world, its leaders are focused on helping its residents achieve a higher standard of living. Along the way, there will be missteps. But highlighting China's economic imperfections is akin to saying the U.S. is a poor nation because impoverished areas exist.

I believe China's new leaders, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, will focus on reforms that will provide residents with opportunities, social security, increasing incomes and higher standards of living.

Frank Holmes is chief executive and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors Inc.

Rick Ferri: The Bond Bubble Isn't as Frightening as It Looks

The biggest investment concern today is the so-called bond bubble. Interest rates are at an all-time low and this is causing an unprecedented and in my view, unwarranted bond-market scare. There is a reason interest rates are low. It's because inflation is low and falling, and the global economy is meandering along at best. Don't expect changes soon.

Besides, there's a good reason to own bonds in a portfolio. They provide protection against a certain type of risk the worst type of risk a risk than can permanently devastate a retirement account. A risk that is building as the stock market hits new highs. A risk that ultimately crushes many investors during steep bear-market declines.

A bond allocation helps protect a portfolio from its owner. People who maintain a stable bond allocation are less likely to panic in a bear stock market. Those who ignore prudence and over-allocate in a bull market tend to have bad endings as they panic sell in a bear market. This is five times more costly to a portfolio than always holding a prudent allocation to stocks and bonds and weathering through the storms. Don't let bond-bubble talk get in the way of good judgment.

Matt Hougan: Go Ahead and Worry. Up to a Point.

It's always good to worry. Just don't panic. Mostly, the answer is in the middle.

Larry Zimpleman: The Ups and Downs Are Par for the Course

In general, I think most investors are more worried about volatility than they should be. Look at the 2008-2009 period and the financial crisis. How many articles did we see then talking about how it had wiped out the savings of an entire generation of people. And, here we are only four years later and the market is reaching new highs virtually every day. If you keep in mind that, in general, markets are tied to corporations and you feel comfortable that you are invested in companies that can grow their businesses and earnings over time, then the volatility that the market delivers is only an issue if you need to draw down the assets in the near future. If you know you won't need to draw on the assets for at least the next five years, volatility is not something that should keep you up at night.

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group.

Michelle Perry Higgins: The Correction Is Coming. Relax.

The next big correction! Let me officially go on the record by predicting that another major market adjustment is just around the corner. It could happen a month from now or be three years away. No one can say when with absolute certainty. The stock market has a good track record of completing its cycles and I encourage investors to recognize that and stop worrying about the inevitable pullbacks. Instead of wasting energy with apprehension and fear, I would advise prudent investors to plan and educate themselves.

I employ a two-step planning process:

1. Have a well-diversified portfolio with a strong defensive barrier (cash and fixed income) to carry you through the down years.

2. Educate yourself on the historical cycles of the stock market. "History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme." Mark Twain

Meir Statman: Don't Worry About Market Timing

The No. 1 thing investors shouldn't be worried about but are is whether to get into the stock market now or get out. If you got out of the stock market in October 2007, good for you. If you got out the stock market in March 2009, too bad. Now, as always, is a good time to buy and hold a diversified portfolio.

Meir Statman is the Glenn Klimek professor of finance at Santa Clara University, and author of "What Investors Really Want."

Greg McBride: If Stocks Fall, Get Ready to Hang In There

The continued risk aversion of investors is predicated on their fear of a sharp pullback in the equity market. I'm not saying it won't happen it almost certainly will. But for investors with the discipline to hang in there, keep reinvesting their dividends and capital-gains distributions and the fortitude to buy more on a downdraft, they'll end up ahead when markets inevitably rebound, as the last six years have illustrated. But sitting on the sidelines or hunkering down in conservative investments won't get you to your financial goals.

Bilderberg event unites protesters against the unknown

A former Labour minister, a Ukip MEP and a US arch conspiracy theorist gathered in a field just outside Watford on Thursday with one shared objective: to get the minutes of a meeting taking place inside the luxury hotel on the horizon.

Two hundred protesters were penned in by police and G4S guards on the edge of the estate in the English countryside where the Bilderberg group of political and business leaders has begun its secretive annual three-day event.

Fleets of Mercedes cars with blacked-out windows sped past, possibly transporting any of the 140 people named on the guest list. Invitees ranged from George Osborne, British chancellor, to Jos Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, and Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, to Peter Sutherland, chairman of Goldman Sachs International.

"Scum!", "Maggots!" and "Pay your taxes!", demonstrators shouted at the cars, despite not being able to identify the passengers. Some refused to call themselves protesters, saying they objected to the lack of transparency, but could not protest against decisions they did not know about.

Michael Meacher, a Labour backbencher and former environment minister, was among the throng. He said the secrecy surrounding the meeting was "utterly anti-democratic". He has asked the speaker of the House of Commons for an urgent question to demand Mr Osborne reveals any plans made in the red-brick hotel.

"This is arguably the most important meeting of the leaders of western finance capitalism this year," he said. "I don't think they attend for just the tea and coffee."

Mr Meacher was on unlikely shared ground with Gerard Batten, a Ukip MEP for London, who suspected that decisions about Europe would be made during the meeting. "If they want to fix the world's problems, they do have to bring the people with them," he said.

Founded in 1954, Bilderberg was designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America during the cold war. This year, it will discuss topics including growth, US foreign policy, cyber warfare, big data, Africa and the Middle-East.

Once cloaked in a shroud of secrecy, it has been slowly opening up over the past decade: it now has a website and publishes an agenda and a list of participants. It insists no resolutions are proposed and no votes are taken.

But that assurance has not been enough for protesters. Placards connecting the event with everything from eugenics to paedophilia show how the silence from inside the building has led to speculation outside.

"Bilderberg ate my hamster," reads one large banner draped across the metal barriers.

"We are assaulting the Bilderberg group with the search lights of publicity. Like Count Dracula!" bellowed Alex Jones, an American radio host and conspiracy theorist, from the middle of a swarm of supporters. His cornucopia of theories have included a plot to kill 80 per cent of the world's population and a plan to combine the US and the EU into a single super state.

Other campaigners connected the meeting with real world events, drawing parallels between the lack of transparency at Bilderberg and the lobbying scandal which has hit British politics in the past couple of weeks.

Hanging up at the heavily-guarded entrance to the field of protesters, one sardonic sign read: "Lobbying register: all corporate lobbyists please sign in here."

Andrew Lamb is to retire as chief executive of CME Group's European clearing house, bringing to an end a 35-year career in London's market structure industry.

Mr Lamb, who joined CME Clearing Europe in 2009, was previously chief executive of LCH.Clearnet and had served for 15 years at the Bank of England, with four years as senior adviser, derivatives and commodity markets.

He was also head of risk and deputy chief executive at London Clearing House for a decade until 2003. He will retire on July 31, according to a memo circulated at CME last week.

Mr Lamb oversaw the establishment of CME's European business and the opening of its London office in May 2011. The world's largest futures operator began clearing off-exchange interest rate swaps earlier this year to challenge the market incumbent LCH.Clearnet for a share of the $500tn business. CME has also applied to become a futures exchange in the UK capital, a move that will put it into competition with Deutsche Brse's Eurex and NYSE Liffe.

He will be replaced by Lee Betsill, currently chief operating officer and managing director of CME Clearing Europe. Tina Hasenpusch will assume the role of chief operating officer, while continuing as head of business development. The appointments of Mr Betsill and Ms Hasenpusch will be subject to regulatory approval.

The memo also noted CME Clearing Europe has hired Marc Vial from JPMorgan to fill a new role as chief risk officer. Mr Vial, who was previously executive director, head of global risk strategy and market analytics group at the US bank, began working in early June.

Markets
Crude Oil Advances As Stockpiles Drop

Oil prices rose after a government report showed U.S. crude stockpiles pulled back from an 82-year high last week, but gains were kept in check because of plentiful supplies.

Light, sweet crude for July delivery gained 43 cents, or 0.5%, to $93.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.

About 6.3 million barrels were drawn from crude-oil stockpiles last week, the Energy Information Administration reported, outpacing the 400,000-barrel decline projected by analysts in a Dow Jones Newswires survey. It was the biggest drop in stockpiles this year.

"The market did not expect such a large crude draw," said Tony Headrick, energy-market analyst at CHS Hedging. "But the market did not shoot higher because supplies are [still] ample."

Oil stockpiles had been steadily rising, reaching their highest level since May 1931 in the prior week. Last week's pickup in demand from refineries and a 7% drop in crude-oil imports helped reverse the trend.

In a sign of the shifting U.S. oil landscape, the volume of crude oil produced in the U.S. last week outpaced oil imports for the first time since January 1997. Domestic production surged to 7.3 million barrels a day in the week ended May 31, helped by surging flows from shale fields, while oil imports were at their lowest since September 2008.

Rising domestic production is helping to cushion the market against higher prices.

The price of Nymex crude, the U.S. benchmark, has risen 2.1% since the start of the year, while Brent crude is down 7.3%.

Oil stockpiles now stand at 391.3 million barrels, 1.7% above last year's level.

"Crude-oil inventories are still exorbitantly high and it's a big cost of capital having all that crude just sitting there," said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston.

Refineries are processing more crude now that the summer driving season is under way. Refineries used 88.4% of their total capacity last week, the EIA reported, up two percentage points from the previous week. Analysts had expected just a half-percentage-point rise.

Gasoline stockpiles last week fell 400,000 barrels, according to the EIA.

Inventories of distillates, including heating oil and diesel, rose 2.6 million barrels, as demand for those products declines with the warmer weather across the U.S.

Oil-market watchers are likely to turn their attention on Friday to the monthly U.S. nonfarm-payrolls report for clues about the health of the job market in the world's biggest oil consumer. High unemployment in the U.S. has kept fuel demand restrained with fewer motorists on the road.

Earlier Wednesday, Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics reported 135,000 new private-sector jobs in May, below the 170,000 expected. The ADP report is seen as a preview to Friday's employment report.

Front-month July reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, rose 0.48 cent, or 0.2%, to settle at $2.8230 a gallon. Front-month July heating oil fell 0.95 cent, or 0.3%, to $2.8554 a gallon.

Greg McBride: These Plans Are Great, if Not in Every Situation

I'm a big fan of 529 college-savings plans because of the tax-free growth and withdrawals for money used for college expenses. There are plenty of low-cost, direct-sold plans available, and the menu of available investment options has become further diversified in recent years. I hesitate to characterize anything as right for everybody, and one instance where the benefits of a 529 college-savings plan may not have time to accrue is for those that are looking at very short investment horizons such as one year before beginning to take withdrawals. The benefit of tax-free growth is very limited over such a short period of time in low-return, no-risk investments, and could be offset by investment expenses or plan fees in the short run.

Greg McBride ("https://twitter.com/BankrateGreg") is a senior financial analyst and vice president for "http://www.bankrate.com/", providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

Charles Rotblut: The Key: Start Early

Qualifying for college aid is dependent on several variables and I'll defer to my peers in this column on whether 529 plans are the best vehicle for college savings.

What I will say is that parents' top concern should not be the type of account, but rather that they are regularly contributing to college. Just as is the case with retirement, the earlier one starts saving and the longer they continually contribute to a properly allocated portfolio, the greater the chance they will have enough in savings once the child enters college.

Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

Michelle Perry Higgins: Not a Slam Dunk for Every Family

A 529 savings plan is definitely a top contender in the college-savings choices. But this plan is not a slam dunk for all families. Before opening a 529 plan or any college-savings account, it's important to evaluate the pros and cons of each plan and then decide which plan, if any, best aligns with your family goals. Let's review a few of the advantages and disadvantages of the 529 plan.

Some of the advantages of a 529 plan are:

 "The earnings that accumulate are tax-deferred, withdrawals are exempt from federal income tax and are also generally exempt from state tax for "qualified higher education expenses" (books, supplies, tuition, fees, room and board). Note: This does NOT include a new car or a shopping spree for the beneficiary.

 "The beneficiary and account holder must be identified when opening the account. After that, friends and family members can also contribute to the plan.

 "If the beneficiary does not use all the funds or decides not to attend college, the account holder can change the beneficiary to another family member (i.e. sibling, parent).

 "Funds may be used at any eligible higher-education institution in the U.S. as well as some colleges overseas.

 "The minimum contribution is typically very low, thus making it more affordable for families to get started.

 "The account holder has control of the funds, not the beneficiary.

Some of the disadvantages of the 529 plan are:

 "Plans will vary from state to state, which is a little more challenging for families. Therefore, you need to do your due diligence on the sales charges, fees, and investment choices by the plan administrator.

 "When a withdrawal is taken but it is not used for "qualified higher education expenses," then the earnings may be subject to income tax plus a 10% penalty tax.

 "A 529 account may reduce your beneficiary's ability to receive financial aid.

Matt Hougan: Yes, for the Vast Majority of People

For all families? No. The world is a complex place.

But for the vast majority of people? Absolutely. Assuming you get a low-cost plan stocked with low-cost index funds or ETFs and those are big assumptions a 529 is a great choice.

Just remember: You have to save vastly more money than you think you should. College prices and price inflation are insane.

George Papadopoulos: 529 Plans Are Not My First Choice

If your goal is to save for your kids' college education, before deciding where to put the money, you must save the money beginning right now! 529 plans are still a great choice for most parents, but I must admit that I am not a big fan. I find the restrictions in changing investments, the limited investment options and the steep penalties if the money is not used for college to be substantial drawbacks. I prefer to first maximize the contributions to a Coverdell Education Savings Account, which can be held at any discount broker and which give you complete freedom to invest the funds as you see fit. Unfortunately, that maximum contribution is only $2,000 per year; it is obvious that even the best financial outcome will not cover more than a year or two of college costs. After that, I prefer to invest in low-cost Vanguard ETFs in taxable accounts so I can be in control of my own destiny while hoping that my two kids will shock me by receiving full rides to their preferred schools. If that happens, the money in taxable accounts can be added to our retirement nest eggs.

The 529 plan I like the most is the Utah state plan with its lower fees and an adequate number of all Vanguard investment fund choices.

Eleanor Blayney: The Best Conditions for a 529 Plan

While a great college-savings tool, 529 plans are not necessarily right for every family.

Generally 529 plans are advantageous under the following conditions:

 "The plan is established for a very young beneficiary. This allows the chief benefit of 529 plans namely, tax-free compounded growth to provide a true advantage over other taxable forms of funding.

 "There is more than one child in the family. The tax-free benefits not used for qualified college expenses by a 529 beneficiary can be transferred to a sibling, and therefore are not lost.

 "The plan is owned by a grandparent or nonparental relative. In this case, the assets in the 529 have no impact on the student's eligibility for financial aid. However, even when a parent owns the 529, the impact is minimal as a result of 2005 changes in financial-aid rules. Only 5.6% of the 529 plan assets are now assumed eligible for college costs, as opposed to 20% for custodial plans. Because of this differential, many parents transfer existing UTMA or trust accounts into 529s.

 "The plan is established in a state that offers residents a credit against state income taxes.

Finding the right 529 plan, given your income and estate-tax situation and your other assets and liabilities, is not easy, however. There are hundreds of 529 plans from which to choose, varying by provider, participation eligibility, investment management, investment options and fees.

Consider, if possible, investing some funds in a 529 prepaid tuition plan. Many states have closed down this option; furthermore, it's usually assumed that this makes sense only if the beneficiary will attend a school in the state providing the plan. But generally you can transfer the money-market equivalent of the prepaid plan to a college in another state. So why not use this option by putting the money you would otherwise put in a money market into a 529 savings plan? That way you keep more windows open for your student, and also diversify the risk of your invested funds.

Rick Ferri: Not All 529 Plans Are Alike

I try never to use the words "never" or "all" when writing about personal finance. Everyone is different, and every situation is different. That being said, most families will find that a 529 plan provides an excellent way to save in order to send kids and grandkids to college. Not all 529 plans are alike. I recommend selecting a plan that has low fees and the ability to invest in low-cost index funds.

Markets
Dollar Slumps on Weak Jobs Report

By Matthew Walter

The dollar weakened after a disappointing report on the U.S. labor market led to increased uncertainty about whether the economy can sustain its pace of recovery.

Private-sector jobs in the U.S. increased by 135,000 last month, according to a report from payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody'sAnalytics. That fell short of the 170,000 gain expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

Stocks tumbled along with the dollar after the report, which is sometimes seen as a leading indicator of the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls report from the Labor Department, which is due Friday. Investors are concerned that a slowdown in job growth may lead the Federal Reserve to maintain its bond-buying program for longer, keeping interest rates low and weighing on the dollar.

"We've got soft stocks and soft data, and the dollar has taken a hit," said Richard Franulovich, a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp.

Speculation about when the Fed will begin to taper its bond-buying program has been a key driver for the dollar this year. Central bank officials have publicly discussed their divergent opinions about how quickly the stimulus program should be ended. In the latest comments, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher reiterated his view Wednesday that the housing market is in a solid rebound, giving the central bank room to begin pulling back from its bond buying sooner rather than later.

In late-afternoon trading, the dollar was at 99.16 from 100.03 late Tuesday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at CHF0.9423 from CHF0.9468.

The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies, was at 74.34 from 74.502.

The move down in the dollar gave more support to the yen, which started gaining overnight after a speech by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in which he laid out his long-awaited growth strategy. Investors said the blueprint fell short of expectations, increasing demand for the yen, which is a popular safe haven.

The euro saw modest gains against the dollar ahead of Thursday's policy meeting at the European Central Bank. Euro-zone policy makers are expected to leave monetary policy unchanged after cutting rates last month.

"The euro remains generally resilient ahead of the ECB meeting tomorrow," said Valentin Marinov, a currency strategist at Citibank. "One reason seems to be investors' anticipation that the ECB may signal a more constructive outlook on the euro-zone economy."

The euro changed hands at $1.3092 compared with $1.3081 late Tuesday. The common currency bought 129.82 from 131.00.

In the U.K., a report showed that a key gauge of activity in the services sector rose to the fastest pace in more than a year in May.

The U.K. pound fetched $1.5401 from $1.5313.

Carlyle to sell New York skyscraper for $1.3bn

Carlyle Group has agreed to sell a New York office tower for $1.3bn, the largest deal for a US building since 2010.

The Washington-based private equity group has spearheaded a deal to sell its 600,000 square foot 650 Madison Avenue office and retail block to a joint venture between retail developer Crown Acquisitions and investment firm Highgate Holdings, for almost twice what it paid for it five years ago.

Carlyle led a group of investors that bought the 27-storey glass-fronted skyscraper in one of Manhattan's prime tourist and office areas for $680m in 2008, according to research firm Real Capital Analytics, before refurbishing and leasing out the property.

If the deal goes through, it will the biggest sale of a single building in the US since Google bought the 2.9m square feet 111 Eighth Avenue in December 2010 for $1.8bn.

"This was one of the best office and retail investments made during the financial crisis," said Robert Stuckey, managing director and head of US real estate at Carlyle.

The sale marks the second profitable exit of a 2008 investment. Carlyle teamed up with Crown to buy a majority stake in the retail portion of 666 Fifth Avenue for $524m which it later sold for $1.08bn after introducing new tenants including Japanese retailer Uniqlo, surf-themed clothing brand Hollister and fast fashion chain Zara

The latest deal would equate to $2,167 per sq ft, which would beat the last record price for an office tower in New York of $1,566 per square feet paid by the private equity firm Somerset Partners for the 325,000 square feet 450 Park Avenue tower ahead of the financial downturn in 2007.

Haim Chera, managing principal of Crown, emphasised the difference between 650 Madison and 450 Park, saying the price was largely a reflection of the 75,000 sq ft of ground-floor retail space, which he values at $1bn. The property is located in one of the world's most expensive and highly-coveted retail districts close to the landmark Plaza Hotel and Central Park.

"The property stands at the centre of a 'retail triangle' with Barneys to the north, Bergdorf Goodman to the west and Bloomingdale's to the east making it one of the most desirable retail locations anywhere," Mr Chera said.

Investors have sought after New York trophy assets as haven investments, which has resulted in rising property values. While many office properties have struggled to recover from the financial downturn as corporations downsize or seek cheaper alternatives, retail properties - particularly along the high-profile shopping corridors popular with tourists and luxury customers - have performed better.

Crown and Highgate will borrow close to half the purchase price, meaning they intend to have about $650m of equity in the property. They thwarted rival bids from others including HFZ Capital Group, Vornado Realty Trust, Brookfield Office Properties and General Growth Properties.

The property is 92 per cent leased. 650 Madison serves as Polo Ralph Lauren's international corporate headquarters and has large retail tenants including Crate & Barrel and luxury designer Tod's.

The pension gap

Fee Paying more to fund managers does not mean better returns. By John Authers

With its national parks and miles of stunning coastline, the English county of Devon has obvious attractions to pensioners. But there are less obvious attractions, too.

Devon's pension fund pays relatively little in fees to investment managers compared with other English counties - yet the performance of the fund is in line with its peers. Staffordshire's pension fund pays more than three times as much, for a fund that is almost identical.

The difference, revealed by a ground-breaking study based on annual reports of the 100 local authority pension plans in the UK , provided to the FT by Investor Data Services, a London consultancy, was not unusual. The most expensive quarter of funds paid an average of more than four times as much for investment management as the cheapest quarter.

With returns falling, fund managers across the world face complaints about fees and a lack of transparency. Active managers are under pressure to justify their fees in the face of growing competition from cheaper passive funds that merely track benchmark indices. These findings will fuel debate over how UK council pensions should be run and whether funds are sufficiently transparent.

The council's funds are managed by some of the biggest names in global asset management. But it is impossible from public data to ascertain the fees and commissions each charge.

UK council plans, which managed 187.3bn between them at the end of the last financial year, are typical of many across the world - but the UK's public-sector disclosure rules allow a look at fees that might stay hidden.

Neither Staffordshire nor Devon is exceptional; they are an interesting example because they appear similar. They are the same size: Devon had 2.68bn in March 2012, against 2.62bn for Staffordshire. They have a similar spread of assets in fixed income, equities and property, with a little money given to hedge fund managers. Both hold the same top three stocks (Royal Dutch Shell, Vodafone and HSBC) while three fund managers work for both counties. They follow the same public-sector procurement rules.

Yet Staffordshire paid 7.152m for fund management in 2011-12, while Devon paid 2.669m. And Staffordshire's bill for administration came to 2.033m, while Devon paid 1.225m.

Over the preceding eight years, Devon paid 3.9m less in investment fees per year and 850,000 less in administration fees. That means Staffordshire paid 38.2m more than Devon for essentially the same job. In overall return over the past decade, Devon has gained 6 per cent a year and Staffordshire 5.7 per cent - in line with the average council, according to State Street Investment Analytics.

Staffordshire county council said: "Hymans Robertson, the actuarial and investment consultancy, has conducted extensive analysis of fee statistics for local government pension schemes and has confirmed that our level of fees are consistent with those paid by other authorities.

"Fund structures can be very complex, so even if they appear to be superficially the same, without detailed analysis it is very difficult to make a 'like for like' comparison."

Council annual reports do not offer benchmarks for costs. It is only by collating cost data, often buried in footnotes, that discrepancies emerge.

One reason anomalies develop is the length of the value chain for pensions. The final return to investors is stated but it is unclear how much this has been reduced by avoidable fees.

Hymans Robertson, which could not comment on individual cases, said that funds the size of Devon or Staffordshire should be paying fees of 25 to 35 basis points. Anything lower would imply that they were "not fully disclosing fees". This could be because they invest in pooled funds "where the manager fees are charged within the fund and reflected in the unit price rather than paid explicitly" by the council. (Devon had a 6 per cent allocation to pooled funds in its latest report). High charges could stem from "funds of funds".

Officials at Devon said they doubted that a cost benchmark would be useful because strategies vary widely.

Another explanation for the discrepancies is that not all the necessary data are available to the public. The costs that funds' investment managers incur in buying and selling stocks are shown in report footnotes (Staffordshire's managers spent 3.28m on commissions, Devon's 959,000). Commission charges vary hugely across the sector, according to IDS's data.

When Christopher Sier, an independent consultant, built a database on commissions using freedom of information requests, he estimated average portfolio turnover at about 120 per cent a year - which seemed high as many funds were passive. But firm conclusions were impossible because information was redacted, often including the names of both the fund managers and their brokers.

Local authorities are already attacking costs. Some are forming consortiums to award contracts or planning to merge their administration. Concentration of managers is falling, with the top five managers accounting for 38 per cent of externally managed assets, from 56 per cent a decade ago.

They are also moving from active managers to passive index-trackers, which now account for 24 per cent of assets, according to the WM UK Local Authority Fund Annual Review - up from 14 per cent 10 years earlier.

Some are negotiating more aggressively with their fund managers. Linda Selman, of Hymans Robertson, said: "They simply ask managers what fee concessions they can make and explain the environment they are living with. That's had a pretty good level of success. When managers have been put under pressure they've offered maybe 10 per cent of the fee."

Some also negotiate on outcomes. One small council cut its investment management fees to only 0.05 per cent in one year because it had entrusted all its assets with one fund manager, in return for a rebate if performance dropped below an agreed benchmark. The manager failed to meet its three-year benchmark and forfeited fees.

The IDS research suggests pension funds will need to offer far more transparency about their charges - and that fund managers can look forward to even more aggressive negotiations in future.

Dollar Under Mild Pressure in Thin Trade

The dollar is under mild pressure across the board Monday but the moves are small and trading ranges tight across currency markets with the U.K. and U.S. markets closed.

The commodity-linked currencies of Australia, New Zealand and Canada recovered from the losses made in Asia, while the euro marked a fresh day high of $1.2949 against the buck during Monday's European trading session.

But with traders out in London--the world's largest FX dealing hub--volumes were light. And there was little in the way of newsflow.

"There's been no big data out...so there nothing fundamentally driving moves," said Lutz Karpowitz, a senior currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.

The subdued tone is likely to continue for the rest of Monday, with markets also shut in the U.S. later for Memorial Day.

When traders return to work Tuesday the focus will continue to be on the U.S. as market participants look for signs for when the Federal Reserve might start tapering back its bond purchases.

"With the Fed firmly in data-dependent mode, incoming data and Fed officials' comments will continue to drive the dollar's performance," foreign-exchange strategists at Barclays said in a note to clients, pointing out that consumer confidence data for May due Tuesday and Chicago's PMI reading published Friday are important releases to watch.

Elsewhere, the yen was steady against the dollar, despite a 3.2% fall on the Nikkei Stock Average. With a large part of the FX market out, comments from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda calling on commercial banks with solid capital positions to be more aggressive in lending, also had little impact on the yen. Similarly, minutes from the Bank of Japan's April 26 meeting published overnight, in which the board appeared to be split over the interpretation of rising government bond yields, failed to stir the Japanese currency.

Elsewhere, the Swedish krona recovered fully from its fall against the euro on weaker-than-expected retail sales data for April. These rose only 2% on the year, compared with a forecast of a 3.2% rise, according to a survey by Dow Jones Newswires.

"Although the data is a bit lower than expected its still positive," said Mr. Karpowitz.

Swedish gross domestic product data for the first-quarter due Wednesday, is likely to be more important for the currency.

"We expect a weak first-quarter GDP, well below the Riksbank's forecast, and if we are right, it will likely strengthen calls for a new rate cut from the Riksbank in July, which is not fully priced in," said Sverre Holbek, a senior analyst at Danske Bank said.

At 1058 GMT, the euro was trading at $1.2946 against the dollar, compared with $1.2925, late Friday in New York, according to trading system EBS. The dollar was at 100.86 against the yen, compared with 101.38, while the euro was at 130.58, compared with 130.97. The pound was trading at $1.5134 against the dollar, compared with $1.5127 late Friday in New York.

The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies, was at 75.14 from 75.257.

Bay Area -- The Valley: Venture Firms Build Own Software to Gain an Edge

By Evelyn M. Rusli

A new website named Grove popped up earlier this year to help entrepreneurs find potential recruits, talk to other startups and track rivals' growth.

That is if the entrepreneur is backed by Sequoia Capital, the well-known venture-capital firm, which built the service for the companies it has invested in.

The 41-year-old Sequoia is one of a growing number of Silicon Valley venture-capital firms now creating proprietary software to gain an edge in the increasingly competitive industry.

Some are creating apps to scout potential deals by aggregating data across the Web and their community of companies. Others are building software -- like Grove, named after clusters of sequoia trees -- to help grow companies they have already invested in.

Sequoia is doing a bit of both.

Grove also features an analytics service the firm developed to help track rising startups to invest in, says Bryan Schreier, a general partner at Sequoia. The service, called Rivalytics, tracks traffic for a mobile app based on public download data provided by Apple Inc. and Google Inc. and private data from Sequoia's companies. By matching the data sets and using statistical analysis, Rivalytics can estimate an app's usage.

Mr. Schreier says the firm had previously created services for its startups by using a hodgepodge of applications from its past investments in companies like Google and LinkedIn Corp. and building stand-alone tools. It built the new website to integrate it "all into a 2013 look and feel," he says.

A Sequoia spokesman declined to say which potential investments the software has helped spot.

Meanwhile, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has been investing in a similar service: an internal program called Dragnet, named after the famous television police series. Built in 2011, the Dragnet website pulls data from multiple sources such as app stores, news sources and LinkedIn to help the firm's partners identify rising startups. Kleiner also shares data from Dragnet with its companies to help them understand broad market trends.

A Kleiner spokeswoman declined to comment on which investments it helped mine from the website, but says it has been helpful.

The new software comes as venture capitalists battle to differentiate themselves. Some have increased their marketing budgets; others have hired armies of specialists in areas like recruiting.

Josh Kopelman, a managing partner at First Round Capital, says hosting a platform that pools resources and insights from its community increases the value of the firm to its entrepreneurs. Mr. Kopelman describes it as another tool in his toolbox when he is courting new investments.

"We do a reverse pitch, where we can pitch them on our platform," says Mr. Kopelman.

He says First Round Capital has spent more than $1 million building an online service that allows its venture capitalists and portfolio companies to ask questions, search job candidates and compare salaries. The firm hired two engineers to build and manage the service.

Mr. Kopelman declined to disclose the service's traffic but says there are employees from 170 companies on the site and they ping its Q&A service hundreds of times a month. "This is about building the DNA into our firm," says Mr. Kopelman.

At least one venture-capitalist-turned-entrepreneur is trying to sell collaboration software to venture firms that don't want to build their own.

Paul Singh, a former partner at seed investment firm 500 Startups, left the company earlier this year to work on his startup, Dashboard.io, full-time. The service is based on software he built to help companies that 500 Startups invested in to network among themselves. Currently, about 50 firms are using it.

The service is free and Mr. Singh wants to eventually make money through charging for premium features. He is considering a tool that will allow startups to compare metrics, such as how often they deploy code, to anonymous data from other companies using the system.

The company wants to "be the Bloomberg of private startups," says Mr. Singh, referring to the media company's data platform for finance professionals.

Wealth Management Journal
Advisers Coax Investors Off Sidelines

The four-year rally in U.S. stocks is proving more resilient than many investors had expected, prompting some portfolio managers to steer their affluent clients away from staying on the sidelines in cash or fixed-income.

To coax clients back into equities, advisers remind them that today's market isn't set up for a fall like the tech bubble of 1999-2000 or the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

"Stocks are probably a little bit overvalued and due for a correction. But we don't see Armageddon coming," says Don Riley, chief investment officer at the Wiley Group in Conshohocken, Pa., which manages $200 million in assets.

Instead of heading into money-market funds, he's advising clients to remain diversified through such exchange-traded funds as the WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend (DLN) and the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ).

"This is a very different looking market than we've seen in the past--there's not nearly the same level of speculation taking place," Mr. Riley says, recalling his days as a trader on the floor of the Philadelphia stock exchange during crashes in 1987 and through the tech-wreck years.

While he doesn't suggest that investors try to time market peaks and bottoms, adviser Josh Brown of Fusion Analytics believes they should realize that the market's peak in 1999 capped "one of the greatest market manias in history."

The current run-up, which traces its roots back to early March 2009, appears to Mr. Brown as rather "run of the mill" from a historical perspective.

But some bearish analysts disagree, arguing that investors are paying a lot more for stocks than they probably realize.

One popular metric used in gauging whether a stock is pricey, for instance, is a price-to-earnings ratio advanced by Yale professor Robert Shiller that takes into account a decade's worth of past inflation-adjusted earnings. The idea is to smooth market bumps over the longer term to give investors a better view of current pricing levels.

Advisers like Mr. Brown, whose firm manages more than $350 million in assets, take exception to such alternative valuations. Besides taking into account more garden-variety recessions in its earnings calculations, the Shiller PE measure also includes the market's fall from its 2007 peak through early 2009.

The result is a raising of valuations to "extreme" PE multiples that are "obscenely flawed," suggesting that the market is peaking, Mr. Brown says.

Another selling point supporting the current rally's strength has been its relatively broad base of market participants.

For example, in 1999 less than one-fifth of the S&P 500's sectors were within 5% of their 52-week highs. At the market's top in 2007, about half were at or near peak levels.

Today, around 89% are at those high-water marks, according to S&P Capital IQ data.

"If you're looking for a decline in market participation, you're not going to find it today," says Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at the New York-based research firm.

Market momentum is much more reminiscent of 1995 than 1999 or 2007, says Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co., which manages more than $7 billion in assets. In that year, stocks rose more than 30% after a sluggish 1994, he points out.

"People still doubt this rally; they think it's built on a sugar high fed by the Federal Reserve's easy-money policies," Mr. Smith says. But he's finding that there are key fundamental factors behind the latest bull run that argue against any huge downturn in stocks.

Earnings on S&P 500 companies are running more than double the rate of 1999, Mr. Smith says. So are dividend yields on blue-chip stocks.

Investors aren't paying up as much this time around, either. Mr. Smith observes that investors are facing a traditional PE multiple of 14.5, which is less than half as much as 14 years ago.

Haverford Trust still likes prospects for stock ETFs, such as the iShares Dow Jones International Select Dividend Income Fund (IDV) and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO), Mr. Smith notes.

"Now that we're more than four years removed from the global financial crisis, it's finally starting to sink in with more people that this market is unique and has to be evaluated on its own merits," Mr. Smith says.

The Property Report
Starwood Capital Goes Shopping for Malls

Starwood Capital Group is in talks to buy seven U.S. shopping malls from Westfield Group for more than $1 billion, a deal that would mark the latest in a flurry of big-ticket acquisitions of retail property.

Starwood's talks with Westfield aren't yet in the final stages and still could collapse, according to people familiar with the matter.

The discussions come as retail property continues to rebound from the economic downturn while fending off competition from online shopping. In addition, buyers are emboldened by low interest rates and the increasing availability of financing, notably from the resurgent market for securitized mortgages.

In another recent deal, private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP this month agreed to sell its majority stake in 30 U.S. shopping centers to DDR Corp. for $1.46 billion. Meantime, Blackstone also is preparing for an initial public offering or sale of its strip-center owner, Brixmor Property Group, by the end of this year.

Retail was one of the last property sectors to begin recovering from the downturn. Occupancy rates and rents showed little increase as consumers held back, retailers contracted and Internet retail expanded.

But the outlook has improved lately. The average vacancy rate for retail properties in the top 63 U.S. markets was 6.8% in the first quarter, down from a recent high of 7.5% in 2010, according to CoStar Group.

Construction of new retail space remains relatively low, allowing landlords to fill vacancies with restaurants, health clubs and expanding retailers such as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance Inc.

"Sales productivity has come back with a vengeance," said Cedrik Lachance, an analyst with Green Street Advisors Inc. "The occupancy rate at better properties is either back to or in excess of the previous peak in 2007. So you have an industry that is far healthier than is commonly believed."

Commercial-real-estate sales in all categories have been gaining thanks to the strengthening economy, rising values and low interest rates. Last year, deal volume hit $294 billion, compared with $229 billion in 2011 and $66 billion in 2009, according to Real Capital Analytics. Retail deals in 2012 totaled $55 billion, up 25% from 2011.

Buyers of retail property have been taking advantage of debt financing available from the sale of commercial mortgage-backed securities, a market that has been gathering steam. Of the $34.1 billion of commercial mortgages securitized so far this year, 32% have been backed by retail properties, more than any other commercial property type, according to Trepp LLC.

Westfield, based in Sydney, owns stakes in 100 malls world-wide. Since 2010, the company has been focusing on its highest-performing malls, selling its mediocre properties. Last year, Starwood acquired a 90% stake in seven U.S. malls from Westfield for $1.05 billion.

Blackstone's public sale of Brixmor is expected to be one of the largest real-estate IPOs since the financial crisis.

The New York-based private-equity firm values the business around $13 billion, say people familiar with the matter. Brixmor owns 90 million square feet of space at approximately 525 properties, making it the largest wholly owned shopping-center portfolio in the U.S.

Blackstone has spent hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading the shopping centers, much of that to attract anchor tenants, such as Wal-Mart, Safeway and TJ Maxx.

While Blackstone has added about 50 centers to the portfolio and shed about 75, the bulk of Brixmor's assets were acquired in 2011 in a $9.4 billion purchase of Australian landlord Centro Properties Group's U.S. operations.

In that deal, Blackstone assumed $8 billion of debt and eventually refinanced it. Brixmor has reduced some of that debt, but it isn't clear how much debt the company currently has.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Pimco shuns 'grim' high yields

Fund focus

Valuations have climbed too much, writes Nick Reeve

Investors should avoid US shares offering high levels of dividend income because valuations have reached risky levels, says Pimco's equity income team.

Raji Manasseh, senior vice-president for dividend strategies at the California-based investment giant, says the team fears the prospects for many high-yielding sectors are grim.

"Financial repression has driven a thirst for yield," Mr Manasseh says. "Clients have funnelled into a narrow range of dividend stocks and raised values to historic highs."

The team has responded by selling down US high-income shares on its Pimco EqS Dividend global equity strategy, focusing on the telecoms, utilities and real estate investment trusts (Reits) sectors. The strategy, which is available through US and Dublin-based funds, was launched in December 2011 amid a push by Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's chief executive, to reduce the group's overwhelming focus on fixed income.

"Since 1995, US telecoms have traded in line with the wider market, but now they are at a 40 per cent premium. You have to ask if these companies are worth 19-20 times next year's earnings," says Mr Manasseh.

The team is also concerned about valuations in US utilities . Compared with its historic trading level of roughly 20 per cent cheaper than the wider market, the sector is now also priced at a significant premium, the senior vice-president adds.

The team is further wary about healthcare, in which Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have booked significant share price gains over the past six months, buoyed by investors' thirst for healthy levels of income.

Pfizer's shares have gained 19.4 per cent while Johnson & Johnson has added 21.7 per cent, with both companies contributing to the 17.4 per cent rise seen on the wider S&P 500 index during that period.

Pimco has deepened its focus on areas such as technology, which is traditionally a growth-orientated sector. News flow in the sector was hijacked by technology company Apple's announcement in April that it was hiking its annual payout by 15 per cent to $3.05 a share. The company's shares now yield roughly 2.7 per cent.

But Mr Manasseh says the team is instead focusing on Apple's main rival Microsoft, on the basis that it offers a more stable dividend model.

He criticises Apple's decision to partially fund its dividend increase with a $17bn (10.9bn) bond issue earlier this month, adding that a number of other US companies had declared dividends in recent months "but not on a scale we like to see".

Pimco's income managers are also considering areas such as infrastructure, with toll road operators in China, Latin America and Europe offering a 5-6 per cent yield at "more attractive valuations", Mr Manasseh says. Elsewhere, the managers are topping up holdings in "selected companies" in the UK, including Imperial Tobacco.

The Dublin-based Pimco EqS Dividend fund has gained 27.2 per cent since launch in December 2011, according to FE Analytics.

Managing: Wanted: More Directors Who Are Digital Savvy

Nearly every facet of corporate life has gone digital. But many public-company boards remain stuck in analog mode.

That has started to change. Boards worried about their scant digital expertise are scrambling to recruit newcomers who can advise management on strategies for mobile devices, social media and data analytics.

"The avalanche of digital activity is making directors conclude they are increasingly ill-equipped in the boardroom," observes Tuck Rickards, a managing director of recruiters Russell Reynolds Associates Inc.

Digital directors, who are sometimes decades younger than many of their colleagues, weigh in on marketing strategy, business alliances and even recruitment, several company leaders say.

The shift has made digital experts like Jeffrey F. Rayport hot commodities in U.S. boardrooms. Dr. Rayport, an operating partner of private-equity firm Castanea Partners, taught the first digital-strategy course at Harvard Business School in the 1990s and later ran the digital-strategy arm of consultants Monitor Group. He says he now fields more than a dozen feelers a year.

"It's a little overwhelming," says Dr. Rayport, who already holds directorships at Monster Worldwide Inc. and ValueClick Inc.

"I have never seen such an acceleration of demand for specific board expertise," says Clarke Murphy, the chief executive of Russell Reynolds. The search firm handled 10 U.S. hunts for digitally savvy directors last year. Its first such assignment resulted in Facebook Inc. executive Sheryl Sandberg joining Walt Disney Co.'s board in 2010.

Because boards at public companies want members with C-suite experience, the pool of digital candidates is small and usually doesn't include entrepreneurial startup veterans, recruiters say.

As a result, finding a digital director can take six to 12 months, which is twice as long as a typical board search, says Norbert Gottenberg, a solo high-tech recruiter. "Both sides are picky," he adds. Boards vet digital prospects more carefully than they do traditional ones, while qualified candidates "want to be on the right board."

Dr. Rayport, for example, is weighing three other directorship offers at publicly held businesses but says he wants to make sure that he's "not playing the role of window dressing."

Thirty-seven of the 100 biggest U.S. companies lack directors with digital expertise, and only 16 have at least three such members comprising 20% of the board, a Russell Reynolds analysis concludes. "Highly digital" boards include Cisco Systems Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and Allstate Corp.

Mark Vadon received his first public-company board invitation in 2006 but waited years before accepting one. The co-founder, chairman and former CEO of Blue Nile Inc., an online retailer of jewelry that went public in 2004, also co-launched and chairs Zulily Inc. The flash-sale site derives almost 40% of its revenue from smartphones and tablets.

For years, Mr. Vadon spurned feelers because they only came from Internet-related businesses. "It wasn't very different from what I was already doing," he says.

Then Home Depot Inc., a home-improvement chain eager to expand online sales, approached Mr. Vadon in 2012 as part of a push to bolster its board's digital expertise. CEO Frank Blake even flew to Seattle to woo him.

Appointed last September, the 43-year-old entrepreneur is younger and wears his hair longer than the others who sit on Home Depot's board. "Whatever his appearance, he was an incredible addition," says Bonnie Hill, the independent lead director.

Among other things, Mr. Vadon says he has urged executives to tailor ad pitches for mobile devices and enlarge the ranks of mobile developers by training current staffers. A Home Depot spokeswoman agrees that "mobile is a priority" but declined to discuss specific strategies.

At Starbucks Corp., digital director Clara Shih played a pivotal role in a mobile-payments deal forged with startup Square Inc. last August. Ms. Shih, named to the coffee chain's board at age 29 in December 2011, runs Hearsay Social, which helps companies use social media.

Though startup leaders are often less wedded to hierarchy and formal structure, Ms. Shih says she felt the Starbucks directorship offered an "extraordinary opportunity" to learn how big businesses operate.

Square will eventually process credit and debit transactions at about 7,000 U.S. Starbucks stores through Square's smartphone app.

Pace Picks Up on Tech IPOs --- Large Group of Maturing Silicon Valley Startups Will Test Post-Facebook Waters

A year after Facebook Inc.'s botched initial public offering, Silicon Valley's IPO pipeline is starting to fill up again.

Following a slowdown in technology IPOs after Facebook's offering last May, companies including microblogging service Twitter Inc., peer-to-peer lending site Lending Club Corp. and software-tools startup Atlassian are among those preparing to go public, said executives and people familiar with the matter.

While some of the companies are in the early stages of preparing for an IPO, others are likely to file within the next year to 18 months, they said.

Any consumer technology companies that test the IPO market would be closely watched as bellwethers of demand for such stocks.

The busiest sector continues to be companies selling software to businesses. Marketing-software maker Marketo Inc., and analytics-software company Tableau Software Inc. are expected to begin trading Friday. Network security firm FireEye Inc. and corporate mobile-device management company Good Technology Corp. have hired banks and could list later this year, said people familiar with their plans. Another considering the leap is utility-software company Opower Inc.

A cluster of advertising-technology firms, including Criteo and YuMe Inc., are also eyeing 2013 listings, people familiar with the situation said.

Among consumer-focused companies, sports camera-maker GoPro Inc. is eyeing possibly going public later this year, according to people familiar with its thinking.

The first quarter was relatively quiet for tech IPOs. Overall, six tech or Internet-related companies went public in the first quarter, down from 15 in the same period a year ago, according to Dealogic. Some companies have slowed their IPO march because of the availability of private financing, which allows startups to delay offerings. Others have put off IPOs until they are more confident that their public valuations would well exceed where they had raised money privately.

Others, though, are beginning to stir. There was a burst of offerings in March and April including Marin Software Inc. and Rally Software Development Corp. and it appears the time is ripe for more.

"The number of private companies across Silicon Valley that is mature is at an all-time high," said Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures. "There's a huge pipeline and backlog of IPOs."

Among the factors spurring the pickup in activity are the soaring stock market, said investors and bankers.

Many tech companies have grown rapidly over the past few years to a public-company scale and are considering taking advantage of the IPO window, they said.

At the same time, rules that went into effect last year with the JOBS Act allow companies to file for an IPO and keep their finances confidential until they are closer to a roadshow. That has prodded some startups that were once leery of public scrutiny to accelerate filing plans, said Jeff Vetter, a partner specializing in IPOs and securities law at law firm Fenwick & West, which helped take Facebook public last year.

The tech IPO business is "much busier," said Mr. Vetter. He estimates Fenwick will work on about 12 tech IPOs this year (including three the firm has already taken public), up from six last year.

Facebook's poor IPO has also helped other potential IPO candidates because investor expectations have deflated, said Renaud Laplanche, chief executive of Lending Club. Mr. Laplanche, who forecasts his San Francisco company will be ready to file for an IPO "by sometime next year," said Facebook's IPO "brought a little more sanity to the market." That encouraged him because "the last thing we want is a stock price that shoots up 200% on the first day and then goes down from there," he said.

One of the most anticipated public offerings is Twitter, which has been valued at more than $10 billion by investors. Company executives have been preparing internally for a public offering, which some investors said privately they expect within a year. A company spokesman did not return requests for comment.

At file-storage service Box Inc., CEO Aaron Levie said going public would give the company a new currency for acquisitions and help it better serve enterprises. While he said an IPO is "unlikely this year," he cited 2014 as a possibility.

"Being a private company gives us a little more flexibility but [being public] is certainly in our sights," Mr. Levie said. He declined to comment on the San Francisco company's financials, except to say revenue rose 150% last year.

Other high-profile tech companies are on a slower IPO track. Box rival Dropbox Inc. is one of those, according to two people familiar with the company's thinking who said the startup has no current plans to go public. Dropbox raised $250 million in 2011 at around a $4 billion valuation and is profitable. Dropbox didn't respond to request for comment.

BNP launches full-service mobile bank

BNP Paribas is to tap rising demand for banking services by mobile phone users with the launch of a full-service dedicated mobile bank across four European countries.

Hello Bank starts with zero customers but aims to have 1.4m by 2017 in Germany, Belgium, France and Italy. The bank launched on Thursday in the first two countries, with France to follow next month and Italy in October.

Banks in France are looking for new customers in the face of stagnant or declining revenue growth in the domestic retail business because of the contraction in the economy and falling demand for loans.

Chris Harvey, global head of financial services at Deloitte, the consultancy, said: "Banks are increasingly looking for new growth avenues. The digital and mobile sector is one promising area that also has the potential to reduce radically the cost base."

Of the 1.4m customers BNP is targeting, up to one-third are likely to be existing BNP clients deciding to transfer their branch based accounts but Franois Villeroy de Galhau, BNP's chief operating officer, said the aim was to attract new customers and to respond to the "explosion" of smartphone usage since 2010.

"In France no one used their mobile for banking services in 2010 - now there are 700,000 people who do and that is growing at 50 per cent a year," he said.

Hello bank is "the first full-range bank specifically designed for mobiles with a rapid and permanent connection", said Mr Villeroy, offering products available in branches. Most other mobile banking services were either payments-based or transfers of technology from the internet to mobiles and tablets, he said.

Some  80m will be invested this year - mainly the cost of acquiring new clients - and Hello bank is expected to break even within four years.

Its accounts and payments will be free - in France, there is usually a charge for debit cards - and its savings rates would be "attractive" said BNP. It will have a back-up staff of 900 for mobile customers, who will have to use the branch network to deposit cash and cheques.

BNP said that Hello bank would entail lower costs than a branch-based network because it needed less paper and fewer employees. But in turn, revenue per customer would be lower.

Banks are looking to cut costs to boost profitability. BNP, which is at the start of a  2bn three-year cost-cutting programme, said this week it expected a "significant" drop in staffing levels in France. Baudouin Prot, chairman, told shareholders at the group's annual meeting on Wednesday that: "Our employee levels will go down in France this year."

France has the second highest penetration rate of online bank usage in Europe - 60 per cent of internet users visit an online bank - after the Netherlands, according to ComScore, the data analytics group.

ING Group's banking website has the highest number of online visitors, according to ComScore, followed by Crdit Agricole and Lloyds Banking Group. BNP is ranked eighth, according to ComScore.

Investment banks' drive into forex proves less lucrative

Investment banks saw dwindling returns in their foreign exchange divisions in the first quarter amid fierce competition on prices, even as the sharp fall in the Japanese yen led investors to pile into the currency market .

Revenues at the 10 largest banks by volume in the forex market fell 3 per cent in the first three months from the period in 2012, according to figures from Coalition, a financial services analytics company.

It does not measure profits, and few investment banks break out figures on forex from their wider fixed income divisions.

The drive by investment banks to expand forex divisions is proving less lucrative than in previous years .

Total revenues at the 10 banks - which include Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Barclays, UBS, HSBC and JPMorgan - were $2bn.

That marked a fall from $2.2bn in the first three months of 2012 and was well below the bumper third quarter of 2008, when turmoil around the collapse of Lehman Brothers helped forex bankers at the top 10 to revenues of $4.8bn.

Investment banks trading the large currencies have found it harder to make money in recent years. Faster electronic trading has hurt margins and banks have become more competitive on pricing.

In response to dwindling interest in trading the euro in 2011 and 2012, some banks temporarily waived transaction costs to retain market share. "Spreads continue to tighten to levels we never thought possible - it's a hyper-competitive market," said Jeff Feig, head of G10 forex at Citigroup in New York.

Yet banks remain focused on their forex divisions, which require less capital to manage in an era when regulators are calling for banks to put more money aside as a buffer against future economic slumps.

"It's a no-brainer product for the banks," said George Kuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition. "We've seen significant attention from investment banks in foreign exchange in the last two to three years due to the low capital requirements."

Coalition's figures show a significant decline in revenues from forward products - derivatives that allow investors and companies to protect themselves against moves in interest rates - offsetting rises in spot and options products driven by hedge funds selling the yen.

Steadier interest rates as a result of central bank easing this year have led to fewer forward contracts being taken out, banks reported.

Lifelines for Investors on Their Own

A reader in Minneapolis needs "direction" with her three pots of money a regular individual retirement account, a Roth IRA and a taxable account, totaling $725,000 but speaks for many investors when she writes:

"I have a hard time believing any adviser they all want to sweep up my assets and collect 1% of the total annually."

Meanwhile, she joins the growing ranks of so-called mass affluent investors (variously defined as investors with $100,000 to $1 million or $2 million in investible assets) who end up "self-directing" their portfolios fending for themselves, many by default.

Assets at the likes of Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, Vanguard Group and other so-called direct providers of investments grew 9% to $3.7 trillion in 2011, from $3.4 trillion in 2010, outstripping the 3% growth in retail investment assets overall, according to new research from analytics firm Cerulli Associates.

Sensing an opportunity, direct providers have been shrewdly expanding their own investment advisory services. At the same time, a new breed of online financial advisory firm is out to do what human advisers do, only with software and without the mazes of fees and conflicts of interest that can plague traditional brokerage firms.

Here's the lowdown:

Discount brokers and no-load fund companies generally offer different levels of service.

The most basic comes in the form of all-in-one funds. These are off-the-shelf funds with a diversified mix of investments. Some, such as Fidelity's Asset Manager funds and Vanguard's LifeStrategy Funds, maintain a fixed asset allocation over time. Others, such as target-date retirement funds and 529 college-savings-plan funds, are managed with a specific date in mind and grow more conservative as that date approaches. In either case, all you pay are the management expenses of the fund.

Schwab and Fidelity offer a range of so-called managed accounts, portfolios of funds and individual securities assembled by professional money managers. At Schwab, the minimum account size is $25,000 for a diversified portfolio of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Annual account fees range from 0.2% to 0.9% of assets, on top of the underlying fund fees.

You also can buy a financial plan that comes with a list of recommended investments. At Vanguard, the cost is $1,000 for those with accounts under $50,000, and $250 for those with between $50,000 and $500,000 in assets at the firm. This includes the plan and a one-time phone consultation with an adviser.

For your own personal financial planner who'll provide continuing investment recommendations, Vanguard charges an annual "service" fee of 0.7% on the first $1 million in assets, 0.35% on the next $1 million, and 0.2% on subsequent amounts on top of its fund expenses, which average 0.19%. There's a $500,000 account minimum, and a minimum annual service fee of $4,500.

Software-based advisers invest your money in portfolios of low-cost index funds, using algorithms to determine the mix of investments that's right for you. They also continuously rebalance your account when stock-bond allocations stray from targets.

"https://www.betterment.com/" charges an annual fee equal to 0.35% of assets on accounts up to $10,000, 0.25% on amounts above that, up to $100,000, and 0.15% on amounts above $100,000. It allocates your money between two diversified baskets of ETFs one containing stocks, the other Treasury bonds.

"https://www.wealthfront.com/" charges nothing on investment amounts up to $10,000, and 0.25% on higher amounts. It uses a wider array of asset classes, including municipal and corporate bonds and real estate. And it continually trolls for chances to realize losses to offset gains in an effort to improve after-tax returns.

At both services, fees embedded in the cost of the underlying ETFs average an additional 0.14% or so per year.

Adam Nash, Wealthfront's chief operating officer, says rebalancing alone can add 0.4% a year to returns and better tax planning, another 1%.

Wealthfront's clients value transparency more than a human touch, he adds. For them, trust is earned not with a handshake but with clear, timely disclosure of costs and portfolio holdings.

Concern at Bloomberg access to users' data; MEDIA

JPMorgan points to reporters' practices

Bloomberg has come under fire from two of its largest clients after JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs expressed concern that Bloomberg News journalists had used private details of how bankers use its powerful financial data terminals to steer their reporting.

People close to JPMorgan said they had raised informal concerns with Bloom-berg News that its reporters had used data about when its employees logged in and out of the terminal to inform their coverage of last year's "London whale" trading loss.

A spokesman for Bloomberg said he was unaware of any record of any such complaint.

News of JPMorgan's concern came after the New York Post reported that Goldman had formally complained after Bloomberg reporters approached executives to ask about partners who had not logged on for some time. A Goldman spokesman confirmed that it had raised the matter with Bloomberg.

Bloomberg said it had disabled journalists' access to customer relationship information "in light of [Goldman's] concern as well as a general heightened sensitivity to data access".

"Limited customer relationship data has long been available to our journalists, and has never included clients' security-level data, position data, trading data or messages," a spokesman said.

Bloomberg News has long seen a competitive advantage in encouraging its reporters to use the wealth of data on its terminals to generate news stories others miss, but few clients knew that reporters could also see when they were logging in and out of the system and which functions they were accessing.

Bloomberg reporters have been able to see broad information on which functions users access, such as equities or commodities, and aggregated data on how many people read each news story. They have not been able to see marketsensitive details of individual equities or other assets users track or which news stories individuals have read, however, or see details of messages sent over Bloomberg's heavily-used messaging service.

Regulators are paying growing attention to the way in which search engines, social networks and other businesses use information on their customers, as companies balance the value to be gleaned from analysing "big data" with the need to protect users' privacy.

Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg's closest competitor in financial data and newswires, said its terminal business and newsroom "operate completely independently with reporters having no access to non-public data on its customers, especially any data relating to its customers' use of its products or services".

Thomson Reuters collects and analyses aggregated and anonymous customer data, a spokeswoman said, but "there are strict controls in place that prevent any Reuters or other staff outside of the development groups from accessing this data in any form".

Goldman issues formal complaint

Bloomberg has come under fire from two of its largest clients, with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs expressing concern that its journalists had used private details of how bankers use its powerful financial data terminals to steer their reporting.

Dan Doctoroff, chief executive, said yesterday that it had long made limited customer data available to journalists, but "we realise this was a mistake".

In response, Bloomberg has appointed an executive to review data compliance policies and disabled reporters' access to information about when customers log in, which functions they access and what contact they have with its help desk.

It acted after a formal complaint from Goldman, whose executives were unnerved by calls from journalists that mentioned when Goldman employees logged in and which Bloomberg functions they used, said one person familiar with the complaint.

Bloomberg said it had limited journalists' access "in light of [Goldman's] concern as well as a general heightened sensitivity to data access". In a memo to clients and staff, Mr Doctoroff added: "Client trust is our highest priority and the cornerstone of our business."

People at JPMorgan said they believed Bloomberg reporters had used login information to try to determine whether Bruno Iksil, the London-based derivatives trader known as the "London whale", had left the bank. "Multiple reporters did it for other traders as well in our equities and fixed income groups in the investment bank," said one person at JPMorgan.

A Bloomberg spokesman said he was unaware of any record of any such complaint from JPMorgan.

Regulators are paying growing attention to the way in which search engines, social networks and other businesses use customer information, as companies balance the value to be gleaned from analysing "big data" with the need to protect users' privacy.

Bloomberg, whose clients range from hedge funds to regulators and central bankers, has long seen a competitive advantage in using the wealth of data on its terminals to generate stories, but few clients knew that reporters could also see details of how they used the system.

Bloomberg reporters have been able to see broad information on which of the roughly 15,000 functions users access, such as charts or asset classes, and aggregated data on how many people read each story. Reporters and salesmen also pooled internal notes that included personal information about customers such as their favourite foods or number of -children.

Reporters have not been able to see market-sensitive details of "securities-level data, position data [or] trading data", Bloomberg said, or communications over its heavily-used messaging service.

About 315,000 subscribers pay it about $20,000 a year for its service.

First it was the factory worker who was made obsolete by technology. Now it is the hedge fund manager who looks increasingly redundant - and not just any hedgie but Wall Street's finest.

The Financial Times this week revealed that tips given by the best and brightest at last year's Ira Sohn conference - where the industry's stars offer their investment advice to raise money for charity - failed to outperform a passive US tracker fund . But even trackers struggle to compete with Wikipedia or Google. Academics have found a direct correlation between market movements and the number of visitors to articles on companies or financial topics.

Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, is best for predicting when the market is about to tumble, according to a paper published this week by academics from Warwick Business School, University College London and Boston University. The more page views on financial subjects, the greater the chance the Dow Jones index will fall. Last month the same team found that a trading strategy based on Google searches for the words debt, profit and loss could deliver well above average returns.

Hedge funds should beware. In 2011, according to Hedge Fund Research, the average return was negative 5.2 per cent. That compares with a gain of 15 per cent using the Wikipedia formula.

Once lauded as Masters of the Universe for their ability to move markets and demand multimillion dollar fees in the process, many of these high-volume traders are in danger of losing their unique selling point. The industry's domination of daily volumes on the US and UK markets has made it more difficult to devise strategies that differentiate one fund manager from another. The results are showing in ever more pedestrian returns. And, if that were not incentive enough to go elsewhere, Wikipedia offers its services for free. Higher productivity and lower costs - now that must really worry the hedgies.

Banks tipped off to Harp loans; general financial

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have inadvertently tipped off US banks and other big mortgage investors to more loan data than the two housing groups intended, resulting in some of the banks using the information released to identify and analyse Harp loans.

The two US mortgage finance groups have been told by their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), to release data on the home loans they guarantee in an effort to encourage private investors to assume more of the risk in the mortgage market.

The loan data cover credit performance for more than 30m single-family mortgages, but exclude information on non-standard loans such as those financed under the government's home affordable refinance programme (Harp).

The swift interpretation of the data by some of the banks highlights the financial industry's increasingly sophisticated ability to digest large volumes of so-called " big data ".

"You could figure out which loans were Harp," Kevin Atteson, of Morgan Stanley's mortgage trading team, said at the " big data finance " conference in New York.

Pinpointing Harp loans is valuable for mortgage investors and traders because it helps identify loans that may face more obstacles to refinancing. US homeowners who qualify for the programme are only allowed to refinance using Harp once.

Morgan Stanley is believed to have used a sophisticated "matching engine" to identify Harp refinanced loans through the released credit performance data.

"The agencies have tried to eliminate the easy matching attributes," said Steven Abrahams, mortgage analyst at Deutsche Bank, "but you could work around that with fair accuracy. If the released loans exclude Harp, then whatever isn't matched, with some qualifications, should be Harp."

As in other industries, "big data" has become a buzzword among financial groups who are seeking to mine reams of new information to gain an edge in the market.

Freddie has historically shared delinquency data for pools of mortgages but not individual loans, while Fannie did not release any type of credit data.

"We are aware of recent research pieces where analysis has been performed on Harp loans as a result of the single-family loan-level data set release," Freddie said. "Freddie Mac can provide no assurances regarding the accuracy of such mapping."

The new data released by the mortgage groups come in files so big that Fannie and Freddie recommend would-be downloaders use specialised "database management systems" to access it. The agencies say that releasing the data will lead to better modelling of the risks involved in investing in such loans.

Besides keeping some in an emergency fund, should the average investor have an allocation to cash and cash equivalents in an investment portfolio? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324030704578427123993873696.html" that discussed the merits of keeping cash in a stock fund's portfolio and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Wednesday, May 8.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Wealth Management Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts online at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html"

Also "http://on.wsj.com/16jTSr8" three wealth-management thought leaders Morningstar's Director of Personal Finance Christine Benz ("https://twitter.com/christine_benz"), American Association of Individual Investors Vice President Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") and Portfolio Solutions Founder Rick Ferri ("https://twitter.com/Rick_Ferri") speak about succeeding as a do-it-yourself investor in a video chat that aired on Monday, May 6.

Michelle Perry Higgins: In a Word, Absolutely.

In my opinion, absolutely. My rule of thumb for investors is that if you think you may need the funds within the next three years, then those dollars should probably be left in cash or cash equivalents. For example, if you plan to tap into your portfolio within the next few years for a home purchase, college or income needs, my advice would be to keep the funds in cash and call it a day. You can't afford to risk losing money in the stock or bond market with dollars you might actually need to have in hand within a few years. The stock market is notoriously good at tempting you to move out of cash and up the risk curve.

Michelle Perry Higgins ("https://twitter.com/RetirementMPH") is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

Matt Hougan: In a Word, No.

No. Put your money to work.

Matt Hougan ("https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

Tom Brakke: Cash Lets You Respond to Opportunities

For investors who take a fully passive approach, it's probably not necessary. I think everyone else should have higher levels of cash today than they generally do.

That may seem counterintuitive given the low rates on cash, but cash provides flexibility during times when markets come under pressure. Being fully invested sounds great, but it prevents you from responding to opportunities.

Central banks around the world have driven the returns on cash to zero, and have caused distortions in the prices of more volatile assets. No one knows whether those policies will lead to nirvana or catastrophe, although we will undoubtedly end up somewhere in between those extremes. Sacrificing a little upside by holding extra cash right now is a good trade for having a cushion if this grand experiment goes awry.

Tom Brakke ("https://twitter.com/researchpuzzler") is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

Rick Ferri: Cash Doesn't Earn a Thing

Cash isn't a good investment because after taxes and inflation, it doesn't earn anything. Today, it's actually a bad investment because inflation is higher than the return on cash.

Cash outside an emergency fund is useful if you have a large liability coming up. For example, your high-school senior is heading off to college and you're footing the bill. Personally, I'm stashing cash this year to pay higher taxes next April.

The only other reason to hold cash is if you're trying to time the markets. Good luck with that. I don't do it, which is one reason I have enough money to pay my taxes.

Rafael Pardo: Liquidity Will Keep You From Robbing Peter to Pay Paul

Yes. As its name suggests, your emergency fund is intended (and should only be used) for emergencies, such as covering living expenses after the loss of a job. Once you deviate from this principle and begin raiding your emergency fund for nonemergency purposes (robbing Peter to pay Paul, as it were), you could find yourself in a heap of trouble. For example, an unforeseen investment opportunity is not an emergency, and yet that opportunity may be too good to pass up. To avoid the dilemma of foregoing the opportunity (and thus missing out on a potential gain) or seizing it (and thus potentially and irreversibly depleting your emergency fund), an allocation to cash in your investment portfolio will give you the liquidity to avail yourself of such an opportunity. And in doing so, you won't compromise the cushion you have built with your emergency fund to safeguard against unforeseen contingencies.

George Papadopoulos: You Need Some Cash for When Opportunity Knocks

I always like to have some cash lying around to take advantage of opportunities that may arise suddenly. Market corrections will always occur; you just never know when. With dividends and capital-gain distributions taken in cash and new cash added to portfolios, we find there is usually at least 5% sitting in cash. This cash came in handy in late 2008, of course. It is always easier to rebalance portfolios when you have available cash as it reduces or eliminates your need to sell a position, which increases transactions costs. The last thing we will do is make market timing calls and "go to all cash."

Sheryl Garrett: Don't Think of Cash as an Investment

Put cash in your saving account and investments in your portfolio. The only cash that you may need in your investment portfolio is money to fund distributions, to enable you to take advantage of opportunities, or maybe you've simply met your objective or it's matured and you're awaiting reinvestment. Otherwise, cash is not an investment, and should not be included in your investment portfolio.

Greg McBride: Cash Becomes More Important With Age

An allocation to cash makes sense for many investors, regardless of age, as a way to diversify your portfolio, but is increasingly important as investors get closer to retirement. Particularly now, investors may opt for a little more cash at the expense of fixed income, given the nosebleed valuations in government bonds. Even for ultra-aggressive investors, a modest cash allocation gives you some investing ammunition when short-term market volatility reveals attractive bargains.

Manisha Thakor: Keep Cash If You'll Use It Within the Next Seven Years

Whether or not you should be holding cash depends upon how you define your "investment portfolio." My personal rule of thumb is that money you know with certainty that you'll need to spend in the next seven years should not be invested in stocks or bonds. Rather it should be parked for safe keeping in cash equivalents (money-market funds, CDs, T-bills, etc.). The reason is that this frees you up to take full advantage of the risk/reward characteristics inherent in equity investing. In plain English, you can swing a little harder because you know you have a cash safety net. So if your definition of your "investment portfolio" is the sum total of funds that you have at your disposal to save and invest, then yes, there absolutely is a place. I also think cash is a fine parking place while you are trying to decide what you want to do, as rushed decisions can easily backfire.

However, if by contrast you are referring to your IRA or your 401(k) as your investment portfolio and you are not within seven years of planning to take distributions, then I prefer to see portfolios fully invested. The way I would temper the inevitable volatility that comes with investing is to take my "risk" on the equity side and using high quality municipals or treasurys (not corporates) on the fixed income side as a buffer. The idea of keeping some "cash on the sidelines" to put to work when opportunities arise to me sounds an awful lot like market timing something that I view as strikingly close to gambling given it's long statistical history of failure.

Larry Zimpleman: Leave Your Allocation at 5% or Less

Unless you are a very conservative investor, I would keep the allocation to cash and cash equivalents to a modest amount say roughly 5% or less. The primary reason for keeping a cash allocation would be to try to move into and out of the market (i.e. market timing). Studies show consistently that market timing is rarely, if ever, successful. The best approach is to set a long-term asset allocation strategy and stay true to that (unless either your time frame for drawing on the assets changes or your tolerance for risk changes).

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group.

Eleanor Blayney: Why and Where You Should Keep Cash

Yes and no. As we CFP professionals love to say, "It depends."

It depends on why and where you are holding this nonemergency cash. It also depends on what else you may be holding namely, debt.

Take the "why" first. Many of us have short-term financial goals, like saving for a significant vacation in three years, or putting a deposit on a home in the next two years. These kinds of goals assuming a time frame of five years or less are suitably held in cash or equivalents in an account separate from emergency money. Keep the two separate so that you can be religious about never tapping the emergency fund except for bona fide, "oh-crap" emergencies. If you mingle the short-term money with the emergency money, before you know it you'll be raiding the emergency fund for things like new furniture or that pesky annual insurance premium you forgot to budget into this month's cash flow.

Now for the "where." It makes little sense to hold cash or cash equivalents in your qualified retirement portfolio, assuming you are not close to retirement or in the withdrawal stage. The primary reason to hold cash is for its liquidity. When you know you're going to need X-dollars in the near future, you want to be invested in something certain to be nominally worth X dollars at that time. Cash in a qualified retirement account loses all the benefits of its liquidity when you cannot withdraw it without paying a penalty.

Finally, consider your liabilities. It rarely makes sense to hold cash at today's negligible interest rates, when you have debt at rates that are more than 2% or 3% of what the cash is earning. If the cash is not needed in the short term (see "why" above), then the smarter investment move is to pay down or off the higher rate debt.

Eleanor Blayney ("https://twitter.com/EleanorBlayney") is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards.

Charles Rotblut: Think About Your Time Frame

The answer depends on when you intend to spend the cash. If you have a big purchase (e.g. a house, a car, college tuition, etc.) within the next few years, then holding cash or a cash equivalent makes sense. It can also make sense for retirees to hold a few years of anticipated withdrawals in cash to fund withdrawals.

Money not needed for the long term should be allocated to a mixture of stocks and bonds. If a security or fund is sold and you are hoping to reinvest the proceeds at lower prices, set a deadline for doing so. For example, if you think stock prices will dip over the summer, set a deadline to invest the cash no later than Aug. 31. This gives you some flexibility, but will prevent you from staying in cash too long.

Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

Terrance Odean: How's Your Tolerance for Risk?

Besides the emergency fund, most investors should not hold a large portion of their investment portfolio in cash for liquidity purposes. Investors with higher risk aversion or shorter investment horizons may want to hold a portion of their portfolio in low-risk or risk-free assets (e.g., T-bills).

In Depth: U.S. Households, Businesses Picking Up Borrowing Again --- Many Still Struggle To Get Loans as Banks Tightened Standards For Young People, Those With Bad Credit

Boise, Idaho -- When the economy nose-dived several years ago, Lou Aaron found it impossible to get a bank loan, forcing him to use six different credit cards to keep his 1950s-style drive-in restaurant running.

Now, the 50-year-old chef said banks are coming to him offering loans. His sales are climbing, and he expects to borrow $350,000 to open a third location next year where he will sell prime rib, hamburgers and his "Idaho Ice Cream Potato" dessert.

America's credit crunch is easing. For the past six years, consumers and businesses have struggled to borrow money, but slowly, things are getting easier.

Large U.S. companies are taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow record amounts of capital in bond markets. Banks are opening the spigots for commercial and industrial firms, and loans grew at an 11% annualized rate in the first quarter of this year, the sixth double-digit percentage increase in seven quarters, Federal Reserve data show. According to the Fed's survey of senior bank-lending officers released Monday, 28% of banks lowered the cost of credit lines early this year to smaller firms like Mr. Aaron's that have annual sales of less than $50 million. Residential lending began edging up last year, and even people with bad credit can get a loan to buy a car these days.

In all, some $713 billion in credit flowed to U.S. households and nonfinancial businesses last year, double 2011's $336 billion, according to the Fed. That is still a fraction of the $2.2 trillion in credit that lifted American consumers and businesses in 2007.

Indeed, many Americans still struggle to get loans. Banks have tightened standards, especially for young people and those with past financial problems.

The improved access to credit in recent months suggests America's economic outlook is gradually brightening, despite recent hurdles like federal budget cutbacks, increased payroll taxes and troubled overseas markets. Falling unemployment -- the U.S. jobless rate slid to 7.5% last month -- and rising stock and home prices should fuel spending, the biggest driver of the economy. More credit should speed this process.

"The underlying conditions that support growth have been gradually improving," William Dudley, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president, said in a speech last month. He said improved "household access to credit" was a factor.

The change is evident in Boise, a community that suffered a real-estate crash and recession similar to the nation's.

The metro area's 640,000 residents are recovering from their debt hangover.

Per capita debt among Boise consumers has dropped nearly 19% from its peak in 2008 to about $35,000 as of the first quarter of 2013, mostly due to foreclosures and bankruptcies, according to data from Moody'sAnalytics and Equifax Inc., a credit-monitoring service. Debt levels rose in the first quarter for the first time in five years, suggesting that Boise residents are starting to borrow again.

Over the past year, Boise's economy has picked up. In this year's first quarter, for example, the number of city permits issued for new residential and commercial construction projects -- efforts that usually require borrowed money -- jumped nearly 20% to a five-year high. Meanwhile, Boise's unemployment rate fell to 6.1% in March from 7.6% a year earlier.

"There's an abundant amount of credit available," says John V. Evans III, executive vice president of D.L. Evans Bank, a local lender. Mr. Evans says his bank is "aggressively trying to make loans." Its commercial loans are up 15% so far this year and 20% from 2008 levels, while mortgage loans are up 52% and 170%, respectively.

Al Youngwerth, president of Rekluse, a 10-year-old manufacturer on the outskirts of Boise, recently secured $700,000 in credit to buy equipment and invest in his factory.

His firm, which makes about 750 different parts for off-road motorcycles and employs 40 people, posted a 25% jump in sales last year and its credit history is clean, Mr. Youngwerth says. When the 48-year-old approached his bank, KeyBank, for loans to finance the purchase of a new robot and other equipment, the bank initially fretted about the company's high level of debt relative to its assets, he says.

Eventually, Mr. Youngwerth won over his bankers, and the robot -- which helps with loading -- arrived about a month ago. "The credit came quickly and easily," he said.

John Williamson, senior vice president at KeyBank, said "banks, contrary to popular belief, do want to lend money." However, he said, KeyBank and other lenders need "to be protective of our capital." Lending by KeyCorp, the parent of KeyBank, grew 6.5%, on average, in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier, the bank said.

Credit usually gets tighter during downturns, but the latest recession was significantly worse, thanks to billions of dollars of souring home loans that shook the nation's banks and gummed up its mortgage-finance system.

Many banks remain reluctant to make home loans to borrowers with tarnished credit histories. Lenders worry loans they unload to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage-finance giants, could be returned to them. And Wall Street's mortgage-securitization machine is struggling to rev up amid stricter rules and unfinished regulations.

"The most frozen assets take the longest to unthaw," said Deutsche Bank economist Torsten Slok. "And at the end of the line of dominoes is mortgages."

Credit conditions have eased more quickly for bigger businesses. Micron Technology Inc., one of Boise's top employers, is borrowing more cheaply, despite its low credit rating and frequent dry spells in one of its businesses, making memory chips for personal computers.

Chip prices, along with Micron's profits, tend to swing depending on supply and demand. The firm has a double-B-minus credit rating from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. A Micron spokesman didn't have a comment on the rating.

Investors are scrambling to buy the company's bonds, says Kipp Bedard, Micron's vice president of investor relations. In February, Micron borrowed $600 million from investors by issuing convertible bonds -- investments that turn into stock under certain circumstances. Micron is paying investors annual interest rates of 1.625% and 2.125% for the two varieties of the convertibles. A year earlier, the company borrowed using similar instruments and paid 2.375% and 3.125%.

Firms like Micron have the Fed to thank for unusually low borrowing rates. By holding its key short-term interest rate near zero and driving down long-term rates through its bond-buying programs, the Fed is pushing investors hungry for returns out of low-yielding bets like government bonds into riskier assets like corporate bonds and stocks.

Consumer credit, which has been slower to respond to the Fed's efforts, is showing signs of life too.

Even borrowers with patchy credit can now qualify for subprime car loans, which were 43% of auto loans made in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Experian, a credit-reporting firm.

Home-equity loans, which allow homeowners to tap their homes for cash, are creeping back. It is the same story with jumbo mortgages, usually taken out by affluent people. The bottom line is that banks are dipping their toes back into riskier territory.

There also are signs traditional mortgage lending is picking up: Residential home loans from banks expanded at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the first quarter, after contracting in the final months of last year, Fed data show. The Fed's latest survey of bank lending officers showed nearly 10% of banks polled said they were easing standards on prime, or low-risk, mortgages, compared with less than 5% in a previous survey.

The recovery of the housing market, which appears to have turned a corner this year, could provide an additional boost. With rising home values making Americans wealthier and improving banks' own balance sheets, more lenders may become comfortable lending. "Rising house prices are likely to encourage a further loosening of credit," the New York Fed's Mr. Dudley recently said.

Meanwhile, many Americans are taking advantage of low mortgage rates to refinance their home loans.

Carrie Applegate finished refinancing the mortgage on her two-bedroom Boise home in January.

It wasn't easy. Ms. Applegate has lived in her home eight years, held the same administrative job at Boise State University for 10 years and has a solid credit score around 750. But when she had her house appraised last fall, its market value was only $130,000 -- which meant she had 19% equity in her home, not the 20% required by her bank to refinance. She scrapped that effort and retried under the government's Home Affordable Refinance Program, which makes it easier for borrowers to refinance.

Eventually the refinance came through -- allowing Ms. Applegate to shave about $100 off her monthly mortgage payment of $730. "I'm happy I did it, I'm better off financially," she said. The refinancing process "is starting to get better."

The economic recovery hasn't been a boon to stock pickers like Brett Horn.

Just several years ago, "hundreds" of undervalued stocks littered the market, recalls Mr. Horn, an analyst at Chicago-based investment-research firm Morningstar Inc. Now, many of them have bounced back.

"It's slim pickings," he says. "You're choosing your spots a little more carefully."

Still, that didn't keep Mr. Horn, 40 years old, from spotting potential in CoreLogic Inc. last year when others predicted doom. The residential real-estate data and services provider had just come off a dismal year, thanks to a lackluster housing market and a 2010 spinoff that burdened the company with several noncore businesses.

When it bottomed at $8 in August 2011, the stock was trading at less than half of what Mr. Horn believed it was worth. He issued a buy rating shortly after, betting that the company would rebound in the long term.

"It was very clear that the market was way too negative on them," he says. "They saw that the numbers were bad, but they didn't quite understand why."

It was a particularly brazen call for Mr. Horn, who joined Morningstar six years ago after nearly a decade in commercial banking, where he specialized in corporate lending. Transitioning to stock picking was challenging, he recalls, especially after years of focusing "strictly on the downside."

His optimistic hunch proved right when CoreLogic management launched a cost-cutting initiative and exited from certain noncore businesses. In a development that surprised even Mr. Horn, the housing market also experienced a refinancing boom. "I knew housing would recover, but I had no idea how quickly," he says. The stock more than doubled last year.

That wasn't his only win in 2012. He also issued buy and hold ratings on Lender Processing Services Inc., a provider of mortgage-processing services and analytics. The company presented a "risk factor," he acknowledges, mainly because of allegations that it "robosigned" documents to speed up foreclosures on homeowners. (It settled charges with the attorneys general of 46 states this past January.)

He suspected the stock was still undervalued, partly because he observed other investors were placing far too much emphasis on transaction volumes in the real-estate market when valuing companies like CoreLogic and Lender Processing Services. "They don't understand that in the long run, everything normalizes," he says.

Lender Processing Services returned 66% last year, according to FactSet.

His biggest regret, he says, is missing out on an opportunity to be bullish on Jack Henry & Associates Inc., a data- and payment-processing-services provider for financial-services firms. He maintained a hold rating throughout 2012, during which the stock returned 18%, according to FactSet. "The company just bounced back a lot faster than I expected, and a lot faster than its peers," he says.

Mr. Horn sees promise in Fiserv Inc., another banking-technology provider. While the stock is already fairly valued, he says, the business appears to be stable and well managed. "Safety is more of a priority, so a safe name would be a good pick," he says.

What advice do prospective do-it-yourself investors need to hear before they start managing their own money? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323741004578418611242496832.html" about do-it-yourself investors who are using new online tools and a-la-carte advice services to manage their money and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Monday, May 6.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Wealth Management Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts online at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html"

Also "http://on.wsj.com/16jTSr8" three wealth-management thought leaders Morningstar's Director of Personal Finance Christine Benz ("https://twitter.com/christine_benz"), American Association of Individual Investors Vice President Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") and Portfolio Solutions Founder Rick Ferri ("https://twitter.com/Rick_Ferri") speak about succeeding as a do-it-yourself investor in a video chat that aired on Monday, May 6.

Tom Brakke: If You Really Want to Try, First Study Financial History

Think twice or maybe three times.

It is quite unlikely that you'll do very well fighting it out in the financial markets against those with more experience and information than you have. Plus, should you happen to somehow beat the averages, in retrospect it probably won't have been worth all of the time, effort and aggravation along the way.

If you still want to try your luck, start reading, but skip the how-to-beat-the-market books and spend your time learning financial history. Perspective and a long time horizon are what you need most, although you'll probably end up making the same mistakes that the rest of us make anyway.

Tom Brakke ("https://twitter.com/researchpuzzler") is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

Greg McBride: Invest for the Long Haul

Educate yourself as much as possible about investments, economics and financial markets. As far as investing goes, invest for the long haul and build the core of your portfolio with mutual funds and exchange-traded funds rather than individual securities. Keep investment expenses low by favoring index funds, no-load mutual funds and keep trading to a minimum.

Terrance Odean: Learn to Golf Instead

My advice to a prospective active do-it-yourself investor is to learn to golf. You'll get a little exercise, some fresh air and time with your friends. Sure, green fees can be steep, but not as steep as the hit your portfolio will take if you become an active do-it-yourself investor. That said, if your plan is to become a passive do-it-yourself investor, to buy and hold well diversified low-cost mutual funds (e.g., index funds), go for it. You'll still have time for golf and, barring a bear market, enough money for green fees.

Rafael Pardo: First Set a Strategy, Then Focus on Tactics

Read, read, read. If you plan to go it alone as an investor, without the guidance of a professional, it is crucial to educate yourself. Failure to do so can result in a series of missteps and blunders that risk squandering away the savings and wealth you have accumulated. Of course, there exists an inordinate amount of literature regarding investment, and so the question becomes, "How do I figure out what I should read?"

At the risk of oversimplification, the key is to differentiate between literature that focuses on investment strategy and literature that focuses on investment tactics. Here, I'm drawing a lesson from the classic game of chess. Chess strategy broadly focuses on the long-term: What are the sound fundamentals that will guide my specific plans and moves to the ultimate goal of checkmate? Chess tactics, on the other hand, narrowly focus on the short-term: What specific moves will enable me to control a particular part of the board, capture a specific piece, etc.?

Your investment tactics should be a function of your investment strategy. First, have a clear picture of your investment goals for example, accumulating enough wealth to retire by the age of 65 or saving enough money to pay for your kids' college tuition. With that goal in mind, you can begin to winnow down the strategy literature to those writings that squarely align with your goals. After doing so, and after becoming familiar with the relevant strategy literature, you should have a better sense of the types of investment tactics that will enable you to bring your strategy to fruition. And after becoming familiar with the tactics literature, you will be ready to wade into what should no longer seem like uncharted waters.

Sheryl Garrett: Read These Books. All of Them.

Invest in your knowledge before you invest in your brokerage account. If you haven't already, invest time reading really smart books on investing, such as; "The Four Pillars of Investing" by William Bernstein, "The Power of Passive Investing" by Richard A. Ferri, "Asset Allocation" by Roger C. Gibson, "Worry-Free Investing" by Zvi Bodie and Michael J. Clowes, "What Investors Really Want" by Meir Statman and "The Little Book of Common Sense Investing" by John C. Bogle. Read them all! It would only take a few days and it could save you or help you make a fortune.

Reading a few great investing books is my recommendation as a first step for all perspective do-it-yourself investors. Books are generally written with the focus on achieving long-term objectives, not making headlines or gathering a "following". After reading all these books, you'll have a pretty good idea on what your second step should be. If you don't, I suggest you rethink your idea of do-it-yourself, or consult with an investment professional to help you with the next step.

Sheryl Garrett ("https://twitter.com/SherylGarrett") is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Rick Ferri: Discipline Is the Most Difficult Step

The same advice I would give to anyone successful investing is a three-step process. Decide on an investment philosophy that you can believe in. Create a portfolio strategy based on this philosophy. Implement the strategy and continue to remain disciplined.

Figure out which investment philosophy has the highest probability for success. Do you believe you're smart enough to time markets or pick investments that are going to beat the markets, or wise enough not to know better? Go with the odds.

Strategy is a portfolio building process that starts by matching financial goals with a sound asset allocation. Product selection follows. It is well documented that low-cost index funds outperform a majority of actively managed funds in every investment category. You don't need anything else.

Discipline is the most difficult step. Staying committed to a plan during all market conditions can be a nerve-racking experience. Success goes to those who are willing to do what most people won't.

Rick Ferri is founder of "http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/" LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is "http://www.rickferri.com/blog/".

Michelle Perry Higgins: Be Guided by Facts, Not Feelings

There are essentially three key pieces of advice I would give to the DIY investor. First, don't ever make emotional trades within your portfolio. Create a sound financial strategy you can maintain and use that plan as your guide. You should always base your financial decision on facts, not feelings. If you don't believe you can do that, then perhaps it is time to hire an adviser. Second, keep your costs as low as possible within your portfolio. You might also want to consider the addition of index funds as they are highly cost-effective. Finally, if you are truly going to be a do-it-yourselfer, you should manage your portfolio as if it is a part-time job. Have a routine that you follow regularly and don't try to wing it. To be successful, you have to give your portfolio the necessary time, attention and research that is needed, otherwise known as T.L.C.

Michelle Perry Higgins ("https://twitter.com/RetirementMPH") is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

Larry Zimpleman: Don't Try to Time the Market

First, I'd want to know two things is this "serious money" as opposed to play money, and does the investor really have a background that allows him or her to make good investment decisions? Assuming we're talking about serious money and that the person has the basic background to make investment decisions, I would suggest rule No. 1 is resist the temptation to market-time (at least with any meaningful amount of money). Study after study shows the danger of trying to market-time. My second piece of advice would be to think about an overall asset allocation approach (based on your tolerance for risk) and then to stay consistent to that asset allocation don't be changing the allocation based on market movements over relatively short periods like six or even 12 months. Since it is serious money, you should have time going for you, so avoid the temptation to make short-term adjustments.

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group.

Charles Rotblut: Four Steps to Better Returns

There are four major points I would make.

The first is to be realistic about your interest level in finance and the amount of time you can devote to managing a portfolio. If looking at a 10-K (an annual report required by the SEC) or analyzing a cash-flow statement puts you to sleep, then you should consider using index funds instead. Similarly, if you don't have the time to read through earnings conference-call transcripts, consider using an index fund.

The second is to consider both your financial and your emotional tolerance for risk. Financial risk is a factor of age, health and wealth. The less money you need relative to the size of your portfolio, and the further out in the future you need the money, the bigger your portfolio allocation to stocks can be. As far as your emotional tolerance, think about what you did with your investments (e.g. your 401(k) plan) in 2008 and even 2001. If you panicked and sold as many people did, you need to consider a less volatile allocation.

The third is to use the power of the written word to your advantage. Write down the reasons that cause you to favorably view an investment and the reasons you would sell it BEFORE you make the actual purchase. Doing this will help you more professionally manage your portfolio and give you a strategy for times when the market's volatility makes you nervous.

The fourth is to pick good securities and diversify. Look for securities of financially strong companies trading at discounted valuations. (Value beats growth over the long term, but some securities are cheap for a reason.) Also, hold a variety of stocks and bonds, including international securities. The unspoken advantage of diversification is that it increases the odds of being in the right asset class at the right time.

Eleanor Blayney: Know When to Fold

"Know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em" &with particular emphasis on the folding.

In my experience, many individuals who manage their own portfolios are also buy-and-holders. Even when they can afford professional management, they reason that they can do better with selecting and holding securities than they will do with an adviser, particularly when they factor in the assets-under-management fee. They choose what they believe are good securities for the long haul, and then walk away from them to do something more productive like playing golf or Sudoku.

They don't sell their holdings, either, because it is hard to admit that their great stock pick isn't so great anymore, or because selling may result in capital gains and they hate paying taxes.

To be a successful manager of your own investments, you need to be disciplined, humble and dispassionate. You need to systematically rebalance the portfolio and be willing to admit your mistakes or at the very least that great stocks, like great athletes, cannot stay on top forever. You need to have a sell strategy in place whenever you buy a new holding. You especially need to be careful never to fall in love with your choices, and at the same time, never allow yourself to hate taxes to the point that the tax tail has wagged the dog to death.

Finally, you may want to consider the Dalbar research that shows that investors, left purely to their own devices, underperform the market and market indexes by a significant margin.

Matt Hougan: You're Never Going to Beat the Market

Don't do it.

First, it is hard. If you think you're going to beat the market, you're wrong. There are very highly paid people who have enormous incentives to beat the market and work at it full-time with nearly infinite resources; almost all of them fail. You're not going to be any different.

But let's say you're smarter than that. You're just going to buy a few index funds, sit back and relax. You're still going to do a terrible job. You'll forget to rebalance, you won't reinvest your dividends, you'll panic and sell at the bottom during a crisis. You'll make a muck of it.

There are good systems out there now Wealthfront, to take one example that will keep you invested in a solid portfolio of low cost ETFs for almost nothing. Do that instead. You'll end up with more money at the end.

Beyond performance, the biggest reason not to go it alone is that you've got better things to do. Your job. Your family. The laundry. Unless you're enormously wealthy, the biggest source of wealth you have is your job. Work at that, and leave the money bit to someone else.

Manisha Thakor: Don't Skip Ahead to the 'Fun Part'

I'd give the exact same advice I'd give to any investor, which is to make sure you can answer these three questions at all time:

(1)What is my asset allocation?

(2)What has my performance been?

(3)What fees am I paying?

To me, these are the core essentials that every investor (do-it-yourself or work-with-an-adviser) should know. If you don't know the answers, you aren't alone &most folks I meet can't answer these questions about their investments. Alas, this is a bit like trying to build a house but not knowing what your foundation is made out of i.e. you can never be truly sure you've got a sturdy structure. So while the tendency may be to jump right into the "fun part" of selecting specific investments to make, taking the time to understand these three elements will enable you to make stronger and more informed decisions for your long run financial health.

I'd also suggest you think long and hard about pursuing an "active" over a "passive" or index-based approach. Time and again academic research shows the primary driver of long-run returns is asset allocation (the mix you select between broad asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash) as opposed to security selection (trying to find the next hot investment). Whether it is through the use of active mutual funds or selecting individual securities, this approach statistically speaking isn't the winner's game. For more on this, I'd recommend potential do-it-yourself investors read Larry Swedroe's new book "Think, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett."

George Papadopoulos: Don't Hit for the Fence

 " Understand that how much you invest will have a greater impact on your retirement security than how well your investments perform.

 " You will likely be better off giving up hitting home runs with your stock picking and instead investing in low-cost index mutual funds and ETFs.

 " Avoid investments you don't understand.

 " Have a plan in place and set goals. If your goal is to invest for maximum performance, be aware that you must be prepared for maximum performance on the downside, too.

 " Diversify, keep costs low, be aware of Uncle Sam and rebalance at set intervals. An investment portfolio is like a garden. If you don't tend to it, weeds will damage it. If you don't have time to tend to the garden yourself, look for a full-time gardener, while you focus on what you do best.

 " Keep it simple. You don't need to invest in a highly complex hedge fund. There is no secret sauce or market guru out there.

 " Have an emergency cash fund in place and make an effort to be debt-free by the time you retire. No one has ever told me that they regretted paying off the mortgage early.

 " Don't be too greedy or too fearful. Easier said than done.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- The Experts: Insights From Our Online Panel

Two questions are never far from investors' minds: On what occasions might active fund management be better than an index fund, and what would Warren Buffett do? Meanwhile, recent gyrations in the stock market continue to cause investors on Wall Street and Main Street to watch policy developments in Washington with a mixture of dread and anticipation. For insights, The Wall Street Journal turned to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Reports.

Edited excerpts of those discussions follow:

---

Under what circumstances should somebody use active money managers as opposed to index funds?

Two Scenarios Favor Active

In general, traditional index funds need certain ingredients in underlying markets in order to best function. These include minimum levels of liquidity, market capitalization and cost efficiency. When those elements are not ideal, active management is a better choice because it is more flexible when dealing with inefficiencies.

The second area where active managers can be preferable is when implementing investment strategies that are complex or fast moving. These strategies are difficult to index due to the many contextual variables that can arise.

-- Christian Magoon, CEO of Magoon Capital

In the Long Term, Never

If we are talking about investing over the long term, never! If we are talking about short-term trading, perhaps you can try to identify an active money manager and hope to get lucky.

-- George Papadopoulos, a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich.

For My Enemies . . .

I can think of many cases in which I would recommend active money managers over index funds. I might be giving the advice to someone I hate or -- and this happens a lot -- someone I expect to hate later. I would also recommend active money managers if I were accepting bribes to do so, if I were an active money manager myself, or if it were April Fools' Day.

-- Scott Adams, creator of "Dilbert" comic strip

Specialized Equity Markets

I believe a portion of an investor's diversified portfolio should hold actively managed funds, especially for specialized equity markets that require specialized knowledge and expertise, as the pricing tends to be inefficient. These areas include emerging markets, small-cap stocks and companies involved in resources and metals mining. The key is in selecting an active manager who has extensive experience investing in these markets, as they understand the seasonal and historical patterns that help them navigate these complex areas.

-- Frank Holmes, chief executive and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors Inc .

Small-Cap Stocks and Emerging Markets

While I am a big proponent of index investing, investors can increase their odds of adding incremental return to their portfolios by seeking active managers that have a strong track record and consistent investment philosophy, particularly in small-cap stocks and emerging markets.

-- Greg McBride , a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com

What's the most valuable thing Washington could do for investors in mutual funds and ETFs?

Roll Out the Rest of Dodd-Frank

Washington needs to implement the investor-protection agenda in the Dodd-Frank Act. All advisers, brokers and insurance agents who provide personalized investment advice must be held to a duty of loyalty, prudence and care for their clients. This is not the case today, and most investors don't realize it. Most people own mutual funds or ETFs in accounts advised or managed by a financial intermediary. The choice of which fund to use should be based solely on your needs, not on those of anyone else.

-- John Rogers , president and chief executive of CFA Institute

Level the Playing Field

Regulators need to ensure the playing field between institutional and individual investors is level. Products and providers need to be overseen and mischief needs to be punished. Expenses should be kept in line as well.

-- Charles Rotblut , vice president with American Association of Individual Investors , vice president with

Put Clients First

Changing the culture and regulatory structure to mandate that investor interests must always come first, and that the adviser is the party responsible for proving they did right by the client, would drastically improve investors' comfort in the markets, with investing and with advisers.

-- Sheryl Garrett , founder of Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Enforce a Fiduciary Duty

First, force brokers to have a fiduciary duty to their clients. The market is going that way anyway, and (by definition) it would be what's best for investors. Finances are too important to do any other way. Second, require the clear disclosure of fees. We're making progress in the 401(k) space, but sterling clarity should be the goal across all financial products and services.

-- Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC

Ensure Investors Are Protected

Bipartisan action and commitment to getting our fiscal house in order in a fair, balanced way would send an important message to businesses and markets that would be positive for investors. Corporations, in particular, are holding huge amounts of cash as a result of the continuing (and tiresome) uncertainty created by congressional gridlock. Getting this cash working in capital projects and more hires would increase economic growth and rates of investment returns.

-- Eleanor Blayney , consumer advocate of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards

What lessons can individual investors learn from Berkshire Hathaway 's Warren Buffett ?

Invest in Things. Don't Rent.

Don't sell. Invest in things; don't rent them for speculative returns. There are caveats to that, of course: if you're tax-loss harvesting, or if the investment landscape shifts, or if your initial thesis (that you wrote down when you first invested) breaks down.

-- Matt Hougan

Keep It Real

Focus on the business aspects of any investment. Research thoroughly. Trust few. Avoid leverage, and be patient and willing to invest forever.

And, if you don't have the time or interest to do all of this with a great deal of confidence, Warren Buffett himself would recommend that we simply invest in index funds.

-- Sheryl Garrett

Don't Follow the Crowd

The most important lesson that Mr. Buffett can offer anyone: Don't get swept up by the crowd.

He has been willing to sit on a mountain of cash, even though interest rates are extremely low. And he is willing to be out of step for long periods in order to do well in the end. Most of us have a very hard time doing that.

-- Tom Brakke, consultant, writer and investment adviser

Be a 'Mensch'

Mr. Buffett teaches us that the most important part of being a self-made man is being a "mensch," a decent man. He recognizes the role of community efforts and luck in his success. He also recognizes the role of government in helping people who have not been successful, and the fairness of sharing the fruits of success.

-- Meir Statman, the Glenn Klimek professor of finance at Santa Clara University , and visiting professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands

Stick to Your Strategy

A large part of Mr. Buffett's success has come from his ability to stay calm and be willing to increase his stockholdings when everyone else is selling. Everyone has heard they should "buy low and sell high," but few people have shown the ability to truly buy low as Mr. Buffett has.

The second is the importance of having a rational, well-thought-out investment strategy and sticking to it. Mr. Buffett has built a fortune by investing in bargain stocks -- good quality companies that trade at attractive prices.

-- Charles Rotblut

Acadian's Churchill Franklin discusses the success of the quant house's unorthodox data gathering with Steve Johnson

Churchill Franklin, the grandly named chief executive of Acadian Asset Management, takes pride in the "objective and unemotional" way the quantitative investment house runs money.

But some of the data Boston-based Acadian crunches in order to make its asset allocation decisions are capable of raising the odd eyebrow.

"If you have ever worked in a bank, you know when the moon is full, the crazies come out," says Mr Franklin, underlining Acadian's observation that the phases of the moon appear to be correlated with moves in equity markets.

Acadian's lunar link is indicative of the lengths it goes to in the hunt for data sources that may give it an edge over competitors.

In order to validate (notoriously smooth) Chinese economic growth data, Acadian's sleuths study satellite pictures to determine if the factory lights are on and attempt to count the number of shipping containers leaving Chinese ports. There are rumours of some companies dispatching empty containers in an attempt to disguise a slowdown in orders.

Acadian also engages in automated reading of periodicals in the search for keywords that might signal future price moves, as well as analysing GPS data produced by tractors as they plough fields.

"The key for us is having the best people that can keep you relatively close to the leading edge of data acquisition," says Mr Franklin, who co-founded Acadian in 1986, 14 years before it was bought by London and Johannesburg-listed Old Mutual, the insurer.

The quant house has since gathered $57bn of assets from 500 institutions in 25 countries for its equity and emerging market debt propositions. Mr Franklin largely attributes this to the success of Acadian's process of "cognitive diversity", a belief that multiple perspectives lead to better ideas and help identify more sources of "alpha", or outperformance.

"The accounting guy, the corporate finance guy, the behavioural finance individual, the machine-based learning, data recognition, robotics [people] - we put all of these capabilities together and we get the classic diversity of thought.

"That is something we believe in. We get more perspectives and more frenetic discussion and we get better outcomes," says Mr Franklin.

"We totally believe in the integrity of the data. The debate will not be about whether we think China is going to collapse, it's how deeply we believe in the robustness of the data or how likely is it to change, to be revised.

"One of the edges we have is we have been doing this all our career. We know when to be suspicious and when to be confident."

That suspicion has led Acadian to reject some potential data feeds, such as the much-hyped ability of Twitter , the microblogging service, to predict markets.

David Purdy, director of marketing analytics at Acadian, argues there is "no evidence" that the balance of positive and negative tweets has any predictive power. "They are synchronised with the market. There is no information that is usable at this stage," he says.

As an example, Mr Purdy points to the level of fear in tweets, which in the US rises every year around the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine high school massacre.

"If you don't understand the data, both the source of it and the meaning of it, it can be very painful," he says.

Similarly, Acadian is wary of correlations it can identify, but not explain. For instance, it says that if the Super Bowl is won by a team from the AFL (rather than the rival NFL), the US stock market tends to rise the following day.

Somewhat surprisingly for a house that sets such store by data, Acadian has been quick to embrace frontier markets , where accurate numbers can be hard to come by. "The data can be lousy, but as long as you have a little bit more than the next guy, that's OK," says Mr Franklin.

He also argues that quant houses have an advantage over bottom-up fundamental players in the fragmented frontier landscape.

"If we had to send an analyst to all of these countries we would go bust in a heartbeat," he argues.

Despite this, Mr Franklin admits Acadian's frontier markets equity offering, which has a capacity of just $400m-$500m, is not "hugely profitable" at present, but he is confident this will change.

"Frontier markets feel to us as emerging markets did in 1993. They have no debt, they have great natural resources, they have a developing consumer class. If you look at a 30-year time horizon, these countries are going to develop."

That said, Acadian does not believe emerging markets themselves are always perfect. It operates a corruption-adjusted price-to-book ratio as a valuation tool, factoring in corruption data from Transparency International, a non-governmental organisation.

"The least corrupt [countries] are not necessarily the best performers but we do find that corruption in general is a tax on the investor, so the more corrupt will have to have a lower valuation to overcome that," says Mr Franklin, who believes examples such as this "humanise" what Acadian is doing.

"The world views quants as black boxy, mathematical and not fundamentally driven. I think of Acadian as being very fundamental, but systematic, repeatable and consistent."

One of Acadian's specialisms is managed volatility strategies, which aim to provide equity-like returns with around 65-70 per cent of the volatility usually associated with stock market investing.

It was a relatively early adopter of the concept, alongside Unigestion, Axa Rosenberg and Robeco, which appears capable of delivering anomalously high absolute, as well as risk-adjusted, returns .

Mr Franklin says the concept "is really taking off", especially in the UK and the Japanese pension sector, although the manner in which such strategies are used may tell us something about regional differences. In Australia and the US investors tend to leverage up their exposure, hoping for equity market volatility but equity-beating returns. More risk-averse Europeans are happy to hope for lower volatility and market returns.

Mr Franklin suggests managed volatility approaches are also seeing interest from institutions that feel impelled to trim their low-yielding fixed income holdings and take on board a little more risk.

"If you think fixed income is going to solve any problems from here on in, that's a hard pill to swallow," he warns.

Economy Unmoved By ECB

Mario Draghi still has the power to steer markets: Bonds rallied and the euro fell as the European Central Bank cut interest rates to a euro-era low of 0.5% and hinted that more might yet be on the table. But the ECB president had to admit that he felt frustrated in his attempts to steer the euro-zone economy out of its funk and that there had been little progress on finding ways of funneling lending to cash-strapped companies. That isn't surprising the real work needs to be done by governments.

For markets, the most significant moment came as Mr. Draghi opened the door a little wider to cutting the rate it pays on money deposited with the ECB, currently at zero, into negative territory. Mr. Draghi warned again that such a cut could have unintended consequences but added that the ECB would "address and cope" with these consequences making negative rates a possibility. That sent German two-year yields into negative territory and pushed the euro sharply lower against the dollar.

Mr. Draghi raised hopes initially by saying the ECB's Governing Council had made a decision on possible ways to enhance credit provision. But that turned out to be only the start of consultations with bodies such as the European Investment Bank to promote a market for asset-backed securities backed by corporate loans. Mr. Draghi admitted that this market is currently "dead" and that the ECB had no precise view on how it might work, meaning there is little near-term relief in the cards for Southern European companies finding it tough to get funding. And even if a funding mechanism were to be developed, there remain questions about bank capital and risk appetite on the part of both lenders and borrowers that the ECB can't address. This is no silver bullet for the crisis.

A negative deposit rate could lead to a much weaker euro, potentially a help for Southern European nations as they rebalance their economies. But the ECB sees the risks to inflation still as broadly balanced, potentially meaning the bar is high for a further cut at least in the near term.

Instead, Mr. Draghi is still calling on governments to take action, in particular on structural reform and creation of a banking union. He did, however, slightly soften the central bank's line on austerity, saying that at the least governments should avoid undoing the progress that has been made on fiscal consolidation.

Unless the economy takes a further sharp turn for the worse, the ECB looks likely to be on hold for some time. Euro-zone politicians have been calling for the ECB to act. Now that it has, the ball is back in their court.

Sanofi's Slump May Be Short-Lived

Welcome to the new growth era in pharmaceuticals. Sanofi's first-quarter profit dropped by a third, after the French drug maker last year lost patent protection in the U.S. on blood-thinner Plavix and hypertension drug Avapro. The pharma group's earnings-per-share forecast this year remains at best flat. But Sanofi's business looks like a decent proxy for the future of the pharmaceutical sector. After years of slumping sales from pharmaceutical products, the worst at Sanofi is over.

Sanofi went into the era of the so-called patent cliff among the worst-placed of its peers. Blockbuster drugs close to losing patent protection accounted for close to 30% of revenue in 2008. Their contribution is now about 3%, set to be negligible by year-end. Sanofi shed its rather parochial attitude to research and development and embraced third-party innovation with a number of licensing agreements. It has bulked up in rare diseases, animal health and consumer medicines. And faster-growing emerging markets already account for about a third of sales, ahead of most European and U.S. peers.

Sanofi expects sales and profit growth in the final quarters of this year and into next year. The delay to the U.S. launch of Novo Nordisk's Tresiba insulin until at least 2017 has created an opportunity for Sanofi's diabetes business. With that tailwind, Sanofi could post double-digit earnings growth next year, argue analysts at Citigroup. The bank forecasts compound annual growth of 9% from this year to 2018, compared with the sector at 7%.

Some skepticism is warranted. An uninspiring quarter in some supposed growth areas, such as animal health, underlined Sanofi's reliance on its diabetes unit, where sales jumped 20%. Moreover, Sanofi's pipeline lacks the near-term excitement of Roche's; the French company won't have final data from trials of its first cholesterol-lowering biologic with partner Regeneron until the back end of next year. But Sanofi, at about 12.5 times 2014 earnings, still trades at a slight discount to diversified peers like GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis, despite its superior growth outlook.

Investors should be wary of betting against a Sanofi bounce-back.

-- Helen Thomas

Infineon Makes

Rapid Rebound

Infineon Technologies is kicking itself back into gear. But investors may be getting ahead of themselves.

Europe's second-largest chip maker by sales says its order books are filling up again after a trying year. That pushed the shares up 9.9% Thursday, reversing recent falls amid fears of a prolonged downturn in the automotive market, from which Infineon gets 46% of its sales. Those fears now look overdone.

True, Infineon still expects revenue to fall by a mid-single-digit percentage this year, while operating profit margins will be below 10%. But sales in its automotive division, which makes sensors and power semiconductors, have stabilized.

Demand for Infineon's chips should continue to grow faster than the moribund car market. While global car production is likely to rise just 2.2% this year, the value of chips used in each car could increase 4.4%, estimates Strategy Analytics. Infineon says premium cars, to which it is a major supplier, contain three times the chip value as midsize or compact models.

Infineon's profitability may take longer to recover. It invested heavily in new machinery in its auto and industrial power businesses last year, which has led to much higher depreciation charges. Infineon believes at least 12% operating profit margins should be achievable longer term, compared with 9% in the second quarter.

But the loss-making industrial power control unit, which supplies engineering companies like ABB and Siemens, faces a tougher slog: Although customer destocking appears to have come to an end, Infineon doubts the unit's margins can return to peak levels of over 20% in 2011, when it benefited from constrained capacity in the industry. Infineon is currently running at 80% capacity across all of its units.

Infineon is already trading at 1.3 times forecast 2014 sales, in line with its three-year average, based on Morgan Stanley estimates. But whereas Infineon generated returns on capital employed comfortably above its midteens cost of capital over that period, returns were just 7% in the second quarter. It would take a much more robust recovery to justify chasing the shares much higher.

Glencore

Xstrata Is

No Miracle

Birth

It's been a long and painful birth: But GlencoreXstrata is finally here. The mining company will begin trading on Friday, with a market capitalization of about $66 billion. The merger process has delivered Chief Executive and 8%-shareholder Ivan Glasenberg and his longtime Glencore management colleagues their dream: full control of the new company. Xstrata will bring a stronger balance sheet and more commodities for Glencore's traders to use generating arbitrage opportunities in physical commodity markets.

But will investors enjoy watching the infant grow?

GlencoreXstrata will certainly be a noisier kid than staid peers like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The company's pro forma Ebitda was $12.9 billion last year, with 80% generated from mining. But Mr. Glasenberg is a trader to his fingertips. His pitch is that GlencoreXstrata can generate a superior return on equity through opportunistic asset buying, selling assets and returning more cash to shareholders if potential returns decline. Avoiding growth for growth's sake, an approach that has recently led to large asset write-downs, is Mr. Glasenberg's mantra.

Still, Glencore's track record doesn't yet prove that its model delivers better returns. Its return on equity averages 15% over the four years since the financial crisis, slightly better than the 10% delivered by Rio and Anglo American. But in that period, BHP has generated a 26% average annual ROE, albeit its year-end is in June. Moreover, Glencore has substantial assets in politically risky countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kazakhstan. If problems arise in such places, a nimble exit could prove tricky.

For investors to give GlencoreXstrata a premium rating, they will have to trust that Mr. Glasenberg can continue handling those political risks while practicing his capital-discipline gospel. Finding a strong new chairman might help allay concerns Glencore is run by a clever but self-interested group. Since its May 2011 flotation, Glencore has traded at eight times its expected earnings, just below the average of 8.2 times for major mining companies, according to Sanford C. Bernstein; its shares are down nearly 40%.

GlencoreXstrata is bringing welcome diversity to the mining sector. But toasting the new arrival would be premature.

Overheard

DreamWorks Animation is making a bet on television only this channel happens to reside on YouTube. The studio said it is buying AwesomenessTV, a teen-focused online network, for $33 million, plus additional payments that could bring the price up to $117 million if the ad-financed service hits certain earnings targets.

DreamWorks has long held ambitions to own, or partner in, a TV network. Buying a YouTube channel is cheaper than starting a new one and avoids the inevitable struggle with pay-TV providers over carriage fees.

DreamWorks hasn't said which, if any, of its content it plans to put on Awesomeness. But the site could help it make money off the portfolio of older titles like "Casper the Friendly Ghost" and "Lassie" that it got when it bought Classic Media. It could also provide an outlet for shows spun off from its animated films. The purchase has another benefit: Its CEO, Brian Robbins, is a Nickelodeon veteran and has considerable experience in children's programming. For DreamWorks, the new channel may live up to its name.

New employee Gaylor is expert on IPOs

Morgan Stanley banker worked on Facebook

Twitter has fuelled speculation that it is preparing for an initial public offering by naming Cynthia Gaylor, a Morgan Stanley investment banker who has worked on deals for Facebook, LinkedIn and Zynga, as its head of corporate development.

The social media company announced the appointment in a tweet and Ms Gaylor responded in kind , saying that she looked forward to focusing on mergers, acquisitions and strategy at the company.

Many analysts regard an IPO as the natural next step for the company, which launched in 2006 and has risen from a quirky start-up to a leading technology and media company with a value, after an investment this year by BlackRock, the asset manager of more than $9bn.

"This kind of hire is a clear indicator that Twitter is preparing now for an IPO," said Sam Hamadeh, founder of market research firm PrivCo.

Facebook, LinkedIn and Zynga, companies Ms Gaylor has worked with for Morgan Stanley, have all been taken public in the past two years.

The move caused a stir on Wall Street, not only as a sign of a likely IPO but also for its significance for Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley's team of west coast technology bankers, led by Michael Grimes, has dominated tech sector deals in recent years, culminating in 2012 with the much-coveted lead adviser role on Facebook's $16.1bn IPO .

However, the chaos surrounding the botched public offering threw the status of the tech team into doubt.

Morgan Stanley was fined $5m last year by a state regulator , which said the company's investment bankers had exerted "improper influence" on the research analysts covering Facebook during the IPO.

Ms Gaylor has most recently been leading Morgan Stanley's technology investment banking division focusing on the financing of capital markets placements.

Ms Gaylor's expertise with IPOs will be helpful if Twitter pursues a public debut while her skills and industry connections will strengthen Twitter in the fierce battle for Silicon Valley talent. Twitter, Facebook and Google often vie to buy the same companies, either for the team of engineers or the products they are developing.

In the past months, Twitter has acquired a series of companies, including a music discovery service We Are Hunted, Bluefin Labs , a social TV analytics firm, and Crashlytics, a mobile crash reporting tool.

World News: Europe: Jobless Rate in Euro Zone Hit a Record in March

LONDON -- The euro zone's unemployment rate rose to a fresh high in March, while the annual rate of inflation fell to its lowest level in April since February 2010, a combination that increases the likelihood that the European Central Bank will cut its benchmark interest rate Thursday.

With a further 62,000 people losing their jobs during the month, bringing the total to 1.723 million over the past 12 months, opposition to the austerity programs pursued by many euro-zone governments in recent years is likely to mount.

The European Union's official statistics agency Tuesday said the rate of unemployment across the 17 countries that share the euro rose to 12.1% from 12.0%, the highest level since records began in 1995. By contrast, the unemployment rate in the U.S. stood at 7.6%, while in Japan it was 4.3%.

Eurostat also said the annual rate of inflation fell to 1.2% in April from 1.7% in March, to hit its lowest level in more than three years. The ECB defines price stability, the maintenance of which is its sole mission, as an inflation rate of just below 2.0%.

The inflation rate was well below expectations, with economists surveyed last week expecting a drop to 1.6%.

The rise in unemployment brought the total number of people without jobs to 19.21 million, but many economists expect that to rise further as the year progresses.

"Policy makers need to address this issue urgently," said Marie Diron, senior economic adviser to business-services firm Ernst & Young. "First, the ECB needs to relax monetary policy at its meeting on Thursday. Second, the nature and pace of fiscal consolidation needs to be reviewed and amended."

The ECB is widely expected to reduce its main lending rate by 0.25 percentage point to a record-low 0.5% at Thursday's meeting in the Slovakian capital of Bratislava, one of the meetings the central bank holds away from its Frankfurt headquarters.

But while signaling that a rate cut is a possibility, ECB officials pointed out that it wouldn't provide much of a lift to the bloc's economy, particularly in Spain and other crisis-hit countries where small business face high borrowing costs.

"The pass-through of rate cuts to the periphery would be limited, and this is where they are most needed," ECB board member Jorg Asmussen said last week.

That has prompted some economists to call for more radical action, such as large-scale purchases of private-sector assets, which they argue would provide more help to ailing economies.

"Given that these economies [in Southern Europe] are already in deep recession and have more austerity coming, [lower interest rates] won't turn things around," said Jennifer McKeown, an economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy.

However, ECB officials have been cool to these proposals, saying it is up to governments to find ways to boost growth prospects.

Within the euro zone, there were wide differences among national unemployment rates, which were highest in those countries that have pursued the most aggressive austerity programs, or suffered the largest economic contractions.

The unemployment rate was highest in Spain at 26.7%, followed by 17.5% in Portugal, while the unemployment rate was lowest in Austria at 4.7%, followed by Germany at 5.4%. Figures for Greece have yet to be released, and it is likely to have recorded a higher rate than Spain, given that it did so in January, the most recent month for which numbers are available.

Figures released separately by German's Labor Ministry showed the number of people without jobs rose by 4,000 in April, having risen by 12,000 in March. However, the unemployment as calculated using Germany's own methodology was unchanged at 6.9%, near its lowest level since reunification in 1990.

"Germany's sluggish economy appears to be starting to have a negative impact on the labor market," said Thomas Harjes, an economist at Barclays. "Firms appear less willing to expand their labor force at times of still-elevated economic uncertainty and rising wage pressures."

The rise in unemployment and easing of inflationary pressures are linked. As the number of people without work rises, consumer demand weakens, and companies respond by cutting their prices, or limiting increases to the minimum needed to preserve profit margins.

"Rising unemployment, higher taxes, weakening wage growth and tightened credit are eating into household purchasing power and constraining household spending," said Anna Zabrodzka, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

Data released Tuesday painted a mixed picture of the state of consumer demand in the euro zone's largest members. While a monthly survey recorded a pickup in consumer confidence in Germany, figures for March showed retail sales fell for the second straight month.

By contrast, French consumer spending rose faster than expected in March, although that partly reflected the higher cost of heating homes given unusually cold weather, and purchases of manufactured goods actually fell.

The euro-zone economy contracted in each of the five quarters to the end of 2012. Official figures for the first quarter of this year won't be published until May 15, although business surveys and the available data suggest that they will record a sixth quarter of contraction.

Figures released by Spain's statistics agency Tuesday showed the euro zone's No. 4 economy contracted 0.5% in the first three months of the year, a less steep decline than the 0.8% fall recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.

The euro zone isn't alone in experiencing a decline in the annual rate of inflation. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said that across its 34 members, inflation fell to its lowest level in three years during March.

Real Estate
Saving Affordable Housing

An apartment complex in suburban Chicago was saved from the clutches of gentrification by a private real-estate investment trust formed to buy and protect affordable housing.

The property, serving a working-class section of Aurora, Ill., was acquired for $5.2 million by a Chicago unit of Denver-based Mercy Housing Inc. in a joint venture with Housing Partnership Equity Trust, a private REIT that was created by Mercy and 11 other housing-related nonprofits.

Although the deal was small, it is significant in that it was the first acquisition made by a real-estate company owned and operated by nonprofits and illustrates how organizations with a social mission can use the for-profit structure to advance their goals.

Housing Partnership has raised over $100 million from investors, including Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Prudential Financial Inc., as well as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The money will be chasing additional acquisitions in the future, says Drew Ades, Housing Partnership's chief executive.

Housing advocates have been alarmed by the rapid decline in the supply of affordable housing, the result of landlords scooping up low-income properties and converting them to luxury dwellings to capitalize on rising values for multifamily properties.

The increased activity of for-profits has made it difficult for nonprofits to remain active buyers; they can't pay the high price tags or move quickly. "We're losing affordable units like crazy," says Cindy Holler, president of Mercy Housing Lakefront, the Chicago office of Mercy Housing, one of the country's largest nonprofits dedicated to affordable housing.

To compete with the profit-making companies for properties, the housing advocates are combining the benefits of their nonprofit structure with the financial flexibility that comes from operating a REIT.

"We were only able to get this property because of this REIT structure," says Ms. Holler, noting that Mercy closed on the property in three months instead of the two years it would typically take to raise financing strictly through the nonprofit channels. Yet, Mercy's nonprofit status came in handy given it was able to use state tax credits to secure the property at a below-market rate.

"There is a stock of affordable housing that's really much more appropriate in mission-driven hands," says Mr. Ades, the former executive director of multifamily risk at Fannie Mae. "You have private investors that are coming in and purchasing these properties, hoping to get 12%, 15% and 20% returns. The only way that happens is if you increase the rents," he says.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard said in its 2011 report that the recession increased the pool of low-income renters at the same time competition for cheaper affordable housing units became more fierce. For instance, renters earning $15,000 or less rose by 2.2 million over the past decade, as affordable rentals declined by 470,000.

Some of tenants at the Aurora property expressed relief their new landlord would keep rents affordable.

"We couldn't afford any more than what we're paying," said 64-year-old Sharon Wetherbe, who lives in the complex with her husband. She said they probably would have to move into a nursing home if they had to leave their two-bedroom apartment where they pay $855 a month, accounting for half of their monthly income.

The average income for residents at the complex is about $26,000 a year, where they have access to an outdoor pool with a sun deck, covered parking and a community room with free Wi-Fi. Their rent is substantially lower than the average in Chicago.

Mr. Ades, declined to disclose the projected returns of the REIT, but estimated the capitalization rate for the acquisition was relatively high at about 7%, indicating a strong initial yield for the buyer. The average cap rate for apartments nationally was 6.1% in the first quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics. In major metro areas, where investor demand for apartments remains strong, the rate was 5.5%.

In addition to Mercy, other owners of Housing Partnership include Homes for America Inc. based in Annapolis, Md., LINC Housing Corp. of Long Beach, Calif., and NHP Foundation in New York.

THE MONEY GAME; Warning: Property Foreclosures Ahead; Small companies face balloon payments on their mortgages and no way to raise the money

By Emily Maltby

Many small firms that own commercial property are facing big trouble.

The problem is simple: Banks typically re-evaluate commercial mortgages every five to 10 years. At that point, they can renew the loans, or ask business owners to pay them off.

These days, lenders are a lot less willing to extend loans that don't seem like good bets and it's tough for businesses to look creditworthy after years of slumped sales and exhausted savings. "So many small businesses have lost their reserves during the recession," says Brent Case, president of Coldwell Banker Commercial Atlantic International Inc., in Charleston, S.C. "They don't have that chunk of cash that banks want as a buffer."

That leaves many small-business owners scrambling to find a lender that will cover their loan or facing the loss of their property through foreclosure.

Trouble in Store

For an idea of the scope the problem, consider this: Some $276.2 billion of nonresidential commercial-property loans are expected to come due in 2013. That's higher than any prior year, according to Trepp LLC, a commercial-mortgage research firm in New York.

Many of these loans were made leading up to the financial collapse in 2008, when property values were high and business owners could depend on steady income to repay the loan. In other cases, the loans came due in the depths of the financial crisis, but banks were willing to give businesses extensions essentially pushing the question of refinancing to a later date. Some analysts estimate as many as 60% of commercial real-estate loans that came due were extended during this period.

Now the extension periods have been coming to an end. Borrowers are again confronting big balloon payments they can't make and banks are more willing to foreclose. They're better capitalized than they've been in years and "are in a position to take a hit" on a loan, says Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics Inc., a commercial real-estate research firm in New York.

Bud Matthews of Chapel Hill, N.C., faced a five-year balloon payment of $240,000 in 2006 and had no trouble refinancing with SunTrust Banks Inc. But when the second balloon payment came due in June 2011, he couldn't find a bank to refinance the roughly $200,000 still outstanding. "We went to other banks, and they'd say, 'You are a good bet, but not good enough,' " says the 61-year-old, who occupies a commercial office for his 15-person construction and appliance-repair firm.

After much negotiating, the bank extended the loan through August 2012, but when it came due, Mr. Matthews couldn't pay the outstanding amount in full. The bank didn't want to refinance and started the foreclosure process.

Days before Mr. Matthews's property was scheduled to be auctioned in February, Harrington Bank, a local lender, agreed to assume the loan.

Hugh Suhr, vice president of corporate communications for SunTrust, says, "While we are not at liberty to discuss specific client relationships, we make every effort to work with clients on a case-by-case basis &in order to reach an outcome that best addresses the needs of all involved parties."

Given the number of loans coming due this year, and banks taking a critical eye to loan applications, it seems the problems will drag out for a number of years. As of mid-2012, about one in three loans coming due through 2016 was under water, meaning the property is worth less than what's owed, according to one estimate from Trepp.

"We can look out three to four years and know with certainty that a super amount of debt will come due that can't be dealt with in an ordinary way," says Phil Jemmett, chief executive at Breakwater Equity Partners, a San Diego consultancy and investment firm that specializes in troubled commercial real estate. "Roughly 20,000 small commercial properties &are facing distress in the next 12 months. We expect similar numbers in the next three years, and then it will taper off after 2016."

The incoming debt could trigger a "wave of foreclosures," says Tom Watson, CEO of JPB Commercial Real Estate Advisors LLC, a brokerage and real-estate consulting firm in Miramar Beach, Fla. The size of that wave, he says, will depend on whether the economy continues to improve. If it does, banks will steadily agree to refinance loans and offset the number of foreclosures that would have otherwise transpired.

The Hardest Hit

To be sure, commercial real-estate analysts largely agree that the commercial real-estate market won't experience a full-on collapse. One January report found that 60% of $399 billion in troubled commercial real-estate assets tracked since 2008 have been bought by a third-party investor or refinanced with a lender. But the report, from Real Capital Analytics, evaluates properties valued at greater than $2.5 million. The smallest businesses may have the longest road to normalcy. Small properties "are much less attractive to the banks, especially larger banks," says Matthew Anderson, managing director at Trepp.

In January 2008, the Spiliadis family, Stelios, Pauline and their son, Dimitris, received a $5.06 million loan from 1st Mariner Bank to build the Inn at the Black Olive. The property narrowly escaped a foreclosure auction late last month when the business filed for bankruptcy a legal maneuver that prevented the auction from going forward.

The Black Olive, which touts environmentally friendly features including solar panels, geothermal wells and recycled wood furniture, was under construction during the depths of the recession. After construction, the elder Mr. Spiliadis, 74, applied for the loan to roll into a 20-year mortgage with balloon payments every three years.

But the inn, which opened in March 2011, wasn't a good bet for the bank. The property value had plummeted, and cash flow was tight. Mr. Spiliadis asked the state of Maryland to provide a $1.5 million loan guarantee, but it never materialized. 1st Mariner, which declined to comment, didn't refinance the debt and Mr. Spiliadis stopped making monthly interest payments.

Now in Chapter 7, the business is bringing in enough sales to sustain operations, says Mr. Spiliadis, but the family is not in the clear they have until June to find an investor. If no investor steps up, the business will likely be on the auction block once again.

Maximum 'Office' Effort

One consolation for Microsoft after a record slide for shipments of personal computers? At least it is making a little headway in tablets.

But that progress comes at the cost of lost sales for its biggest and most profitable software product: Office.

In the first quarter, 7% of tablets sold globally ran a version of the Windows operating system, according to Strategy Analytics. That remains a distant third to the iPad (48% first-quarter market share) and Android tablets (43%). But considering that a year ago Microsoft had zero share, it counts as decent progress.

Windows is a big contributor to Microsoft's top and bottom lines, naturally. It is responsible for about a quarter of revenue and a third of operating income. So the 14% year-on-year decline in PC shipments in the first quarter, a record according to IDC, wasn't good news for Windows' future. To protect it from the PC slump, Microsoft needs to get Windows onto fast-growing mobile devices. And its strategy to do that, at least in tablets, is novel. Instead of just aping the iPad, as so many Android-based tablet rivals are doing, it is promoting a new line of "convertible" devices combining the features of tablets and laptops.

The idea is to convince buyers that Windows-based tablets can do more than rival devices and, consequently, that they can save money buying one product instead of a laptop and tablet. That sales pitch revolves around a key feature of Windows tablets: They are the only ones that run a full version of Office.

Particularly popular among business users, the Office suite includes Word, Excel, Power Point and other productivity apps. And it is a far bigger business for Microsoft than even Windows. Microsoft's Business Division, of which Office is the primary component, generates around 30% of sales and nearly half of operating income. Office is so popular, Morgan Stanley has estimated that even 30% to 40% of Mac users pay for it.

So the fact that Office isn't available for iPads and Android tablets, the most popular devices in the fastest-growing segment of the computer market, means Microsoft is leaving money on the table.

Take the iPad alone. Analyst Brian Marshall of ISI Group expects Apple to sell 88 million of them this year. If 35% of those iPad buyers also purchased Office, and Microsoft received about $40 per copy of the software, that would translate to about $1.2 billion in additional sales. Add potential customers from the existing pool of iPad owners, plus all of those with Android tablets, and the figure could well be higher.

Granted, this amount would boost earnings only 3% or so. But an added benefit would be to nip in the bud those mobile rivals training a new generation of device users to rely on Office alternatives such as Google's Google Docs, applications from Evernote, and Apple's iWork apps.

Gaining share for Windows in mobile is the right priority. And early market-share data suggest the present strategy is worth pursuing a while longer. But it is still possible that being able to build Excel spreadsheets won't help Windows-based tablets earn more than nominal market share.

In that case, Microsoft will have to rethink whether it is worth sacrificing its best franchise at the altar of Windows.

-- Rolfe Winkler

Standard Life:

Beware of Vertigo

Don't look down. Standard Life PLC, the U.K. life insurer, saw its shares wobble on Friday on the surprise departure of its finance chief to rival Prudential PLC. It hardly matters -- the stock has risen a whopping 72% in the past year, as investors have embraced Standard Life's strategy of shifting away from the capital-intensive business of underwriting insurance risk and toward the gathering of assets into a range of savings products. But the insurer-turned-asset manager's lofty perch leaves it exposed.

True, Standard Life should benefit from two big trends in its home market. The first is new laws requiring employers to automatically enroll staff in a pension plan. The company welcomed some 21,000 employees in the first quarter from its existing pension customers, with opt-out rates lower and contributions higher than expected. The rest of the year looks busy, says management, and the company has boosted capacity so it can process 60,000 new members a day.

The second change is new rules that prevent financial advisers' commissions being bundled into fees for fund- management products. The company stopped paying commissions from 2004 and -- while U.K. retail net inflows were similar to last year's first quarter -- Standard Life is seeing more interest from advisers who previously sought out commissions elsewhere.

The company's ascent has unshackled its valuation from peers. It trades on about 15 times 2014 forecast earnings, well above Legal & General on closer to 10 times and in line or above asset managers like Schroders or Henderson. The company's first-quarter numbers were impressive: New business sales, measured by the present value of premiums, rose 24% from last year. Net inflows of third-party funds into Standard Life's investment arm almost tripled.

But these inflows were underpinned by investors' appetite for the company's multi-asset absolute-return fund, GARS. That leaves the company exposed to a drop in performance of that product.

Standard Life is riding high, but investors could be forgiven for feeling a little queasy.

Spain's Move May Pressure Bonds

When Spain unilaterally raised its budget deficit targets in March 2012, it marked the start of a long rise in Spanish bond yields. They didn't stop until they were over 7%, forcing European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to pledge to do "whatever it takes" to hold the euro together. Spain has just raised its deficit targets again. Spanish bonds might end up coming under pressure, but a rerun of last year's bond-market rout doesn't seem imminent.

True, some of the circumstances are similar. Last year, as now, hopes for the euro-zone economy were fading fast. The budget target revisions in both years followed a sharp fall in yields, leading to worries that reduced market pressure was allowing governments to backslide on reform. This year, the Spanish revisions are even sharper: the 2013 target is now 6.3% of GDP, up from 4.5%, and the deficit is only expected to fall below 3% in 2016 rather than 2014.

But other factors mitigate against a selloff. Last year, there was also great uncertainty over how Spanish banks would be recapitalized; while concerns remain that last year's bank bailout didn't go far enough, the problem has at least been addressed. In the first half of 2012, foreign investors were also pulling out of Spanish bonds as fears of a euro-zone breakup ran high; the situation has stabilized. Mr. Draghi's pledge is still providing support to the bond market, even if doubts have grown about its implementation. And the new deficit targets, while perhaps still optimistic, are at least closer to reality.

That said, caution on Spain might be warranted given the deterioration in the deficit and growth outlook, and the prospect of higher bond issuance over time. Spain's credit ratings are on the brink of "junk" and the deficit revisions could put them under pressure.

Spanish 10-year bonds Friday yielded 4.27%, a premium of just 0.2 percentage point over Italy. But the latter, especially now that it has formed a government, looks like a more stable credit on many measures. Spain will probably rally along with Italy in the near term as investors welcome political stability. But Spain now looks more vulnerable to a bond market setback.

ProSieben

Still a Star

As RTL

Debuts

Bertelsmann AG wants a Hollywood ending to its affair with the television business. Should investors play a role?

Rather than buy out minority shareholders, the media conglomerate has decided to sell down its 92% stake in Luxembourg-based RTL Group to as little as 75% and invest the cash in expansion elsewhere. RTL, whose assets include a German TV programmer and FremantleMedia, will start trading in Frankfurt on Tuesday.

While European media remain dicey, RTL has advantages that set it apart. First, nearly 60% of RTL's operating income comes from Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, whose main assets are German broadcasters RTL Television and Vox. Germany is a rare European market where advertising has held up; the division's revenue rose a respectable 3.7% last year.

Another plus: German pay-TV operators recently began paying broadcasters to carry their channels. Previously, broadcasters paid operators for carriage, but high-definition-TV turned the tables as operators became desperate for HD content.

RTL could also capitalize on a shift away from print ads. Some 49% of ad spending in Germany goes to print, compared with 35% for Western Europe, according to ZenithOptimedia. TV accounts for just 22% of advertising in Germany versus 30% in Western Europe. FremantleMedia, while only contributing 13% of RTL's operating profit, could also draw a crowd. There aren't many ways to invest in pure production.

Even so, investors should consider ProSiebenSat.1 Media, Germany's other big broadcaster. While RTL is coping with declining markets like France and the Netherlands, nearly 90% of ProSieben's operating income comes from German-language TV. And ProSieben is ahead of the pack with digital initiatives like maxdome, a video-streaming service.

Analysts expect ProSieben's earnings per share to rise more than 8% annually in the next three years, compared with roughly 5% for RTL. If RTL prices at the bottom of the 54 euros-62 euros per share range, it would trade at 11.5 times consensus 2014 earnings, compared with ProSieben's multiple of 12, adjusting for a coming special dividend. While both are star material, ProSieben looks camera ready.

Overheard

The weather in Chicago this earnings season has been decidedly drizzly. Groupon shareholders may want to make sure they pack an umbrella. Actually it is one Windy City building in particular over which clouds seem to have gathered -- 600 W. Chicago Ave. -- where a number of companies co-founded by Eric Lefkofsky, and in which he is still the largest individual shareholder, all have head offices.

One is InnerWorkings, which in mid-April reduced financial projections after a major customer took most of its business to a rival. Its shares dropped 25% on that news. Another is Echo Global Logistics. On Thursday, it reported first-quarter results that fell short of expectations. Its shares dropped 12% over two days. Groupon also calls that address home. Besides holding a $700 million stake in the online coupon company, Mr. Lefkofsky also assumed the co-chief executive role in February after former head Andrew Mason was fired.

Groupon reports its first-quarter results May 8. Lucky for shareholders, Accuweather.com is forecasting "abundant sunshine."

FT REPORT - RISK MANAGEMENT: PEOPLE
Scandals put spotlight on the human element

Getting the measure of people and their potential shortcomings presents one of the big challenges to companies, writes Brian Groom

If a company's success comes down to its people, as business leaders often say, then they also pose some of its biggest risks. People risk is one of the most important - if not the most important - elements of risk management. The question of how to measure and manage that most unpredictable of resources is preoccupying employers worldwide.

The financial crisis has heightened awareness of this, not least through an ever-growing list of scandals such as investment bank JPMorgan's $6bn trading losses incurred in the "London whale" affair, the alleged rigging of the Libor benchmark interest rate and the US investigation into alleged insider trading by employees of the hedge fund SAC Capital.

People risk goes far beyond the financial services sector. Prime examples include the UK's phone hacking scandal, in which journalists' covert gleaning of information from mobile phones led to the closure of Rupert Murdoch's News of the World news-paper, or the lax culture over decades at the BBC that allowed the late disc jockey Jimmy Savile to get away with sexual assaults on children.

It can range from deliberate acts to simple incompetence or poor human resources management; or from rogue traders and fraudsters to inadequate staff training, lax safety procedures and lack of performance management consistency.

"Every organisation that employs people has got to be concerned about people risk," says Carolyn Williams, head of thought leadership at the Institute of Risk Management (IRM), which has members in more than 100 countries. "As organisations get bigger and more complex, the problem multiplies."

Research by SHL, a talent management company, found that one in eight managers and professionals were a high risk to their companies, mainly through poor decision-making and communication. The risk was most acute at middle manager level.

"They have a critical role to play as they are the interface between strategy and operational execution," says Eugene Burke, chief science and analytics officer. On the one hand they have to manage compliance and commitment from frontline staff. On the other, they need to communicate decisions from leaders in a relevant way so frontliners feel motivated and empowered."

SHL found that one in eight frontline staff posed a high risk by not sticking to rules or attending to detail - which could translate into increased error rates and accidents - or by poor commitment and teamwork.

It found the riskiest sectors for all job levels were telecoms and consumer goods. The public sector and retail were the most risk averse. Banking was in the middle, but it is a sector in which a few cases can have a big impact - and it is of systemic importance, so problems there have repercussions across the whole economy.

"If you look at crises that corporates find themselves faced with, it all to a greater or lesser degree starts from some issue relating to people," says Nick Squire, a partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

Questions about individual behaviour seem inextricably linked to a company's culture. Problems can arise if the leadership turns a blind eye to misdemeanours or tacitly encourages them, or if policies and processes are poorly communicated.

There is a global standard for risk management, ISO 31000, providing principles and generic guidelines. "A lot of work has gone into systems and processes and yet still people are not behaving as they are expected to," says Ms Williams at the IRM.

"People are looking for explanations as to why this is - and culture then comes up. Do you have a comprehensive network of policies that just don't get followed? Or, which can be just as bad, do people follow them blindly, without thinking about what they are really doing?"

The purpose of risk management is to allow risks to be taken, not to cut them out completely. Too little risk-taking can be as damaging as too much, which is arguably what happened to Eastman Kodak, the photographic film business. It saw itself as being in the chemicals rather than the image business, Ms Williams says, and failed to make the leap to digital technology.

Steve Saporito, chief executive for the Americas at the global solutions consulting group of Willis, the insurance broker, says he cannot think of any project with a client in which people risk has not been a top 10 issue in some form.

Whether it is failure to attract and retain critical staff, high turnover or poor succession planning in case important personnel leave, he says it is important to dig below the surface. It usually has a deeper cause such as poor accountability, misalignment of incentives with a company's aims or a culture in which employees are not encouraged to question the status quo.

Willis, with other brokers, accountants and others, offers "enterprise risk management", or ERM, a framework for identifying, analysing, responding to and reducing risks. Business has boomed since the crisis, especially since Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, included evaluation of ERM in its credit rating protocol three years ago.

Some risks can be quantified, such as fraud losses per branch within a bank, stock losses at a retailer or injuries at a mining company. But people risk often defies precise quantification. "You want to get a good understanding of the risk, both at the surface level and below the surface, get some sort of qualitative five-by-five matrix of likelihood and severity to comparatively measure that risk against other risks," Mr Saporito says.

Companies also measure employee engagement to monitor the degree of commitment to the company, or the extent of compliance with ethics policies. Some use psychometric testing to establish employees' risk-taking propensity, which needs to be balanced against safeguards. As companies cut staff, the number of risk managers has in some cases been reduced, so procedures need to be firm.

Steve Culp, managing director of Accenture's risk management practice, says managing people risk is "first and foremost about communication. The policies, structures, the data being tracked are all going to be secondary". He stresses the importance of internal hotlines.

One question since the financial crisis has been why risk management in banking, which has the most complex and rigorous systems, failed. Some say the models were flawed but others believe executives simply overrode advice because profits were so tempting. It certainly seems that systems and processes did not take sufficient account of the human factor.

"The important thing is to recognise there is an issue, which has to come at board level," says Ms Williams. "Companies focus a lot on the management of their assets. People need to be seen as an asset in the same way. You can have the best rules, policies and processes, but that still might not mean that people follow them."

Companies need to show humility in acknowledging problems can happen, she suggests. "People look at an organisational car crash and think 'that couldn't possibly happen here, we're not in that sector or we are not like that' - and then you discover horsemeat in your burgers."

COMPANIES
Slow start forecast for LSE's tech IPO strategy; exchanges

The London Stock Exchange's efforts to lure technology groups is set for a slow start, with some advisers expressing doubts that it will lead to a significant batch of initial public offerings.

The High-Growth Segment , which allows companies to trade on London's main market by floating as little as one-tenth of their shares, has been open for applications for the past month.

Intended to facilitate the path "from start-up to stardom", it has been enthusiastically received by venture capital investors. However, advisers active in the technology sector told the FT that the option of a smaller listing was unlikely to have a significant impact, given that only four technology groups launched IPOs in London last year.

"I rather get a sense of the exchange thrashing around, looking for ideas," said a partner at a City law firm, saying he did not see a long pipeline of groups seeking to list. About six companies have made preliminary enquiries to the LSE since the draft rules were published in February, but none has made clear their intention to list on the segment.

Sam Smith, chief executive of brokerage FinnCap, said: "It is early days and a step in the right direction. However, we have seen very limited enquiries."

The High-Growth Segment is aimed at companies in Europe that might otherwise decide to list on Nasdaq in the US, or sell themselves to larger US companies. About 20 European groups listed in New York in the past three years, according to the LSE.

Companies listing on the segment must float a stake of at least 30m, meaning candidates are likely to have a market capitalisation above 300m.

Established tech start-ups such as Mind Candy would be eligible, but the segment would be out of reach of others such as Rosslyn Analytics, which has announced its intention to list on AIM this year .

One of the advantages of listing on the segment is reduced disclosure and governance requirements. Yet one banker said: "It's going about things in the wrong way. Lowering the rules does nothing but alert and alarm the investors that something of lower-quality is coming their way."

Nonetheless, others support the LSE initiative. "Being able to drip feed a company on to the market is a good way to balance the seller hoping for a high valuation with the buyer worrying about owning an asset with little public track record," said Andrew Griffin, at Monitise, the mobile payments group.

Tim Kay, who heads KPMG's work with London tech start-ups, said he had modest expectations for the initiative. "Anything we can do to support UK plc is a good idea. Is the High-Growth Segment the only answer? Of course it isn't."

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Henderson revamp starts to pay; Fund focus

The new global outlook is yielding results, finds Eleanor Lawrie

Henderson Global Investors ' revamped Global Equity Income fund is showing the green shoots of a performance U-turn, following a significant overhaul a year ago.

The former New Star fund, managed by Andrew Jones and Ben Lofthouse, was taken over by Henderson when it bought New Star in 2009. Three years later, on May 8 last year, Henderson launched a complete revamp of the fund following sustained underperformance.

The changes centred on switching the fund from predominantly focusing on UK equities to a global outlook, and moving it into a global equity income fund peer group.

The overhaul came after five years of lacklustre returns in which the fund ranked 78 out of 79 funds in its former sector (IMA UK Equity Income), according to FE Analytics data correct to the end of April 2012.

Since the mandate change, Global Equity Income has delivered a top-quartile 29.3 per cent gain, compared with a 25.1 per cent average rise from funds in its new IMA Global Equity Income sector, the data provider adds. The fund is currently yielding roughly 3.5 per cent, according to Henderson.

Mr Jones says the UK was "never a bad market", adding that the decision to move to a global focus was due to the "increasing concentration of income" in the UK stock market.

The fund is currently 22 per cent weighted to UK equities, compared with a 15 per cent weighting on its benchmark MSCI World index - amounting to a 7 percentage point overweight in its home market.

"Royal Bank of Scotland, BP and Lloyds Banking Group were cutting their dividends, so income fell in the UK, meaning income is concentrated within only a few stocks," Mr Jones says.

The managers now have more than a 40 per cent exposure to the US and they have added marginally to Europe through stocks such as Electrolux, the Swedish appliance manufacturer.

The next step may be a bigger foray into emerging-market stocks, the manager says. The duo are keeping a watchful eye on emerging markets, which they caution still vary widely in terms of their attitude to paying dividends to investors, as opposed to purely focusing on growth.

Mr Jones hails companies in Brazil, Taiwan, Korea and China as having a "quite established" trend of paying out reliable dividends to shareholders.

"Emerging markets have underperformed, and we are having a look to see if there is anything more exciting there," says co-manager Mr Lofthouse.

In China, the fund holds Hong Kong-listed infrastructure company NWS Holdings, which the team suggests is a strong investment in spite of broader market weakness in the world's second-largest economy.

Mr Jones and Mr Lofthouse add that they are also populating their developed-market equity portfolios with companies that derive revenues in emerging economies.

For example, UK-listed Unilever, the consumer goods conglomerate, has benefited from growth in Brazil, the managers say. They also hail US-listed Las Vegas Sands, a global casino operator that paid out a major special dividend at the end of last year thanks in part to its growing business operations in China and Singapore.

BOJ Nods Toward Difficulties

A year can be an awfully long time in economics. The Bank of Japan now says that it will try to accomplish in three years what it previously set out to do in two.

Japan's central bank made a splash three weeks ago when it announced its intention to stoke 2% inflation within two years. The goal was to reverse more than a decade of economic malaise in which Japan has often seen prices fall rather than rise.

On Friday, the central bank partly backed off its original plan, saying that it will now aim to meet the inflation target by March 2016 instead of March 2015.

The bank's earlier promise to inject 60 trillion yen to 70 trillion yen ($612 billion to $714 billion) per year into the financial system stands. Even so, the revised timeline seems like a tacit acknowledgment that ending Japan's deflation trap remains a formidable task.

Indeed, data out Friday showed that Japanese consumer prices fell 0.9% in annual terms in March. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the central bank have made some steps forward recently, but a fall in prices is a step in the wrong direction. Nor will it necessarily engender confidence among consumers that the central bank can achieve its inflationary aim.

To be fair, monetary policy takes time to filter through the economy. What's more, the central bank is trying to undo 15 years of deflation.

The bank's promise of loose monetary policy has certainly weakened the yen, which has flirted of late with a level of nearly 100 to a dollar, and strengthened Japanese stocks.

Japanese companies like Sony and Canon say they expect higher earnings as exports get a boost on the back of the depreciating currency.

The bigger problem, though, is how monetary easing filters through to household income and consumption. Expanding the size of the labor force or boosting the purchasing power of workers is what would really stoke demand.

But there's much to be done in this respect. The average monthly earnings of Japanese workers actually fell 0.7% in February from a year earlier, CLSA says.

The participation of women and immigrants in Japan's labor force remains too low given the country's aging and shrinking population. It is well below that of European nations and the U.S.

In other words, loose monetary policy can only do so much. Tokyo also has to do more to convince companies to raise wages and add workers.

But this will be tough. UBS analyst Duncan Wooldridge says that even if the labor participation rate for women age 15 to 64 rises by a full percentage point in each of the next two years, achieving sustained 2% inflation is doubtful.

Mr. Abe and the Bank of Japan have given themselves an extra year to meet a difficult inflation target, but without important policy measures another year may not be enough.

Samsung Shines as Rivals Fade

Samsung's legal battle with Apple over smartphone patents drags on. But there is no disputing which of them is winning the fight for profits.

Days after Apple reported its first drop in quarterly earnings in 10 years, Samsung on Friday announced record first-quarter net profit of 7.15 trillion won (US$6.4 billion), up 42% year-on-year.

The drawn-out patent dispute between the two consumer-electronics giants may be an overhang. Samsung booked provisions in its mobile division in the first quarter of 2013, but didn't disclose exactly what the provisions are related to or how big they are.

Still, at the rate Samsung is racking up profits -- and given its cash position of $28 billion at the end of the first quarter -- even a severe penalty would hardly make a dent. A California judge recently cut the amount of damages Samsung must pay Apple for patent violations from $1 billion to about $600 million, about 1% of quarterly revenue.

There are other concerns. Demand for televisions and personal computers is slowing. Lingering doubts about the global economy could hurt sales more broadly. Still, Samsung is a dominant player in just about all its business lines, which means it is in a relatively strong position compared with many rivals.

Despite the success, Samsung shares trade at about seven times estimates of next year's earnings. That looks cheap. The 10-year average is 10.4 times forecast earnings, Bernstein Research says.

Some investors might worry Samsung has too many eggs in one smartphone basket -- three-quarters of operating profit is tied up in cellphones and telecom equipment. But to punish Samsung for its success would be churlish.

Samsung benefits from having a wider range of phones than most of its rivals, from cheap to ultra-expensive, in a fast-growing market. In the first quarter of 2013, global smartphone shipments increased 36% from the same period last year, Strategy Analytics says. Samsung shipped 69.4 million units in the quarter, almost twice as many as Apple, to capture a record 33% share of the global market.

Its latest phone, the Galaxy S 4, has hit a bump in the U.S., with some carriers complaining of delays getting the new device to market. Samsung says that is due to strong demand, a plausible excuse given recent sales growth. The Korean company only has to maintain momentum for its star to rise even higher.

For ADM and GrainCorp,

It's Love at Third Sight

Archer Daniels Midland and GrainCorp should now be able to walk down the aisle with heads held high.

ADM has been courting GrainCorp for a while and was twice spurned last year. But an improved bid of three billion Australian dollars (US$3.1 billion) now seems likely to tip the scales, nudging up the offer price just enough to gain the support of GrainCorp's board. Even after upping the bid, ADM expects the deal to boost earnings in the first year following acquisition.

The base for ADM's offer remains A$12.20 cash a share -- the same price that was rejected by GrainCorp in December -- but ADM is throwing in a A$1 dividend per share. Australians among GrainCorp's shareholders can benefit from tax rules that mean the dividends are worth about 43 cents more a share.

The offer marks a 49% premium to where GrainCorp's shares were trading in October, just before ADM made its first offer. Macquarie says the bid implies a valuation of 9.5 times the average of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization over the past four years. That is more expensive than recent deals, such as Glencore's acquisition of Canada's Viterra and GrainCorp's acquisition of Integro Foods and Gardner Smith Group to build its edible-oils business.

The terms of the agreement prevent GrainCorp from shopping for rival bids. If an unsolicited counteroffer shows up, ADM has two days to match it. Other potential bidders would have to factor in that ADM already has a stake of almost 20%.

GrainCorp's board can proudly say it held out for more. ADM, too, can point to a dogged pursuit that lands it Australia's largest independent grain handler and a dominant position in grain ports along the east coast, with routes to fast-growing markets in Asia. That is about as happy a start to a marriage as either could hope for.

BoCom Earnings Surprise on Upside

SHANGHAI -- Bank of Communications Co. kicked off the first-quarter reporting season for China's major banks, and its stronger-than-expected profit growth brought a sigh of relief in the sector.

Profit growth at Chinese banks is expected to continue to slow as Chinese lenders grapple with a slowing economy and interest-rate deregulation, but analysts said resilient net-interest margins will help buoy lenders' net income in the coming quarters.

China's fifth-largest bank by assets, also known as BoCom, said Thursday its first-quarter net profit rose 12% to 17.71 billion yuan ($2.87 billion) from 15.88 billion yuan a year earlier, thanks to healthy net-interest income and higher commissions.

The result was better than the average 16.33 billion yuan net-profit forecast among five analysts polled by Thomson Analytics. Still, it was down from the 20% increase in earnings in the year-earlier period.

Net interest income in the three months ended March 31 rose 11% to 32.03 billion yuan from 28.81 billion yuan a year earlier. Analysts said China's major banks have been boosting their lending profitability by making loans to retail and small and medium-size enterprises instead of big state-owned companies, which typically pay lower rates.

Net fee and commission income from credit cards and sales of wealth-management products rose 24% from a year earlier to 6.93 billion yuan, from 5.60 billion yuan.

BoCom's net-interest margin fell to 2.57% in the first quarter from 2.63% a year earlier, which analysts attributed to a reduction in residential mortgage rates.

But analysts said a recovery in borrowing demand will help improve loan pricing and support Chinese lenders' net-interest margins.

The lender's nonperforming-loan ratio rose to 0.97% at the end of the first quarter from 0.92% at the end of last year.

"A slight deterioration in nonperforming loans in the first quarter isn't systemic, and we're confident that the bank's bad loan ratio will be capped at 1% this year," BoCom Executive Vice President Qian Wenhui said at a press briefing after the lender's first-quarter results.

Mr. Qian attributed the decline in loan quality to small corporate customers in eastern China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The two provinces are known as hubs for small and medium enterprises and exporters, which are likely to fare poorly given a slowing economy.

Contrary to analysts' expectations, Mr. Qian said he doesn't expect HSBC Holdings PLC to sell or reduce its 19% stake in the Chinese bank, because the London-based bank remains interested in having exposure to emerging markets and China's growth.

Corrections & Amplifications

Ted Bailey says his trading-analytics company, Dataminr, is making headway with trading clients in using technology to scan news streams and make rapid buy or sell decisions. In a Money & Investing article on Thursday about such technology, he was quoted saying that his firm was "making a lot of headwind" with clients.

(WSJ April 26, 2013)

(END)

When the words "explosions" and "White House" popped up Tuesday on a verified Associated Press Twitter account, computers in the bare-bones offices of a New York City startup sprang into action.

The computers, housed in the Madison Avenue headquarters of a company called Dataminr, sent alerts to clients like hedge funds and government agencies about the apparent news. Shortly thereafter, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 145 points in seconds.

But the machines weren't fooled: Before the AP announced that the tweet was a hoax -- its account had been hacked -- Dataminr's computers generated a fresh alert saying the news may not be legitimate.

Moments later, shares rebounded across the board, and the blue-chip index ended the day with gains greater than before the incident.

Tuesday's tumult is shining a light on the investment world's use of sophisticated computers programmed to scan news streams -- including those from Twitter and other social media -- to make buy or sell decisions in fractions of an instant.

The technology has been around for several years, but it is increasingly finding adherents among financial firms, including hedge funds, investment banks and even long-term investors such as mutual-fund companies. Experts say traders use the data for just about every kind of investment around the world, from U.S. stocks to the Korean won.

To some on Wall Street, the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent decision to allow companies to release material information via Twitter had "legitimized" the strategy, said Ted Bailey, chief executive and founder of four-year-old Dataminr. The company is lately "making a lot of headwind" with large hedge funds and government clients, he said.

The roots of these computer programs go back to those built by media companies and hedge funds to trade around publicly disclosed information, such as earnings and economic data, say traders and programmers.

Media firms including Dow Jones, Bloomberg and Reuters began setting up "elementized news feeds" around 2006. With the feeds, this public information was piped nearly instantaneously to data centers and sold to trading firms. Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal.

These trading firms would then devise computer programs to buy and sell based on an earnings report being up or down, or a firm being named in a lawsuit.

Some of the new programs are rather simple, looking for key words in verified accounts of major news sources. Others use complex algorithms to detect patterns. Dataminr's program works by processing hundreds of millions of daily tweets instantly to find credible and actionable information that they can share with clients.

Dataminr looks at dozens of variables about each tweet, such as the influence of the user, the geolocation of where the tweet is sent from, and how tweets are clustered together.

In 2010, Johan Bollen, an associate professor at Indiana University, and two other professors published research showing how using Twitter could with more than 85% accuracy predict the daily up and down readings of the Dow.

Some investors that use news-scraping programs draw the line at Twitter, however. "The accuracy of tweets is a major concern," said Zeid Barakat, co-founder of Flyberry Capital, a startup that uses high-speed strategies to trade commodity futures around news events.

Credit Suisse AG doesn't use these sorts of algorithms because the technology is still developing, said Dan Mathisson, the head of U.S. equity trading.

Tuesday's incident "doesn't happen often enough to make it worthwhile" to invest in such technology, he said.

Others say being first is a critical advantage. Selerity Inc., based in Jersey City, N.J., detected an August 2012 tweet from a person who witnessed a fire at a Chevron Corp. refinery in Richmond, Calif., near San Francisco, news that hadn't reached the broader media, according to the firm's founder, Ryan Terpstra. The tweet read "oh [expletive] the chevron refinery in richmond [is] on fire!!!"

Selerity alerted clients, who were able to buy gasoline futures contracts before the news spread widely and caused prices to soar, says Mr. Terpstra.

In the case of Tuesday's commotion, Dataminr's computers not only flagged the event but the algorithms noticed quickly that there was no corroboration. Unlike the Boston Marathon bombing a week earlier, there were none of the telltale signs of a disaster: no sudden swell of tweets from people in the vicinity of the White House, for instance, Mr. Bailey said.

The company alerted customers to another tweet, from a reporter at the White House, saying the report appeared to be a false alarm. The AP and White House quickly issued official denials of the explosions shortly thereafter.

One of the first firms to embrace the small but growing industry being created around social media and investing was New York-based RavenPack.

The business, begun in 2007, now has dozens of hedge funds, mutual funds and banks as clients, all of which have embraced social media more aggressively in the past year, said Armando Gonzalez, chief executive of the firm. The company today counts several institutional investors with more than $5 billion in assets under management as clients of its social-media products.

When Tuesday's minicrash happened, Mr. Gonzalez said he was inundated with questions from clients about how the incident could happen. Most wanted to be sure that RavenPack was using information only from trusted sources, which he said they had. Mr. Gonzalez said he finished answering questions from clients at 2 a.m.

Lombard: Pensions stars align to drag auditors into new orbits

In cosmic terms, the 25 years that European lawmakers think it should take for a company to rotate its auditor is but a blink of an eye. After all, 165 years pass while Neptune rotates once around the sun. But a quarter-century is a long time in business. A watering-down of the European Commission's plan for companies to enlist fresh abacus rattlers every six to 12 years shows just how good at lobbying accountants are.

Their job has been made easier by a lack of serious opposition. The brain-shrinking boringness of audit regulation has made debates low-key compared with those concerning executive remuneration.

That should change in the UK thanks to the decision of two pensions titans to "draw a line in the sand". The 38bn Universities Superannuation Scheme and RPMI Railpen, which manages 18bn, say they will vote against the reappointment of any audit firm whose tenure at a FTSE 350 company exceeds 15 years. Their preference is for a change every seven to eight years.

The average FTSE 100 company waits for Jupiter to orbit the sun four times (about 48 years) before it replaces its auditor. So USS and RPMI Railpen are set to cast a lot of protest votes.

Good. This will remind accountants that while they are hired by company audit committees, their real employers are the shareholders.

There are sound arguments for regular auditor rotation. Incomers are better at spotting anomalies than incumbents blinded by over-familiarity. Accountants who can count on reappointment will naturally seek to lift revenues by cross-selling other services, such as management consultancy. And that can compromise their objectivity.

The auditors who signed off the accounts of tottering banks as "true and fair" have enjoyed a remarkably easy ride since the financial crisis. USS and RPMI Railpen deserve support from other investors in making it bumpier.

It is 60 years since James Watson and Francis Crick published their model of the structure of DNA in the journal Nature, writesAndrew Hill. No better time, then, to eradicate the use of the expression by smug business leaders, as in: "It's in our DNA" or "It's in the company's DNA".

The likely origin is Gareth Morgan's 1986 book Images of Organization, which laid out eight metaphors through which people think about organisations, including as a machine, as a political system and as an organism. Fair enough, but the use and abuse of the term has bloomed in recent years. Delve into the archive and you will find 550 instances of the two sentences above in the past year alone.

Why is this bad? Apart from the laziness of using just one metaphor - which may lead to groupthink - one suspects all 550 of the past year's examples were positive: sustainability is "in our DNA", customer service is "part of our DNA".

Yet it is the embedded nature of negative corporate traits, from inefficiency to outright corruption, that is the real risk for organisations. To say something is in your DNA suggests it cannot be easily changed, whereas corporate culture has to be constantly under review. Time for some new metaphors and fresh thinking.

Despite its name, WANdisco is not a nightclub for goths, but a UK-based tech success. Shares in the Aim company, whose products help people handle data overload or work on shared files, have quadrupled since last June's float.

The shares levitated another 3 per cent on Thursday, thanks to a doubling in cash bookings to $3m in the first quarter. WANdisco also announced it had made its first sale of products for managing "big data" - the slew of information generated by proliferating IT systems.

The Silicon Valley-spawned venture does not say who the customer is or how much they will pay. Which begs the question: why make an announcement at all?

The danger facing lossmaking start-ups is that they become slaves to the need to produce "newsflow". Lacking the proof of concept that profits or a lucrative buyout may supply later, investors clamour for heartening press releases instead.

WANdisco should beware of fuelling unsustainable optimism. Tech dunces dazzled by the sparkle of the group's story should breathe into a paper bag, meanwhile. The shares, trading on a 49-times multiple of enterprise value to sales, look expensive compared with established businesses, such as Arm Holdings at 21.5 times. To paraphrase ukulele-playing sage Warren Buffett: never invest in a company you flatter yourself you understand but probably don't.

Website revenue optimization company Dynamic Yield has raised $2 million in Series A financing led by Bessemer Venture Partners. The New York Times Company and Innovation Endeavors, the investment fund of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, also participated in the round.

Dynamic Yield was founded in 2012 by CEO Liad Agmon and CTO Omri Mendellevich. Based in Tel Aviv, Dynamic Yield develops real-time audience personalization software that increases revenue yield and key engagement metrics for online publishers and e-commerce websites. The start up has been self-funded to date.

Dynamic Yield plans to use the proceeds to expand its global footprint by opening a New York City office and to support the growth of its expanding customer base.

Dynamic Yield's software can help publishers and e-commerce sites more effectively monetize their visiting user traffic. Dynamic Yield provides website owners with an automated SaaS solution that measures the revenue impact of each page layout and individual in-page components. Real-time personalization algorithms can then be directed to increase overall revenue yield by increasing user engagement, ad clicks, product purchases, social sharing and page-views.

Dynamic Yield also provides a comprehensive audience module that helps website owners to understand who are their most valuable users, why they are valuable and how to increase reach, engagement and revenues from existing and new traffic channels. With an understanding that publishers lack the time and resources to go through complex integration projects, Dynamic Yield has focused on making the product easy to deploy and manage.

Dynamic Yield is already powering nearly a billion monthly page-views.

Agmon said, "We supposedly live in an era of dynamic, personalized web experiences, yet data loads and algorithmic capacity have kept the vast majority of websites largely static. We have shown in the past 12 months that our low-touch SaaS solution has significant and far reaching effect on our clients' bottom-lines."

Bessemer's Adam Fisher, who sits on Dynamic Yield's board, said, "There are a lot of tools and services in the market to optimize discreet components of a website, but nothing that takes a holistic view of how to maximize revenue across revenue sources and yet improve user engagement and satisfaction at the same time. With its big data approach, Dynamic Yield helps website owners achieve this difficult balance, while still allowing for editorial control."

Apple Struggles With Chinese Checkers

Despite being seemingly invincible, even Apple may struggle to climb the Great Firewall of China.

China is Apple's main growth market. In the quarter ended in December, China accounted for 13% of Apple's revenue, and Chief Executive Tim Cook has said he expects it will become Apple's largest market. Shareholders anxiously await a deal for China Mobile, the world's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, to officially carry the iPhone.

Yet a string of criticism and proposed regulatory curbs suggest Apple's trajectory in China may deviate from the course many expect.

The latest came in Wednesday's edition of the People's Daily. An article included Apple in a list of websites and app stores that have been investigated for providing pornographic content in China. This comes a month after Apple was attacked by China Central Television over its iPhone warranties, prompting an apology from Mr. Cook.

Then there is a proposed law that could give the Chinese government more control over apps and put new standards in place that may force companies to help the government track users.

Why does Apple suddenly find itself in the cross hairs? The proposed law suggests the Chinese government is wary of the growing power of a company whose smartphone "ecosystem" Beijing doesn't control.

This would fit a pattern. Facebook is a "walled garden" of content that is blocked to Chinese Web surfers entirely. Twitter is, too. And then there is Google which, in effect, kicked itself out of China's mainland search market after refusing censorship demands.

Ironically, Google's Android mobile operating system dominates the smartphone market in China, despite the company's strained relationship with the government. But those devices don't come with Google services that are standard elsewhere, such as YouTube, search, and Google Maps. Also, without access to the Google Play store, Chinese users have a weaker selection of apps to choose from.

Apple is famous for the control it exerts over so many aspects of its devices, including the apps available to users. This is a big part of the iPhone's appeal: Apps just work and are largely free of bugs or malicious code. Mr. Cook will be in a tough spot if, for instance, Beijing requires Apple to alter its services in a way that lends itself more easily to government control.

Not that China is exclusively focused on Apple. A Chinese government research institute in March said that the country is too reliant on Android and that local manufacturers should have more control over it.

One issue Beijing must deal with, though, is that iPhones and Android devices are popular for a reason. And Chinese consumers will grow more attached to them over time, especially as there are few good alternatives today. Curbing Chinese consumers' access to such technology would likely cause grumbling across the country, something the government has historically been keen to avoid.

Still, any adversity for Apple and Google in China could spell opportunity for local smartphone makers like Lenovo and Huawei Technologies. Together, these two had about 26% of China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2012, estimates Strategy Analytics.

Foreigners Samsung and Apple had 16.3% and 9.7%, respectively. Hewlett-Packard offers a cautionary tale here. Its share of China's personal-computer market collapsed after it came under fire from state media in 2010 over product quality. Lenovo's market share increased sharply.

Apple's reputation, and huge valuation, rests on its ability to create new markets that it then dominates. China won't necessarily fit that model.

Kiwi Is Already Flying High

Middle Earth is getting pricey. New Zealand may be well known as the setting for the Lord of the Rings movies. But its currency has been the recent scene-stealer, strengthening to a near 20-month high against the U.S. dollar.

In the past month, the kiwi is up about 3% against the greenback. Anticipation of an interest-rate increase is part of the reason. Earlier this month, a central bank official said rising house prices might lead to a monetary-policy response. The official cash rate stands at 2.5%, where it has been since March 2011. Central bank officials meet this week.

New Zealand is also about to see a wave of significant share sales -- including the privatization of three state-owned utilities -- that could raise as much as seven billion New Zealand dollars ($5.89 billion). Some foreign investors may have been buying the kiwi ahead of the listings.

But there is another reason for the currency's strength. New Zealand is on the verge of being included in Citigroup's World Government Bond Index, having crossed the threshold for market size in outstanding government-bond issuance earlier this month. A NZ$2 billion bond took the eligible outstanding bond issuance to almost NZ$63 billion -- above a US$50 billion threshold.

Inclusion in the index should boost the investor base for kiwi debt, with portfolio managers adjusting their weightings to send more funds down under. The problem, though, is that some investors may be trying to get in ahead of the word from Citigroup. That could mean there is little upside left on the table once the kiwi is officially part of the index.

Royal Bank of Canada estimates that 50% to 60% of kiwi bond inflows related to potential portfolio adjustments have already occurred. In two other recent cases, the currencies of South Africa and Mexico strengthened ahead of inclusion in the index and for a short while after, but that was followed by significant underperformance, RBC notes.

Ahead last week's Group of 20 gathering in Washington, International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director Min Zhu said the kiwi is about 10% overvalued. The currency actually fell almost 1% last week. This kiwi may already have flown too high.

Overheard

There is no way of falling off a cycle gracefully, but that won't stop Wall Street from trying.

The past week or so has brought a clutch of reports from analysts signaling the end is nigh for the so-called commodities supercycle, with at least two on Friday alone. It comes amid a selloff in hard assets of all descriptions, with gold's slide most prominent.

Given efforts the past decade to promote commodities as an investment for the masses, via such novelties as metal-backed exchange traded funds, don't expect a quick funeral.

Citigroup, which has been calling a turn in oil markets, released a report called "From Commodities Supercycle to Unicycles."

Barclays followed with a tome on commodities subtitled "From an age of shortage to an era of enough?" The key theme there is that investment in new capacity is finally leading to more supply, loosening markets and prices. But Deutsche Bank stuck closest to the true spirit of the Street with its report: "Trading the Commodity Underperformance Cycle."

The cycle is dead; long live the cycle!

What's the most valuable thing Washington could do for investors in funds and ETFs? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323869604578370350748580878.html" that discussed ways Washington officials could benefit individuals buying mutual funds and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Thursday, April 11.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts online at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html?mg=inert-wsj"

Also "http://on.wsj.com/14CDLEj" three of The Experts Christian Magoon ( "https://twitter.com/ChristianMagoon") of Magoon Capital, Rick Ferri ( "https://twitter.com/Rick_Ferri") of Portfolio Solutions and Matt Hougan ( "https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") of IndexUniverse speak about investing in index funds and ETFs in a live video filmed on Monday, April 8.

John Rogers : Roll Out the Rest of Dodd-Frank

Washington needs to implement the important investor-protection agenda contained in the Dodd-Frank Act since, so far, only one-third of the Act has been rolled out. All advisers, brokers and insurance agents who provide personalized investment advice must be held to a duty of loyalty, prudence and care for their clients. This is not the case today, and most investors don't realize it. Most people own mutual funds or ETFs in accounts advised or managed by a financial intermediary. The choice of which fund to use should be based solely on your needs, not on those of anyone else.

John Rogers is the president and chief executive of the CFA Institute.

Tom Brakke: Tax Simplification Would Help

I suppose if I had to pick one thing, it would be tax simplification (and not just for the parts of the code related to investments).

Some other thoughts regarding what "Washington could do":

It depends on which funds or ETFs you own as to which specific policy changes would do you the most good.

The Federal Reserve has been punishing savers in favor of speculative activity. The "most valuable thing" may already have been done on behalf of those in risk assets.

When it comes to legislative and regulatory proposals, investors should not assume that their best interests will be represented by investment firms any more than the buyers of food should assume that their best interests will be represented by food companies.

Tom Brakke ( "https://twitter.com/researchpuzzler") is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

Rick Ferri: Don't Impose a Financial Transaction Tax

It's not what Washington could do; it's what they shouldn't do. Washington shouldn't impose a financial transaction tax (FTT) on the purchase and sale of securities, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The proposed tax between 0.03% and 0.5% would be applied to the market value of the securities in a transaction. This tax would harm individual investors who are saving money in mutual funds and ETFs to meet retirement, education and other financial goals.

Rick Ferri is founder of "http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/" LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is "http://www.rickferri.com/blog/".

Charles Rotblut : Put Institutional and Individual Investors on the Same Footing

If I were to ask members of the American Association of Individual Investors what Washington politicians could do for them, the majority would say fix the budget problem, get serious about paying down the debt and do something about the economy. Regulatory issues involving mutual funds and ETFs would be far down their list of priorities.

Regulators do need to ensure the playing field between institutional and individual investors is level, however. Products and providers need to be overseen and mischief needs to be punished. Expenses should be kept in line as well.

Though I do favor more disclosure than less, it is possible to overwhelm individuals with too much detail. Efforts to make prospectuses clearer with important information about fees, rates of returns, investment objectives and strategies are always welcome.

Charles Rotblut ( "https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors .

Scott Adams: Stop Giving Money to Strangers

This might be a trick question but I'm going to go with the obvious answer: I think investors would like Washington to stop taking their money and giving it to strangers.

Scott Adams is the creator of the Dilbert comic strip that appears in thousands of newspapers world-wide and "http://www.dilbert.com/".

Sheryl Garrett : Make Advisers Put Their Clients' Interests First

Fully empower the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement and enforce "http://www.thefiduciarystandard.org/" for all those who render professional investment advice to retail investors! If all financial advisers are required by law to put their clients' interests ahead of their own always that would be the most valuable thing Washington could do for investors.

I recognize that many investors do not work through financial advisers; however, the financial advisory industry has a significant impact on workplace investment options, as well as personal decisions and investments that people make every day. Changing the culture and regulatory structure to mandate that the investor's interests must always come first, and the adviser is the party responsible for proving they did right by the client, would drastically improve investors' comfort in the markets, with investing and with advisers.

Sheryl Garrett ( "https://twitter.com/SherylGarrett") is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Frank Holmes: Thoughtful and Moderate Referees

I often compare government regulation to referees at sporting events. All sports require officials to make sure the participants play by the rules. Fans love watching March Madness, the World Series and the Super Bowl, as they trust they are following a fair competition. Imagine these sports with more complicated rules, more referees than players and a controlled outcome.

Washington has good intentions, as regulators are watching out for the investor. However, excess and complicated regulation can dilute the efforts of innovators and game-changers, which can lead to lower profitability and fewer jobs created.

Americans need thoughtful and moderate regulation so that initiative and achievement is appreciated, companies are competitive and investing is fair and rewarded.

Frank Holmes is chief executive and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors Inc .

Greg McBride : Allow Deferral of Taxes on Reinvested Dividends

Given the federal deficits and the hot-button issue of taxes, it'll likely never happen, but providing investors the option of deferring taxes on reinvested dividends and capital gains in a taxable account would encourage more capital investment and avoid taxes on phantom income.

Greg McBride ( "https://twitter.com/BankrateGreg") is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

Matt Hougan: Enforce a Fiduciary Duty

First, force brokers to have a fiduciary duty to their clients. The market is going that way anyway, and (by definition) it would be what's best for investors. Finances are too important to do any other way.

Second, require the clear disclosure of fees. We're making progress in the 401(k) space, but sterling clarity should be the goal across all financial products and services.

Matt Hougan ( "https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

George Papadopoulos: Adopt the Fiduciary Standard and Get Rid of the Alphabet Soup

I think the SEC should adopt the fiduciary standard of care for all persons dispensing financial advice, who must place their clients' best interests above their own at all times. The current suitability standard is not strong enough because it allows advisers to recommend what is "suitable" for an investor. Just yesterday I met with a prospect whose adviser had sold him several variable annuities, all stuffed in his Individual Retirement Account. It made my blood pressure reach a dangerously high level! If the adviser had been a fiduciary he or she would have thought twice about making such an awful recommendation.

If the SEC does not do the right thing, I could settle with reform to the overly confusing world of retirement plans. The alphabet soup has reached absurd levels. These are just some: 401(k), Individual 401(k), Roth 401(k), 403(b), 457, SARSEP, Regular IRA, Rollover IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, Simple IRA, Keogh, Money Purchase, Profit Sharing, Defined Benefit Plan and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (Education IRAs). There is a lot of room available to consolidate these accounts. At the very least, we should stop coming up with new ones to add to the mix!

George Papadopoulos ( "https://twitter.com/feeonlyplanner") is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich., serving affluent individuals and families.

Eleanor Blayney : Ensure Investors Are Protected

First of all, bipartisan action and commitment to getting our fiscal house in order in a fair, balanced way would send an important message to businesses and markets that would be positive for investors. Corporations, in particular, are holding huge amounts of cash as a result of the continuing (and tiresome) uncertainty created by congressional gridlock. Getting this cash working in capital projects and more hires would increase overall economic growth, and thus rates of investment returns.

Second, we support extending the fiduciary standard (which SEC-registered investment advisers have to follow) to broker-dealers who provide retail investment advice. This standard would improve consumer trust and confidence in financial professionals and markets. More confidence and better advice equals better investment results.

In fact, research done by CFP Board (as part of the Financial Planning Coalition) found that 93% of respondents said that they agree with the statement that financial advisers providing advice "should put your interests ahead of theirs and should have to tell you upfront about any conflicts of interest that potentially could influence that advice."

Eighty percent of American investors do not believe the federal government is doing enough to protect "consumers from being taken advantage of" by financial advisers. Also, the survey found that 84% of American investors agree that "financial advisers should be regulated by the federal government to protect investors and build confidence in financial services." In other words, American investors want to ensure they are protected.

Eleanor Blayney ( "https://twitter.com/EleanorBlayney") is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards .

Michelle Perry Higgins: Stay Out of the Way

While I'm sure that many of the changes they make are well intentioned, some of them are actually harmful to the market and to investors. In my opinion, the best thing they could do is to stay out of the way. Every new law should be examined in the clear light of day to assess its short- and long-term consequences. Similar to the tax code, each adjustment they make produces a corresponding change in behavior. They should also provide some incentives for job creators instead of punishing their success. For example, every time Washington bureaucrats decide to increase the capital-gains and dividend tax rate, they take money out of investors' pockets, and that is definitely not a good thing. I think lawmakers should cut the long-term capital-gains tax rate and dividends back to 15% for top-bracket taxpayers.

Michelle Perry Higgins ( "https://twitter.com/RetirementMPH") is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

Larry Zimpleman : Give Investors Greater Certainty

The word that comes to mind is "certainty." Provide some certainty around tax policy and a longer-term path toward a much more balanced budget that also gets the size of the outstanding federal debt to a reasonable level in relation to gross domestic product (GDP). We must get away from a legislative environment that causes us to lurch from crisis to crisis, keeping markets and investors on the edge of their seats. Businesses, individuals and investment markets can only make good decisions when there is certainty over the longer term about how the economy will perform and what the level of interest rates will be. We all hope we might get back to that environment soon.

The Experts: When Does Active Management Make Sense?

Under what circumstances should somebody use active money managers as opposed to index funds? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323869604578368643942370104.html" on a new generation of investments that aren't nearly as passive or as cheap as readers might think and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Monday, April 8.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts online at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html?mg=inert-wsj"

Also "http://on.wsj.com/14CDLEj" three of The Experts Christian Magoon ("https://twitter.com/ChristianMagoon") of Magoon Capital, Rick Ferri ("https://twitter.com/Rick_Ferri") of Portfolio Solutions and Matt Hougan ("https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") of IndexUniverse speak about investing in index funds and ETFs in a video chat.

Christian Magoon: Here Are Two Scenarios Favoring Active Managers

Active managers often have an edge in two scenarios. The first occurs in markets that aren't efficient. In general, traditional index funds need certain ingredients in underlying markets in order to best function. These ingredients include minimum levels of liquidity, market capitalization and cost efficiency. When those elements are not ideal, active management is a better choice because it is more flexible when dealing with inefficiencies. Why? Active managers aren't bound by the predetermined set of rules that traditional indexes follow. Thus market segments, including less-liquid fixed-income sectors and certain emerging equity markets, are often attractive candidates for active management.

The second area where active managers can be preferable is when implementing investment strategies that are complex or fast moving. These strategies are difficult to index due to the many contextual variables that can arise. In comparison, active managers are ideally able to make investment decisions quickly and based off countless variables. In comparison, contextualization and speed are not easy elements to "program" into index development.

Christian Magoon ("https://twitter.com/ChristianMagoon"), chief executive of Magoon Capital, provides strategic advice to potential and existing ETF sponsors in areas of product development, marketing and distribution.

George Papadopoulos: In the Long Term, Never

If we are talking about investing over the long term, never! If we are talking about short-term trading, perhaps you can try to identify an active money manager and hope to get lucky. If you go that route, you should try to pick an active fund with lower-than-average investment costs. You can't control investment performance, but you can control investment costs.

George Papadopoulos ("https://twitter.com/feeonlyplanner") is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich., serving affluent individuals and families.

Larry Zimpleman: Remember It Takes Expert Knowledge to Pick the Right Index Fund, Too

In general, 75% to 80% of the population does not consider themselves investment "experts." While it might sound appropriate to ask if they should use index funds, the reality for this group is that using index funds assumes a person has enough investment expertise to be able to determine which index funds are appropriate for them, and what their overall asset allocation should look like.

The majority of the investing public really isn't in a position to answer that question. The best option for this group is: a) find an investment adviser that you're comfortable with or b) consider the use of "life cycle" funds (either risk-based or time-based) as a way to adopt a multi-asset-class portfolio that provides good diversification and adjusts the portfolio over time as horizons change.

If you consider yourself an investment expert, then the question of index funds vs. managed funds is more appropriate. But, again, this assumes you know what overall asset-allocation approach you want to use. In considering the use of active funds, be sure to look at the investment track record over an entire market cycle not just for one or three years. Also, make sure the size of the fund is stable or growing and that the portfolio managers have been with the fund over that entire time.

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group.

Charles Rotblut: An Argument for Both Active and Index

Though some of my fellow expert panelists may disagree with me, I think there is an argument to be made for combining both active and index funds.

Index funds work best when seeking broad exposure to stocks, particularly large-cap stocks. Given the low cost and the high propensity for active managers to underperform, start with index funds.

A good active manager, however, can take advantage of market anomalies such as value, size or liquidity. Sequoia (SEQUX), which I personally own, is a good example. A manager who adheres to a rational asset-allocation strategy over the long term can also be beneficial. The Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) and Vanguard Wellington (VWELX) are examples. In AAII's Model Fund portfolio, we combine actively managed mutual funds with index-tracking ETFs to profit from the advantages of both.

The big questions to ask are, what is the active manager bringing to the table, and is his strategy replicable year after year? A strategy that merely involves the manager selecting stocks he thinks are attractive isn't going to help investors. The approach has to exploit market anomalies or otherwise be truly unique, and there has to be long-term performance good enough to justify the higher expenses and risks associated with active management.

If you don't see consistently good long-term performance, stick with index. Considering that the average fund investor doesn't even match the returns of the funds they invest in, simply focusing on mimicking the performance of the broad indexes can offer a huge improvement in portfolio returns.

Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

Scott Adams: It's a Perfect Strategy for My Enemies

I can think of many cases in which I would recommend active money managers over index funds. For example, I might be giving the advice to someone I hate or and this happens a lot someone I expect to hate later. I would also recommend active money managers if I were accepting bribes to do so, if I were an active money manager myself, or if it were April Fools' Day. And let's also consider the possibility that I might be drunk, stupid or forced to say things at gunpoint. I've also heard good things about a German emotion called schadenfreude, so that could be a factor too.

Scott Adams is the creator of the "Dilbert" comic strip that appears in thousands of newspapers world-wide and "http://www.dilbert.com/".

Frank Holmes: Use an Active Manager for Specialized Equity Markets

I believe a portion of an investor's diversified portfolio should hold actively managed funds, especially for specialized equity markets that require specialized knowledge and expertise, as the pricing tends to be inefficient. These areas include emerging markets, small-cap stocks and companies involved in resources and metals mining. The key is in selecting an active manager who has extensive experience investing in these markets, as they understand the seasonal and historical patterns that help them navigate these complex areas.

Frank Holmes is chief executive and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors Inc.

Sheryl Garrett: Hope Says Active, Reason Says Passive

Although I follow the passive school of investment philosophy for most circumstances, there are times when active management has its place. Unfortunately, I don't know exactly when or if that place will occur. If buying the market is good, wouldn't it be even better to have a group of trained professional sort through and screen out the weakest companies/stocks or issuers/bonds and so on? Optimistic reasoning would tell us yes, but the academic evidence says otherwise.

Some of us don't want to settle for just what the market will bear, but rather hope that human beings (active money managers) have an ability to help mitigate risk and receive a higher return per unit of their risk taken in the less efficient segments of the investment marketplace, such as high-yield municipal bonds, international bonds, small-cap foreign equities and so on. I acknowledge that is wishful thinking and that there have only been a few dozen people in the history of the modern capital markets that really do add Alpha consistently and over time. If we can only find the next Alpha managers! Meanwhile, take a load off and go passive.

Sheryl Garrett ("https://twitter.com/SherylGarrett") is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Eleanor Blayney: Some Reasons for Active Managers (but Not Many)

If the person I was counseling was herself an active manager, I would definitely advise her to invest in her own fund: It sends a good message to other investors of her conviction and confidence in what she is doing!

For the most part, however, index funds trump actively managed funds when it comes to low information costs (you know what you are getting), low expenses and competitive returns over the long run. A case for active funds might be made for investments in areas that require highly specialized knowledge or expertise, such as a merger-and-acquisition fund or a fund focused on a very narrow segment of the market. Another possible argument for active funds: In a bear market, active managers can react defensively or opportunistically, whereas indexes must stay fully invested in their benchmarks.

Eleanor Blayney ("https://twitter.com/EleanorBlayney") is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards.

Rick Ferri: High-Yield Corporate Bonds Are Better Suited for Active Management

Certain asset classes are better suited for active management than indexing. High-yield corporate bonds are a good example. An unrestrained high-yield bond index includes all bonds outstanding and weighs each security based on the amount issued by a company. This type of index would create problems for investors.

Before General Motors went bankrupt, their bonds were the largest segment of the high-yield bond market. GM paper dwarfed all other issuers. An investor wouldn't have wanted to own an index fund of high-yield bonds when the company went under because they would have lost a bundle.

To reduce single-issuer risk, high-yield-bond-index providers created constrained indexes. The methodology held each company to a few percentage points of an index. It was a managed solution.

The second problem with high yield is liquidity. Many high-yield bonds trade infrequently, and that makes it impossible for an index-fund manager to track the index. To solve this issue, index providers added security screens to eliminate low-volume bonds. It was another managed solution.

There is nothing wrong with using an ETF or index fund that tracks a managed index, except that these products tend to hold fewer bonds and have higher expenses than some actively managed funds. The Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Admiral Shares (VWEAX) holds more bonds and has lower expenses than any high-yield index fund or ETF. In my view, this makes VWEAX a better index fund than existing index funds and ETFs.

Greg McBride: Small-Cap Stocks and Emerging Markets Present Opportunities for Good Active Managers

While I am a big proponent of index investing, investors can increase their odds of adding incremental return to their portfolios by seeking active managers that have a strong track record and consistent investment philosophy, particularly small-cap stocks and emerging markets.

Greg McBride ("https://twitter.com/BankrateGreg") is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

Matt Hougan: Active Management Might Work In Bonds

All of the data suggest that this is a terrible idea in nearly every corner of the market. We like to think that managers can have an edge in undiscovered corners of the market small-cap emerging markets, illiquid credit but the data suggest otherwise. Most active managers lose over the long haul, and it's impossible to find the ones that will outperform in advance. Anyone who debates this with you in the equity space is &confused.

In bonds, it's different. Broad-based bond indexes are so overloaded in U.S. government debt right now, and that debt is yielding so little and subject to so much interest-rate risk, that I worry about investors who "own the market" in the bond space. Even John Bogle, the father of index investing, has said that just buying the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index is not such a good idea these days.

I think considering the services of successful fixed-income managers like Bill Gross or Jeff Gundlach is a legit idea. They've shown the ability to navigate tricky waters and have established remarkable long-term track records. Thanks to their size, they also have a real advantage when it comes to accessing liquidity in the bond market.

Will it work out? I have no idea. But if you can get it for low costs BOND costs 0.55% a year, for instance it's a reasonable idea. (Run away screaming from anyone who wants to charge you 1% for investing.)

Tom Brakke: Three Points to Consider When Pursuing an Active Strategy

Passive strategies like index funds should be the default approach for most people. They are cheaper, easier and have had better results over time than active managers.

Selecting active managers is difficult, and many of those who would give you advice on which manager to select base that advice primarily on past performance, which isn't a good predictor of future performance. (Those in the business of making the recommendations might say they do much more than that, but ask yourself this: When was the last time they proposed buying a fund with subpar recent performance or selling one that's been very good?)

Which is not to say that active strategies should never have a place in your portfolio. If you use them, do so carefully:

1) Choose managers that are truly active, not the "closet indexers" that are prevalent in the business. (Hint: You should want more "tracking error," not less.)

2) Focus on the least efficient parts of the market, where active managers have the best opportunity to outperform.

3) Discount the narrative you hear about the manager from those recommending the investment and seek out information from other sources.

Active managers offer the possibility of outperformance, while often delivering the reality of underperformance. If you really want to "outperform" your neighbor, save more than they do. It's as close as you'll ever come to a sure thing.

Michelle Perry Higgins: Active Mangers Can Help You Navigate Lesser-Followed Areas

Although certainly not in the majority, there are several actively managed funds available to investors that have done an outstanding job of outperforming their benchmarks over time. The idea of an investor using funds like this in combination with some core index funds makes great sense. However, with so many funds in the universe today (per Morningstar, 29,432 as of Feb. 28, 2013), it takes a lot of time and effort to screen and identify funds that have past records of exceeding target levels. Even with appropriate due diligence, investors still have to keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results. If I had one suggestion to offer the individual who was going to wade into this pool, it would probably be that they may have more success with active managed funds by going to lesser-followed areas such as small-cap stocks, emerging markets or even the high-yield bonds. In these sectors, there are more opportunities for a skilled manager to find undervalued opportunities as compared to a typical large-cap-fund manager.

Rick Ferri to Frank Holmes and Greg McBride: The Myth of Inefficient Markets

Rick Ferri is responding to "http://on.wsj.com/12AS3kQ" by Frank Holmes and "http://on.wsj.com/12BjF9u" by Greg McBride.

Frank Holmes and Greg McBride advocated investing in actively managed funds that specialize in part of the equity markets that they believe require specialized knowledge and expertise. Their theory is that small-cap and emerging markets are inefficient and that active managers outperform indexing.

This theory doesn't pan out in the numbers. According to a newly compiled study by researchers at Vanguard, a significant majority of actively managed funds in so-called inefficient sectors such small-cap stocks and emerging markets have not delivered on the promise of outperformance, particularly after accounting for the large number of poor-performing funds that closed or merged over the years.

It's a myth that actively managed equity funds have a leg up in markets perceived as inefficient. Low-cost market-matching index funds outperform a majority of active managers in every style and sector and across every continent in the long run.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - HOUSE & HOME
Property of the state

On both sides of the Atlantic, governments that shy away from 'socialist' policies are propping up national housing markets. Jim Pickard asks what impact this has on prices and what happens when the support stops

Socialism is a dirty word in many parts of the US. After all, America is a global symbol of free markets, muscular capitalism and the small state. Yet somehow the government has turned its mortgage market into a giant nationalised enterprise on a par with China's Red Army or Britain's National Health Service.

US mortgage finance vehicle Fannie Mae, created by Franklin D Roosevelt to drag the US out of the Great Depression, underwrote around one in five mortgages during the 1940s. It was seen as the archetype of Keynesian intervention. Yet Roosevelt's efforts have been eclipsed by those made by 21st-century governments around the world to pull their economies out of the post-credit crunch tailspin.

Today, in the US, almost nine out of 10 mortgages issued in the US are subsidised by the state through a bewildering array of state-sponsored groups. They include Freddie Mac, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks and Fannie itself. Housing, in other words, has become an arm of the state.

One of these groups, the Federal Housing Administration, is so integral to the market that without it prices could have fallen a further 25 per cent, according to Moody'sAnalytics.

And at the same time the Federal Reserve is soaking up some $40bn of mortgage debt a month - through "quantitative easing" - with more than one eye on the housing market.

It is hard to dispute that if you own a residential property in any of the 50 states its value is being held up by the whim of politicians and central bankers.

"The US doesn't use the term socialist very much to describe policies like this, they use words like "progressive" or "redistribution", says Edward Pinto, fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, a free market think-tank. "I recently spoke at a conference in New York where the Europeans were staggered by the extent of government involvement in our mortgage market."

This new status quo is not entirely the result of conscious decisions by the political classes. Washington was forced to prop up real estate when it realised it was so closely entwined with financial markets and their "too big to fail" banks that letting either collapse would be disastrous.

Bear in mind that it was George W Bush, a Republican president, who nationalised Fannie and Freddie in the heat of the crisis in September 2008 - not his more leftwing successor.

But attempts to send the two mortgage underwriters back into the private sector have withered on the vine.

"There was momentum before the election but that has completely evaporated," says Gary Painter, director of research and of graduate programmes in public policy at the Lusk Centre for Real Estate at the University of Southern California. "Now the new political focus is almost entirely on austerity instead."

Meanwhile the Obama administration exhorts private lenders to relax their lending criteria for borrowers.

Across the Atlantic, the tentacles of the state have also become entwined with the housing market, albeit in different ways. The British government would not set Soviet-style targets for tractor production or widget manufacturing. Housing is a different matter.

The central interest rate has been slashed to close to zero. Tens of thousands are buying homes arm-in-arm with the state under "shared equity schemes". Most strikingly, one in three mortgages taken out in the UK are through two government-controlled banks.

Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland remain in majority state ownership with little sign of progress on a mooted sell-off. Lloyds had 26.7 per cent of the mortgage market last year; RBS had 7.5 per cent.

This is reminiscent of supposedly communist China, where most banks are majority-owned by the state with small public floats.

Andrew Jakabovics, senior director of research at Enterprise Community Partners, a US group, says Westminster is as involved in housing as Washington.

"It's a matter of what you count as involvement in the property market," he argues. "The British intervention was directly into the banks themselves . . . we rescued the secondary mortgage market. That's qualitatively different but not quantitatively different."

Under last year's new initiative, the Bank of England has pumped more than 14bn into a scheme called "Funding for Lending" aimed at forcing down the price of business loans and mortgages.

March 2013 saw the gradual nationalisation move up a gear as chancellor George Osborne earmarked billions more for shared equity programmes and - most controversially - paved the way for Britain's own Freddie/Fannie system of mortgage guarantees.

In theory his move is meant to be temporary. But then so was the "short-term" rescue of Fannie and Freddie five years ago.

The house price crash was certainly spectacular. American homes have lost 35 per cent of their value on average. Irish homes fell by a third. How much worse would it have been without government intervention? "That is the million-dollar question," says Martin Ellis, head of market research at Lloyds, which owns Halifax.

Yet the British market has recovered fast - much faster than the US. The average home last year sold at 246,000, up 10 per cent on five years earlier, according to the government's Office of National Statistics.

That average disguises the mismatch between regions. House prices have powered ahead in London - but in Northern Ireland they are still down by a half from their crazy peak.

Ed Stansfield, an economist at Capital Economics in London - one of the few to predict the housing crash - says there is still a major mismatch between people's income and house prices: "We still have a market where pricing is not at a rational level."

Perhaps the interventions by the government have been, well, too successful?

Voters who own their homes are as asset-rich as they were before and many are making lower mortgage payments. But with lenders loathe to lend as generously as before the crash, young adults who lack sufficient savings remain locked out of the market. The average age of a first-time buyer has risen by eight years since the 1960s to 35, according to Post Office Mortgages. The ratio between house prices and earnings in Britain has barely changed since 2007.

One of my colleagues, Carly Ince, a 30-year-old editorial assistant, is an exemplar. She wants to buy her own flat in Tower Hamlets, a far-from-glamorous borough of east London where she grew up. Even there a basic former council flat in Bow is on the market for 220,000 - seven times the average London wage.

"When my parents first came to the area, both aged 22, they got a flat in east London and the rent was only 9 a month," she says. "People could afford their own home back then. Now you have no chance unless your parents help you or you inherit."

Critics say the UK government's new 130bn mortgage guarantee scheme is more likely to drive up prices than to increase housing supply, re-inflating a damaging bubble.

"Is it just going to drive up house prices? By and large, in the short-run, the answer is, yes," said Stephen Nickell, an official from the Office for Budgetary Responsibility. Alistair Darling, former Labour chancellor, says the move could create a new "housing bubble", replicating the sub-prime crisis in the US.

The question goes to the heart of the dilemma faced by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. How can they avoid another crash if and when they withdraw support from the market? Some experts speculate on a route out for governments, albeit over a long period.

"Nobody is talking about the government going cold turkey," says Pinto. "You would have to phase it out over, say, five to seven years to give the market a chance to normalise."

Roger Harding, head of policy at Shelter, a British charity for the homeless, says the ideal scenario would be for nominal prices to stay stable, allowing real-terms house prices to gradually become more affordable. At the same time ministers should address the issue of low supply, with housebuilding at a historic low; if they can break entrenched local resistance to development.

Harding says governments should use their armlock over mortgage lending to get homes built: "Otherwise we are going to repeat the mistakes of the past."

The model, he argues, could be the 1950s, when housing minister Harold Macmillan oversaw the building of more than 300,000 new homes a year, mostly through local authorities.

"But politicians will struggle to square the circle. It seems likely they will remain chained to policies that prop up the housing market, even as they keep paying lip service to first-time buyers who they cannot help en masse at the same time.

"It's broadly accepted nowadays that China still lives under the banner of 'communism' despite capitalist markets playing an increasing role in society. In Britain and America - at least where the housing market is concerned - the reverse process seems to be taking place."

Apple Struggles in China

Despite its seeming invincibility, even Apple may struggle to climb the Great Firewall of China. China is Apple's main growth market. In the quarter ended in December, China accounted for 13% of Apple's revenue, and CEO Tim Cook has said he expects it will become Apple's largest market. Shareholders anxiously await a deal with China Mobile, the world's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, to officially carry the iPhone.

Yet a string of criticisms and proposed regulatory curbs suggest Apple's trajectory in China may deviate from the cosmic course many expect. The latest came in Wednesday's edition of the People's Daily. An article included Apple in a list of websites and app stores that have been investigated for providing pornographic content in China. This comes a month after Apple was attacked by China Central Television over its iPhone warranties, prompting an apology from Mr. Cook.

Then there is a proposed law that could give the Chinese government more control over apps and put new standards in place that may force companies to help the government track users. Why does Apple suddenly find itself in the cross hairs? The proposed law suggests the Chinese government is wary of the growing power of a company whose smartphone "ecosystem" Beijing doesn't control.

This would fit a pattern. Facebook is a "walled garden" of content that is blocked to Chinese Web surfers entirely. Twitter is, too. And then there is Google which, in effect, kicked itself out of China's mainland search market after refusing censorship demands.

Ironically, Google's Android mobile operating system dominates the smartphone market in China, despite the company's strained relationship with the government. But those devices don't come with Google services that are standard elsewhere, such as YouTube, search, and Google Maps. Also, without access to the Google Play store, Chinese users have a weaker selection of apps to choose from.

Apple is famous for the control it exerts over so many aspects of its devices, including the apps available to users. This is a big part of the iPhone's appeal: Apps just work and are largely free of bugs or malicious code. Mr. Cook will be in a tough spot if, for instance, Beijing requires Apple to alter its services in a way that lends itself more easily to government control.

Not that China is exclusively focused on Apple. A Chinese government research institute said in March that the country is too reliant on Android and that local manufacturers should have more control over it. One issue Beijing must deal with, though, is that iPhones and Android devices are popular for a reason. And Chinese consumers will grow more attached to them over time, especially as there are few good alternatives today. Curbing Chinese consumers' access to such technology would likely cause grumbling, something the government has historically been keen to avoid.

Still, any adversity for Apple and Google in China could spell opportunity for local smartphone makers such as Lenovo and Huawei Technologies. Together, these two had about 26% of China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2012, estimates Strategy Analytics.

Foreigners Samsung and Apple had 16% and 10%, respectively. Hewlett-Packard offers a cautionary tale here. Its share of China's personal-computer market collapsed after it came under fire from state media in 2010 over product quality. Lenovo's market share increased sharply.

Apple's reputation, and huge valuation, rests on its ability to create new markets that it then dominates. China won't necessarily fit that model.

Diageo Drinks

To U.S. Health

Diageo PLC should be grateful Americans haven't lost their thirst for hard liquor. The U.K. spirits giant said European and some emerging-market sales were weak in the first three months of the year. But North America, which generates nearly 40% of Diageo's operating profit, delivered a roughly 7% rise in organic sales last quarter.

Still, how much more can Diageo squeeze out of the U.S. drinker? Much of the recent revenue growth is the result of a series of price increases implemented since last May, which have continued to boost sales. The anniversary of those increases in just a few weeks will raise the question of whether more will be needed to boost revenue growth.

True, wealthy drinkers won't blink at a couple of extra bucks for a bottle of Diageo's top-tier brands like Don Julio tequila and premium varieties of Johnnie Walker whiskey. But Diageo sells far greater volumes of standard brands that could be tougher to mark up: Smirnoff vodka and Captain Morgan rum were its top two sellers by volume in North America by a long shot last year, estimates International Wine & Spirit Research.

Besides, many Americans have thinner wallets this year, thanks to a payroll-tax increase imposed in January and delays in income-tax refunds. Brown-Forman, which makes Jack Daniel's whiskey, recently questioned whether consumers will accept price increases as willingly as they did prerecession; consumers may be flexible with aged spirits, but price increases on un-aged liquors like vodka are "more difficult," it said.

Another risk: While Diageo hasn't commented on future price increases, it is rational for retailers to expect another round. That could have led some retailers to buy extra stocks in advance, temporarily boosting Diageo's revenue.

Diageo shares have risen 26% in the past year and trade at 19.3 times consensus earnings for the year through June, well above its five-year average of 15.3 times in the past five years. The group still has plenty of growth potential, but investors who buy now may regret it in the morning.

Raising Dutch Austerity Stakes

When even the deficit hawks take a breather from austerity, you know things are tough. And in the Netherlands, things look very tough indeed.

Dutch unemployment climbed in March to 8.1%, from 7.7% in February and 7.2% just three months ago. True, the latest jump was more due to a rise in the labor force than outright job losses, which were low. But the jobless number is just one in a string that show an economy in trouble, hamstrung by its high levels of personal debt and exposure to euro-zone trade. Dutch gross domestic product contracted 1% last year. Corporate bankruptcies are at a record. Real disposable income dropped 3.2% in 2012, the fifth consecutive annual fall and the biggest on record. House prices have fallen 18% from their August 2008 high, and as of 2011, 25% of mortgages were underwater. In February, the Netherlands had to nationalize SNS Reaal, the country's fourth-largest banking group.

As a result, the Dutch government is struggling to reduce its budget deficit to 3% of GDP. In 2012, it stood at 4.1%; in March, the government conceded it wouldn't get to 3% this year. It has identified 4.3 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of new measures to hit the target in 2014, but last week Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he would wait until September to decide whether austerity is needed. That smacks partly of desperation: The economy seems unlikely to turn around enough that the cuts will be reduced by any significant amount. But it also recognizes that Dutch consumers and businesses have been battered.

The dismal economy and the softening of austerity may present some political complications for Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem in his role as head of the Eurogroup, hammering out bailout terms for other countries. But they seem unlikely to cause a deepening of the crisis. Ten-year Dutch bond yields, at 1.44%, are only 0.2 percentage point higher than Germany's. The Netherlands may even benefit, like France, from quantitative-easing flows from Japan. In January, Japanese investors bought 6.2 billion euros of Dutch bonds, a record, according to UBS.

The debate about austerity will rage on. But the battle lines have been drawn in the euro-zone bond market, and the Netherlands is on the fortunate side of them.

Jupiter

Grapples

With New

Universe

Charging customers for something they assumed came free is a recipe for upheaval. Jupiter Fund Management blames new U.K. rules that force intermediaries to charge upfront fees rather than bundle commissions into product charges for sluggish inflows into its funds this year. Net flows into Jupiter's mutual funds of GBP 247 million ($376 million) in the first quarter were down 50% from last year's final quarter. The company believes the hiatus will be short term. But that may be too optimistic.

The ranks of U.K. advisers are likely to thin by up to a fifth, estimates Deloitte. Some cost-conscious customers are taking investment into their own hands: Hargreaves Lansdown, whose platform offers savings products directly to consumers, had record inflows in the first quarter. But the money should still find its way to fund managers; Jupiter is the best represented company in Hargreaves Lansdown's ranking of its top 150 funds. Fund managers could also develop their own consumer platforms, cutting out the middlemen.

The snag is that greater transparency is ultimately likely to lead to more pressure on fund-management fees. Much of the industry has got away with charging top-drawer fees for substandard returns, so a shake-up is overdue. Separating advisers' remuneration from product choice may mean greater allocation to passive funds, which charge about 0.2%, rather than active managers, charging closer to 0.75%.

Already, Investec Asset Management has waived initial fees for its U.K. fund range. Lower-cost active funds of the type offered by Schroders or J.P. Morgan are trying to woo money away from index-followers but risk cannibalizing more upmarket business.

The Property Report
Tax Plan May Provide Boost --- In Obama's Budget, a Spur for Foreign Pension Funds to Invest in U.S. Property

By Sarah Krouse

Despite the austerity mood in Washington, President Obama's proposed budget would provide tax relief to some foreign investors, a move the U.S. real-estate industry has been seeking for years.

As part of a larger push to spur private investment in U.S. infrastructure, Mr. Obama has proposed changes to a 1980s tax policy called the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, or Firpta, that would exempt foreign pension funds from paying taxes on gains from real-estate sales.

The proposal is still subject to congressional approval, which will likely prove tricky in the current budget-cutting climate. It also doesn't go as far as the real-estate industry would like because the proposed exemption would only apply to overseas pension funds, not all foreign investors.

But this is the first time Mr. Obama has included a Firpta change in a budget. If the change is approved, it likely would lead to an increase in U.S. investments by foreign pension funds.

"For a pension investor who is looking around the world thinking, 'I want a global portfolio,' quite often the Firpta has stopped them filling in that North American piece," said Paul Richards, head of European property at consulting firm Mercer.

The proposed exemption would cost $2.2 billion over the next 10 years, according to the 2014 budget, and is part of a larger package of incentives for infrastructure investment.

Firpta had led a number of investors to change their strategies to investing in real-estate debt in the U.S. rather than equity, said Ben Sanderson of Hermes Real Estate Investment Management Ltd., which manages money for pension funds. "It's not a barrier that makes it entirely impossible to invest, but [investing in the U.S. would be] more attractive if it was reformed," he said.

Firpta taxes gains from foreign sales of assets including buildings, land, mines and timber, as well as stock in real-estate companies. While foreign investors consider it onerous, many still invest in the U.S. because of its clear legal system and a transparent property market, where price and performance data is easy to obtain.

However, foreign pension-fund investments accounted for just 1% of the total $267.12 billion in U.S. commercial real-estate deals completed last year, according to data from Cushman & Wakefield and Real Capital Analytics. Overseas pension funds represented the same percentage of the total investment volume in 2011.

Deals by foreign investors as a whole represented 7% of total deal volume in 2012.

High-profile transactions by foreign pension funds in 2012 included the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board's $1.8 billion investment in a joint venture with Westfield Group that included interests in 10 regional U.S. malls and two redevelopment sites.

The Second Swedish National Pension Fund, a $37.64 billion fund, made its first investment in U.S. commercial real estate last year as part of a push to diversify its portfolio. The fund paid $325 million for a 41% stake in US Office Holdings, a company owned by South Korea's National Pension Service and Tishman Speyer Properties LP. The Swedish fund had invested 7.5% of its portfolio in real estate throughout the world in 2012, according to its latest annual report.

Patrick Kanters, managing director of global real estate at APG Asset Management, the fund manager that invests 329 billion euros ($428.9 billion) for pension funds including Dutch civil-service pension fund ABP, said the group had been investing in U.S. real estate since the late 1990s, but that the proposed change was a "great idea" that would set a more-level playing field for investors.

He said that today, domestic buyers in the U.S. are able to place higher bids in competitive tenders for properties because their future internal rates of return, or IRR, aren't affected by the added tax on future capital gains. "They can pay slightly more to get the same IRR," Mr. Kanters said.

Jim Fetgatter, chief executive of the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate, said the move to revise the law showed investors for the first time that the White House understands the impact of Firpta. "The fact that the president acknowledged that Firpta regulations are an impediment to foreign investment, that's a significant step for it to be publicly acknowledged, and from such a high level," Mr. Fetgatter said.

Roper Industries Inc. has agreed to buy Managed Health Care Associates Inc. for about $1 billion in cash as the high-technology company looks to expand in medical-related services.

Privately owned Managed Health Care supplies software and analytics services to specialty pharmacies, assisted-living facilities and other health-care providers outside of an acute-care hospital setting.

In 2007, private-equity firm Diamond Castle Holdings LLC bought the Florham Park, N.J., company in partnership with its management.

Roper, whose products range from radio-frequency readers to automatic water-meter readers, had seen double-digit-sales increases for nearly two years, thanks in part to acquisitions. But its sales growth began to ease in late 2011.

The Sarasota, Fla., company expects the deal to generate $95 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the first 12 months of ownership, excluding the impact of acquisition-related fair value accounting.

Roper Chief Executive Brian Jellison pointed to Managed Health Care's technology tools and customer-service model, adding the company generates substantial recurring revenue through long-term customer relationships and high retention rates.

The deal is expected to be completed within 30 days.

Roper's recent fourth-quarter earnings rose 18% amid strong revenue growth in it medical and scientific imaging segment, while margins also widened.

Forex chiefs hope for end of risk-on, risk-off trend

After long months in the dark, currencies are coming back into the light. Investors have flocked back to the global foreign exchange market this year as trends have developed in key currencies, while talk of currency wars has put the Japanese yen, the euro, the pound and the US dollar firmly back on policy makers' agendas.

Heads of forex at investment banks are hoping 2013 will finally shed the risk-on, risk-off trend that has dominated currency markets since the financial crisis of 2008, and that traditional currency trading on economic fundamentals will return.

The Japanese yen has been the big draw for investors this year. Shorting the currency has been the most popular trade in the foreign exchange market since late last year, when a new government that promised to drag Japan out of its decades-long period of deflation was elected.

Hedge funds began to front run changes expected at the Bank of Japan. This sent shockwaves through the currency market in April when it unveiled a far more aggressive monetary easing package than had been expected.

The move has created a clear trend in the Japanese yen that is music to the ears of investors and traders, who have wearied of watching currencies react to news headlines and developments in the eurozone crisis over the past two years.

Since the start of 2013, the dollar has risen 15 per cent against the yen to approach Y100, its strongest level in nearly four years, while the euro is at its strongest level in more than three years at Y130, a 14 per cent gain this year.

The Japanese yen is not alone in showing a strong trend this year. The UK pound fell steadily in the first 10 weeks of the year as waning haven demand and concerns over the health of the UK economy led investors to dump sterling.

Meanwhile, the dollar has been rising in line with US equities. Traders and analysts believe this could mark a period of dollar strength at times of global risk appetite, as investors use the weaker yen to fund trades instead of the more liquid dollar.

"We've definitely seen a resurgence in forex this year as an asset class," says Peter Taylor, managing director in forex trading at Barclays.

"If we look at the previous two to three years it was an asset class that many investors stayed away from for various reasons: we were living in a more complex environment that was driven by political happenings in Europe and we had currency moves that were a lot more headline driven.

"The themes we've seen play out in the dollar and yen have made for an easier trading environment and definitely been a driver of bigger volumes from investors."

Kevin Rodgers, head of forex at Deutsche Bank, says: "There's been a slightly more normal feel as we used to have a lot of interest in the yen, sterling and Swiss franc. That turned heavily into emerging markets and the euro in 2011 and 2012, so I think the mix of currencies seems more normal this year."

Jeff Feig, head of G10 foreign exchange at Citigroup in New York, says: "There's definitely less risk-on, risk-off trading, and a greater focus on the economic fundamentals underlying currency pairs, and I think that's good for business."

"Risk-on, risk-off is not in vogue, thank God," says Tim Carrington, global head of currencies and emerging markets at Royal Bank of Scotland. "That's another way of saying correlations between asset classes are going back to normal, which is a good thing."

Bankers are still expecting more trade from the Japanese yen, despite the recent sharp falls, with many pointing out that much of the movement so far has been driven by hedge funds. RBS says that US and European asset managers have not yet become heavily involved in shorting the yen, while a wall of cash from domestic Japanese investors and life insurance companies is expected to hit overseas markets in the coming weeks.

That has already led to a fall in bond yields across Europe and emerging markets as hedge funds front-run the expected buying spree.

"The interest in the yen trade is very high - I don't think it's necessarily peaked," says Mr Feig at Citi. "There's a sense that a lot of this is foreign driven, and the next leg could really be driven by domestic flows."

Bankers are still cautious on calling a definite end to risk-on, risk-off trading. The crisis in Cyprus in March caused some to wobble in their predictions that the currency world had returned to fundamental trading, with the yen re-emerging temporarily as a haven during the eurozone crisis.

"We like a bit of volatility: it prompts businesses to hedge, it brings risk money into the markets; but what we don't really want is a catastrophe," says Mr Rodgers.

Bankers are hoping the upswing in interest in currency trading will lead to higher revenues this year in their foreign exchange divisions.

Figures from Coalition, a financial services analytics company, showed a drop of around a fifth in revenues at many top banks last year as investors shied away from trying to make money by trading currencies. Companies frequently did not bother to hedge currency exposure because volatility was so low between currency pairs.

Mr Feig says: "The first quarter has been very good for us and for our clients and we hope to see more of that - fingers crossed."

Tim Carrington at RBS says: "In the first quarter, we've seen better returns in forex than in the past several years. The investor community is far more active than they have been for years."

But he sounds a note of warning: foreign exchange is becoming less profitable for many banks as more competition and increased electronic trading make clients more cost-conscious, leading to lower margins at the banks. The difference in price between buying and selling currencies, known as the bid-offer spread, for example, has narrowed.

"The spread compression will hit the banking community quite hard," Mr Carrington says. "The sheer cost pressures in business have made the investor side more aggressive."

Russia poses problems for BlackRock; Fund focus

Energy holdings blamed for fall in trust's shares, writes Eleanor Lawrie

BlackRock's Sam Vecht has admitted that "inappropriate" holdings in Russian energy stocks contributed to losses on his eastern European investment trust in the past year. This comes even as the trust's board plans an overhaul of the product.

Shares of the 130.7m BlackRock eastern European Trust shed 2.9 per cent in the past 12 months - a performance the fund manager describes as "disappointing".

The trust held roughly 10 per cent in Russian gas giant Gazprom as the company's share price peaked in September last year, along with large holdings in Lukoil, Surgutneftegaz and Novatek, according to historic portfolio numbers from data provider FE Analytics.

"It's a big sector and I got the stocks wrong," says Mr Vecht.

The trust's shares fell 2.9 per cent in the year to April 3 compared with a rise on its benchmark MSCI EM Europe 10/40 index of 1.7 per cent.

The trust's share price discount to the value of its assets widened from 9.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent during the period, FE says, contributing to the loss.

The trust's board has just announced changes to be put to shareholders in its annual general meeting in June. This will involve changing the trust's name to the BlackRock Emerging Europe trust, and slashing its holdings from 50 to between 20 and 30 companies.

The manager said this was to reflect investor demand for higher conviction holdings to emphasise its active management, as exchange traded fund inflows have dominated inflows into the region in recent months.

The 12-month loss has not derailed the manager's impressive longer-term record. Since Mr Vecht took over in May 2009, the trust's shares have gained 75.9 per cent, compared with a 49.5 per cent benchmark performance.

The trust's five-year loss of 21.6 per cent continues to show the scars of Russia's sharp falls in the early phase of the subprime financial crisis.

The manager says he is still not "massively" bullish on Russia, which made up 62.9 per cent of the portfolio as of February 28 out of a maximum allocation of 70 per cent, although there are positive signs.

Russia has "never been cheaper", Mr Vecht says, citing other developments including rising dividends, liberalisation and economic reforms .

Elsewhere, Mr Vecht says he is also targeting several markets with proximity to Russia.

He has built up a roughly 2.5 per cent weighting in Kazakhstan and 1.5 per cent in Turkmenistan, saying the economies are "coming out of a challenging period" and offer an opportunity that is "well below most people's radars".

Mr Vecht says his best-performing stock in the past year was Turkish gold mining company Koza Altin, which has come good after several years in the portfolio.

He says eastern European economies face an appearance of "guilt by association", under which their proximity to the big developed economies of Europe and the US creates the impression they face similar fiscal and monetary troubles.

Ben Seager-Scott, senior research analyst at Bestinvest, says the trust is on the group's "radar" but he prefers to access emerging markets through broader mandates, leaving regional allocation to managers' discretion.

"When you get into regional funds - and the same holds true for funds that invest specifically in some of the larger countries - in many ways the fund may be forced into stocks simply to 'make up the numbers' for a broad and diversified portfolio," says Mr Seager-Scott.

"That said, the eastern Europe investment trust is a pretty reasonable investment, and Sam Vecht has good form in this area, adding value for investors since he took over."

Mr Seager-Scott says more than half the investable eastern European region was accounted for by Russia, a country which was more of a "fallen superpower than a rising star" when compared with other emerging market countries.

"It is also volatile and highly sensitive to the oil price," he adds. "This volatility means even good managers are prone to extended periods of underperformance as their good judgment is obscured by noise and global macroeconomics or geopolitics that are difficult to predict."

Economist Eyed for Fannie Watchdog

Mark Zandi, a prominent economist, has emerged as a leading candidate to head the regulator of mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac amid signs that he would likely attract support from Senate Republicans, according to people familiar with the matter.

The White House hasn't yet decided who to nominate as the next director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a position it has struggled to fill. Along with Mr. Zandi, the Obama administration has also been considering Rep. Mel Watt, a North Carolina Democrat.

The FHFA director has become an increasingly important economic-policy position in Washington, because the agency serves as the warden of Fannie and Freddie, which own or guarantee half of all the nation's mortgages.

Mr. Zandi, co-founder of an economic-forecasting firm that was purchased by Moody's Corp. in 2005, serves as chief economist of Moody'sAnalytics. A registered Democrat, he was an economic adviser to the 2008 presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.). He speaks frequently on the economy, fiscal issues and housing testifying before Congress at least nine times in the last two years and played a key role advising congressional Democrats on the 2009 economic-stimulus bill.

In an interview Thursday, Mr. Zandi dismissed a question about whether he was being considered for the FHFA job. "Who knows what they're going to do with that," he said, declining to elaborate.

The FHFA's current director, Edward DeMarco, took the job four years ago in an acting capacity after his predecessor left for the private sector. Mr. DeMarco has at times clashed with the Obama administration over homeowner aid, and left-leaning groups have campaigned to replace him. The agency, created five years ago, has never had its own director confirmed by the Senate because of Republican opposition to an earlier nomination.

Mr. Zandi has attracted attention, in part, because he may have a good chance at winning Senate confirmation. Senate Republicans have largely supported Mr. DeMarco and are expected to scrutinize his successor closely. But Mr. Zandi may placate these critics.

Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who serves on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a written statement Friday: "If Mark Zandi and the administration have an acceptable plan to transition us away from our dependence on [Fannie and Freddie], I'm optimistic that he could do a good job helping our country effectively execute that plan while also protecting the taxpayer."

On housing, Mr. Zandi has published a paper outlining the need for a continued government role in backstopping the home-loan market.

While he has sometimes advocated more government intervention to address the foreclosure crisis, he has also called for scaling back the mortgage-interest deduction and the government's role in the mortgage market once the current crisis has abated.

Replacing Mr. DeMarco could give the administration greater latitude to expand initiatives to help homeowners facing foreclosure and to mediate disputes over when banks should be forced to "buy back" defaulted mortgages, which some policy makers fret has kept credit standards too tight. But people familiar with the process have said that the Obama administration's push to fill the FHFA position has less to do with specific policy flare-ups and more to do with its desire to have a permanent director oversee the process of overhauling Fannie and Freddie.

Without clear direction from the White House or Congress, Mr. DeMarco has begun to move more aggressively to shrink the firms' heavy presence in the mortgage market. Last month, he announced plans to merge some of the firms' back-office operations into a separate company that, for now, would be jointly owned by Fannie and Freddie.

Health
When Your M.D. Is a Computer Algorithm --- To Curb Prescription Painkiller Abuse, Firms Take Data-Driven Approach; Some Physicians Leery of Analytic Programs

By Timothy W. Martin

ORLANDO, Fla. -- Despite all that drug-enforcement agents and regulators are doing to fight prescription painkiller abuse, the most effective combatant might turn out to be a computer algorithm.

That became apparent at last week's National Rx Drug Abuse Summit in Orlando. Joining an audience of patient advocates, policy makers and law-enforcement officers were members of a burgeoning cottage industry: a swarm of firms that are taking a data-driven approach to the drug-abuse epidemic.

With the costs of abuse soaring, these firms are combining medical research and guidelines with computer analysis to guide some doctors about what prescription painkillers should be administered to which patients, and in what doses. Or, if at all.

The companies, largely insurers and medical-bill review consultants for firms paying workers' compensation claims, say they're filling an unmet need: providing research-driven clinical advice and guidelines to physicians who haven't been thoroughly educated on how to treat pain. They say they will help lower health-care costs, dictate safe use and identify potential painkiller abusers before they get hooked.

But some physicians are leery of analytic programs -- with names like "Opioid Defense Manager" and "VantageComp" -- playing any role in medical treatment, especially when the software is deployed by companies looking to lower drug costs and medical spending.

Rising Medical Solutions Inc. was one of around 40 analytic companies attending the Orlando conference. Using algorithms developed in-house, Rising Medical assesses whether an individual is low, medium or high-risk.

The valuation is based on a 30-question survey that asks about an injured worker's optimism about recovery, their previous injury history and whether they smoke, among other signs that measure vulnerability to becoming addicted to painkillers.

It also considers factors like the "lag time" -- when an injury occurred versus when it was reported -- since a delayed disclosure could signal higher potential for abuse. In those situations, Rising Medical assigns case managers to high-risk cases from day one.

For instance, if a restaurant worker with a broken ankle stays on opioids longer than two weeks, Rising Medical may issue an alert. The Chicago-based company has determined that being on prescription painkillers any longer could be an early indicator of addiction, said Jason F. Beans, CEO at Rising Medical.

"We enact interventions to prevent the small lower-back claim from becoming a lifetime addiction," Mr. Beans said. "We want to deal with cases before they become problems."

PMSI Inc.'s statisticians and actuaries built a proprietary Risk Intelligence System that employs 18 criteria it says could signal fraud or abuse. What pops out is a Population Risk Scorecard, on a scale of 0 to 150, that compares an individual company's results versus other firms in the area or in a similar industry.

If individual cases show potential abuse, PMSI-employed physicians will dial up doctors treating an injured worker and walk them through a "real-time clinical road map," based on the medication history and evidence-based guidelines. "We know that all physicians aren't perfect," said Jay W. Krueger, an executive vice president at PMSI.

Some doctors question whether analytics could discriminate against people who have a legitimate need. "One person doesn't heal the same way another person does. Treatment has to be directed by the physician -- not the insurer," said Andrea Trescot, a practicing pain doctor and past president of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, a nonprofit industry group.

The analytics-driven industry has grown to more than three dozen companies from just a handful a decade ago, said Ishita Sengupta, director of workers' compensation at the National Academy of Social Insurance, a nonprofit research group that tracks workers' compensation benefits and costs.

Yet it is growing like an industry with a future. Insurers like American International Group Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and Travelers Cos. have added analytical or predictive-modeling abilities to their workers' compensation divisions in recent years.

Some pharmacy-benefit managers like Modern Medical Inc., of Lewis Center, Ohio, specialize in paring down workers' compensation costs. "Your doctor's approach to pain care may lead you to become addicted -- but that's not the case with high cholesterol or high blood pressure," said Michael Gavin, chief strategy officer at Prium, a Duluth, Ga., firm that consults for workers' compensation payers.

Prium can require direct nurse oversight of individual cases or physician reviews of an individual drug regimen.

The nascent industry's growth comes as workers' compensation spending is soaring. The average medical cost for workers paid to stay at home was $28,000 in 2011, nearly doubling in a decade from $15,900 in 2001, according to the National Council on Compensation Insurance, which tracks workers' comp spending. Painkiller spending also nearly doubled last decade, to $35 a claim in 2009, says NCCI.

"Hydrocodone is cheap, but the medical treatment spending is expensive," said Michael A. Testa, a fraud analytics senior manager at Express Scripts Holding Co.

Companies using analytics say it is just one tool -- not the only one -- and that they employ their own physicians for guidance.

Their internal guidelines, even if proprietary, are often tied to either state-mandated workers' compensation regulations or evidence-based research, they say.

Special
Sector Investing; Funds to Fine-Tune Technology Exposure; These four funds focus on areas of tech and communications where analysts see rapid growth

Fund investors can get considerable exposure to technology stocks through broad index funds such as those tracking the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which was 16% in tech as of March 31. Some people also own broad tech or communications sector funds.

But for investors who want to capture tech's growth opportunities in the purest way and are comfortable with more concentrated risk, narrower, thematic mutual funds and exchange-traded funds can make sense.

Here are four highly targeted funds that offer exposure to what many analysts consider to be promising markets in technology and communications. While the performance of some of these funds hasn't been strong over the past year, the funds do give investors exposure to several tech niches that analysts predict will have strong revenue growth in coming years.

First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index. Cloud computing allows big businesses to lease the computing and software resources of a third party instead of buying their own hardware and software. This can save the companies money, as well as give them earlier access to the latest technology, since company-owned data centers are expensive to upgrade and designed to last for years. Researcher Gartner Inc. has forecast that spending on cloud services will grow at a compound annual rate of 17.7% from 2011 to 2016.

The majority of the stocks in this $95 million ETF are tech vendors, but about 10% of the index developed by International Securities Exchange LLC is dedicated to end users of the technology, such as Netflix Inc., the online movie rental service. The fund's top holdings include Aruba Networks Inc., which sells networking equipment; software giant SAP AG; cloud-based corporate software company NetSuite Inc.; and Netflix. The expense ratio is 0.6%.

The ETF, launched in 2011, returned a negative 0.7% over the 12 months through March, compared with the 0.6% average return of funds in Morningstar Inc.'s tech category.

First Trust Nasdaq CEA Smartphone Index. It might seem that everyone in the world has a smartphone, but that is hardly the case. Smartphones still constitute a minority of the mobile market world-wide, according to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF research at S&P Capital IQ. "We think smartphones are going to continue to be a growth market, especially as prices for the technology continue to fall," he says, and that is good news for "the food chain of companies in the smartphone manufacturing process." He also thinks that many companies in this $12 million ETF such as top holdings Samsung Electronics Co. and electronics manufacturers Sanmina-SCI Corp., Benchmark Electronics Inc. and Compal Communications Inc. are good values.

One issue for investors, according to Mr. Rosenbluth, is that this two-year-old fund is thinly traded and can have a wide bid-ask spread (the difference between the prices potential buyers "bid" to acquire shares and the prices potential sellers "ask" to part with theirs). The expense ratio is 0.7%.

The smartphone ETF returned a negative 3% over the year through March, trailing the Morningstar tech category's average return.

But growing demand for high-speed mobile devices and equipment bodes well for companies such as Samsung, a maker of 4G LTE smartphones, currently the fastest technology. Gartner sees the market for 4G LTE infrastructure growing at a compound annual rate of 42.6% from 2013 to 2017.

PowerShares Dynamic Networking. This $37 million ETF gives investors exposure to companies that make the equipment that runs telecom networks, a sector that Gartner predicts will expand about 5% this year, or more than twice the pace of the economy.

Some segments within that broader market, however, are expected to grow much faster. Gartner sees the wireless corporate network market growing at a compound annual rate of 18.4% from 2011 to 2016, and the market for high-speed fiber-optic Internet-access equipment growing at a compound annual rate of 12.1% from 2010 to 2014.

The ETF tracks a NYSE Arca index that selects stocks based on price and earnings momentum, earnings quality, management and value, says Ed McRedmond, senior vice president of institutional and portfolio strategies at Invesco PowerShares, the fund's sponsor.

Top holdings include router makers Juniper Networks Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., enterprise information-technology company Citrix Systems Inc., communications-infrastructure company Motorola Solutions Inc. and connector company Amphenol Corp.

The fund has an expense ratio of 0.63%.

The ETF returned a negative 6.7% over the past year. But for the past five years, it is in the top 10% of Morningstar's tech-ETF category, with an average return of 12.9% a year.

Fidelity Select Communications Equipment. Investors seeking an actively managed fund focused on the communications and data-networking market might consider this offering from Fidelity Investments as an alternative to the PowerShares ETF.

Brian Lempel, a research analyst and IT sector leader at Fidelity Investments, says Fidelity looks for equipment companies that benefit from a number of long-term technology trends, including cloud computing, data analytics and consumerization, which refers to the growing demand for consumer tech products within large corporations.

"Secular trends in technology take place over many years," he says. He says he and his colleagues aim to "identify the winners" and hold on to them through market ups and downs as their businesses grow.

This $300 million mutual fund, managed by Ali Khan, holds companies such as Cisco, Juniper and Motorola Solutions, and wireless technology companies Qualcomm Inc. and Ericsson. The expense ratio is 0.89%, according to Morningstar.

The fund is down 3.2% over the past year, vs. the average 13.4% gain for funds in the Morningstar communications category.

But for the past five years, the fund has returned an average 5.2% a year, beating the average 2.9% return of funds in its Morningstar category.

Corrections & Amplifications Brian Lempel is a research analyst and IT sector leader at Fidelity Investments. An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified him as the manager of Fidelity Select Communications Equipment, which is managed by Ali Khan.

Yen Extends Losses

The yen fell to its lowest price against the dollar in four years, but stopped just short of the 100 level.

Japan's currency has fallen around 7% since last week, when the Bank of Japan surprised markets with the magnitude of its new easing program. The central bank plans to pump trillions of yen into the Japanese economy as a way to lower long-term interest rates and stoke inflation, a process that is also expected to result in a weaker yen.

"The Bank of Japan understands the urgency of the moment, so they will be quite aggressive from here," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics. "We're not looking at a one-time move by any means."

In late-afternoon trade, the dollar bought 99.76, its highest level since April 2009, compared with 99.03 late Tuesday.

It was helped along by an earlier-than-expected release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March 19-20 meeting, which showed Fed members actively debating whether to pull back on its bond-buying program before the end of the year. Bond buying by the Fed typically weakens the value of the dollar.

"A lot of people in the market are targeting a dollar-yen move to 100, so the minutes were an excuse for people to sell yen again," said Greg Anderson, a currency strategist at Citigroup in New York.

The yen saw a brief bout of strength early Wednesday, after new BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires and other media that he doesn't expect an "avalanche" of capital leaving Japan due to the central bank's newly enhanced easing program. Mr. Kuroda said the BOJ plans were not aimed at weakening the yen.

However, the yen erased all gains within an hour.

Michael Woolfolk, a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said, "Japanese officials are concerned about the pace of the yen's decline ... but unless they say anything significantly new, the market is going to quickly return to yen selling."

The euro, meanwhile, slipped to $1.3070 from the previous day's close of $1.3082, after industrial production numbers across the region came in mixed, highlighting the long road the euro zone faces as it attempts to kick-start economic growth.

The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies, was recently up 0.03% to 73.72.

The British pound bought $1.5330 from $$1.5322 late Tuesday. The Australian dollar fetched $1.0539 versus $1.0489.

Easy Money: Fed Policies Spur Corporate Spending

By Victoria McGrane

(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Historically low interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve have paid off for Fricks Co., a maker of industrial concrete floors based in Fort Worth, Texas.

On one side of the ledger, the low rates have encouraged several big customers to dust off construction plans they had shelved during the recession, bringing in a flood of work, says Ronald Arrington, the privately held company's chief financial officer. "Our estimator is just swamped," he adds, referring to the company employee who provides price estimates to prospective customers.

Coupled with tax breaks, the low rates have also led Fricks to increase its own borrowing, Mr. Arrington says. The company has used the money to replace about half its fleet of specialized construction equipment, as measured by dollar value, ahead of schedule.

Mr. Arrington is one of 450 CFOs who responded to questions about the effect of low interest rates on company borrowing and debt management over the past 12 to 18 months for a survey conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine. The latest round of the quarterly online survey, which polls public and private companies of various sizes across a range of sectors, concluded March 8. The questions related to interest rates were posed exclusively for The Wall Street Journal.

The results of the survey, as well as interviews with some participants, provide a window into how the Fed's unconventional policies are influencing corporate behavior.

CFOs at 202 firms, about 45% of the survey respondents, said low interest rates had led them to increase borrowing. The poll also drilled down on what firms are doing with the borrowed funds, finding that half of the financial officers who are borrowing more said they're spending the proceeds on new capital investments.

About one in four of those borrowing more said they had used the funds to increase mergers and acquisitions, and about a fourth said they had expanded their domestic operations. About one in 10 said they had increased hiring. Each CFO could check more than one use of the money.

The Fed has kept short-term interest rates pinned at nearly zero since late 2008, and more recently it embarked on several rounds of aggressive bond-buying to lower long-term rates, all in an effort to boost a sluggish economy.

The easy-money policies are designed to induce spending and investing, which the Fed hopes will lead to more hiring. But Fed critics say the policies aren't having their intended effect, pointing to disappointingly slow growth and still high unemployment of 7.7%.

The survey, though, shows the Fed's easy-money policies are motivating at least some businesses to invest in new equipment, buildings and technology upgrades. Moreover, some business executives say lenders are starting to make credit more available, too.

John Graham, a finance professor at Duke and a director of the survey, said the results show Fed policies are providing a "solid step in the right direction," especially when combined with the strengthening housing market.

The impact of the Fed's policies on companies' hiring is tougher to gauge. Few of the CFOs responding to the survey said they were borrowing money specifically to hire more workers. But interviews with several of them revealed that their borrowing for other activities sometimes led to increased staffing.

Low rates prompted family-owned liquor and wine distributor Young's Market Co. to double its credit line, which is secured by the company's inventory and receivables, over the past two years, said Kevin Manion, CFO of the Tustin, Calif.-based business.

The borrowed funds have been spent on investments aimed at boosting growth, and they have included higher-speed conveyor and sorting systems to move product through its warehouses faster, as well as technology upgrades to help track that inventory better and fill customer orders more quickly and accurately.

While the borrowing didn't directly underwrite new hiring, the company increased its workforce about 5% in each of the past two years, Mr. Manion says.

Similarly, Hartford, Conn.-based Kelser Corp. hasn't used new borrowing specifically to increase staffing, but the technology company has hired workers to keep up with annual revenue growth of 25% to 30% over the past two years, says CFO Donald Noble.

Despite low rates, Mr. Noble says it wasn't until last June that he started to see lenders actually willing to extend credit. The company has since accepted an offer from International Business Machines Corp. to increase its "flooring" line of credit, which finances inventory, by 50%. In addition, Kelser took out a loan to buy other companies.

While lenders are interested in making loans to his company, credit is still tight for weaker companies, Mr. Noble says.

In fact, many of the firms Kelser is looking at as possible acquisition targets can't get the financing or credit facilities they want, he says. "They're not taking as many chances on companies anymore," he says.

While the Fed's policies appear to be spurring more borrowing, one risk is that companies could overdo it.

U.S. banks' commercial and industrial lending in the week including March 20 was up 11% from a year earlier, to near precrisis levels, according to Fed data. More than $1 trillion of nonfinancial U.S. corporate bonds, a record level, were issued last year, according to Dealogic, and the pace is about the same so far this year, with about $259 billion of bonds issued as of April 1.

"Short-term positive, long-term problematic" is how Moody'sAnalytics economist John Lonski described the interest-rate environment for U.S. corporations. The low rates have helped companies strengthen their financial positions by lowering the cost of their debt and encouraging them to use more long-term debt, but they could also take on more debt than they can handle.

Corporate debt is growing at nearly twice the rate that profits grew last year, Mr. Lonski says. And if the trend continues, it could "destabilize the economy in the future."

MarketWatch / The Personal Finance Report: Bank To-Do List: Make a Deposit, Grab a Brew, Maybe Strike a Pose

Forget free toasters -- think beer and yoga.

Those extras are among the draws being used by banks to lure customers to branches in an age when checks can be deposited with a smartphone picture and mortgage applications filled out online.

An Umpqua Bank branch in Portland, Oregon, drew a crowd of 150 last fall with an Oktoberfest-style celebration, replete with pretzels, beer and a strolling accordionist. Such events are part of a larger slate of community events and programs -- from yoga classes to dog fairs -- that Umpqua offers in its 200-plus branches. The idea is simple: The more reasons a bank gives customers -- or just as important, potential customers -- to visit a branch, the more likely the bank will grab a piece of their business. "You take the chore" of going to the bank "and turn it into a pleasant experience," says Eve Callahan, an Umpqua spokeswoman.

The idea is spreading, as banks aim to reshape themselves from transactional hubs into more like community centers. The driving factor: Many customers never set foot in branches any more -- even to visit an ATM. A study by Financial Management Solutions, Inc., a Georgia-based research and consulting firm, found that monthly teller transactions at community banks and credit unions plummeted 40% from 1992 to 2012.

But banks remain dependent on branches to pitch services: The customer who walks in to cash a check -- or get a free scoop of ice cream -- may walk out with a car loan. And those marketing opportunities don't translate as well in the online and mobile worlds, where customers are apt to remain focused on the transaction at hand, says Will Weidman, vice president of Applied Predictive Technologies, a software and analytics company that works with financial institutions. "Banks have not cracked the other channels as a means to cross-sell," he says.

The new approach is similar to the Starbucks model. In some instances, it can be as basic as providing free coffee and Wi-Fi -- or, in the case of TD Bank, free coin-counting at "Penny Arcade" machines. Other banks are opening up their spaces for community meetings, or hosting their own classes and seminars.

Connecticut-based Connex Credit Union has held events for first-time home buyers and for seniors grappling with understanding Medicare. And Philadelphia-based Beneficial Bank set up financial libraries within its branches, so customers can read up on any number of money-related topics. In the process, Beneficial CEO Gerry Cuddy says, the bank hopes to create a "stickier" relationship with its clients.

Mr. Cuddy says the goal is to create a welcoming environment -- not make a "hard sell." But some industry observers warn that banks risk alienating customers if the cross-selling becomes too obvious or intense.

Health Care (A Special Report) --- Your Company Wants to Make You Healthy: A look at the pros and cons of the most popular wellness programs used by companies

Employer wellness programs used to mean just having a gym in the office or posters on the wall encouraging people to take the stairs instead of the elevator. Now more companies are using real money, and sometimes penalties, as incentives for workers to get in better shape.

Nearly 90% of employers offer wellness incentives, or financial rewards or prizes to employees who work toward getting healthier, according to a recent survey from Fidelity Investments and the National Business Group on Health. That's up from 57% of companies in 2009. The perks are also worth more now: $521 per employee on average, compared with $260 four years ago.

"They feel that if they pay more they'll get a better result," says Adam Stavisky, a Fidelity benefits consultant.

But is that true? Which incentives work, and which ones don't? Employers are experimenting with different models in hopes of improving employees' health, lowering claims costs and getting better returns on their wellness investments.

"Incentives themselves are not the silver bullet," says Stephanie Pronk, health and wellness consultant with Aon Hewitt, the human-resources business unit of Aon PLC. "It's really important to change up the incentive design and keep people on their toes," she says.

What follows is a look at the pros and cons of popular kinds of corporate wellness incentive programs being used today.

Educational/Awareness Incentives

THE PLAN: Companies offer rewards for completing activities that include an assessment of their personal health and risk factors. These can range from filling out a questionnaire about family medical history, diet and fitness routine, to taking a biometric screening for cholesterol, blood pressure and other factors. Incentives worth at least $100 are needed to get about 75% of employees to participate, says Lockton Benefit Group. Smaller rewards than that tend to motivate in the range of only 30% to 50%, experts say.

TYPICAL ANNUAL VALUE: $120 for a health-risk assessment; $130 for biometric screening

PROS: Experts say the simple activities are a good way to introduce employees to healthy behavior and their own risk factors. Companies can also use the data to figure out what their workers' health needs are.

CONS: Telling people about their risks and giving them advice won't necessarily lead them to take action.

EXAMPLE: Caterpillar Inc. reduces premiums by $75 a month for employees who complete a health-risk assessment; up to 90% of eligible employees participate, according to the National Business Coalition on Health.

Action-Based Incentives

THE PLAN: To earn rewards, and sometimes avoid penalties, employees are required to take action to improve their health after going through a risk assessment, such as joining a weight-management program or getting a preventive screening.

TYPICAL ANNUAL VALUE: Rewards of $200 to $350 for assessment followed by action

PROS: The model motivates employees to take steps to change their unhealthy behaviors, Ms. Pronk says.

CONS: The incentives don't encourage healthy behavior beyond the completion of the required programs.

EXAMPLE: Houston city employees must complete three tasks in order to avoid a $25 monthly payroll surcharge: fill out a health-risk assessment, take a biometric screening and either talk to a health coach, sign up for a program like Weight Watchers or get a screening such as a mammogram. As a result, 90% of employees have completed three of the tasks or more.

Everything-But-The-Kitchen-Sink Incentives

THE PLAN: Companies offer incentives for an array of tasks; the more complex and beneficial the task, the bigger the reward.

TYPICAL ANNUAL VALUE: Generally $25 to $125 per task

PROS: Employees like the freedom to choose their health activities, from bike rides to self-defense classes, rather than having to talk to a nurse or participate in an official program to get the reward, say experts. A wellness program that lays out a tempting trail to follow will have more success keeping people involved, Ms. Pronk says.

CONS: Too many options can overwhelm employees, and companies can waste money on programs that won't effectively address workers' biggest health problems.

EXAMPLE: JetBlue Airways Corp. offers as much as $400 for a range of activities from teeth cleaning ($25) to completing an Ironman triathlon ($400).

Progress-Based Incentives

THE PLAN: Employers offer rewards for taking steps to hit optimal benchmarks for cholesterol, blood pressure and weight. Steps can include enrolling in a weight-management program and reducing body mass index.

TYPICAL ANNUAL VALUE: $100 for reaching a healthy weight

PROS: Employees are financially motivated to improve their health, instead of getting penalized for not being perfect, says Paul Terry, CEO of StayWell Health Management, which runs corporate wellness programs.

CONS: Rewarding employees for simply showing up to a wellness program doesn't mean they will actually get healthier, and there's a long way to go from a "morbidly obese" body mass index of 40 to a healthy under-25.

EXAMPLE: At insurer Florida Blue, workers can earn rewards of up to $500. The firm's total staff with five or more health-risk factors has decreased by half, to only 11%, since 2009; those with two risks or fewer now make up 59%, up from 41%.

Outcome-Based Incentives

THE PLAN: Companies tie incentives and penalties to health metrics, with workers paying more until they hit ideal cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index levels; 41% of employers use this model, a survey by Fidelity and the National Business Group on Health found.

TYPICAL ANNUAL VALUE: $100 for achieving a healthy weight; $125 for hitting other biometric targets; $200 for quitting tobacco. (According to Fidelity's survey, employers don't penalize employees for not achieving results, but reward those who do with lower premiums, cash or deposits into their health savings or flexible savings account.)

PROS: Experts say this model is effective at making people objectively improve their health: Participants in a recent Mayo Clinic study lost nine pounds on average when they received $20 per month for meeting weight-loss goals (or paid $20 when they didn't); participants who didn't receive incentives lost only two pounds on average.

CONS: Critics believe the model could be discriminatory and decrease access to health care. Legally, employers must offer workers who don't hit targets an alternative way to earn the incentive, such as a doctor's note or program participation, so experts say employees might never reach the goal.

EXAMPLE: Furniture company KI sorts workers into four tiers of premiums based on biometrics, with the healthiest people paying $1,000 less (or $1,500 for a family) than the riskiest.

Targeted Incentives

THE PLAN: Companies crunch employees' health-risk, claims and other data -- or have the insurer or an analytics company do it -- to offer personalized wellness programs and incentives.

TYPICAL ANNUAL VALUE: $100 to $125 for targeted programs

PROS: Experts say that personalizing wellness programs boosts participation among those who will benefit the most.

CONS: Some workers feel personalized interventions are intrusive and compromise privacy.

EXAMPLE: Johnson & Johnson employees get $500 off annual premiums for submitting a health profile; the company then uses the data to offer an additional $100 to $250 for participating in activities tailored to the employee, such as a diabetes management program. The company says its return on investment is up to $4 for every dollar it spends on employee wellness.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Russian reforms prove a lure; Fund focus

A Jupiter manager expects a wave of investment in domestic markets, writes Nick Reeve

The Russian equity market is undergoing landmark reforms that could make it a far more attractive bet for investors, according to the manager of the 287.8m Jupiter Emerging European Opportunities fund.

Elena Shaftan says a wave of new liquidity could flood into Russian stock markets in the next few months as authorities put in place equity trading reforms that will bring its stock exchange up to international standards in terms of speed of trading and regulation.

The country's two main exchanges, RTS and Micex , have merged, and President Vladimir Putin has voiced a desire to float more state-owned companies on public markets.

Ms Shaftan, who has 18 years' experience of the region's markets, says she has built up her investment in Russian companies to roughly two-thirds of the Jupiter Emerging European Opportunities portfolio.

In a sign of confidence, she also says she is focusing on less liquid small and mid-cap stocks rather than more "defensive" large-cap names.

She says that Russia is experiencing a "change of culture" in terms of attitude to financial markets as it seeks to move away from its reliance on oil exports, adding that people are more appreciative of capital markets as a "road to personal wealth".

"The introduction of a central depositary [for settlement of trades] opens Russia up to the wider market," Ms Shaftan says.

"We don't know how far the reforms will go, but so far it has certainly made people stop and think. To diversify away from oil, Russia needs to attract foreign investment, and it needs to demonstrate the environment is safe."

Russian authorities are also seeking to change the rules on how pension funds invest. These funds do not have high levels of equity investment, as the managers are forced to make good any losses experienced through investing in risk assets.

But proposed reforms to this law aim to drastically increase Russian pension funds' investment in the domestic markets, which would create what Ms Shaftan refers to as a "cushion of domestic liquidity". As much as $50bn could come in to the market in the next few years if the reforms go ahead as planned, she says.

President Putin's reforms also include a requirement for Russian companies to pay 25 per cent of their profits as dividends to shareholders.

Ms Shaftan's bias towards small and mid-cap companies has hurt the performance of her fund in recent years. In the five-year period to March 25, the fund lost 16 per cent, according to FE Analytics, while its benchmark, the MSCI EM Europe 10/40 index, gained 6 per cent.

Shorter-term performance, however, has been much stronger, and Ms Shaftan says she has seen "signs of change" in the past three months. In the six months to March 25, the fund gained 12.9 per cent compared with the index's gain of 7.9 per cent.

"When people look for safety, they look for index-hugging and liquidity, for example exchange traded funds," Ms Shaftan says.

"When risk appetite improves, investors start to look at fundamentals, and that often leads them towards small and mid-cap companies."

Special
The Experts: What Lessons Can Investors Learn From Warren Buffett?

What lessons can investors learn from Warren Buffett's investment strategy and history? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324735304578354753422652608.html" on the increasing difficulty of getting some personal time with Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders' meeting and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Friday, April 5.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts online at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html?mg=inert-wsj"

Also "http://on.wsj.com/14CDLEj" three of The Experts Christian Magoon ("https://twitter.com/ChristianMagoon") of Magoon Capital, Rick Ferri ("https://twitter.com/Rick_Ferri") of Portfolio Solutions and Matt Hougan ("https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") of IndexUniverse speak about investing in index funds and ETFs in a live video chat that aired on Monday, April 8 at 3 p.m. EDT.

Matt Hougan: Invest in Things. Don't Rent.

Don't sell. Invest in things; don't rent them for speculative returns.

There are caveats to that, of course: If you're tax-loss harvesting, or if the investment landscape shifts, or if your initial thesis (that you wrote down when you first invested) breaks down.

But holding periods for stocks now average less than a year. Fifty years ago, they were about seven years. We were better off then.

Matt Hougan ("https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

Sheryl Garrett: Keep It Real

Don't try to be fancy. Keep it real. Focus on the business aspects of any investment. Research thoroughly. Trust few. Avoid leverage, and be patient and willing to invest forever. And, if you don't have the time or interest to do all of this with a great deal of confidence, Warren Buffett himself would recommend that we simply invest in index funds.

Sheryl Garrett ("https://twitter.com/SherylGarrett") is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Eleanor Blayney: Invest Like a Woman

According to a recent book on the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett "invests like a girl." While it would be more politically correct to say that Mr. Buffett "invests like a woman," the point remains: His investment style and method share many characteristics that research has shown are more prevalent among women investors. These include patience, ability to learn from mistakes and investing only in what he understands.

There's a take-away here particularly for women, who tend to be reluctant, anxious investors or think they do not know enough to invest. You've got what it takes! You are more like Warren Buffett than you might think! It is imperative for you to get investing to ensure your financial security over your longer lives. (This is a message for all Americans, but women in particular need the support and encouragement to become confident investors.)

Eleanor Blayney ("https://twitter.com/EleanorBlayney") is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards.

Tom Brakke: Don't Get Swept Up By the Crowd

No name gets dropped quite as much as Warren Buffett's by those writing about investments, including me. As an indication, The Experts were given a question that referenced him just last month.

The infatuation with Mr. Buffett is understandable given his success and his folksy manner. But investors should be aware that he plays a different game than the rest of us. He gets the first call on deals and he gets attractive terms on his investments. We can't replicate those advantages.

Another thing to keep in mind is how much Mr. Buffett's strategy has changed over time. Whereas most investors are urged to adopt a plan and stick to it, Mr. Buffett showed that different times and different circumstances mean that core principles should be examined and adapted as necessary.

Charlie Munger was the key person in Mr. Buffett's evolution. There are good lessons from that: It's important to listen to other perspectives, and a dialogue like Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger have had over the years has gotten them to places that neither could have gone on his own.

Mr. Buffett has said that his favorite holding period for an investment is "forever." That's a welcome departure from the short-term thinking that pervades much of the investment business. You should not, however, make the mistake of thinking that anything that Mr. Buffett holds is worth owning. Many investors did that in the '90s, buying Coca-Cola and other stocks because Buffett owned them, even though they were trading at historic levels of overvaluation. The results weren't good. So don't cherry-pick Mr. Buffett's ideas and expect to do well. That's not a great way to emulate him.

The most important lesson that Mr. Buffett can offer anyone: Don't get swept up by the crowd.

For example, he has been willing to sit on a mountain of cash, even though interest rates are extremely low. Most financial advisers would scoff at that, but Mr. Buffett will wait in cash if there aren't compelling values available elsewhere.

And he is willing to be out of step for long periods in order to do well in the end. Most of us have a very hard time doing that.

Tom Brakke ("https://twitter.com/researchpuzzler") is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

Michelle Perry Higgins: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy Only When Others Are Fearful

The best lesson to me is to not be a part of the herd when it comes to investing. You see the herd mentality when an investor becomes greedy and wants to invest when the particular stock they are watching is at an all-time high or they begin pouring money into the stock market when it's at peak. Then, as soon as the indicator starts to fall, they become fearful and quickly sell at a loss. You would never see Mr. Buffett do that. A patient, long-term value investor is the one that sees the big picture and understands stock-market cycles. He or she will likely not fall into the greed or fear trap. Warren Buffett is a brilliant man and has many lessons that investors should emulate. One of his most valued quotes for me is, "We (must) simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful." That is the epitome of breaking away from the herd.

Michelle Perry Higgins ("https://twitter.com/RetirementMPH") is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

Meir Statman: Buffett Teaches Us the Importance of Being a "Mensch"

The most important lessons we can learn from Warren Buffett are about life.

We tend to seek investment lessons from Mr. Buffett. How can we make the most money from our investments? Should we choose value stocks? Or perhaps growth stocks with dominating brands? But what is the money for?

Money offers three kinds of benefits: utilitarian, expressive and emotional. The utilitarian benefits of money are in the financial security it provides to us and our families. The expressive benefits are about what it says about us. Does it say that we drive a Lamborghini or does it say that we can afford a Lamborghini but choose to drive a Toyota? The emotional benefits are about how it makes us feel. Does a pile of money make us feel tall as we stand atop it, or does it make us proud as we contribute it for the benefit of others? Mr. Buffett enjoys the utilitarian benefits of money, providing well for himself and his family, and he enjoys the expressive and emotional benefits of money by giving it away.

Mr. Buffett teaches us that the most important part of being a self-made man is being a "mensch," a decent man. He recognizes the role of community efforts and luck in his success. He also recognizes the role of government in helping people who have not been successful, and the fairness of sharing the fruits of success. Mr. Buffett "believes in fairness," wrote Rana Foroohar following an interview with Mr. Buffett. "He believes in the ability of government to make people's lives better. But most of all, he believes in luck." Mr. Buffett's good fortune, he says, "starts with being born in this country." When asked by Andrew Ross Sorkin if there are any private equity investors he admires, Mr. Buffett "flatly replied: 'No' &When asked if he followed any hedge-fund managers, he struggled to name any &"

Meir Statman is the Glenn Klimek professor of finance at Santa Clara University, and visiting professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands.

Larry Zimpleman: Take the Long-Term View

I think Warren Buffett and other very successful investors offer the average investor a lot of good tips for their own investment strategy. Some of the concepts I think Mr. Buffett teaches us include:

A. Invest like you want to own the company. If you don't understand what a company does or how it makes money, it's probably not a good investment.

B. Don't outguess yourself if the fundamentals behind the motivation for your investment are still in place, don't worry if the returns aren't performing over the short term. But if the circumstances do change, be willing to act.

C. Probably the most important one is to invest for the long term. Even Warren Buffett doesn't know whether the markets will go up or down over the next month, or even the next year. But the odds that markets will go up over five or 10 years is very high so take the long-term view.

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group.

Rick Ferri: Buffett Hasn't Been Wrong on Index Funds

It would be nice if we could all pick stocks like Warren Buffett. A handful of investors have, but most have not. I don't need to because I own Berkshire Hathaway stock. It's the only individual stock in my portfolio. All other investments are primarily in low-cost index funds.

Warren Buffett would approve of my strategy. He has been a longtime advocate of index-fund investing. In 1996, he wrote in the Berkshire Hathaway annual report that, "Most investors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path are sure to beat the net results of the great majority of investment professionals."

Each year, Mr. Buffet repeats his index-fund endorsement in some fashion or other. "A very low-cost index is going to beat a majority of the amateur-managed money or professionally-managed money," Mr. Buffett said at the 2007 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. He hasn't been wrong.

Rick Ferri is founder of "http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/" LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is "http://www.rickferri.com/blog/".

Greg McBride: You Own a Business, Not a Piece of Paper

There are several lessons investors can learn from Warren Buffett. Mr. Buffett espouses the "buy and hold" that many investors have dismissed as out of fashion. Mr. Buffett is also a great example of the importance of minimizing trading to keep investment expenses low and to preserve returns. Investors should also follow Mr. Buffett's lead and recognize equity ownership as owning part of a business and not just owning a piece of paper. Other concepts such as recognizing value, buying what you know and the power of compounding are well illustrated by Mr. Buffett.

Greg McBride ("https://twitter.com/BankrateGreg") is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

Charles Rotblut: Never Panic and Stick to Your Strategy

I recently asked Carol Loomis, who wrote a book on Warren Buffett last year and edits his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, a similar question. She noted that in a previous annual report, Mr. Buffett said those people with the aptitude, the interest and the time to decide what securities to invest in can do well. Most others should simply invest in index funds.

I would add two other things.

The first is the importance of never panicking. A large part of Mr. Buffett's success has come from his ability to stay calm and be willing to increase his stockholdings when everyone else is selling. Everyone has heard they should "buy low and sell high," but few people have shown the ability to truly buy low as Mr. Buffett has.

The second is the importance of having a rational, well-thought-out investment strategy and sticking to it. Mr. Buffett has built a fortune by investing in bargain stocks good quality companies that trade at attractive prices. Despite everything else that has evolved over his career, he has kept a laser focus and only tweaked his strategy when there was an overriding reason to do so.

Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

Scott Adams: How Hard Could It Be?

When I watch LeBron James jump from the free-throw line, rotate 360 degrees in the air, and dunk a basketball, I always say to myself "Now I know how to do that, too!" It's the same feeling I get from watching Warren Buffett invest. I mean, how hard could it be? As far as I can tell, all you do is make folksy pronouncements and neglect trimming your eyebrows for decades. Mr. Buffett says the market is inefficient and he has opportunities and information not available to the average person, but I haven't been average since LeBron taught me to dunk so that's not an issue for me.

The Apps Fall Far From Apple's Tree

Google is eating Apple's iPhone from the inside out. Facebook is hugely popular on mobile, but faces a threat from companies that are building their own mobile social networks. Oh, and smartphone users love games. Really love them.

These are just some of the themes that emerge from studying the app charts. These are real-time scoreboards of the top apps by number of downloads and by revenue that are published by the makers of the dominant mobile operating systems, Google and Apple.

The Billboard of the mobile era, the app charts are something all technology investors should follow to understand who is up and who is down in the smartphone age.

There can be no doubt that smartphones have become the dominant computing device. Last year, nearly 700 million of them were shipped world-wide, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. That was nearly double IDC's estimate for PC shipments of 352 million. As recently as 2010, PCs were still the bigger market.

No wonder a war is being waged among tech's biggest players to control the mobile experience. On Thursday, Facebook is due to open another front when, together with Taiwan-based handset maker HTC, it is expected to roll out a smartphone with a special Facebook-themed home screen. The hope is to grab even more of mobile users' time. Controlling that will be the key to billions of dollars of advertising and other revenue in the near future.

But Facebook is just one of many players competing for attention. Google and Apple are others. Meanwhile, there are thousands of smaller app developers taking on these giants, and having great success in some cases.

Luckily, investors can see who is winning and losing.

While Apple's App Store and Google's equivalent Google Play store don't disclose the specific number of downloads or the precise amount of revenue for each app, they do provide country-by-country lists of how apps rank on both scores. A useful tool to track this is provided by research firm App Annie, which collects all the data and presents it in ways that otherwise wouldn't be visible, particularly for Google Play.

Important trends emerge when you study the charts. First, people love games: In the U.S., by revenue, nine of the top 10 apps on Google Play are games as are eight of the top 10 apps on iPhone. Candy Crush Saga, where players must quickly arrange brightly colored candies, is No. 1 for both.

Excluding games, Google is actually the most popular publisher of apps on Apple's mobile devices these days. Apps like Google Maps and YouTube are downloaded more frequently than even the apps Apple encourages iPhone users to download when they first buy their device.

Together with popular apps like Chrome, Search and Gmail, it is clear that Google is building a strong connection directly with the users of Apple products. The clear risk for Apple is that as iPhone users grow accustomed to Google's mobile apps, they may more-readily defect to rival devices running Google's Android.

Apple is the No. 2 nongame publisher of apps for iPhones in terms of downloads. But it isn't clear that many are actually using its apps, including Find My Friends, iTunes U and iBooks.

This is a key limitation of the app charts. While Apple and Google publish data on downloads and revenue, they don't disclose how much time users are actually spending inside individual apps.

One app publisher that is having no trouble with user engagement, though, is Facebook. Though its app ranks 60th for the iPhone currently, it sits atop the Google Play store. The reason may be that most iPhone users long ago already downloaded the app, while the Android equivalent, which hasn't been out as long, is still being rapidly adopted by users.

In any case, research firm comScore tracks app usage and says that about a fifth of the time that U.S. smartphone users spent consuming media on their device in February was in Facebook's app. That doesn't include Facebook Messenger, a separate service that handles texting. Nor does it include Instagram, the photo-sharing app that Facebook recently bought. Both of those rank very highly on the U.S. app charts.

Even Facebook's domination of mobile usage is hardly total. Newer apps are grabbing a bigger share of mobile content creation and sharing. Snapchat, which allows users to send photo messages that disappear after a brief time, is currently ranked seventh for iPhone and 20th for Android in the U.S., according to App Annie.

Another app that is growing in popularity is Vine. Published by Twitter, Vine captures six-second videos to share with friends and is currently ranked third in the U.S. for iPhone. Twitter itself was ranked 36th for the iPhone and 10th for Google Play in the U.S. In terms of usage, though, it does quite well, grabbing 1.7% of U.S. smartphone users' time spent in apps in February, according to comScore, good for 11th in their rankings.

Another threat to Facebook could come from apps like WhatsApp Messenger. Ranked among the top paid apps in the U.S. for iPhone, WhatsApp is a popular alternative to standard text-messaging apps that come with smartphones. It is a threat to Facebook because it is rapidly recreating Facebook's key asset, a social network, largely based on users' smartphone address books.

Abroad, you can see how similar messaging apps are turning this into a big business. Developers in Asia are building their games on top of the social networks built by messaging apps. In Korea, for both iPhone and Google Play, nearly all of the top-downloaded and top-grossing apps are built on top of a messenger app called Kakao. The same is true in Japan for an app called Line.

Facebook is capitalizing on the popularity of games: Because it has so much usage within its core service, game publishers pay to promote downloads via the social network's app install ads. Meanwhile, Google's suite of popular apps are also used extensively: Together, its apps accounted for around 7% of app usage in the U.S. in February, according to comScore.

In a sense, the odd-man out here is Apple. Despite the fact that its sleek devices have done so much to make the word "app" commonplace, it has just one truly popular app of its own: iTunes. Yes, having all of your music tied up in one Apple-owned service is a strong tether. But as the sheer diversity of the app rankings suggest, Apple could use more than one popular service to keep customers tied to its mobile devices over the long term.

BOJ Puts Substance in 'Abenomics'

Shinzo Abe and Haruhiko Kuroda want to make believers of us all.

Prime Minister Abe says his bold economic plan, focused on a 2% inflation target, would require a certain amount of audience participation. People would have to, ahem, buy into it for it to work.

Now Mr. Kuroda, at his first meeting as Bank of Japan governor, has provided more solid reasons to believe Japan's leaders are going to do whatever it takes to get the economy humming again.

First, the BOJ has committed to hitting the inflation target in "about two years." Where previously vagueness had prevailed, now there is a clear timeline with which to judge the effectiveness of "Abenomics."

Second, Mr. Kuroda has delivered on high expectations for monetary easing -- and then some. The BOJ said it would double the monetary base and its holdings of Japanese government bonds in two years, and buy JGBs in much longer durations than previously, up to 40 years. The bank also surprised the market by increasing purchases of equity funds and real-estate securities.

With these moves, the BOJ has officially made "qualitative and quantitative easing," or QQE, part of the financial lexicon.

In a symbolic move, it also temporarily scrapped a self-imposed rule that theoretically limited government-bond purchases to the amount of bank notes in circulation.

The immediate response to the BOJ's announcement saw the yen continue its weakening trend and the Nikkei resume its upward march.

But skeptics still will be concerned.

The BOJ's actions are meant to boost asset prices and depress interest rates. That, according to Abenomics, will boost economic activity and demand, spurring growth.

But the risk is that Japan's borrowing costs will rise faster than overall prices. That is a big concern as total government debt is more than 220% of annual gross domestic product. Japan's banks, major holders of JGBs, could find themselves in a precarious position indeed.

Also, though doubts over whether the BOJ can successfully engineer an end to deflation seem misplaced given the plan to print seemingly unlimited amounts of money, much still rests on the need for important structural changes to raise the real, underlying rate of Japan's economic growth.

To that end, a package of pro-growth measures is expected in June. These must include, for instance, policies to boost the labor force, deregulate potential growth sectors such as health care, and improve corporate governance by forcing more independent directors on corporate boards.

The BOJ's announcement has put some concrete measures behind the government's ambitious targets. But until Mr. Abe delivers on the important structural reform leg of his plans, Abenomics remains a leap into the unknown.

Telefonica's Hang-Ups

On Debt Are Receding

Telefonica shareholders can sleep a little easier. The Spanish telecom firm's net debt, which peaked at 56.3 billion euros ($72.3 billion) in 2011, is expected to fall below 47 billion euros this year. That should bring leverage to under a targeted 2.35 times Ebitda, close to an average of two times for its big European peers. But there is renewed talk of asset sales that, if they materialize, could reduce Telefonica's leverage even further.

Major League Baseball

Tests Seat Upgrades

Major League Baseball franchises are taking a page from the airline industry playbook, testing a mobile app that allows their most loyal customers to upgrade their seats during the middle of a game.

As the season kicks off, the Atlanta Braves, Oakland Athletics, Minnesota Twins and Arizona Diamondbacks will begin sending fans mobile offers at the start of games, pitching empty seats for a fee or as a reward for customer loyalty.

Franchises are concerned that last-minute upgrades could discourage advance sales of those higher-priced seats. "You'd hate to give a first-class upgrade to someone who might otherwise buy a first-class ticket," said Joe Inzerillo, chief technology officer for Major League Baseball Advanced Media.

The franchises already collect a wealth of data on fans attending games through the app "At the Ballpark," the platform for the new upgrade program. Since last season, fans have been able to use the app to "check in" at games.

Beyond filling empty seats, MLB hopes that offering someone a chance to sit in better seats will give them a taste of the experience and push them to buy pricier tickets in the future.

Rosetta Stone to Steer

Consumers to the Cloud

Language learning company Rosetta Stone Inc. on Tuesday said it acquired Livemocha for $8.5 million. While Rosetta Stone has made its mark selling language courses through CDs offered at yellow kiosks in malls and airports around the world, Livemocha's language courses are only offered online.

Much as Oracle Corp. last year acquired RightNow Technologies Inc. to ease its entry into cloud computing, Rosetta Stone is making this acquisition as much for the technology underpinning its smaller online learning rival as for the customer base it hopes to monetize in the near future.

Rosetta Stone CEO Steve Swad has been "on a mission for the last 18 months to accelerate our transition from being a language learning company to being a learning company, and from a CD-based company to cloud-based company. This transaction is foundational in moving faster in that direction."

While 99% of Rosetta Stone's business customers access the company's products over the cloud, the majority of its customers on the consumer side still buy CD versions of its products.

In addition to providing improved functionality, the acquisition will allow Rosetta Stone to cull usage and socio-demographic data from Livemocha, helping to identify other courses which the company could begin offering.

Amid Euro-Zone Crisis,

ING Tries Building Trust

With European consumers rattled by the continuing Euro-Zone Crisis, Dutch banking giant ING Groep NV is using technology to build trust with its customers.

The bank is harnessing traditional analytics and database software, and experimenting with Big Data, to do simple things that aren't all that simple to accomplish, but which could translate to higher customer loyalty -- such as helping customers avoid overdraft fees by suggesting fund transfers from one account to another.

The bank is also using predictive analytics based on historical transaction records, tracking the frequency of customer contact, the relevance of each contact, as well as emotional relevance to get a sense of what customers value.

After ING discovered through analytics that customers dropped out of the online loan application process because they didn't want to print the completed form, the bank created a system that alerts an ING agent, who calls the customer and offers to print the form and send it to them.

Abreast of the Market
U.S. Stock Rally Hits Brakes --- Weaker-Than-Expected Economic Data Damp Investor Sentiment

Stocks slipped, as investors hit pause after a pair of disappointing economic readings from the U.S. and ahead of two key global monetary-policy announcements.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 58 points, or 0.4%, to 14605.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed nine points, or 0.6%, to 1561, and the Nasdaq Composite Index pulled back 15 points, or 0.5%, to 3239.

On Tuesday, the Dow and the S&P 500 both rose to record highs for the second time in three sessions.

"The rally's leadership is limited to a smaller and smaller number of names," said Julius Ridgway, investment adviser at Medley & Brown LLC, in Jackson, Miss. "It seems to be getting a little narrower."

The Russell 2000, an index of small stocks, slid more steeply than other benchmarks, pulling back 1%.

Stocks extended losses after the Institute for Supply Management's reading on the U.S. nonmanufacturing sector came in worse than expected -- slipping to its lowest level since August 2012 -- and employment slowed as well.

A disappointing report on private-sector jobs growth for March also cast a pall on Tuesday's optimism. Data compiled by Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics showed an increase of 158,000 jobs on the month, well below the 192,000 expected.

The measure is seen as a preview to Friday's closely watched employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

"Investors are trying to interpret all of this economic data. At the same time, they're looking for the opportunity to take a bit of a breather" after the latest rally, said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds.

But Mr. Tanious remains positive on the U.S. economy. "We would view the selloff to be a buying opportunity," he said.

Next on investors' radars will be monetary-policy decisions abroad. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are both slated to announce policy moves on Thursday.

"All eyes will be focused on what both of those central banks are going to do in their efforts to stimulate economic growth . . . their actions may dominate" market action, Mr. Tanious said.

Zynga rallied 14% ahead of the rollout of two real-money casino and poker games in the next few days.

U.S.-listed shares of Vodafone pulled back 4% after Verizon Communications said it doesn't plan to merge with or make a bid for the U.K.-based telecommunications company. Verizon shares pulled back 1.3%.

Treasury prices got a boost from the weaker-than-expected economic reports. The benchmark 10-year note gained 9/32 in price to yield 1.830%.

European Stocks

Shares slid in the wake of the soft U.S. ISM and jobs figures and as investors took to the sidelines ahead of monetary-policy announcements by the ECB and the Bank of England.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index slid 0.9% to close at 294.80, partly erasing a 1.3% jump from Tuesday.

Delhaize Group tumbled 4.9% after HSBC cut the supermarket operator to "underweight" from "neutral."

Telecom firms were also in the downgrading spotlight, with Telecom Italia off 5.4% after UBS cut the firm to "sell" from "buy." France Telecom lost 4.4% after the bank reduced the rating to "sell" from "neutral."

Royal Bank of Scotland Group lost 4.4% on news the bank and its former executives are to be sued by 12,000 individuals and institutions. The group alleges that they were misled about the bank's financial health during a 2008 share sale.

Mining firms dropped in the U.K. after UBS downgraded the materials sector to "neutral" from "overweight." Shares of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto both declined 2%. Metals prices were also lower across the board.

AXA retreated 1.9% in Paris as HSBC Holdings said that it agreed to sell its Singapore insurance business to the French insurer. HSBC fell 1.4%.

U.K. utility SSE managed to close 0.3% higher, despite being fined GBP 10.5 million ($15.9 million) for misselling products. This was the largest ever punishment issued by the U.K.'s energy-industry regulator.

Markets
Fewer IPO Deals, but a Bigger Take

Companies going public on U.S. exchanges raised 29% more funds in the first quarter than in the year-ago period, and most of those that launched managed big gains, a trend that bankers said bodes well for deal activity in the months ahead.

The first quarter ushered in 25 IPOs that together raised $7.5 billion, according to data provider Dealogic. But the soaring stock market hasn't set off a burst in the number of initial public offerings, with the quarter seeing 14 fewer deals than last year.

Several factors, including a sluggish U.S. economy and Washington's fiscal uncertainty, helped keep a lid on the number of IPOs. Also, bankers said companies have watched for sustained appetite on the part of investors for new deals before putting IPO plans in gear.

"One might think IPOs would be more robust with the relatively strong market performance and low volatility," said Scott Cutler, head of global listings at NYSE Euronext. "Conditions have been stronger than the reality, but the window is open," Mr. Cutler said.

The first quarter's largest deal was Zoetis Inc., the animal-health unit of drug maker Pfizer Inc., which raised $2.57 billion in the largest deal to hit U.S. exchanges since Facebook's $16 billion debut in May. Leisure-cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., frozen-foods purveyor Pinnacle Foods Inc., and master limited partnership CVR Refining LP all raised more than $500 million apiece. All fetched prices at the high end of expectations and notched double-digit-percentage stock gains.

"We've seen a fewer number of IPOs than last year, but the deals are larger and experiencing more favorable pricing outcomes and strong aftermarket performance," said Liz Myers, head of global equity capital markets at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Many other IPOs were well-received. Building-products company Boise Cascade Co., three-dimensional printer maker ExOne Co., child-care-service provider Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. and international money-transfer service Xoom Corp. all climbed at least 40%.

More than half of the quarter's IPO volume derived from offshoots of existing companies or large firms taken to market by private-equity owners. That trend is likely to continue, bankers said, with the largest potential IPOs likely to come from private-equity firms, including biopharmaceutical-analytics provider Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc., tech hardware and software seller CDW Corp. and builder Taylor Morrison Home Corp. Each is pegged to launch deals valued at upward of $500 million. Also circling the runway to go public is Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc., Safeway Inc.'s gift-card unit.

"There's been success with sponsor-backed companies going public, particularly those focused on the housing recovery and consumer spending," said Frank Maturo, vice chairman for equity capital markets at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. "And things are starting to pick up with this trend of IPOs from carve-outs and spinoffs."

Noticeably absent in the first quarter were technology IPOs, the sector that tends to generate the highest proportion of deals. Just five tech IPOs launched in the first period, raising a total of $765 million, according to Ipreo, a market research firm. In the first quarter of 2012, 14 tech deals made up nearly a quarter of offerings and raised $1.88 billion. The U.S. maintained its position atop the global IPO leader board for total deal volume, after taking in the most in 2012.

In Asia, a quiet start to the year saw 10 new listings raise $1.05 billion in the first quarter in Hong Kong, the top global venue for IPOs from 2009 to 2011. Hong Kong has a heavy backlog, however, with companies including brokerage China Galaxy Securities Co. eyeing a $1.5 billion IPO in the coming quarter.

Europe nearly doubled the amount of funds raised through IPOs in the first quarter compared with last year, with 19 deals valued at $4.9 billion. The biggest deal came from German real-estate company LEG Immobilien AG, a $1.6 billion debut in Frankfurt. This week, upscale Italian notebook maker Moleskine SpA is slated to raise about $650 million with an offering in Milan.

Big data analytics company SiSense Ltd. has raised $10 million in its second financing round. Battery Ventures led the round, joined by current investors, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital. SiSense said that it would use the proceeds "to meet intense demand for its solution."

SiSense has raised $23 million since it was founded in 2004 by CPO Elad Israeli and CTO Eldad Farkash. The company's Prism solution operates in the area of 0.5-100 terabytes of data, the amount of data held by most of the world's businesses. The company says that its Prism solution can analyze 100 times more data than traditional in-memory solutions, at a fraction of the cost, and can analyze on one node what normally requires 20 nodes.

SiSense says that its subscription revenue rose 520% in the past year, and that it has won customers in 49 countries.

SiSense CEO Amit Bendov said, "We are experiencing exponential sales growth and incredible buzz in the market now it's time to add oil to the fire. Our biggest challenge right now is growing the sales force and the support teams quickly enough to keep up with the demand."

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Custodians respond to stronger focus on price; Controlling costs

Market forces as much as legal actions have made their mark, writes Brian Bollen

Transaction cost analysis (TCA) is going the same way in the foreign exchange markets as it did in the equities market. This will mean greater transparency, increased efficiencies in trading and greater competitiveness in pricing.

This forecast comes from Jim Cochrane, who started his professional life flying US military intelligence aircraft and is now director of analytics at New York-based Investment Technology Group.

TCA will assist clients beyond the requirements of regulatory compliance. Their attention will turn away from the question of whether they have benefited from the best execution available and towards implementation shortfall and process improvement, he adds.

TCA has been the topic of much discussion in recent years, not least because of the launch of a series of legal actions against custodian banks by US pension funds.

In the vanguard was Edmund G Brown Jr, attorney-general of California at the time. In 2009, he alleged that State Street had made excessive profits from FX transactions arising from the day-to-day servicing needs of assets belonging to the California Public Employees' Retirement System . State Street says it is vigorously defending the litigation.

Virginia and Florida filed similar suits against Bank of New York Mellon. Virginia and BNYM settled out of court on undisclosed terms in November 2012 after a judge had earlier dismissed their claim while leaving the door open for the state to refile. Virginia and BNYM subsequently renewed their relationship for another five years, the bank insisting that areas of dispute should be resolved through commercial negotiations rather than through litigation of baseless claims. "We will continue to defend ourselves where appropriate," BNYM said.

These actions traced their roots to 2003, when Calpers, the world's largest pension fund, appointed currency risk specialist Record Currency Management to analyse foreign exchange transactions. A later paper by Record, FX Transaction Costs - Plugging the Leakage in Returns , said the extent to which custodian banks profited from foreign exchange activity seemed excessive to most, especially when they failed to provide proper disclosure of actual profits. The substance of the paper remains relevant today, roughly 21 months since it was first published, says James Wood-Collins, chief executive of Record.

A year or two later something seems to have changed for the better in terms of custodian behaviour in pricing foreign exchange transactions, if anecdotal evidence can be relied upon. Mr Cochrane, for example, describes custodians as "having come inside the daily rate", whereas previously they operated some distance outside it.

This could, it must be said, owe as much to market forces as to legal actions. Torben Kaaber, chief executive of Saxo Capital Markets UK, observes that there has always been a premium associated with institutional FX trading and that continues to be the case.

However, whereas a decade ago there were very few platforms available to handle institutional requirements and going through a prime broker was a Hobson's choice, now high speed and highly sophisticated platforms are available in the market and offer a more cost-effective solution. "As a result, we see outsourcing of trading requirements - particularly in the FX space - very much as the direction of travel," he says.

The markets have moved strongly to execute online, using single-dealer platforms, multi-dealer platforms and aggregators, adds Mr Wood-Collins. As these platforms represent an increasing share of the total market they are creating a rich data set of online prices, he says. This, in turn, highlights poor practice. It very quickly becomes clear who is charging more than they ought.

Custodians have, without exception, responded to the challenges they face, offering more models for execution. They are offering clients the option of, for example, accepting the market price at the time of trading or a predetermined spread over a predetermined benchmark, Mr Wood-Collins states. Toby Cole, managing director in the FX business at RBS Markets, says that a spread of one basis point is not unrealistic, depending on the currency involved and the volume of the trade.

The heightened focus on price has also been driven by the prevailing economic conditions of recent years. Investors who may have been accustomed to annual returns around or in excess of double digits will find, suggests Mr Cole, that cutting a few basis points off their foreign exchange transaction costs can improve their Sharpe ratio significantly.

Tips for Investors

ITG's Jim Cochrane lists a number of ways investors can ensure the institutions with which they are executing FX transactions deliver the best deal.  " Ask for a time stamp  " If the custodian refuses one, cap the rate; insist on nothing beyond the high and low of the day  " Instruct the custodian to stay within a certain spread above the market rate at the time of the trade

A Galaxy Far, Far Away

A Broadway-style show was a clever way for Samsung Electronics to launch its latest smartphone, the Galaxy S4. But the event was notable as much for what wasn't mentioned, Google, as for what was.

The packed house at New York's Radio City Music Hall (capacity 6,000) was rewarded for showing up. The performance was entertaining, poking fun at the spectacle that smartphone launches have become, while successfully demonstrating key features of the new device. As Steve Jobs showed, slick presentations are important to drive momentum. And, considering that smartphones are harder to distinguish these days, brand-building may be taking on added importance.

That lesson isn't lost on Samsung. It clearly wants to blaze a more independent trail from Google, maker of the Android operating system that powers Samsung's line of popular smartphones. The search company was hardly mentioned in the presentation.

Though the latest version of Android is available on the S4, Samsung didn't emphasize the point. Key Google services like Google Maps and Google Now, a new smart assistant for answering questions, weren't discussed. The huge library of apps available via the Google Play Store, a key foundation of Android's popularity, wasn't brought up.

Instead, Samsung emphasized its own smartphone services, like a feature called S Translator that provides text-to-voice and voice-to-text translation in nine languages.

The Korean conglomerate actually has more momentum in terms of smartphone market share than any other device maker, including Apple. Samsung commanded 31% of the global smartphone market in 2012, according to Strategy Analytics, compared with 20% for Apple. In 2011, they both had roughly a 20% share.

The Android ecosystem is similar to the PC ecosystem. Like Microsoft, Google provides an operating system that hardware makers install on their devices. But Microsoft doesn't have a hardware partner with such a big market share.

Samsung is seven times as large as the collection of second-tier Android handset makers that have about 3% to 5% share each. Only a few points of market share separate Hewlett-Packard from Lenovo Group from Dell in PCs.

The risk to Google is clear. Samsung could "fork" Android, developing its own flavor of the open-source operating system that may not rely as much on Google services like search and maps. Amazon did something similar with the Android-powered Kindle Fire. Samsung is even working on its own mobile operating system, Tizen, which it plans to ship in devices later this year.

Samsung can't break away from Google any time soon. After all, a large selection of apps is vital for smartphone market share these days. But Samsung is smart to add its own software to devices, in order to avoid its hardware becoming commoditized like PC makers'.

In the same way, you can understand why software-focused Google has started to roll out its own smartphones, both its own designs and via its Motorola subsidiary. Considering the volatility that is typical of the cellphone market, demonstrated by the waning fortunes of yesterday's dominant brands Nokia and BlackBerry, it pays to hedge your bets.

As Wages Leap,

China Labors On

China's job markets are heating up. Strong demand for labor shows that factories are humming, but rising wages also are a reminder that China can no longer count on an expanding workforce to buoy its future growth.

Online recruitment firm 51job Inc. reports that 62.4% of the 24,254 firms it surveyed in the first quarter planned to boost recruitment versus a year earlier. Human-resources consultancy Manpower's survey of 4,200 firms also found stronger hiring intentions.

Demand for workers is pushing wages up. A survey of more than 300 factories in the Pearl River Delta by Standard Chartered found an average increase of 9.2% in 2013, after 7.6% in 2012.

Tight labor markets are a mixed blessing for China's economy. Rising wages boost households' share of national income -- needed to rebalance the economy toward stronger consumption.

Aggressive hiring is also a sign that demand is robust, which is reassuring after industrial output and retail-sales growth slowed in January and February.

But a fight for workers is also the latest sign that the demographic dividend that fueled China's growth for the last decade is used up. Rapid rises in wages -- if not matched productivity gains -- will lower export competitiveness, and raise inflationary pressure.

So far, the positives are winning. The World Bank estimates China's labor productivity growth at 8.3% a year, broadly in line with wage increases. But the shift in labor markets still changes the pattern of winners and losers from China's growth.

Firms targeting the mainland's mass-market consumer stand to gain the most from rising wages.

Firms exploiting the diminishing stock of low-wage workers will find it harder to labor on.

BOE Weighs In on the Pound

Sellers of sterling: Cease and desist! Bank of England governor Mervyn King has said the pound is now "properly valued" and the bank isn't trying to push it down. His comments, as well as a pause for breath in the dollar's recent rally, saw the pound touch $1.513 Friday, well off its lows for the week near $1.48, but still down 7.5% this year. But is Mr. King right?

To the markets, Mr. King's words look aimed at stemming the risk of a collapse in the pound. With U.K. growth proving elusive and uncertainties building around monetary and fiscal policy, there is a risk that foreign investors lose confidence in U.K. assets. Markets had started to bet heavily against the pound. Now they may decide to listen, at least temporarily, to Mr. King. But longer term, sterling looks set for further weakness, particularly if U.S. data continue to suggest a sustainable recovery. Royal Bank of Scotland thinks the pound could fall to the low $1.40s later this year.

From a more technical perspective, in trade-weighted terms the pound has now unwound all of 2012's appreciation, a move that some BOE policy makers had been concerned about. And in quantitative terms, Goldman Sachs thinks the fair value for the pound against the dollar is around $1.47 -- not far off current levels -- although it is undervalued against the euro.

From the perspective of economic growth, it is arguable that the fall in sterling is unwelcome, at least in the near term. The 25% depreciation that took place in 2007-2008 has delivered few obvious benefits in terms of rebalancing the economy toward exports.

The fall in sterling also threatens to exacerbate inflationary pressures, squeezing real wages, delaying debt reduction and dragging on demand. Indeed, since a significant proportion of U.K. capital-goods spending is on imports, rising prices act to damp investment and lower potential growth, UBS argues. Meanwhile, U.K. exports of financial services, a vital sector hit by the crisis, aren't likely to benefit from a weaker exchange rate.

Investors will have plenty of opportunities to decide whether they agree with Mr. King. This week will be vital, with the U.K. budget, the latest set of BOE minutes and a U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting all due on Wednesday.

With the budget expected to deliver few surprises, the BOE minutes expected to hint at fresh easing and the U.S. potentially heading toward the end of stimulus, it seems likely that sterling will come under renewed pressure.

Big Banks

Back in

Capitol's

Crosshairs

For big banks, a chill political wind again is blowing out of Washington, D.C.

Although the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve maintain the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul has essentially solved the issue of too-big-to-fail, the matter is far from resolved. And after waning in 2012, debate over what to do about financial behemoths has returned with a vengeance.

There are fresh calls from members of Congress and even some bank regulators to break up the biggest firms.

On Saturday, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher, a Democrat who has advocated breaking up the biggest banks, reiterated his stance while addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservative activists.

For investors in too-big-to-fail firms -- J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- the question is whether the newly charged political atmosphere actually could lead to additional legislative or regulatory action, and how far any initiatives could go. So far, many investors are inclined to dismiss matters as political theater -- shares in the biggest banks are up strongly over the past six months.

Arguments to dismantle too-big-firms likely would run against a formidable foe, the still-nascent economic recovery. Potential disruptions from bank break-ups, in terms of crimping lending, roiling markets and job losses, would be a strong disincentive to radical action.

That said, the renewed focus on too-big-to-fail does pose a threat to big-bank earnings and valuations.

There is talk among regulators, for example, of forcing banks to issue a minimum amount of long-term debt, cap the size of short-term liabilities or restrict the activities that can be conducted within regulated bank subsidiaries. Such moves could further constrain banks' ability to juice returns through leverage.

The danger isn't lost on banks themselves. A number of banking groups recently joined together in a public attempt to rebut notions of a big-bank borrowing subsidy.

The future shape of banking and too-big-to-fail banks is far from decided. Until it is, big-bank investors will have to keep a sharper eye on weather reports out of the Capitol.

-- David Reilly

Overheard

In order to get Yahoo back in gear, Marissa Mayer has taken a number of pro-productivity initiatives. But a big explanation for her company's more than 40% stock price jump since she signed on as CEO? Financial engineering. After repurchasing $1.5 billion of stock in the fourth quarter, Yahoo bought back $663 million more in January and February, at an average price of $20.23. That brings the total to $2.1 billion since October (average price: $18.78). The buyback activity kicked into higher gear in November, a bit more than a month after cash rolled in from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba repurchasing its own shares from Yahoo. Buybacks aren't the only reason Yahoo is up. Even after cutting its Alibaba stake, Yahoo still owns 24% of the company. And Alibaba grew sales a massive 74% to $4.1 billion in the fiscal year ending September 2012 according to Yahoo's 10-K. It also generated $688 million of operating profit. Neither buybacks nor Alibaba's success have anything to do with a turnaround at Yahoo, however. That is still very much in the works, never mind the stock price.

-- Is now the time to dive into the stock market? Or has the market already risen too much? Or shouldn't I even be thinking about investing this way? Those are some of the questions many investors are asking themselves these days.

To gather insights into these issues, we recently put these questions and others to The Experts -- an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics raised in Wall Street Journal Reports, including this month's Investing in Funds & ETFs Report.

To read what else The Experts have to say about investing and wealth, go to WSJ.com/WealthReport.

Is It Time to Dive Into the Stock Market?

Take a Long View

The answer is yes for anyone who is investing money for the long term. Bonds paying 2% or 3% are simply not going to build your wealth or preserve your ability to purchase future goods and services. Plus, from a valuation standpoint, stocks look cheap relative to bonds.

-- Charles Rotblut , a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors , a vice president with the

Equities Are Attractive

No one can consistently time the market, and certainly following public fund flows in and out of equity funds is a terrible timing technique. But we do know that even after their recent run-up, equities are attractive relative to bonds, and starting a program of dollar-cost averaging into equities is likely to provide reasonable long-run rates of return.

-- Burton G. Malkiel, Chemical Bank chairman's professor of economics, emeritus, and senior economist at Princeton University , and author of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street."

For My Sake, Buy, Buy, Buy!

Should you dive into the stock market? Absolutely. And if you have no money to invest, I recommend getting cash advances against your credit cards. And stop eating, entertaining and saving for your kids' educations. Sell your blood if you need to. Put all of that extra money in the stock market. My reasoning is simple: I own stocks and I want you to drive up their prices.

-- Scott Adams, creator of the Dilbert comic strip

No Diving

The phrase "dive into the stock market" is unfortunately apt to a lot of consumers whose financial behavior is dictated primarily by fear or greed. A lot of consumers have been waiting since 2008 or 2009 to "get back in," when in reality they should have never been out.

-- Eleanor Blayney , consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board

Waiting for What?

Investors waiting for market volatility to calm down and for more certainty will be waiting for the rest of their lives.

-- George U. "Gus" Sauter, a senior consultant to Vanguard Group, and Vanguard's chief investment officer from 2003 through 2012

Lots of Positives

There are plenty of positive signs for equity markets. U.S. business and households have been deleveraging. Inflation is in check across the G-7 countries, even as central-bank balance sheets climb higher. The housing market in the U.S. is improving. Prospective home-buyer activity has picked up considerably, and new-home sales have historically tracked this trend.

Developing markets continue to be an area of strength as well. Compared with developed markets, emerging countries continue to experience solid growth and have low government debt as a percentage of GDP.

With that said, I like to manage investors' expectations, especially when it comes to anticipating potential downside volatility. However, I would challenge investors to see down days as buying opportunities.

-- Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors

Bonds: A Darker Picture

Bonds aren't the ultimate "safe haven" some paint them to be. They are simply one type of income investment that is subject to risks that will ebb and flow. And for today, it appears the risks to the average bond investor are considerable.

-- Christian Magoon, CEO of Magoon Capital

How Should Investors Stop Themselves from Reacting To Short-Term Market Events?

Keep Some Play Money

First, I keep 10% of my money to play with. Ninety percent is off-limits, and with the other 10% I can do whatever I want. Any less than that and I'm tempted to muck with the other 90%; any more than that and I'll ruin my financial future.

Second, I've learned to think about downturns as opportunities. If you can make that switch in your head, so that you're excited when things go down because it offers the chance to buy more, you're in a better place.

-- Matt Hougan, president of ETF Analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC

Keep Your Emotions At Bay

1. Don't be afraid to call your financial adviser if your nerves get worked up.

2. Your asset allocation should align with your financial plan.

3. If you tend to be a highly nervous investor, looking at your account daily or even weekly is probably not a good idea.

4. Remember that corrections are sometimes healthy for the stock market.

5. You may want to use those corrective periods as a buying opportunity. Put a smile on your face and be happy that you are buying shares at a cheaper price.

-- Michelle Perry Higgins, a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors

What Noise?

My view of successful investing relies on three key principles: philosophy, strategy and discipline. If you have a sound philosophy and implement a prudent strategy based on it, then you'll find the discipline to ignore the noise and stay the course.

-- Rick Ferri, founder of Portfolio Solutions and author of six books on low-cost index-fund and ETF investing

Write It Down

Before you buy a stock, bond or fund, think about what is attracting you to it and what could cause you to sell it. Then write your thoughts down. Coming up with your sell rules makes you think about what could go wrong, and if you can't come up with clear sell rules, then you should be aware that you don't understand the risks of the investment.

-- Charles Rotblut

Run the Right Race

Concentrate on what you can control and avoid watching CNBC or anything with a stock ticker or market pundit. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint.

-- George Papadopoulos, founder of the eponymous fee-only wealth-management firm based in Novi, Mich.

Trust in Two Things

First, eliminate short-term mistakes and find a trustworthy adviser. Second, avoid trading your portfolio monthly and look to periodically (annually) rebalance your asset allocation.

-- John Rogers , president and CEO of the CFA Institute

Play Games You Can Afford

A person with $100 million can afford to "play" with $10 million, placing them all on red and losing fast or trading online and losing slowly. But a family with a $100,000 retirement portfolio cannot afford to play with $10,000 and lose. Play videogames if you must. Play basketball if you wish. But don't play away money you need for a secure retirement.

-- Meir Statman, Glenn Klimek professor of finance at Santa Clara University , and visiting professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands

How Should an Investor Decide Whether to Dump a Mutual Fund That Has Been Doing Poorly?

Wait Three Years?

A better-performing fund should be solidly in the top half of performance of similar funds over a three-year period. If your fund is below the top half, do some research on the investment style of the fund: Maybe it's just not the right external environment for that investment style. Finally, is the fund growing or shrinking or has the portfolio manager recently changed?

-- Larry D. Zimpleman , chairman, president and chief executive officer of Principal Financial Group , chairman, president and chief executive officer of

Consult Your List

Have a mutual-fund-criteria list. This is a list of all your "must-haves" in the mutual fund.

For example, a few of the criteria on my list are performance, expense ratios, risk, fund-manager tenure and fund minimum. I recommend staying committed to your criteria in the good and bad market cycles

-- Michelle Perry Higgins

Forget the Magical Thinking

Decisions about dumping a fund doing poorly are reserved for people who invest in active funds, worrying that a fund manager has lost the magical skills which have drawn them into the fund. In truth, it is more likely that magical good luck had drawn them into the fund years ago and equally magical bad luck is repelling them now.

Investors in low-cost index funds need not agonize over such decisions.

-- Meir Statman

How Many Strikes?

Does the manager have a rational approach to managing money? Can he or she articulate why he or she should be able to outperform? Has the manager stuck to his or her strategy over both good and bad periods? Finally, has the team that is managing the money been stable? Has it added new top-notch talent? A swing and a miss on any of these questions may not warrant dismissal, but two strikes is pretty serious.

-- George U. Sauter

Long-Term Losers

Some funds do achieve consistently poor performance. If your fund has been consistently underperforming for some years, it might make sense to dump it.

-- Terrance Odean, Rudd Family Foundation professor and chair of the Finance Group at Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley

Performance Can Be Luck

Most decisions about managers end up being based much too heavily on performance. Unfortunately, it might be nothing more than statistical noise or an outgrowth of lucky risk-taking that will ultimately do you harm. You can avoid active management and focus on index funds. You probably don't have the skills and time to select good managers, so why try?

-- Tom Brakke, chartered financial analyst, consultant, writer and investment adviser

Let the Category Be Your Guide

Mutual funds, and ETFs, should be compared against their category and style peers. If a fund's performance is in line with its peers, then the fund may well be worth holding on to even if its absolute performance is lousy. Take a step back, consider what asset classes and investment styles you want to be allocated to, and then pick and hold on to good funds that match your needs.

-- Charles Rotblut

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- Exchange-Traded Funds: ETF Information Overload! --- How to screen so many products? Here are websites that can help

By Murray Coleman

4 March 2013
The Wall Street Journal

As investors continue to flock to exchange-traded funds, many experts are warning that growth in the marketplace is creating a sort of "information overload" for ETF shoppers.

Some 178 new ETFs were launched in the U.S. last year alone, researcher Morningstar Inc. says. That pushed the total to 1,446 portfolios, covering a gamut of styles and themes.

The total number is a 70% increase since 2008, even after subtracting funds that didn't gain traction and were liquidated.

"A flood of new products is making screening for the best ETFs a bit overwhelming at times, even for more experienced investors," says Andrew Ahrens, a financial adviser in Lafayette, La.

Most ETFs are passively managed portfolios, and "at first glance, they might seem fairly simple to research," says Barry Glassman, an adviser in McLean, Va. But with more ETFs focused on very narrow slices of the market or tracing unique investment themes, "it's becoming a much more nuanced marketplace with increasingly exotic indexes," he says.

Here's a look at what advisers and investors say are useful online resources for ETF investors:

-- Morningstar.com: Free materials on this site include ETF spotlight articles, volatility and risk ratings for various ETFs, total returns for funds going back as far as 15 years and portfolio breakdowns by individual securities, as well as sectors. Things like detailed portfolio reviews and analysis require a premium membership, which costs $195 a year.

"As a professional, I've decided it's worthwhile to pay up for some of Morningstar's extra features," says Brad Stratton, an adviser in Overland Park, Kan. "But a lot of novice investors probably won't see a need to dip into their wallets."

-- ETFdb.com: Free resources on this Chicago-based site include screening tools to sort through ETFs by asset class, region, expenses and other specific requirements. Also included are direct links to company sites to find specific information. The firm's analysts also frequently write about trends between different groups and types of ETFs.

Nathan Geraci, president of the ETF Store, an independent investment adviser in Kansas City, Mo., recommends the "Mutual Fund to ETF Converter" (on the Free Tools tab) that allows investors to type in a ticker symbol for a mutual fund and find comparable ETFs. For example, a recent search using the Pimco Total Return fund produced more than a dozen different names, including Pimco's like-named ETF.

For an annual subscription of $199, users can also get recommended model portfolios and additional analysis.

-- IndexUniverse.com: This San Francisco-based ETF researcher has had an Internet site featuring a mix of articles and data-screening tools for more than a decade. But in recent years it has been beefing up its analytics resources and developing a database that is designed to categorize ETF information in a more easily digestible fashion.

Such refinements are helping researchers at Beacon Trust in Morristown, N.J., cut their time devoted to selecting ETFs nearly in half, says analyst Julie Morris. "I can filter down our choices with such granularity," she says. For instance, from the universe of emerging-markets stock ETFs, she can quickly eliminate those that are regionally focused to home in on those that take a narrower view.

A premium service offering more detailed data costs about $2,000 a year.

-- XTF.com: This site is a longtime favorite of many ETF-savvy investors, including Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group in New York. Its performance charts and portfolio data can be combined with fund-flow analysis and liquidity screens to rate ETFs in a number of different ways. XTF also provides a more advanced set of tools for fees ranging from $39 to $99 a month.

"There are several robust sites around, but we like the flexibility XTF gives us in presenting data and uncovering relationships between different types of ETFs," Mr. Colas says.

-- ETF-Company Sites: When researching a single fund or a group of ETFs within the same family, investors should go right to the source, suggests Jerry Slusiewicz, an adviser in Laguna Hills, Calif. He points out that sites from fund companies such as Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc.'s iShares unit and State Street Corp.'s State Street Global Advisors often provide the best-scrubbed summaries of basic portfolio data.

In response to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323375204578267724288429176.html" on a "Mutual Fund Madness" tournament that discussed the mistake of focusing too much on short-term performance, The Wall Street Journal asked The Experts: How should investors stop themselves from reacting to short-term market events?

Terrance Odean: Review Fund Performance Once a Quarter at Most

My advice would be to not check your funds' performance more than once a quarter. There may be exceptional circumstances that require more frequently monitoring. Personally, I review the performance of funds I hold about once a year. And I make changes far less often.

Terrance Odean is the Rudd Family Foundation Professor and Chair of the Finance Group at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

Matt Hougan: Keep Some Mad Money in Your Portfolio

Everyone knows what to do. Write down your plan so it's committed to paper. Have a financial adviser so you have someone who will talk you off the edge before you sell. Only look at your portfolio on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.

It all sounds great and it is but for most people, it won't work.

People are human. And if you're reading The Wall Street Journal, you're interested in the markets, which means you want to react. I work for a company called IndexUniverse and even I want to react.

What do I do? Two things:

First, I keep 10% of my money to play with. Ninety percent is off-limits, and with the other 10% I can do whatever I want. Any less than that and I'm tempted to muck with the other 90%; any more than that and I'll ruin my financial future.

Second, I've learned to think about downturns as opportunities. If you can make that switch in your head, so that you're excited when things go down because it offers the chance to buy more, you're in a better place.

Rick Ferri to Matt Hougan: Have More Faith in the Financial Adviser

I disagree with Matt Hougan's view that having a financial adviser doesn't work to keep clients invested during market downturns. A financial adviser "circuit breaker" can be the cheapest insurance an investor can buy.

A sizable number of clients called us for advice during the financial crisis. Our consistent message was the same for all this storm will pass, stay the course.

The vast majority of our clients stayed disciplined and made no change in strategy, a very small percentage required a small change in allocation, and only a few clients eventually capitulated. We couldn't save everyone, but we definitely had a positive impact.

Michelle Perry Higgins: Follow These Five Tips to Ease Emotional Investing

This is the million dollar question. Another way to say it might be, "How do investors keep their emotions in check during chaotic times?" I'll admit that I become emotional from time to time with my kids, my husband and when my 49ers lose the Super Bowl. However, emotion has no place when it comes to investing.

Here are five tips I recommend to keep you focused with your investments when it may be tough to keep emotions at bay:

1.Don't be afraid to call your financial adviser if your nerves get worked up. Talk through your asset allocation, financial plan and current market events. There's no such thing as a stupid question, so don't be afraid to call.

2.Your asset allocation should align with your financial plan. If you are going to need cash within the next 7-10 years (i.e. income, home purchase, college funding or new vehicle) then those dollars should be out of the stock market. Irrational behavior can occur if you have money at risk that is needed in the short term.

3.If you tend to be a highly nervous investor, looking at your account daily or even weekly is probably not a good idea. You may want to consider viewing your investments a little less frequently.

4.Remember that corrections are sometimes healthy for the stock market. My clients always look at me cross-eyed when I say this, but it's true. The point here is that there is not necessarily a need for panic when corrections occur. "http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/06/why_investors_f.html".

5.You may want to use those corrective periods in the stock market as a buying opportunity. Put a smile on your face and be happy that you are buying shares at a cheaper price.

Rick Ferri: Stay Disciplined With a Sound Investment Philosophy and Smart Strategy

Reacting to events and short-term market movements is the symptom of a bigger problem. It signals the lack of an investment philosophy.

My view of successful investing relies on three key principals: philosophy, strategy and discipline. Philosophy is an understanding about how markets work and a belief about whether or not prices can be predicted. Strategy is how a portfolio is constructed based on an investor's unique needs. Discipline is the willingness to stay true to the philosophy and follow a strategy.

I'll use myself as an example.

Philosophy: I have learned that the markets price securities in a relatively efficient manner and attempts to beat the markets most often result in lower returns than just riding them.

Strategy: I follow an aggressive balanced portfolio using all low-cost stock and bond index funds and ETFs. This strategy is based on my need for portfolio growth and future income.

Discipline: My strategy is on autopilot. I am a diligent do-it-yourself investor and do not deviate based on the noise. Other options for discipline include investing in a balanced index fund or hiring a low-cost adviser to manage the portfolio.

If you have a sound philosophy and implement a prudent strategy based on it, then you'll find the discipline to ignore the noise and stay the course.

Tom Brakke: Model the Behavior You Want Your Clients to Have

It depends on the situation, of course, since some people are more analytical and some more emotional. Like any form of communication, the more precisely you can tailor the message for the audience the better it is.

An investment policy statement can be very helpful, depending on how it is written and whether it truly explores the investment beliefs of the investor and provides a road map for the investor and the adviser.

For example, if an investment policy statement says, "We don't react to short-term events" and "We don't choose investments based upon historical performance," then you have an agreed-upon foundation on which to proceed and a simple reminder of that is usually sufficient.

Interestingly, advisers can be their own worst enemies in this regard, causing rather than solving problems. While it is common for them to fret about clients reacting to events and performance issues, consider what actually happens much of the time:

Rather than avoiding near-term events, many advisers use them as the cornerstone of their client communications (newsletters, emails, etc.), heightening rather than diminishing the interest in the events. And, a client might hear recorded market commentary while on hold, as I recently did, or visit an adviser's office where CNBC is playing throughout the day. All of those things might make an adviser look more "in the know," but they are counterproductive if you want clients to quit worrying about every little problem and market movement.

Similarly, the focus on performance that clients have can be fanned by the advisers themselves. Many advisers won't show a fund that doesn't have four or five stars from Morningstar, yet that is nothing more than a quantitative grade based upon past performance. Relying on those stars (or other ratings like them) is the same as clients overreacting to a 5% drop in the market; behavioral scientists call it recency bias and it is pervasive among investors, from individuals to advisers to hedge fund managers.

So, speaking to advisers, I'd say the most important thing to do is to model the behaviors that you would like your clients to have. That may lead you to reconsider some of your current practices.

Charles Rotblut : Set Clear Sell Rules Before Buying a Stock

Here is a simple strategy for deciding when it is time to part with an investment: Before you buy a stock, bond or fund, think about what is attracting you to it and what could cause you to sell it. Then write your thoughts down. I use a spiral notebook to do this, but a sheet of paper, a blog or a whiteboard work just as well anything that will later require you to physically alter what you wrote down.

There are a few reasons why this is a very effective strategy. First, since these are your personal sell rules, you are more likely to follow them. Second, the process of coming up with your sell rules makes you think about what could go wrong, and if you can't come up with clear sell rules, then you should be aware that you don't understand the risks of the investment. Third, one of the oldest rules is to sell an investment when the reasons you bought it no longer apply. Finally, if you do this before you place the buy order, you will have less of an emotional attachment to the investment and will be better able to make a rational analysis of it.

Christian Magoon: A One-Act on Long Term Investing

Consider this hypothetical conversation:

"How old are you?" I replied to an excited question about the latest market trend.

"I'm 45. Why?" the man said.

"You'll understand in a minute. First I need to know your age in more specific terms," I responded.

"Seriously? OK, I am officially about 45 years and about three months old. Good enough?" the man sneered.

"Actually, it isn't. Be more specific," I said with a smirk. "How old are you, in days?"

"This is ridiculous!" he yelled.

"Exactly," I smiled and said. "Adults don't keep track of their age in days or months because they are insignificant in comparison to years. Years are what matter."

"True," he nodded. "So what's your point?"

"Just like keeping track of age works better using years, investing decisions work better when based on years not months, weeks or days. You began this conversation asking me what I thought of the latest market trend, right?"

"Yes, about an hour ago," he sighed while tapping his foot.

George Papadopoulos: Communicate to Clients That Investing Should Be as Fun as Watching Paint Dry

Concentrate on what you can control and avoid watching CNBC or anything with a stock ticker or market pundit.

Investing is a marathon, not a sprint. I often remind clients that financial markets do regularly go down unexpectedly and the question is not if but when this will happen again. Anything is possible in the short term. We always take the long-term approach sticking to the financial plan we have in place and our spectacularly boring investment style: A low-cost diversified portfolio consisting of broad-based ETFs that is rebalanced at set intervals while being mindful of opportunities to save on taxes.

Ben Graham , the father of value investing, once said: "Individuals who cannot master their emotions are ill-suited to profit from the investment process." In many ways, we are getting paid to help clients make sound financial decisions and keep them focused on the long term in a disciplined manner. Rebalancing at set intervals forces us to "buy low and sell high."

We will always wage battles against the emotions of greed and fear.

This is why it is so important to know your client well. In the client-screening process, I make it very clear that I am not a stock picker and my investment style is as exciting as watching paint dry. Some people need the excitement that comes from buying a stock and watching it. They need to have that feeling of being a player embracing their inner Warren Buffett . (Why does it always seem to be men who fall into this category?) I understand it. I am perfectly fine if they take up to 5% of their portfolio and go open a "mad money" account at E*Trade and trade it like the E*Trade baby. After a while, they give up.

John Rogers : It's Not Just Individual Investors Who Need to Correct Nearsighted Investing

There are two proven ways for investors to avoid the trap of overreacting to short-term market moves: First, eliminate short term mistakes and find a trustworthy adviser. Second, avoid trading your portfolio monthly and look to periodically (annually) rebalance your asset allocation.

The dangers of nearsightedness are just as great in management teams and boards. An excessive short-term focus by top management can hurt investors in multiple ways and detracts from long-term value creation and investment. One way to avoid this is to build truly visionary board leadership to foster and promote longer-term thinking.

Boards of directors and corporate executives can combat the short-term thinking that has tripped up companies with depressing regularity. They can do this by focusing on these points:

 " Embracing the role of visionary stewards on behalf of stakeholders

 " Eschewing the quarterly earnings guidance game

 " Communicating long-term strategic goals to stakeholders

 " Ensuring that compensation is adequately linked to long term strategy

 " Compensating executives with a clear focus on long-term value creation

 " Providing strong risk oversight for the firm

 " Being fierce advocates for a strong corporate culture that will serve their stakeholders

 " Emphasizing the importance of board culture with independent-minded directors willing to address difficult decisions

By focusing on what is most important over the long term, boards can ensure more enduring and sustainable value creation for stakeholders.

Meir Statman to Matt Hougan: Mad Money Isn't Right for Every Portfolio

A person with $100 million can afford to "play" with $10 million, placing them all on red and losing fast or trading online and losing slowly. But a family with a $100,000 retirement portfolio cannot afford to play with $10,000 and lose. Play videogames if you must. Play basketball if you wish. But don't play away money you need for a secure retirement.

Gus Sauter : For Market Success, Brace Yourself for a Long, Volatile Ride

The classic advice was to buy your securities, put them in a drawer and not look at them again until you retire. Unfortunately, things have changed. We don't get certificates to stick in a drawer anymore. Instead, we get statements quarterly or even monthly and we have Internet access to our investments 24/7. We are bombarded with information and pundits state   with no uncertainty   what the markets will do. So, with two very significant bear markets imprinted in our minds, it's not surprising that investors respond with a hair-trigger reaction to even a slight disturbance in the market.

The most successful antidote to cure investors' propensity to overreact to short-term events is education. In many aspects of our lives, our expectations for the future are shaped by our experiences of the past. And we anticipate that the most recent experiences, the ones freshest in our minds, are most likely to be repeated. To overcome this overreaction, investors should understand three things:

1. Success is earned by focusing on the long term   both backward and forward. The historic bull market of the 1980's and 90's is fading from memory for many investors. It's important to remember that even with meager returns during this century, the market returns over the past thirty years and longer have been very favorable. Looking forward over a long time horizon I believe the market is more likely to provide returns similar to the longer-term historic returns than those of the recent past.

2. The stock market always has been and always will be volatile. That is why stocks have provided a superior return to other asset classes. Quite simply, investors would not suffer the volatility of the market if they weren't rewarded for it. So realize that there will be sharp, even scary pullbacks from time to time.

3. Very, very few investors outperform the market by trying to time it. Instead, investors who do try to time market swings typically sell out after the market has pulled back and then buy back in at higher prices.

So, realize that the stock market is likely to outperform other types of investments over the long term. It can be, and most assuredly will be, a wild ride. And, most investors will not outperform the market. So ignore all of the noise and hyperbole and be satisfied with what the market returns over the long term.

To be forewarned is to be forearmed.

Shopping fight hots up as Chinese banks seek to use client data, writes Simon Rabinovitch

Banks are not normally the floggers of kettles and smartphones, duvets and leather shoes. But China Construction Bank, the world's second-largest lender by market value, is undeterred by convention.

Half a year ago CCB launched an online mall, buy.ccb.com, in a move akin to HSBC directly taking on Amazon.

While a few western banks such as Bank of America have launched internet shopping portals linked to big retailers, CCB's ambition goes well beyond that. It wants to become a fully fledged ecommerce site that is home to thousands of vendors, big and small.

CCB's move is a highly unusual strategic decision for a bank, and highlights two new facts of life in China's banking sector.

First, the country's banks, long coddled by the government, suddenly find themselves in a fiercely competitive landscape.

Second, the fight for control of "big data" is heating up in China as banks seek to marshal as much information as they can about their clients.

"We have to keep customers on our platform, otherwise the space that we occupy in the value chain and the service chain will be squeezed narrower and narrower," Pang Xiusheng, vice-president of CCB, told the Financial Times.

The opening shot in the battle was fired five years ago not by a banker but by an internet pioneer.

In an address to a business forum, Jack Ma, founder of China's largest ecommerce company Alibaba, criticised banks for their reluctance to lend to small and medium-sized businesses. "If banks don't change, we will change banks," he said.

Mr Ma started out by co-operating with banks. Backed by CCB, he launched AliLoan in 2007, a lending programme focused on small companies.

The idea was to combine strengths. Alibaba had reams of information about its users and had pieced together detailed credit records for them. CCB was sitting on heaps of money and was hungry for good borrowers, but was wary of the risks of lending to small businesses with no credit histories.

This co-operation came to an end in 2011 when the agreement between Alibaba and CCB expired and was not renewed.

People familiar with the partnership say Alibaba realised how valuable its store of credit data was for banks and demanded a bigger cut of lending profits.

The biggest point of contention for CCB, though, was not money, but rather the way it was being sidelined in the ecommerce business. That had become an extremely lucrative terrain, with online transactions increasing 30 per cent to Rmb5.9tn ($947bn) in 2011.

"We made lots of attempts to capture some of this market, but in the end all the data about our clients and their transaction behaviour was in the hands of third parties," Mr Pang says.

The former partners struck out independently, Alibaba using its own funds to lend via its AliFinance website and CCB launching its own ecommerce site.

The race is on to see which one will be successful in breaking into the other's territory: Alibaba as a lender or CCB as a shopping platform.

Alibaba has a head start. By mid-2012 it had extended Rmb28bn in loans to more than 130,000 small businesses. In the six months since its founding, CCB says its ecommerce site has registered 10,000 stores and has hosted Rmb3.5bn in transactions.

An executive in the tech industry says he believes Alibaba has a lead over CCB because, as an ecommerce platform, it is closer to small businesses .

"Whether it's ecommerce or financial, the key is data. The players that have the best data will win," he says

Alibaba declined to comment.

Other banks are not waiting for the results of CCB's foray into ecommerce. Bank of Communications, China's fifth-biggest listed lender, opened an online shopping mall in September.

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and China Minsheng Bank are all believed to be looking at launching similar websites.

"Competition is very severe now for Chinese banks, and information about clients is the key for their competitiveness," said May Yan, an analyst with Barclays. "Big banks actually have an advantage because they already have a very big database."

Yet ecommerce will not come easily. Chinese banks are largely state-owned and have long been protected by the government from competition in their core lending businesses.

In online shopping they are up against internet companies that hail from the private sector and have been some of China's most innovative enterprises over the past decade.

"Big banks will be constrained by the system," says Zhang Meng of Analysys, a Beijing-based internet research firm. "They will not have the same innovation, market savviness and service standards as the privately run ecommerce platforms."

32%: Proportion of U.S. corporate cash holdings invested in corporate debt at the end of November

Companies continue to plow the largest portion of their cash holdings into corporate debt as they look for safe investments providing better returns than U.S. Treasurys.

As of Nov. 29, treasurers had allocated just over 32% of their cash to corporate debt, a gain of 0.2 percentage point from the beginning of the month and the second consecutive monthly increase, according to data from Clearwater Analytics. Clearwater estimates its data represent 20% of all U.S. corporate cash holdings.

The share of corporate cash held in agency bonds, on the other hand, shrank in October and November. John Spengler, a senior portfolio manager for Clearwater Advisors, said the narrower spreads between agency bonds and Treasurys made corporate debt more appealing to cash managers.

"As agency spreads compressed in October, corporate investors chose to pursue high-grade corporate bonds as an alternative" with a greater yield premium to Treasurys, he said.

Commercial paper increased its share of corporate cash in November to 9% from 8.5% at the beginning of the month. The short maturity of commercial paper makes it "an attractive placeholder" ahead of anticipated year-end volatility, said Tim Dunn, also a senior portfolio manager at Clearwater.

Corporate debt is by far the largest investment category among all asset types tracked by Clearwater. That's the case even though its percentage share of company cash actually shrank from month to month until October, after hitting just over 34% in May, its highest level in at least five years. The second-largest investment vehicle for company cash is U.S. government debt, at 25% of the total.

Corporate News: Macerich to Buy 2 New York Malls

Mall-giant Macerich Co. has agreed to buy two large malls in the New York area for $1.25 billion, underscoring that buyers are still willing to pay lofty prices for lucrative properties in difficult-to-enter markets.

Macerich, which owns 62 U.S. malls, will pay $751 million for the Kings Plaza mall in Brooklyn and $500 million for the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, N.Y. Both are being purchased from units of Vornado Realty Trust.

Each mall generates significant sales per square foot -- $650 a square foot annually at Kings Plaza and $520 at Green Acres. The industry average is $370.

The malls' location in the New York market also enhances their value because they serve a populous market and competing properties aren't likely to be built any time soon.

"They're both in urban or semiurban environments where it would be very difficult to replicate them," says Dan Fasulo, managing director of real-estate research company Real Capital Analytics. "That creates tremendous scarcity value."

The combined price Macerich will pay for the malls amounts to a first-year yield that's roughly in the 5.5% range. A lower yield means a higher value for the property, and the yield in the Macerich deal highlights the premium the two malls fetched because of their New York locations. According to Real Capital Analytics, the average yield on high-end U.S. mall sales in the past 12 months was 6.2%,

Analysts say that the price paid indicates that both malls are good properties with room to improve in strong, dense markets. "Doing $500 a foot [in sales] in the New York metro area is midlevel because of the density of people," says Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill + Partners.

For Santa Monica, Calif.-based Macerich, the purchases strengthen the company's foothold in the New York market. It already owns Queens Center mall on Long Island and the Shops at Atlas Park in Glendale.

Macerich Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Art Coppola said in an interview that the company intends to bolster sales at Kings Plaza and Green Acres by replacing stores with low sales productivity with better-selling tenants. He declined to give specifics on anticipated changes at each mall.

Kings Plaza is 1.2 million square feet, and Green Acres is 1.8 million.

Mr. Coppola added that Macerich has experience managing high-volume malls. "There are no security issues at either (Kings Plaza or Green Acres), other than the issues that come with high population density anywhere in the U.S.," he said.

Macerich anticipates finalizing the purchases late this year or early in 2013. New York-based Vornado, which owns office properties and high-end, urban retail properties, sold the malls as part of its effort to exit the mall market. Brokerage Eastdil Secured represented Vornado in the deals.

Loan Rollovers Mount in China --- Critics Call the Practice 'Extend and Pretend' and Warn About Growth of Bad Debt

BEIJING -- Greentown China Holdings Ltd. has a problem. The property developer has to repay nearly $3 billion in debt in the next 12 months, but it had only $1.2 billion in cash and bank deposits as of the end of June, according to its latest regulatory filing.

To stay afloat, Greentown, based in the wealthy eastern province of Zhejiang, is counting on its banks rolling over loans.

"There is no problem for us to get the loan extensions," said Simon Fung, Greentown's chief financial officer. Mr. Fung pointed to a coup the company pulled off last year: Even as Beijing moved to tame the housing market, which hurt the company's profits, Greentown managed to get its banks to stretch out the maturities of all its loans that came due, totaling about 20 billion yuan ($3.2 billion).

Greentown isn't alone in counting on banks' willingness not to ask for their money back when it is due.

Although Chinese lenders don't disclose how many loans they extend or modify, the practice is becoming increasingly popular, according to companies and banking executives.

The strategy -- called "extend and pretend" by critics -- is raising alarms among analysts and bank investors. They warn that it could add to banks' increasing piles of bad loans and may restrict banks' ability to lend to bolster the slowing economy.

Chen Zuofu, a vice president at China Construction Bank Corp., the country's second-largest lender by assets, said in August that the lender rolled over nearly eight billion yuan of loans in the first half of this year, up about 10% from a year earlier. Still, that represents only a fraction of the 6.9 trillion yuan of loans it held at the end of June.

"We have relatively strict requirements" when it comes to extending maturing loans, Mr. Chen said, adding that the bank applies the practice to "quality clients, companies and projects."

Suntech Power Holdings Co., a large solar-panel maker in eastern China's Jiangsu province, has nearly $1.6 billion of debt coming due this year, the majority owed to Chinese banks. Suntech said in a statement that it intends to roll over "the vast majority of our short-term credit facilities into new credit facilities."

Catic Shenzhen Holdings Ltd., a manufacturer in the southern city of Shenzhen, said in an August regulatory filing that the company is "confident" in its ability to renew its outstanding bank loans due this year.

Yvonne Zhang, a senior banking analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the rollover practice appears to be spreading, though it is hard to gauge how broadly because of a lack of disclosure by Chinese banks. In particular, Ms. Zhang estimates that banks have extended "a very big portion" of maturing loans to local-government projects so that the loan terms match the time needed to finish the projects, which is usually longer than three years.

Loan extensions could "delay banks' problems into the future," she said.

Greentown's Mr. Fung said most of its bank loans are short term, between 1 1/2 years and two years, as it is difficult for companies to get long-term loans in China. As a result, it is "common practice" for banks to give borrowers more time to repay the loans, he said. Greentown also plans to use proceeds from asset sales to repay loans and is seeking longer-term financing by turning to banks in Hong Kong, Mr. Fung said.

China's economy has slowed from a growth rate of 8.1% in the first quarter to 7.6% in the second quarter. That is still a healthy rate compared with flagging western economies, but it its the lowest pace since the global financial crisis. Early data from the current quarter suggest that the slowdown has continued. The weaker growth has led to predictions from economists that Beijing would try to stimulate the economy with monetary and fiscal policy.

But China hasn't acted since it cut interest rates in July. It also hasn't moved rapidly to finance new construction projects, a key element of its 2009 response to the global financial crisis.

Part of the reason, analysts say, is the limited ability of Chinese banks to make new loans. Lenders are burdened by hundreds of billions of dollars of loans made in 2009 and 2010 that banks must collect, renew or recognize as bad debt.

State-owned banks, many of which are listed both in mainland China and Hong Kong, traditionally have played a pivotal role in carrying out government policies because they are more beholden to their biggest shareholder -- the Chinese government -- than are other lenders. This time, fears are rising that these state-controlled banks are playing extend and pretend with loans accounting for much of the total.

"It's a big macro phenomenon," said Stephen Green, China economist at Standard Chartered. "You've already seen less money coming into the country, and the central bank hasn't moved aggressively to free up the liquidity. At the same time, loan extensions could further limit banks' ability to lend to new borrowers."

So far, Chinese regulators have largely endorsed banks' forgiving approach to maturing loans. Regulators allow banks to extend the maturities of loans to borrowers who haven't encountered any "substantial deterioration" in their businesses and finances.

Banks usually shouldn't roll over loans to borrowers whose credit quality has worsened, the rules say, but can do so if a borrower pays all the interest owed and an unspecified part of the principal.

Regulators also allow banks to extend the terms of loans through refinancing, as well as to restructure loans to those who have suffered difficulties in their businesses. The rules, though, don't spell out how any of the modifications should be carried out.

"This is a reasonable loan-workout framework set by Chinese regulators," said Zhu Chaoping, head of research and analytics at ChinaScope Financial, a research firm.

"But it all comes down to how banks interpret the rules," Mr. Zhu said. "Given the increased capital requirements on Chinese banks, they certainly have the incentives to get around the rules to avoid recognizing losses while preserving capital."

Loan extensions or other modifications can increase the odds for banks to get repaid later. But the strategy amounts to a bet that the economy will rebound enough for borrowers to earn the money to repay the debt. If it doesn't work, the banks could be forced to write off the loans and take a hit to earnings.

Partly because of those concerns, shares in Chinese banks are trading near record-low valuations in the Hong Kong market. "The slowing economy, which has recently caused a drop in loan-demand growth, is creating some near-term uncertainties for the banks," said Frank Yao, senior portfolio manager for Neuberger Berman's Greater China investment team.

Some analysts say extending maturing loans, rather than calling them in, has helped hold down Chinese banks' bad-loan ratios. China Construction Bank said its ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans fell to 1% as of June 30 from 1.09% as of the end of 2011 despite the slowing Chinese economy, while Bank of China Ltd. reported the percentage dipped to 0.94% from 0.97%.

The rollover practice has "distorted the figures and kept banks' nonperforming-loan ratio low," said Charlene Chu, head of Chinese financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. "It will take a long time for banks' nonperforming-loan ratios to catch up."

China Construction Bank's Mr. Chen said stretching out loan maturities can help protect "assets that are at high risk" of defaulting, boosting the chances for the bank to get repaid later. Bank of China didn't respond to a request for comment.

Opinion
Jeb Hensarling: Dodd-Frank's Unhappy Anniversary; Two years after Washington 'reformed' Wall Street, the economy stinks and 'too big to fail' is enshrined into law.

Two years ago, I was one of 43 members of Congress appointed to the conference committee for the Dodd-Frank financial-reform bill. Along with others, I fought against the legislation and lost.

After an all-night session, Democrats (who then held the House majority) produced a 2,300-page behemoth they touted as a panacea for financial crises. President Obama predicted the bill would "lift our economy," give "certainty to everybody" and end "tax-funded bailouts period" because it would no longer allow institutions to become "too big to fail."

Two years later, we remain mired in the worst economy in the postwar era, "too big to fail" is actually enshrined into law, and Dodd-Frank's voluminous rules are proving to be some of the most confusing, complex and harmful our capital markets have ever seen.

Dodd-Frank was based largely on the premise that regulators lacked the authority to prevent Wall Street from taking outsize risks. But that was the wrong diagnosis and it led, inevitably, to a prescription for the wrong remedy.

Before the crisis, regulatory mistakes and incompetence abounded but almost no examples of a lack of regulatory authority can be found. Federal regulations were not the solution to the crisis but its principal cause. Federal policy pushed financial institutions to lend money to people for home purchases they couldn't afford. This dramatically eroded historically prudent underwriting standards. Of the subprime and Alt-A mortgages that led to the 2008 financial crisis, more than 70% were backed by the federal government through government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), the Federal Housing Administration and other programs. An accommodative monetary policy, in turn, allowed an inflated housing bubble that finally burst.

Having incorrectly diagnosed the problem, Dodd-Frank's authors wrote 400 new regulations. These generally fall into one of two categories: those that create uncertainty and those that create economic harm.

A prime example is the so-called Volcker rule. This 300-page proposal (to limit the kinds of investments banks can make) is not yet finalized by regulators. The proposal includes roughly 1,300 questions covering nearly 400 topics and is so confusing that it elicited more than 18,000 comment letters from market participants and the public.

Another example is the rules contained in Dodd-Frank's derivatives title, which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says could make it more expensive for nonfinancial companies to hedge their risks, possibly causing "hundreds of American companies to take their capital and jobs elsewhere." Then there is the "Qualified Residential Mortgage" rule that, if implemented by regulators as they have proposed, will increase mortgage interest rates by one to four percentage points, according to Moody'sAnalytics. And these are just a few of the law's 400 rules.

The House Financial Services Committee estimates that private-sector job creators will have to spend 24,180,856 hours each year to comply with Dodd-Frank and that's only for the 224 rules that have been written to date. William Isaac, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has predicted that hundreds if not thousands of community financial institutions will ultimately buckle under the regulatory load. As one community banker in my native Texas remarked, "My major risks are not credit risks, risks of theft, risks of some robber coming in with a gun in my office; my number one risk is federal regulatory risk."

Dodd-Frank harms not only businesses but consumers, too, by creating the benignly named "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau." This bureau gives unparalleled power to an appointed credit czar who can ban or ration practically any consumer financial product deemed "unfair" or "abusive" based on his or her discretion alone, with virtually no oversight from Congress.

Rationing consumer credit will make it more expensive for entrepreneurs to obtain capital and will stifle both product innovation and consumer choice. Had the new bureau existed 50 years ago, today we might be without ATMs, frequent-flier miles or debit cards.

Perhaps most harmful, Dodd-Frank has codified into law a taxpayer-funded safety net for institutions deemed too big to fail the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which the Congressional Budget Office predicts will cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. In downgrading the credit ratings of the nation's largest banks last month, Moody's explicitly stated that its ratings still reflect an assumption "about the very high likelihood of support from the U.S. government for bondholders or other creditors in the event that such support is required to prevent default." So much for ending taxpayer-funded bailouts. And when we lose our ability to fail, we will soon lose our ability to succeed.

Consider also what Dodd-Frank fails to do. Instead of eliminating government-sponsored enterprises which have received $200 billion and counting in taxpayer-funded bailouts since 2008 and were at the epicenter of the crisis Dodd-Frank leaves them in a state of perpetual federal conservatorship. Through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration, taxpayers now back 99% of new residential mortgage securitizations.

So where do we go from here? For starters, the president should work with Congress to phase out the government-sponsored enterprises and transition them to the private market. Other industrialized nations enjoy comparable or higher rates of homeownership without government dominance in their mortgage markets. Next, Dodd-Frank's bailout authority must be repealed. The way to address the risks posed by financial institutions would be more transparent balance sheets and a meaningful application of capital and liquidity standards. As long as companies have enough capital to cover their risks and absorb potential losses, we don't need federal regulators micromanaging credit allocation.

If Washington regulators were competent enough to manage risk, the government-sponsored enterprises wouldn't have been forced to guarantee subprime mortgages and wouldn't have needed a taxpayer-funded bailout, and the National Flood Insurance Program and the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation wouldn't be in the red. If Washington bureaucrats could be trusted with credit allocation, Solyndra would never have received a dime from taxpayers.

If Americans want the jobs and economic growth that flow from innovative, competitive and transparent capital markets, we should commit to making this anniversary Dodd-Frank's last.

Lie Bores Into Credibility

Of Barclays's Management

Scandals emanating from the boom years should have lost their power to shock. But evidence unearthed by U.S. and U.K. regulators showing how traders and managers at Barclays connived to manipulate a key market interest rate used to benchmark trillions of dollars of loans and derivative contracts is enough to stir even the most jaded cynic.

The U.K. bank, which has agreed to pay $453 million in fines, is the first to settle with regulators in a wide-ranging investigation, involving most of the leading global investment banks, into rigging of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Barclays can live with the fine, but damage to its reputation and that of top management, none of whom has resigned, could be lasting.

Barclays says many of those directly responsible have left the bank. Some employees may yet face disciplinary and even criminal proceedings, according to people briefed on the situation. The bank says top managers were unaware of the abuses, cooperated fully with the investigation, settled fast and have added new processes to stop this from happening again. None of Barclays's current four top executives -- Chief Executive Robert Diamond, finance director Chris Lucas, Chief Operating Officer Jerry del Missier or Rich Ricci, who runs the investment bank -- will take a bonus this year.

But this isn't good enough. The regulatory documents show that, at best, Mr. Diamond and his team presided over a culture of sloppiness, greed and a lack of concern for clients' interests. At worst, employees' behavior flirted with criminality. For all Mr. Diamond's recent homilies about "citizenship," investors will wonder whether an unchanged top team is really best-placed to restore the confidence of clients and regulators.

They also should ask why Mr. Diamond and his colleagues are only forgoing this year's putative bonuses rather than seeing prior-year deferred awards get clawed back.

The latest blow comes just weeks after Mr. Diamond and Mr. Lucas angered shareholders by clinging onto outsize 2011 bonuses despite delivering value-destroying returns on equity. The board's failure again to get tough will reinforce the impression Barclays is run by bankers for bankers.

Of course, Mr. Diamond and his colleagues may be betting that regulators unearth even greater skulduggery at other banks, helping to deflect attention from Barclays. Certainly, this probe threatens to further undermine public confidence in the investment-banking industry at a time when its business model and ingrained conflicts of interest are under unprecedented scrutiny.

The scandal also threatens to do further damage to the reputation of London as a financial center. The Barclays settlement comes just days after a U.S. senator publicly noted how many boom-time scandals originated in London. All the more reason why Barclays should show real citizenship by taking the sort of action that might signal to the world it truly understands the gravity of this scandal.

Tablet Market Isn't Set in Stone

While Apple's iPad remains the lodestar at the center of the tablet universe, Microsoft and Google are aiming at its opposite ends. Of those two, Microsoft's strategy looks like the one investors should get more excited about.

Google is going cheap, Microsoft high-end. The seven-inch, $199 Nexus 7 tablet from the search giant, released Wednesday, is set to duke it out for the bottom end of the market with Amazon.com's identically sized and priced Kindle Fire.

Thus far, price has been the only way rival tablet makers have been able to take market share away from the iPad -- which commanded a 63% share in the first quarter of this year, according to Strategy Analytics. Cheaper Android tablets had 32%. So, in that sense, Google seems to be playing it safe.

But Microsoft's Surface tablet -- at least the more expensive of its two versions -- may be able to carve out its own niche when released late this year or early next year.

With a clever keyboard on the flip side of its magnetic cover, ports for connecting other devices and, crucially, compatibility with enterprise applications including Microsoft Office, it is the first crossover tablet that could fully replace a laptop.

Granted, Microsoft has a challenge to attract content and apps to its platform. But if it can do so, it may be able to flip the "bring-your-own-device" trend that has so many corporate workers bringing iPads to their offices. Instead, they may start bringing the Surface home.

Going higher-end also means Microsoft would dodge a potential threat faced by Amazon and Google. If, as is possible, Apple releases a cheaper, smaller iPad, the bottom of the market could yet gravitate its way as well.

Rupee's Toll on Foreign

Indian importers are pulling their hair out because the rupee's sharp slide makes everything they buy overseas more expensive. Foreign companies with big operations in India have just as much reason to curse the currency.

The Indian currency is down 11% against the dollar in the last three months, and it also has fallen sharply against other major currencies. Foreign businesses with units in India find the money they repatriate in dollars is worth less than previously. That can mean a significant hit to earnings.

Take Standard Chartered PLC. The London-based company is the largest foreign bank in India. It makes about 12% of its profit in the country. But on Wednesday, the bank warned of the negative impact of the rupee on earnings, saying the rupee's decline would be a major contributor in a 2% foreign-currency drag on group net income this year.

The problem could get worse.

At 57 rupees to the dollar, the exchange rate is already hovering near historic lows. But some analysts say it could fall further. IndusInd Bank analyst Moses Harding says the dollar-rupee exchange rate could fall another 5% in the short term.

That should be a concern for companies such as Unilever PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC and a slew of Japanese car makers that all have significant revenue in rupees.

Suzuki Motor Corp., through its unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., earns a fifth of total revenue from India.

The Indian unit of London-based Vodafone Group PLC contributes nearly a tenth to the group's overall revenue.

Though rupee costs also fall with a decline in the currency, profit figures are likely to take a hit given the dramatic shift in India's foreign-exchange rate.

The rupee's slide compounds the problem of India's slowing economic growth. Gross domestic product is growing at just above 5%, its slowest rate in nearly a decade. Car sales increased a meager 2.2% in May, compared with 30% in the past year.

High inflation is a persistent problem and affects consumer-goods companies and car sellers alike.

India's long-term story is attractive. In the past week, global giants Ikea of Sweden and Coca-Cola Co. have flaunted their plans to expand in India.

The furniture maker will invest close to $2 billion in stores, and Coke has committed $5 billion. Both are betting on the rise of India's consumer class; the retail market will grow nearly 34% by 2016, Euromonitor says.

For now, though, the country's long-term promise is giving way to near-term volatility. Foreign companies in India must brace for the rupee's rapid retreat.

Koris International, the investment advisory group, will on Tuesday unveil a new agreement with Lyxor Asset Management in response to the growing demand for risk-managed portfolios based on alternative strategies.

Koris will provide investment advice based on quantitative asset allocation models to the wide range of alternative investment strategies on Lyxor's managed accounts platform. Lyxor will act as manager of the portfolios. Jean-Ren Giraud, chief executive of Koris, said the alliance with Lyxor marked the beginning of a new era for funds of hedge funds.

Mr Giraud said Koris and Lyxor were offering a "unique combination" of asset allocation expertise and state of the art operations and infrastructure.

In March, Koris agreed a partnership with Rothschild & Cie Gestion. Rothschild will manage a fund incubator that uses the risk-budgeting techniques developed by Koris.

Mr Giraud said the new partnerships reflected investors' growing concerns with controlling losses beyond that achievable by diversification and volatility constraints. "The risk of loss is a subject that the asset manager must be able to discuss openly with clients so as to control it without conflicting with the investment strategy."

Last week, S&P Capital IQ announced the launch of its Global Markets Intelligence group, a new advisory business that will provide risk-based equity and fixed income portfolio strategies. S&P Capital IQ is a data, research and analytics provider that is part of the McGraw-Hill group. It already provides advice on $18bn of assets via two existing business lines that will be unified as part of the new GMI group.

"The key to the Global Markets Intelligence approach is that our methodologies are built with risk mitigation components as their core and not as a separate overlay," said Michael Thompson, managing director at S&P Capital IQ .

The Business: Change.org Tests the Line Between Activism, Profits

Corrections & Amplifications

The Business column on Friday about Change.org referred to the for-profit petition website, which generates revenue by matching users with fundraisers and others, as an email harvester. The term can sometimes refer to the improper acquisition of emails, which wasn't a definition intended in the article.

(WSJ June 13, 2012)

(END)

Signing onto the email harvester that is Change.org, the online-petition site, is like being a sea turtle wandering into a drift net.

But is that such a bad thing?

Change.org is the for-profit, online-petition site famous for forcing Bank of America and Verizon to roll back customer fees, or so it claims. The company sells access to its members to groups keen to raise funds. There are several sites like it, and they are growing rapidly. But few if any are growing as rapidly as Change.org, and none has made as big a splash in corporate America.

"I have huge problems with Change.org because they are a lead-generation business disguised as a social-change organization for whoever is willing to pay them for the email addresses," says Clay Johnson, author of "The Information Diet" and a veteran of fundraising through social media. "It's dangerous to monetize 'change' because there's an economic incentive to sensationalize."

Change.org is testing the boundary between profit-making and social activism. The company says there really is no boundary. You can't do good works unless you can pay your way.

"The reason we're making money is that it's the necessary condition to having impact," says Ben Rattray, chief executive of Change.org.

The company hosts about 15,000 new petitions a month on a range of topics and says it may hit 30,000 by the end of the year. Based in San Francisco, it says it has 15 million members globally. It's planning to nearly double its staff of 140 over the next year and expects revenue, forecast at $15 million this year, to grow enough to cover costs. It opened an office in London last month and has staff in countries throughout the world. The site is already available in seven languages, with five more on the way.

By one measure, the petition you initiate on Change.org is the come-on, a way to pull in new email addresses and generate revenue. By another measure, it's the essential mission of the site: to foster social change.

The business model works this way: Join Change.org and sign a petition. Your email is registered as having an affinity with that subject. Change.org then matches you with petitions dealing with similar causes that are sponsored by political groups, activists or nonprofits such as Oxfam. You can sign their petitions and opt to learn more about the groups. If you do opt in, the sponsor gets your address.

As an example, I signed a Change.org petition to halt construction of a tunnel through New Zealand park land. Next thing, I was automatically shown three sponsored petitions from the Sierra Club, Obama for America and Don't Forget Ed, an education initiative.

Every step of the way the focus is on expanding the petition's reach and touching more email addresses. Change.org helps you share the petition through your Facebook page and mine your email contacts for additional addresses.

For every petition you sign, a thank-you note goes to your personal email address, again offering to help you share the petition with friends through social media.

Sponsors can spend "from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands" for the exposure and leads, says Mr. Rattray. The revenue, he adds, lets Change.org be a "company committed to empowerment," providing support for the efforts of average citizens who post the vast majority of petitions on the site. He says initial funding came from two "philanthropic" investors. Profits are plowed back into the business.

Care2.com, another petition site, has a similar business model. Like Change.org, it is a B Corporation, a relatively new distinction for companies geared toward social benefit. B Corps can choose to invest profit in the company rather than pay it to shareholders.

But Care2.com seems a bit more up front about the moneymaking side of things. Consider its name: dot-com, not dot-org. And its home page carries advertisements, which signals revenue generation.

"We believe for-profits can be a force for good, and it's good to make that clear," says Clint O'Brien of Care2.com.

All the sites give like-minded consumers a place to share information, organize, and project a collective voice. Experts in marketing say that's good for competition and good also for companies: They can see the likes and dislikes of their customers.

Are these petitions effective? Or are they just more "slacktivism" -- easy to sign and inconsequential?

Change.org says its petitioners score at least one success a day. The site still trumpets the Bank of America and Verizon "victories" from months ago.

But this is squishy territory. Bank of America and Verizon were deluged with complaints through their normal customer channels -- phone calls, branch visits, letters -- after bloggers and the traditional media reported the new fees. The companies say the petitions were noted but didn't have a primary role in their decisions. Instead, direct customer contact was by far the dominant factor.

Verizon says it had already made its decision to nix its fee early on Dec. 30. The main Change.org petition was opened only a few hours earlier.

I asked Networked Insights, a real-time data analytics firm, to try to measure the role Change.org had in both controversies. The firm found mentions of Change.org in about 5% of social-media grousing over the Verizon fees, and 2% in BofA's case.

"It probably had marginal impact," says Sean Reckwerdt of Networked Insights. He adds that even those small numbers can stir conversation.

Regardless, Change.org claims it led a vast army of petitioners who triumphed in both battles. That's a good story to pitch to its paying sponsors.

And that's good for business.

Deal of the Week: Doubling Down in Detroit

By Maura Webber Sadovi

(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Nearly three years after buying the Pontiac Silverdome for $583,000, a Canadian real-estate investor has snapped up another bargain in the Detroit region.

A company controlled by the Apostolopoulos family, of Toronto, has purchased the landmark Penobscot Building, Detroit's third-tallest office tower, for $5 million. The price, which comes to $5 a square foot, is tiny compared with the $200 level that buildings on average are selling for nationwide and even well below the $28 range that downtown Detroit buildings fetched last year, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"There are deals right now to be had in Detroit, and there's huge upside," said Steve Apostolopoulos, whose father, Andreas, founded Triple Group of Cos. The company owns about 11 million square feet of office, retail and other commercial properties. The portfolio includes properties in Toronto, Detroit and New York as well as Greece, the U.K. and Australia, Steve Apostolopoulos said.

There is a good reason why Detroit office buildings are so cheap: The city's downtown market has a vacancy rate of 26.5%, one of the highest in the nation. The city has made some strides fighting a decadeslong flight of businesses and residents to the suburbs, but significant challenges remain in the wake of auto-industry bankruptcy filings and restructurings. The city's unemployment rate was 15.8% in April, compared with the seasonally adjusted national rate of 8.1% for April, and Detroit's population dropped by one-quarter to 713,777 in 2010 from 951,270 in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau. In April, the city took a controversial step to stay solvent when it agreed with the state to share financial power.

Other investors also have been lured by the low price tags on Detroit's older historic buildings. But rents are so low in these "Grand Dames" that they cover operating expenses and real-estate taxes and not much more, wrote Levi Smith, a broker with Principal Associates of Southfield, Mich., in an email. "It will be many years before the market changes."

The 47-story Penobscot Building, which includes decorative touches designed to recall the Native American tribe it was named for, is about half-empty. Triple Group plans to spend an unspecified amount of money upgrading the building and to lower the rents from about $15 a square foot to $10 a square foot to attract more tenants and bring the building's occupancy up to 90% by next year, Steve Apostolopoulos said.

That may seem like wishful thinking to many who have watched Detroit writhe over the years. But there have been a few encouraging signs lately. The vacancy rate ticked down in the first quarter from 26.6% in the first quarter last year and the 28.4% peak it hit in 2008, according to real-estate research firm Reis Inc.

Meanwhile, construction is under way on Whole Foods Market Inc.'s first Detroit supermarket, and, in the city's financial district, Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert has purchased numerous downtown office buildings. The Detroit native is filling up some of the space with his employees relocated from the suburbs.

"The amount of people [from outside the area] who are willing to take a look at investing in Detroit today is light-years away from what it was three to five years ago," said Susan Mosey, president of Midtown Detroit Inc., an economic development group.

The Penobscot Building is a complex of three towers located in the heart of Detroit's downtown near Compuware Corp.'s headquarters and the refurbished Campus Martius Park. The 568-foot-tall building was purchased in 2005 for $14 million by Northern Group of New York, according to David Friedman, president of Friedman Integrated Real Estate Solutions, the broker in the sale to Triple Group. Northern Group couldn't be reached for comment.

The seller in the latest deal was Capmark Financial Group Inc., one of the biggest commercial real-estate lenders to go bust in the downturn. The Horsham, Pa., lender, which took back the Penobscot Building from a venture of Northern Group, sought bankruptcy protection in 2009.

Capmark, an independent company that used to be part of a financing affiliate of General Motors Co., emerged from bankruptcy protection last fall and put the property on the block. The younger Mr. Apostolopoulos said Triple Group's all-cash offer with no contingencies helped seal the deal.

He said the family continues to look for additional deals in Detroit. "It's the theory of buy low and sell high," he said.

Post Properties Sheds Past --- Apartment Owner Boosts Balance Sheet, Shifts Strategy to Benefit From Upturn

Longtime investors in Post Properties Inc. have to be feeling better these days than in 2008, when the rental-apartment company passed on a buyout offer from its founder and unsuccessfully put itself up for sale.

Back then, Post's stock fell far below the offer it received, which was in the mid-$40-a share range. Shares dropped to below $10 in 2009.

Those that held on through the dark days have been rewarded this year by seeing Post's stock rise to its postrecession high of above $50 a share. In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Post closed at $48.93, up 51 cents.

Like all multifamily property owners, the Atlanta-based company has gotten a huge boost from the housing crisis, which has turned millions of would-be homeowners into renters. Post operates nearly 22,000 apartments in 58 communities.

At the same time, Post's management has steered the real-estate investment trust into healthier waters by fixing up its balance sheet and extricating the company from its ill-fated strategy to get into the condominium-development business.

David Stockert, whose 10-year anniversary as Post chief executive is in July, called that strategy his "biggest regret." Of the company's performance since the downturn, Mr. Stockert said: "I feel very proud that we turned it around."

Looking forward, the question facing Post, as well as the rest of the multi-family sector, is how long the good times will last. For more than two years, the multifamily sector has been the best performing commercial-property class thanks to strong demand from people who can't or don't want to buy a home.

But there also are signs that the rise in property values may be losing steam as the home-ownership market stabilizes. Last year, sales of apartment buildings totaled $54 billion, up more than 50% from the prior year, pushing up values to peak levels in a few cases, according to Real Capital Analytics.

But this year, deal volume fell in the first quarter while values have been at about the same level for three quarters, Real Capital said. Apartment building owners also reported an increase of tenants moving out in the first quarter, although most said that they were able to replace those with new tenants paying higher rents.

Mr. Stockert said the market "still has legs," but he added that it "inevitably" will weaken as new supply hits the market and the rest of the housing market firms up.

"That's bound to happen and that's OK," he said. "We can still perform well in that market."

Some analysts and investors agree that Post is in solid shape. They point out that Post's apartments tend to offer upscale amenities that many younger renters want. Also, the company started building new rental communities before many competitors jumped back into the development game.

Post has over 1,800 apartments in the pipeline. "We expect they're going to have their properties out of the ground faster and be able to capitalize on this upswing," said Brendan Lee, a portfolio manager with TIAA-CREF's Real Estate Securities Fund. According to FactSet, TIAA-CREF owned more than one million Post shares valued at nearly $49 million at the end of the first quarter.

Post was founded in 1971 by John Williams, who ran the company until 2002 when he stepped down. Mr. Williams lost a proxy battle over control of the board in 2003 and resurfaced in early 2008, joining forces with Cadim, a Montreal pension fund, to make an unsolicited offer for the company.

Post decided to put itself up for sale, but no deal happened. Mr. Williams declined to comment.

After the market crashed, the company was saddled with two unfinished luxury projects, one in Austin, Texas, and the other in Atlanta. In 2009 and 2010, Post wrote off $104 million related to the projects.

In his turnaround strategy, Mr. Stockert decided to hold off building projects, but he reactivated them as soon as he saw the positive trends in the rental business. As a result, the first tenants are moving into the second phase of the Post Carlyle Square in Washington, while Post South Lamar in Austin should open its doors later this year. Post also bought back some of its debt at a discount to face value and refinanced at a lower interest rate.

Teacher Fund Buying Builder --- Calstrs Is Acquiring Majority of Apartment Developer LCOR From Lehman

By Eliot Brown 
737 words
23 May 2012
The Wall Street Journal

English
(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

A large California pension fund is buying a majority stake in LCOR Inc. from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., ending a 13-year relationship between the failed investment bank and a real-estate developer that has built millions of square feet of apartment buildings and mixed-use projects over the years.

The California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs, is finalizing a deal to pay more than $820 million for a stake of more than 90% in LCOR, including 14 rental-apartment properties with nearly 5,000 apartments. Lehman invested in LCOR in 1999, and the developer became its partner on numerous projects during the boom years.

While the bulk of the deal's value is in those apartments, Calstrs plans to use LCOR to build its real-estate portfolio through development.

LCOR has a pipeline of some 16 million square feet of planned apartment, mixed-use and office projects, including developments in cities such as Hoboken, N.J., Tysons Corner, Va., and Montgomery County, Md.

It is unusual for a pension fund to directly own a developer. But Calstrs is opting to do so in part because competition among institutional investors is becoming increasingly intense for so-called core assets, or those with low risk. That is driving up the price of buying property and making development more attractive.

LCOR's development sites and expertise "provide Calstrs the opportunity to build significant core assets on an ongoing basis," said Timothy Works, the Calstrs portfolio manager on the LCOR deal.

After billions of dollars of losses from property investments during the downturn, Calstrs has set a goal to have about 50% of its $19 billion in real estate as core investments. As of fall 2011, that figure stood at just 31%, according to documents from a Calstrs board meeting in April.Demand among institutions for core rental apartments has been particularly strong. Partly because of a declining homeownership rate that has helped push up rents, the average price per U.S. apartment unit sold in the first three months of 2012 was $103,171, up from about $80,000 for the same period in 2009, according to research service Real Capital Analytics Inc.

Increases in commercial property prices have generally slowed, though, since last summer.

Land and construction costs, meanwhile, have been rising more sluggishly, prompting some investors to view development as an attractive alternative. These investors believe the additional profit from development is "more than compensating you for the incremental risk," said Devin Murphy, a vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, which advised Lehman on the deal.

Micolyn Magee, an adviser to Calstrs from Townsend Group, told the fund's board in April that because of high prices for apartment buildings, "you have access to that property type predominantly through renovation or even through development, which is a better risk-adjusted return."

LCOR's management group, which owns a small stake in the company, will stay on.

Peter DiLullo, LCOR's chief executive, said that apartment development is "the number one item on our business plan" given the demand in the market right now.

Among LCOR's projects over the years: the 2.5 million square foot headquarters of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, Va.; the development of Terminal 4 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport; and Aurora, a planned 341-unit building under way in North Bethesda, Md.

Mr. DiLullo said he initially feared for his company's future when Lehman collapsed. But Lehman, managed by restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal Inc., brought LCOR new business as it turned to the firm to help it deal with a mountain of properties taken over through loans the bank held, after borrowers fell into default.

For example, LCOR helped Lehman manage 25 Broad St. in Manhattan, a failed condominium conversion deal that has now been converted to rental apartments.

That property and 13 others that Lehman took control of during the downturn are part of the Calstrs purchase.

"They were a very good partner, as bankrupt partners go," Mr. DiLullo said.

Lehman emerged from bankruptcy protection earlier this year with a plan to liquidate assets. Last year, Lehman valued its real-estate assets at more than $13 billion.

Deal of the Week: Downtown L.A. Rises Up

By Maura Webber Sadovi

Office investors are beginning to trickle back into downtown Los Angeles as a rising number of residents, restaurants and glitzy entertainment options bring new zest to the city's once-overlooked core.

But the rebound in the office market downtown remains weak compared with the growth of the area's night life and residential population. The rise in office property values continues to lag behind the region's prime office markets in places like West Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills that still are favored by tenants and big investors.

Consider the deal that is in the works for 400 South Hope St., a 1980s-vintage tower a few blocks from the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall. CBRE Global Investors has agreed to pay about $236 million to buy the 26-story tower from a venture of Tishman Speyer Properties and asset manager BlackRock Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

That price, which equates to about $337 a square foot, is still shy of the roughly $351 a square foot that Tishman Speyer and BlackRock paid in 2005. Downtown Los Angeles office buildings sold for as much as $450 a square foot at the peak in 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics, a real-estate research firm. By comparison, prices for the best buildings in the strongest markets in the Los Angeles region as well as the rest of the country are approaching record highs.

"If any central business district is lagging, it's Los Angeles," says Dan Fasulo, a Real Capital managing director.

The downtown Los Angeles market has long suffered higher vacancy rates than other office markets in the region. Its office towers were home to a vibrant international banking center in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but downtown was hurt by overbuilding, the recession of the early 1990s and consolidation in the financial-services industry.

The downtown market strengthened during the boom years leading up to the latest recession, but it got blasted again with the financial crisis, according to Steve Marcussen, executive director with Cushman & Wakefield in Los Angeles. Downtown Los Angeles's first-quarter office vacancy rate stood at 15.5%, above the 13.2% rate in West Los Angeles, 10.3% in Santa Monica and 8.7% in Beverly Hills, according to Reis Inc., a real-estate research firm.

The 700,000-square-foot building at 400 South Hope, which formerly was named the Mellon Bank Center, is 80% leased, according to people familiar with the property.

The good news downtown continues to be the rebirth of entertainment and other uses dating back to the Staples Center's opening in 1999. Developers since then have converted older office buildings into residential properties, and downtown's residential population more than doubled to nearly 50,000, according to Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Association.

Meanwhile, arts and entertainment oriented buildings have opened downtown such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the sprawling LA Live entertainment complex.

More recently, a push is under way to build a National Football League stadium downtown. "Now . . . downtown's dominated by entertainment and tourism," says Mr. Marcussen. "We have a purpose again."

While office investors haven't flocked back to the city, they certainly are taking notice. During the depths of the downturn, downtown office deal activity ground to a halt with no large office building transactions in 2009 and only $211 million in 2010, according to Real Capital Analytics.

By comparison, this year is off to a decent start with $254 million in deals in the first quarter, although it still is well off the pace of the $3.4 billion in sales rung up in 2007 overall at the peak of the market.

Other parts of the city are enjoying more demand from technology, entertainment and other office tenants. But the declining availability of space and increasing rents in these markets work to downtown Los Angeles's benefit. Last year, the Gensler architectural firm relocated into about 53,000 square feet of downtown space from Santa Monica.

CBRE Global Investors is the investment-management unit of CBRE Group Inc. CBRE's brokerage arm represented the seller in the sale of 400 South Hope. The company keeps the two operations separate to prevent conflicts of interest.

Other sales downtown this year include the purchase of the PacMutual building by a venture of veteran developer Nelson Rising for $60 million.

Stress balls, breath mints, cupcakes and a sponsored  oxygen bar : yes, it s Internet Week in New York, the annual feast of branded freebies, parties and panels for the city s digital media and marketing set.

Today a Yahoo presentation drew the biggest crowd at the warehouse-like SoHo venue. Some were clearly there for an address on  big data  by Billy Beane, the number-crunching general manager of the Oakland A s baseball team and inspiration for Brad Pitt s character in Moneyball.

Others, though, were hoping for some insight into Sunday s sudden reshuffle after Scott Thompson s CV-padding scandal led to the departure of Yahoo s short-lived chief executive. They were disappointed.

Ross Levinsohn, Thompson s replacement (in an interim role, at least), was supposed to lead the event, but was on the west coast talking to staff. Rich Riley, Yahoo s executive vice president for the Americas since last month, stepped in to unveil Genome from Yahoo, a proprietary tool designed to suck in huge amounts of data from Yahoo s network and others including Microsoft and AOL, and spit out better returns on advertisers  investment.

In a conversation on the sidelines, Riley said his team would not be blown off course by the latest turmoil at the top.  I ve always been impressed with the Yahoo team s ability to stay focused on our customers. That s what we are,  said the 13-year Yahoo veteran, who is in the midst of moving from Switzerland to New York.

As he flicked through this morning s FT coverage of Thompson s abrupt exit, Riley said there would be  no change  in Yahoo s focus on digital advertising, pledging to increase its presence in New York, the home of Madison Avenue s marketers.

He was happier to talk about Genome, which relies heavily on Yahoo s display ad deal with AOL and Microsoft and on Interclick, the online advertising targeting company it bought for $270m last December.

 Just as Billy fundamentally changed the way you run a baseball team by applying data and analytics & that s precisely what Yahoo plans to do with digital marketing,  he said, to explain the day s guest star.

Genome would be  the most complete, custom audience solution in the industry  when it launches in July, he said, matching up consumer data from advertisers, Yahoo and third parties with Yahoo s content to improve the targeting of online campaigns.

Pressed on what Genome will do for Yahoo s bottom line, he was less forthcoming.  We hope to take share in display advertising,  he said, but he declined to provide numbers. Perhaps he missed Beane s line that  the mathematics will always work if you trust it.

Borrowers Face Big Delays In Refinancing Mortgages

By Nick Timiraos and Ruth Simon

When Craig Foyer called Bank of America Corp. in March to ask about refinancing the mortgage on his Oconomowoc, Wis., home, a saleswoman told him the company was "swamped with business" and that it would call him back in 60 to 90 days, he says.

"That doesn't do much for someone interested in the market right now," said Mr. Foyer, 46 years old, who works in software development.

Clogged mortgage pipelines have created headaches for hundreds of thousands of Americans trying to take advantage of low mortgage rates, which averaged 4.05% for the week ending April 27, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Those rates have helped thousands of Americans free up cash or retire debt. On average, borrowers that refinanced during the first quarter of 2012 reduced their first-year interest payments by $2,900, according to mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac. Overall, refinancing over the past three years has unlocked savings worth $46 billion in their first year, according to Moody'sAnalytics.

But considering how far mortgage rates have dropped, the refinancing burst has been lackluster by historical standards. A surge in demand has come at a time when fewer banks control a larger share of the mortgage market than they did before the financial crisis. Banks also are being more careful about whom they lend money to and how they process loans. It now takes the nation's biggest mortgage lenders an average of more than 70 days to complete a refinance, according to Accenture Credit Services, up from 45 days a year ago.

There is another factor. Amid reduced competition, some large lenders have boosted their rates in a bid to hold down volumes while bolstering profits. That limits the savings for many applicants.

In March, Mark Morrison says he was offered a 4.63% rate by his mortgage company, Ally Financial Inc., when he asked about refinancing. That would have resulted in monthly savings of just $87, before figuring in $1,500 in upfront fees. Rates that week were being quoted at 4.13% in the local newspaper, and the Waukesha, Wis., resident says he "got the runaround" when he asked why his mortgage company couldn't offer him a more competitive rate. An Ally spokeswoman declined to comment.

After shopping around, Mr. Morrison locked in that lower rate with a smaller lender. Accunet Mortgage in Butler, Wis., also offered to pay closing costs, providing Mr. Morrison a monthly savings of $167. He closed on the loan last month after a wait of about three weeks. "It really is a rat's maze for the consumer," says Brian Wickert, Accunet's president. The bigger banks, he says, "have enough people saying 'yes' to those offers that they're taking super-high profit margins."

While it is taking lenders of all sizes longer to process loans today, some smaller, more nimble mortgage lenders are turning around loans more quickly because they quickly staffed up or never cut back.

The housing bust wiped away $7 trillion in household equity, leaving many homeowners with too much debt to qualify for new loans. But the mortgage sector's limitations are further undermining the Federal Reserve's effort to boost the economy by holding short-term interest rates near zero.

Normally during a downturn, refinancing activity "really gets the economy going, and it isn't happening right now," says Alan Boyce, a bond-market veteran who runs Absalon, a company backed by billionaire financier George Soros that is pushing to change how U.S. mortgages are financed.

While refinancings from the drop in interest rates since 2009 have produced $46 billion in savings, Mr. Boyce estimated last year that in a normal market, refinancing could have generated an additional $67 billion in annual savings.

Part of the reason is that lenders are being more cautious in the wake of the financial crisis. The two government-controlled mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have added new requirements designed to improve loan quality for all mortgages. Appraisal packages, for instance, must now include a photograph of bathroom toilets as proof the house actually has a bathroom.

Demand for refinancing also has surged in recent months amid a push by the Obama administration to make it easier for homeowners with loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to refinance, even if they don't have any equity in their homes or strong credit. That initiative, called the Home Affordable Refinance Program, has accounted for as much as one-third of refinance applications in recent weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

President Barack Obama is set to renew a legislative push to enable refinancing for underwater borrowers, or those who owe more than their homes are worth, whose loans aren't backed by Fannie and Freddie during a visit to Reno, Nev., on Friday, according to a White House official.

In the past, mortgage companies relied on independent mortgage brokers to help pick up some of the added demand when refinancing spiked. But mortgage brokers now account for less than 10% of originations, down from roughly 31% in 2005, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The shakeout helped rid the industry of brokers who were making questionable loans, resulting in sounder lending. But it also means there are fewer places for borrowers to turn to find the lowest rates.

"You have more loans going through a pipeline that is too small," says Terry Moore, global managing director of Accenture Credit Services, which provides consulting and mortgage-processing services to banks.

The nation's four largest banks now account for 55% of all loan originations, up from 38% in 2004.

Wells Fargo & Co., the nation's largest mortgage lender; third-ranked Citigroup Inc.; and fourth-ranked Bank of America now routinely advise borrowers to expect refinances to take as long as 90 days. Wells Fargo and Citigroup say they are generally picking up the extra cost of locking in the rate for the longer-than-normal period so that customers are protected if rates rise. Wells Fargo says it has also added staff in response to higher loan volumes.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the country's second-largest mortgage lender, says it is telling borrowers to generally expect their refinances to close within 45 to 60 days. The bank says it hired more than 1,100 new employees to handle mortgage originations in late 2011 and continues to hire loan officers, underwriters and processors.

Citigroup has been adding staff and streamlining its processes in an effort to cut its average refinance time from 77 days to less than 50 days, says CitiMortgage chief executive Sanjiv Das.

Bank of America says beginning in April it no longer put customers like Mr. Foyer on a wait list because it has added 500 employees to handle the latest surge in business. Delays are "vastly improving" from late last year, when a drop in rates caught much of the industry by surprise, said Matt Vernon, who heads retail sales for Bank of America Home Loans.

Mr. Foyer ultimately settled on a no-cost refinance with a local mortgage bank for a 3.5% rate on a 15-year mortgage, down from the 4.3% rate on the previous 20-year loan. Mr. Foyer estimates it will save him about $12,000 over the life of the loan. He closed on the loan in April some three weeks after he applied.

Before the mortgage crisis, the spread between the rate lenders paid investors and the rate they charged borrowers averaged around 0.5 percentage point. But that gap has nearly doubled since 2009.

At U.S. Bancorp, mortgage-banking revenue more than doubled during the first quarter from the year-earlier period to $452 million in the first three months of 2012. "It is just a function of supply and demand in the current market and that gives us some pricing opportunity," said Andy Cecere, the bank's chief financial officer on a call with analysts in April.

The mortgage industry has long suffered from boom and busts, with loan processing times increasing as refinancings climb. That is being compounded today by the fallout from the mortgage bust.

Lenders have become far more cautious about making new loans because they may have to repurchase bad loans from mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie. The government-controlled firms can force banks to buy back mortgages that run afoul of underwriting rules, and they have stepped up those demands in the aftermath of the mortgage bust.

Fannie asked banks to buy back $24 billion in defaulted mortgages last year, up from $13 billion in 2010. The company didn't report data on repurchases before the crisis, when they were viewed as a minor nuisance.

Lenders have responded to buyback pressures by scrutinizing anything that could be used to justify a costly loan repurchase. CitiMortgage, for instance, now triple-checks borrower income and assets and the appraisals used to determine a property's value.

The normal gridlock can be exacerbated if the borrower is self-employed or if the appraisal comes in lower than expected. A disputed appraisal value spawned Amy Sperrazza's six-month battle before securing a 3.75% fixed rate for her Dawsonville, Ga., home in February.

"It was one thing after another," says Ms. Sperrazza, who began the refinance process last August. She and her husband both are employed and have good credit, but they spent months haggling over the appraisal, which valued the home using the sale of foreclosed properties from a different county.

Innovations in Health Care (A Special Report) --- Numbers, Numbers and More Numbers: Health-care players are finding that crunching the numbers can pay off in both better care and lower costs

By Shara Tibken

Under pressure to do more with less, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and health-care providers are all pushing data analysis to new heights.

Insurers have been crunching numbers for years to figure out which patients are most likely to generate high costs. Now other groups are gauging probabilities of relapses, and the likelihood of a patient's not taking his or her medicine. Using models that draw on massive troves of medical and other data, some are also focusing on seemingly healthy individuals, trying to prevent problems before they occur.

Several insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc. and WellPoint Inc., are seeking to pinpoint who will develop conditions such as diabetes. Pharmacy-benefit managers such as Express Scripts Inc. and CVS Caremark Corp. are working on programs to predict medication compliance. Care providers, meanwhile, are trying to identify who is most likely to be admitted -- or readmitted -- to a hospital, and are adjusting their care to prevent such return visits.

Proponents say each of these activities can improve care and prevent further expensive health problems, reducing costs for companies and patients.

"There's a huge increase in demand for health care, but the delivery model is inherently inefficient," says International Data Corp. Health Insights analyst Scott Lundstrom. "Companies are looking to how to optimize the quality of almost everything."

Here's a look at new ways in which health-care companies are using data:

Insurers

Perhaps the best-known health-care analytics push is WellPoint's partnership with International Business Machines Corp. IBM created a supercomputer, dubbed Watson, that responds to voice commands and last year won the TV quiz show "Jeopardy!" by quickly scouring its database for the right answers. WellPoint plans to use Watson's data-crunching technology to help suggest treatment options to doctors, based on medical records, research databases and other sources. "Research doubles every five years," says Lori Beer, executive vice president of enterprise business services at WellPoint. "How does a physician keep up with that?"

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, too, is working with IBM to build a tool for cancer treatment that will draw on patient histories, the center's clinical knowledge and molecular and genomic data.

In a separate project, WellPoint nurses and case managers pore over patient records and claims histories to see whether patients are following doctors' orders. This is particularly important for people with chronic conditions like diabetes, which are managed more effectively with preventive care.

Pharmacy Benefit Managers

Express Scripts this summer plans to roll out a program that will study data about patients in its customer base -- which includes employers, government agencies, unions and health plans -- to identify and intervene with patients less likely to take their prescriptions correctly. The program will start with medicine for high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, asthma and osteoporosis, and later include multiple sclerosis.

For plan sponsors that choose to participate, Express Scripts first runs its predictive models. Looking at about 400 variables, including enrollees' prescription history and the economic makeup of their neighborhood, the program tries to identify who is likely to stop taking their medicine and why. Bob Nease, chief scientist at Express Scripts, says the company's testing has shown its predictions are correct about 90% of the time.

Patients identified as likely to be noncompliant then receive tailored interventions to help overcome their specific hurdle. Some patients will receive over-the-phone pharmacist consultations and help signing up for auto-refills and other programs that simplify adherence. For patients not taking their medicine because of behavioral reasons, mainly forgetfulness, timers are attached to the caps of prescription bottles to remind them to take their medication.

Among patients tested in a control group, Dr. Nease says, using the beeping caps increased compliance by about 2%. But when timers were given to those identified as forgetful, there was a 16% rise in compliance.

Care Providers

Many care providers try to use analytics to identify who is at risk of a hospital admission.

Heritage Provider Network, a Northridge, Calif., physicians group that develops health-care delivery networks, is sponsoring a competition to figure out the best algorithm to identify which patients are likely to be sent to a hospital within the next year, based on Heritage patient data. The competition, which has a $3 million prize, will end in April 2013.

"Hospitalizations are very expensive and cost this country a lot of the resources we're using in health care," says Richard Merkin, president and chief executive of Heritage. "Imagine if you could effectively predict who was going to be hospitalized," Dr. Merkin says. "You could reallocate resources to prevent unnecessary hospitalization and put those resources to use for cure rather than care."

Health Management Associates Inc., which operates nearly 70 hospitals across the U.S., also is working with technology partners on predicting readmissions. It is looking for patterns in its own patient and operational data and ranking the likelihoods of admission associated with different factors. The company, based in Naples, Fla., is also trying to predict demand for certain services, such as the emergency room and lab work, to help it better staff its hospitals.

"Companies have to do more with less," says Eric Waller, chief marketing and strategy officer for HMA. "We're being incentivized as an industry to improve clinical care and increase customer satisfaction and improve margins with lower reimbursements. It's driving people to be much more interested in the use of analytics."

As more patients seek care, analytics will also help providers offer more efficient preventive care. "There's a huge amount of waste in the system," says Dr. Nease, the Express Scripts chief scientist. "Advanced analytics allows you to be much more sophisticated in where you intervene and with what."

Indian Firm Seeks to Book the Plaza

An Indian conglomerate has made an unsolicited $600 million offer to acquire the storied Plaza Hotel in New York, but the deal would need approval of two owners: an Israeli-owned holding company and a Saudi Arabian prince.

Sahara India Pariwar Ltd., which bought London's high-profile Grosvenor House hotel in 2010, made the offer to Israeli-owned El Ad U.S. Holding Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. El Ad is examining the proposal, these people said. But, as of Monday, El Ad executives had yet to discuss the offer at length with their partner in the hotel, Kingdom Holding Co., which is controlled by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.

"Kingdom is not a seller of its interest at this time," Kingdom spokesman Charles Henry said Monday. That doesn't block El Ad from selling its own interest, though Kingdom's approval of such a deal would be needed.

Sahara's offer values the hotel portion of the Plaza -- spanning 230 rooms -- at $400 million. That amounts to $1.7 million a room, a lofty sum even for Manhattan. In recent years, that potential price has been matched only by the per-room price that Hong Kong investor Cheng Yu-tung's New World Development Co. paid for the Carlyle Hotel last year, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The deal also allots $200 million for the so-called retail portion of the hotel, which encompasses the hotel's banquet hall, fitness center and other common areas wholly owned by El Ad, the U.S. real-estate arm of Israeli entrepreneur Isaac Tshuva, these people said.

In 2004, Kingdom sold its stake in the hotel, which then had 800 rooms, to El Ad only to buy back a portion shortly thereafter. Kingdom now owns 50% of an entity that holds 130 of the Plaza's rooms and 25% of another entity that holds 100 rooms that were to be sold as condominiums but are still rented out as hotel rooms. El Ad owns the balance.

The remainder of the Plaza's rooms were converted into 180 apartments and sold individually by El Ad after it bought the hotel in 2004. Those aren't subject to Sahara's pending offer.

Another potential snag: Sahara would want to terminate management of the Plaza by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, which has run the hotel since 1995, in favor of Sahara itself managing the property. Kingdom owns a 35% stake in the Fairmont chain.

Sahara's has interests in infrastructure, housing, media, manufacturing and information technology.

Prince Alwaleed is a significant shareholder in News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal.

Real Estate
Starwood Goes Shopping for U.S. Malls

Veteran investor Barry Sternlicht is close to making his biggest push to date into the shopping mall industry as his Starwood Capital Group prepares to buy majority stakes in seven U.S. malls from Westfield Group for roughly $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

The identity of the seven malls couldn't be determined on Tuesday. However, five of the seven are among the 17 U.S. malls that Sydney-based Westfield put on the market early last year.

Westfield, which owns 118 malls globally, has stated publicly since last year that it will divest some of its midscale malls to raise capital for several billion dollars of redevelopment work at its more lucrative properties.

Westfield will retain a minority stake in the properties being sold, but the percentage remains in flux, these people say. The deal isn't completed, and the terms could change or it could fall apart at the last minute, they added.

Founded in 1991, Starwood has roughly $18 billion in assets under management and a track record of some major hits, including its creation of the Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. chain and iStar Financial Inc., a finance company that went public in 2002.

But this also is a treacherous time to make a big bet on the retail industry, which is battling headwinds from a weak economy, competition from online shopping and overbuilding during the boom years. It also is facing the ongoing closure of hundreds of stores by mall stalwarts such as Sears Holdings Corp., Gap Inc. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

The malls that Starwood Capital aims to buy have annual sales that are at or only slightly higher than the industry average for large, enclosed U.S. malls, according to people familiar with the matter.

That presents a challenge for Starwood Capital, since many mall owners and industry experts predict that shoppers and retailers increasingly will patronize stronger malls to the detriment of average and subpar malls. Investments in mediocre shopping centers can be successful if the properties can be rehabilitated and returned to higher prominence. Others may be doomed to obsolescence.

"Not all B [grade] malls are created equal," says Ben Yang, an analyst tracking real-estate investment trusts for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "Some could be B-plus malls in the future, and some could be C malls at some point."

Starwood Capital has hired brokerage Eastdil Secured to help it line up mortgages to put on three of the malls, these people say. It will assume the mortgages already in place on another three. The financing status of the seventh couldn't be determined.

The retail outlook isn't totally bleak, especially if the economy improves. Stoking buyers' optimism, U.S. retail property has shown slight improvement since its nadir during the recession. Vacancy rates have stopped rising, though they remain just shy of multiyear highs. Construction of new shopping centers is minimal, meaning that existing properties face little new competition.

In the top 54 U.S. markets, retailers are adding more square footage than they forfeit. Real-estate-research company CoStar Group predicts that retailers will expand their occupied space in those markets by 0.9% this year, 1.1% next and 1.2% in 2014.

Buyers, meanwhile, have ramped up their activity. In 2009, deal activity for U.S. malls larger than 500,000 square feet totaled $873 million, according to Real Capital Analytics. Last year, the mall-deal tally jumped to nearly $3.7 billion. Real Capital analysts foresee further increases in transactions for all classes of retail properties, noting in a report this month that $8 billion in retail-real-estate deals now are classified as under contract.

It is possible that Westfield will sell additional U.S. malls in the wake of the Starwood Capital deal, a person familiar with the matter said. Bidders such as Atlanta-based Greenfield & Associates showed interest last year. In February, Westfield agreed to sell a 45% stake in 11 of its 55 U.S. malls and one mall-development site to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for nearly $2.2 billion.

Other mall owners haven't had much luck in selling their struggling malls. Simon Property Group Inc. last year listed four midscale malls for sale but eventually took them off the market. General Growth Properties Inc. opted to spin off 30 of its weaker malls as Rouse Properties Inc. last January rather than sell them.

Marketing start-ups Geeks aren't known for their social skills

HOLLYWOOD portrayed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, as aloof, disinterested and awkward in all manner of ways in "The Social Network". During important meetings with venture capitalists and potential investors Mr Zuckerberg's character became increasingly distracted and at one such appointment his business attire was a bath robe, pyjamas and slippers. (This made-for-the-movies moment actually stems from a real event, when Facebook made a pitch to Sequoia Capital.) Despite his apparent insouciance, Facebook secured enough capital to finance its business, turning it into one of the worlds largest companies. Facebook's experience, however, is rare.

Most companies need to lay on the charm to get investors to prise open their wallets. When it comes to starting up a small tech business, having a good idea is the easy part. Financing that idea and marketing it is where many start-ups fall down. And geeks are not known for their social skills. Many struggle to come across well in the slick, fast-talking world of venture capitalists and angel investors. Esther Dyson, an American angel investor in tech companies, told peHUB, a private-equity website, that its much easier to invest money than to attract it. Those who do manage to get enough cash face another problem. All that time spent glad-handing businessmen and investors means the development of a product can stagnate. The geeks need to return to programming, error checking and developing, while juggling the composition of a commercial team from scratch. It is little wonder that so few ideas come to full fruition.

Young start-ups usually have had two financing options: hands-off venture capitalists that are willing to plough money into a company without rolling up their sleeves, or business incubators that are short on funds but wealthy in enthusiasm and knowledge. The Sandpit, a London-based entrepreneurial organisation, has come up with a third way by taking equity in promising start-ups, giving them a direct investment in their success. Founded by Simon Campbell, The Sandpit made its first big investment last year in SoDash, a social media-powered sales platform for companies that relies heavily on artificial intelligence algorithms to predict and track public perception of brands. The Sandpit put 125,000 ($200,000) into SoDashs coffers, and provided staff and advice to the young company. Three months after partnering with The Sandpit an extra 120,000 of annualised sales to clients including RBS, Virgin Trains and Universal Music had been secured. SoDash won the PepsiCo10 competition, which highlights new technologies based in Europe.

Jonathan Grubin, head of product at The Sandpit, now splits his time between London and SoDashs offices in Edinburgh. He explains that Although were two separate groups on paper, we act and work as if the products are our own...we effectively become the commercial arm of the businesses we get involved with. Because of their equity stake, it is in The Sandpits interest to see SoDash grow. Simply throwing money in (the old venture capital set-up) is seen as inefficient. The Sandpit wants real returns from its investment, and lends all the manpower it can muster to help achieve that.

A hands-on process is beneficial for start-ups. Most entrepreneurs want to be plugged in to a network where they can get advice and help growing their business, says Robert Scoble, a respected tech blogger as a minor celebrity among geeks. A personal touch is needed in order to succeed, with relationships that plug the monetary and expertise gaps that are bound to exist in nascent tech start-ups. That is precisely what the likes of The Sandpit provide.

Facebook was and is a rule unto itself. The rest of the world has to sweet-talk financiers into parting with their cash. Marketing is therefore all-important for start-ups. As Mr Scoble explains, you have to be both good, and have a good bullhorn, to rise above the noise.

Stockholm emerges as European tech hub

London boasts the bars round Old Street's Silicon Roundabout while Berlin has the St Oberholz caf, but in Stockholm the social hub for the high-tech start-up scene is a quarterly poker game.

The game started in the office of a consumer ratings website four years ago, but is now a glitzy showroom event attended by hundreds of tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists looking for the next billion-dollar Swedish internet company to rival Spotify and Skype.

The expansion of "The Founders" event is a fitting symbol for the rise of Stockholm as a leading European tech start-up capital, which is now rivalling Berlin, Paris and London.

Stockholm is still some way behind London in terms of investment in new companies, but US venture capital firms invested nearly $200m in Swedish tech companies last year and $308m in 2010, more than twice the average amount invested between 2002 and 2008, and more than rival hubs in France and Germany, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

"A couple of years ago Stockholm was still recovering from the effects of the dotcom crash and few people saw it as a major tech start-up centre, but then along came Spotify in 2008 and a couple of other success stories last year and now it has the whole world's attention," said Fred Destin a venture capitalist at US-based Atlas Venture.

Recent successes aside from Spotify, the music-sharing website worth $1bn, include Klarna, an online payments service that allows users to pay for goods only once they have been delivered. The company won $155m in funding from General Atlantic of the US and DST Global, the Russian backer of Facebook, Twitter and Groupon, last year and has a valuation of close to $800m.

Slightly more than a year ago Qliktech, the business analytics company, successfully listed on Nasdaq and its share price has risen 30 per cent from its initial public offering price. Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5bn last year.

An analysis by venture capital firm Creandum reports that in the past five years,  2.6bn has been generated annually from Nordic tech-company exits, with more than half of this coming from Sweden alone.

Each major success helps to inject money, confidence and talent back into the city, according to local industry insiders. "Every company that makes it acts as a catalyst for new ideas, new start-ups and new investments. It's a ripple effect." said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive of Klarna.

Wrapp, for example, which is a promising social gifting site that started last year, is headed by the founder of Rebtel, a leading internet telephone company which this year surpassed 150m users, and the former technical head of Spotify. It has recently won funding from Atomico, the international venture capital firm formed by Niklas Zennstrm, co-founder of Skype.

Other recent start-ups that have benefited from the local scene include Mojang, the creator of Minecraft, an indie internet game that has already sold more than 2m copies, and iZettle, Europe's answer to mobile-payment company Square, which last year raised  8.2m in funding.

But there are also problems for Stockholm's tech scene, which could scupper its hopes of becoming Europe's Silicon Valley. Domestic venture capital funding still remains subdued following the dotcom crash at the turn of the century. The scene relies heavily on more fickle foreign money.

Talent, which is Stockholm's key commodity due to its world-class education system and history of high-tech engineering, is also problematically mobile. The people behind popular music website SoundCloud, for example, have moved to trendy Berlin while Videoplaza and Readmill have all moved headquarters to bigger markets abroad.

But for the moment, the majority of successful players have remained in Stockholm in one form or another as the "angel investors" or board members to local companies. "As long as the tax situation for start-ups and entrepreneurs is not getting worse and the poker game survives, keeping people in the city should not be a problem," said Kristofer Arwin, the founder of the quarterly poker game and the price comparison website PriceRunner.

ECB's Cheap Money May Carry a Cost

Who could resist the lure of almost free money? Certainly not Europe's banks.

The European Central Bank's second Long-Term Refinancing Operation attracted even more demand than the first. Eight hundred banks requested 529.5 billion euros ($712.7 billion) in three-year loans, compared with 523 banks taking 489 billion euros of loans last time. Strip out the refinancing of existing ECB facilities, and the amount of net new money being pumped into the European financial system is likely to have been 313 billion euros, up from 200 billion euros in December, broadly in line with expectations.

Even so, the size of the LTRO should be positive for markets, at least in the short term. The large number of participating banks lays to rest concerns that ECB facilities might be stigmatized. Easier collateral rules will have helped many banks without access to private markets to replace maturing funding. Smaller banks, in particular, could use cheap loans to fund carry trades, boosting their short-term profits and giving further support to sovereign-bond markets. Some banks are also likely to have used the LTRO to fund cross-border exposures where they have domestic deposit shortfalls as part of their contingency planning against a possible euro breakup.

But the LTRO is no panacea for the euro zone's economic problems. True, the ECB loans averted a nasty credit crunch, and easier financial conditions will provide some support to the real economy. But banks are unlikely to use LTRO money to fund new loans to businesses and households, which typically have maturities beyond three years; most banks will continue to deleverage to meet new capital rules. Any lasting boost to the real economy will depend on banks and governments pushing ahead with restructuring and reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness.

Ominously, there are already signs governments are taking advantage of easier financial conditions to backpedal on reform.

The Spanish banking-sector overhauls announced in January fell far short of the radical plan that had been promised; some in Madrid are now talking of relaxing fiscal targets. In France, the front-runner in the presidential elections, Francois Hollande, has been talking of lowering the retirement age to 60 from 62.

This is sure to alarm the ECB, which is anxious that the time bought by the LTRO be used well. After all, these LTRO loans will need to be refinanced in three years. And with governments also making the most of bank appetite for carry trades to issue shorter-dated bonds -- Spain has already issued 35% of its funding needs for this year, 65% of it with maturities of five years and under, according to Morgan Stanley research -- the euro zone could face the mother of all rollover risks in 2015.

-- Simon Nixon

Italian Curve Shows Limits to LTRO

Three is the magic number for bond investors to take away from the European Central Bank's long-term refinancing operations. The three-year maturity limits how far the ECB's cash injections, which total more than 1 trillion euros ($1.35 trillion), can reach: Banks will be unwilling to invest in assets maturing later than that. Italy's yield curve provides a vivid example.

Italian yields have fallen sharply since peaking in late November -- in large part thanks to the ECB's efforts. But while two-year yields have plummeted more than 5.5 percentage points to 2.23%, 10-year yields have fallen just over two points to 5.22%. The gap between the two of nearly three percentage points leaves the Italian yield curve looking extraordinarily steep. The gap between German two-year and 10-year yields is just 1.6 percentage points.

The steepness of the curve suggests investors still believe Italian government bonds carry credit risk -- something the ECB's liquidity can do nothing about. Longer-dated bonds potentially offer bigger capital gains than short-dated bonds if the euro-zone crisis is easing, yet investors aren't racing to snap them up. That reflects a number of risks. Prime Minister Mario Monti has a long way to go in implementing structural reform. Meanwhile, the economy has entered renewed recession. Further ratings downgrades could dent appetite for Italian debt, when the country still needs to sell over 200 billion euros of bonds this year.

True, the fall in short-dated yields has cut Italy's average cost of borrowing. The biggest problem in November wasn't that 10-year bonds yielded over 7%, but that two-year yields were even higher. So the steepening of the curve offers some genuine relief.

But without another LTRO on the horizon, investors should pay close attention to Mr. Monti's efforts to reform the Italian economy. If he succeeds, 10-year yields should drop as credit-risk fears recede, while if he struggles, two-year yields could rise as the liquidity rush fades. Either way, it's a reasonable bet the Italian yield curve will get flatter.

Good Times

For Standard

Chartered

For a bank like Standard Chartered, good just isn't good enough.

The U.K.-listed, emerging-markets bank reported pretax profit of $6.8 billion in 2011, up 11% from the year before and its ninth consecutive year of record profit. Over the past five years, it has boosted income by an average 15% a year, loans by 14% and earnings by 7%. And it boasts a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.2%, along with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 75%. That is hard to argue with.

Standard Chartered owes its success partly to geography: It is focused on Asia, the Middle East and Africa, where strong growth in trade is fueling demand for its cash-management, trade-finance, foreign-exchange and corporate-finance services. It also has been lucky, with European competitors scaling back in these areas. But mostly, it has been smart, tapping investors for $5.2 billion in 2010 to fund its growth.

But not everything always goes according to plan. The Indian unit, previously one of the best performers, fell victim to difficult economic conditions, with profit falling 33% to $804 million in 2011.

Profit at Standard Chartered's Korean subsidiary more than halved to $172 million following an industrial dispute.

Meanwhile, staff costs in Asia are soaring, although the bank held down operating-cost growth to 10%, in line with revenue. New U.K. bank taxes and ultraconservative liquidity regulations are costing the bank at least $500 million a year, it estimates.

As a result, Standard Chartered managed only a 12.2% return on equity in 2011 and, given the economic outlook, may now struggle to hit its midteens, medium-term target. For a bank that trades at 1.5 times book value -- a substantial premium to its European and Asian peers -- investors will likely want more.

-- Simon Nixon

Overheard: Mad Men Yields

It's beginning to feel a lot like . . . the early 1960s. John Lonski of Moody's Analytics notes that in February, the long-term single-A industrial company bond yield should average 4.42%, the lowest since December 1963, just after JFK's assassination. Yields on lower-rated corporate debt, meanwhile, are at their lowest level since 1966.

Both are still above the lowest point for such yields, which came in the mid-1940s. But that may actually be good news for some corporate executives. Super-low yields, while reducing borrowing costs, can spawn far-larger pension deficits.

These yields set the discount rate companies use to value their future pension obligation. So, the lower they go, the lower the discount rate and the higher the obligation. Further proof that even super-low interest rates can come with strings attached.

Business
Fed Raises Bar For Bank Deals

By Maya Jackson Randall

U.S. regulators eventually gave the green light to the $9 billion merger of Capital One Financial Corp. and ING Direct in a key test of the financial rules-of-the-road since the Dodd-Frank Act.

But the Federal Reserve Board may be less accommodating to more-complex medium and large banks, analysts and experts said.

Capital One's purchase of the online banking unit of ING Groep NV, which closed Friday, was the first major U.S. bank deal to undergo heightened scrutiny designed to prevent the emergence of larger banks with greater systemic risk that could be deemed "too big to fail" or put the economy at risk. Now, large banks that are seeking to purchase as little as $2 billion in financial assets will likely face delays and more examination to make sure any potential benefit to the public from the deal isn't outweighed by heightened risk.

The latest Fed decision, which followed its approval in December of a smaller acquisition by PNC Financial Services Group Inc., is mixed news for Fifth Third Bancorp and Huntington Bancshares Inc., which have expressed at least some interest in acquisitions. The ruling could also affect the U.S. units of European banks, including Banco Santander SA's Sovereign Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC's Citizens Financial Group, as Europe's debt crisis leads to speculation of sales.

"Organizations that are much larger than Capital One, or that are significantly engaged in more-complex activities such as investment banking, securities underwriting and dealing, insurance or provision of core clearing and settlement services, may experience more difficulty in persuading the Federal Reserve Board that major acquisitions do not present significant financial stability concerns," law firm Sullivan and Cromwell LLP said in a memo.

The Fed's 40-page order the most-detailed analysis of how Washington will measure systemic risk sends a cautionary note to sizable banks looking to gobble up their peers through cost-saving combinations.

The Fed required Capital One to improve its risk-management programs and to beef up infrastructure given that Capital One has faced lawsuits over efforts to repossess automobiles and allegations that it has collected debt from customers whose debts had been discharged in bankruptcy.

"The bar is being raised for all banks," Capital One Chief Financial Officer Gary Perlin said Thursday at a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. conference.

Size matters, but it isn't the only factor. " 'Too-big-to-fail' is a pithy moniker. But it should be called, 'too-important-to-fail,' " said Joseph Vitale, a partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP. He said he expects bank deals but only at a sluggish pace.

The Fed indicated it will consider several factors to assess whether a firm's collapse would disrupt trading or funding in key markets. It will review how easy it would be for other companies to offer substitute products; a bank's financial exposure to other firms; the complexity of the combined firm's activities and the extent of the firm's cross-border activities. It will also consider the "opaqueness and complexity of an institution's internal organization."

The Fed signaled that modest corporate reshuffles are unlikely to pose concerns. Also, small transactions under $2 billion in assets are likely to get a pass, along with mergers that leave a bank with less than $25 billion in total assets.

The Fed ultimately found that Capital One doesn't engage in business activities or markets that would put the economy at risk in the event of financial distress, adding that the firm "would be significantly less complicated to resolve than the largest U.S. universal banks and investment banks."

"I think we were all kind of surprised and taken aback by the level of scrutiny and the length of time it took," said Paul Miller, analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. Pressure from consumers and political groups also slowed the deal.

The Fed analysis is a warning sign to the nation's giant firms J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , Bank of America Corp., and Citigroup Inc. which engage heavily in more-complex activities such as investment banking and securities underwriting.

"It's a speed-bump for traditional M&A [mergers and acquisitions] for regional banks. It's a game-changer for anything else," said Karen Shaw Petrou, co-founder of Federal Financial Analytics, which provides analysis on financial policy.

Big regional banks such as Fifth Third, Huntington and FirstMerit Corp., which have under $150 billion in assets, are in a sweet spot, said Tom Mitchell, analyst at Miller Tabak, who added that the industry is "ripe for a lot more consolidation" in the next 18 to 24 months.

"Any bank under $500 billion is probably a candidate to make an acquisition and probably every bank of up to $100 billion in deposits or assets is a candidate to be taken over," Mr. Mitchell said.

Huntington Chief Executive Stephen Steinour recently indicated that the bank is on the prowl. "We remain in a posture where we are looking," he said on a recent earnings call. Fifth Third Bancorp Chief Executive Kevin Kabat said at a December conference that mergers and acquisitions are "an avenue that will present important opportunities for us in the future."

RBS Row May Have Unintended Victims

The row over bank bonuses has continued relentlessly in the U.K. for five years, starting with the 2008 bonus round in the initial aftermath of the credit crunch. But the successful campaign to force Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester to give up the GBP 1 million ($1.57 million) share award to which he was contractually entitled takes the row to a new level. A Rubicon may have been crossed: This move may have real-world consequences.

The first consequence is likely to be felt at the bank itself. Mr. Hester is unlikely to storm off in protest, at least not just yet. But the treatment of Mr. Hester -- the man brought in to rescue RBS appeared in danger of becoming almost as vilified as his predecessor, Fred Goodwin -- confirms that RBS is now a political football. The bonus row follows Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne's decision in December to claim credit for the closure of parts of RBS's investment-banking division. Any impression that the government is now calling the shots is sure to make it harder to retain and recruit high-quality staff. To the extent that hits performance, it also will hit the value of the bank.

The second consequence is likely to be felt in the wider economy. The bonus row sends a clear signal to the bosses of all the U.K. banks that they should avoid any entanglement with the British state at all costs, including relying on U.K. authorities for liquidity as well as capital. This comes at a time when the economic costs of rapid financial-sector deleveraging are only just being fully appreciated.

In recent months, the Treasury has become sufficiently alarmed at the impact on growth that it has launched programs to underwrite the risk of some mortgage lending and lending to small and medium-size enterprises. Last week, it also published a memorandum of understanding with the Bank of England that would allow it to direct the BOE to supply emergency liquidity to banks. Some U.K. bankers believe the BOE's refusal to provide European Central Bank-style liquidity support lies behind the U.K.'s recent economic underperformance. Yet the bonus row will only encourage banks to run themselves even more conservatively, hoarding liquidity and capital. That could further undermine growth at a time when the government wants banks to lend.

Finally, the episode may fuel doubts over London's future as a financial center. Among international bankers at Davos last week, there was widespread concern that the U.K. is becoming an unpredictable and hostile environment to do business. That doesn't mean banks that have invested heavily in London are about to leave, but it does mean the City may struggle to capture its share of new investment. After all, a financial center that is uncomfortable with people making money isn't much of a financial center at all.

Portugal Needs Help to Convince Market

The market has made up its mind on Portugal. Like Greece last year, five-year bond yields are north of 20%, a deep recession is coming and a clear financing gap lurks in 2013: The Portuguese bailout program pencils in 9.3 billion euros ($12.3 billion) of bond sales for that year. But Portugal isn't necessarily doomed to a debt restructuring -- as long as the euro zone has learned from Greece and steps in to fill the gap.

The immediate catalyst for the Portuguese bond implosion was Standard & Poor's downgrade to "junk." Even though Moody's and Fitch already rated Portugal similarly, this has still caused index-tracking funds to sell. It also raised the already-high bar for returning to market. Portugal will now need to win upgrades back to investment-grade from two of the three main rating firms. The second major factor is the disastrous Greek restructuring itself. Euro-zone promises that Greece is "unique" aren't enough to reassure investors.

Portugal faces a hard 2012. The economy is forecast to contract 3%, and austerity will bite. But the government has political backing for its program, and there is little social unrest. The tough 2012 budget, which includes public-sector wage and job cuts, won 90% approval in Parliament. Structural changes are getting under way. The cost to firms of dismissing workers has been cut sharply, and the authorities have committed to limit collective wage bargaining in 2012.

Unlike Greece, Portugal beat its 2011 budget-deficit target of 5.9% of GDP, although only by partially transferring bank pension funds to the social-security system. Its debt is forecast to reach 116% of GDP this year, far below Greece's and comparable to Ireland and Italy. Export growth in 2011 was strong, with goods exports up 15.4% on the year in November, as Portugal seeks to capitalize on historic trading links with Africa and Latin America. The euro-zone economy may yet be more buoyant than expected this year, too.

Given the euro zone's track record, investors are right to be concerned. Portugal can build goodwill among its lenders by carrying out reform, and there is time to find a solution to 2013's funding gap. But the market knows the fate of Portugal's bondholders will be determined in Berlin and Brussels, not Lisbon.

Carrefour

Needs to Go

Under Knife

Carrefour has been given an urgent transfusion of new blood. Under current CEO Lars Olofsson, the French retailer has suffered five profit warnings, a failed Brazilian merger and a 33% share-price slide. Georges Plassat, who will take the helm in June, has good credentials. But investors must hope he has a taste for more radical surgery.

Carrefour's biggest problem is its home market -- responsible for almost half of group sales -- where it is losing market share. Sales growth in Latin America and Asia has slowed for five straight quarters. Lower earnings could soon start to make net debt, now 2.3 times Ebitda, look uncomfortably high. Pressure on cash flows could force Carrefour to cut its dividend as much as 35% in March, analysts forecast.

Mr. Olofsson cut prices and put beauty parlors and child-care facilities in hypermarkets. But analysts say Carrefour's stock management is weak and the price cutting didn't go far enough. Mr. Plassat should consider more extreme steps: selling the subscale Polish and Turkish businesses or listing a minority stake in one of its "growth market" businesses. He could even stop selling nonfood items, where performance is disappointing, and lease store space to clothing groups.

But strong unions make it hard to cut jobs in France, where Carrefour has more distribution capacity than it needs. Attracting customers to hypermarkets will remain difficult, while high gasoline prices make it costly to drive there. With a presence in 32 markets, Carrefour's size makes it a management headache.

Mr. Plassat, a former senior executive at Carrefour and head of rival Casino France, is well qualified. Most recently, he turned a struggling shoe retailer into retail giant Vivarte. But Mr. Olofsson, a top Nestle executive, also came highly recommended. A 4% fall in Carrefour's shares Monday suggests investors aren't expecting the patient to recover soon.

Overheard

Thorsten Heins is certainly optimistic, though he may not be very realistic. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday, the new CEO at Research In Motion grew feisty explaining that the BlackBerry maker is in a stronger position than critics suggest. "We're not losing money," he pointed out. But RIM is losing smartphone market share. Rapidly. At the start of 2010, RIM's share was 20%. That halved to 10% by last year's third quarter, estimates Strategy Analytics. Mr. Heins called RIM "a growth story in the rest of the world, a turnaround story in the U.S." Sure, RIM is still increasing the subscribers world-wide that pay to access its proprietary-data network, but if its handset shipments continue their recent decline, subscriber growth could hit a wall.

The CEO flashed his BlackBerry Bold, calling it an "iconic device." Though an impressive upgrade, he shouldn't get carried away.

ECB May Hold Key to Debt Labyrinth

The European Central Bank could help solve Greece's debt puzzle. Talks with private bondholders on a "voluntary" deal to cut 100 billion euros ($129.3 billion) off Greece's debt have faltered, with banks arguing they have made the best offer they possibly can. It is increasingly likely that euro-zone governments will need to take a loss, too, to make Greece's debt profile look sustainable. A move to restructure the ECB's estimated 45 billion euros-50 billion euros holding of Greek bonds could unlock the process.

The ECB isn't involved in the Greek private-sector debt-restructuring process, which covers some 200 billion euros of debt, as it is an official body. It bought bonds to try to stabilize the market rather than as an investment. It has powerful arguments for why it needs to avoid losses. First, it would make it impossible for the ECB to accept Greek paper as collateral for lending to banks, cutting the Greek banking system adrift and effectively ejecting Greece from the euro -- a potential disaster scenario. Second, it would put an end to any further ECB bond purchases, removing a key tool that has proved effective in damping the crisis in Spain and Italy.

But if the ECB insists its bonds are paid off in full, that could strengthen the hand of other investors in holding out against a voluntary deal. Greece might then have to introduce and use so-called collective-action clauses in the bonds to force holdouts to participate. In that case, it is difficult to see how the ECB could extricate itself. While creditors with differing claims can be treated separately, creditors holding the same bond should be treated equally.

One idea is for the ECB to swap its bonds at the price at which it bought them for paper issued by the European Financial Stability Facility. The EFSF could then tender these bonds into the swap, with the government guarantors of the EFSF bearing the losses. After all, these governments would need to recapitalize the ECB if it took a significant loss anyway. But this way, the ECB balance sheet would remain intact.

Greece would get extra debt relief of up to 25 billion euros, potentially smoothing the path of a second bailout. More private holders of bonds might prove willing to agree to the "voluntary" deal because if government entities took losses, it would be harder to argue they should be treated differently. Fears of higher losses for holders of bonds from other countries where the ECB has been buying -- Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- could also recede. That could encourage buyers to return to these markets.

Politically, euro-zone governments would have to countenance upfront losses -- a huge problem. But the cost of a Greek deal falling apart is likely to be much higher.

BlackBerry Revival Requires Sure Touch

For Research In Motion, this weekend was all about research in demotion.

Unfortunately for investors, the departure of co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie came with no obvious shift in the BlackBerry maker's strategy. Ultimately, to save the company, new CEO Thorsten Heins may have to exit from handsets completely.

With a change at the top, investors were excited the door might even be open for a possible sale of the company. Yet Mr. Heins said he doesn't plan a big break with the past.

Having stuck to keyboard-based BlackBerrys, RIM can't compete with touch-based devices from the likes of Apple and Samsung. As those two have separated from the pack, the smartphone business has become a two-horse race, says analyst Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics.

Like his predecessors, Mr. Heins is staking the company's future on a new operating system. Originally expected in its smartphones early this year, RIM now says not to expect those phones until the end of 2012. That launch date would be nearly six years behind the first iPhone.

RIM hopes its new operating system will reinvigorate its products and perhaps appeal to other handset makers interested in licensing it. Yet two mobile operating systems, Apple's iOS and Google's Android, already dominate the market.

Even if RIM doesn't want to sell itself, there is still hope for shareholders. Network outages aside, the company tends to deliver email more efficiently than rivals through its proprietary servers.

Subscription fees to access this network generate a bit more than $3 a share of earnings per year, estimates Jefferies Research analyst Peter Misek, while handsets now contribute little to no profit. Of course, if Blackberry devices disappear, so will this revenue stream. The solution, argues Mr. Misek, could be to offer the BlackBerry email experience to iPhone and Android users for a fee.

In that scenario, RIM might have to scale back its handset business. It would be a risky path. Yet it may grow increasingly appealing if RIM continues to slide.

-- Rolfe Winkler

UniCredit

Has Started

To Right Ship

Fortune favors the brave -- or desperate. Two weeks ago, UniCredit's efforts to raise 7.5 billion euros ($9.7 billion) of new capital looked to be going nowhere. Despite pricing the new shares at a deep discount, shares in the Italian bank fell nearly 50% in the first week after the terms were announced. Yet they have since rallied, and investors are back in the black, allowing for the effect of the new shares. Barring a euro disaster, UniCredit should now raise its money. But don't expect its success to spark a wave of deals.

UniCredit shares are still down 35% since it first said it planned to raise capital in November after the European Banking Authority stress test revealed a large capital hole. Since the start of January, more than 20% of the share register has changed hands. But investors who bought the rights to buy new shares at their low point two weeks ago have made nearly five times their money. Given how far UniCredit has underperformed European banks, the rally could have further to run.

So this should be a golden moment for other banks to tap markets. The EBA stress test revealed a 115 billion euro capital shortfall across the European banking sector. But most banks say they can meet their capital-ratio targets via deleveraging -- or shedding assets. Investors don't want to put capital into banks that can't deliver an economic return on equity under new regulatory rules.

Besides, most banks are too busy putting together full-year results to pull together the up-to-date financial data for a rights issue. The next opportunity might be around the time of first-quarter results in May. At that point, bankers anticipate a number of institutions could be tempted to take their chances, including Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and some of the medium-size Spanish and Italian groups. But that depends on markets retaining their current optimism -- and bank boards feeling bold.

Overheard: AIG Raps Earnings Hopes

In 2008, AIG's near-collapse hit financial markets like a hurricane. Four years later, it is providing a tailwind for earnings growth.

S&P 500 companies are on track to boost earnings 9.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet. While under recent double-digit improvements, that's hardly a catastrophe. But AIG juices the numbers. It is expected to post earnings of 62 cents a share, versus a year-ago loss of $16.20. Strip that out, and the S&P 500's earnings-growth rate falls to just 2.2%. Meanwhile, the share of firms missing earnings estimates is the highest this cycle. Analysts have gone from expecting 14% earnings growth for 2012 back in July to about 9.6% now. And that may still be too high. According to Barclays Capital, the high ratio of quarterly earnings misses so far points to a further slide in full-year forecasts. Stocks will need another handhold to continue their climb.

Cure for Japan Rests

With Europe's Healing

The gloom over Japan has been bad, and it should have been even gloomier.

The central-bank survey of business sentiment, the Tankan, shows that Japan is in worse shape than most expected. The strong yen -- and weak euro -- are hurting exports, as is the fallout from floods in Thailand, which has buckled supply chains barely recovered from disruption after the March earthquake.

Worse still, big corporations said they now plan to increase capital expenditures far less than most economists had expected in the fiscal year through March. Spending on plant and equipment accounts for about 15% of the economy, so a dip is bound to hurt. Companies small and large say profits will fall nearly 5% this year, while almost all expect prices for their goods and services to decline in the next three months, after worsening in the previous quarter, too.

All eyes are on the Bank of Japan and the government in Tokyo to see whether they can arrest the slide.

Certainly, the nation's $154 billion reconstruction package will support the economy early next year. The central bank can ease monetary policy a bit more, too, by increasing its asset purchases and upping buys of Japanese government bonds to lift liquidity in the market and keep borrowing rates low.

But there is little reason to think BOJ measures will have much impact. The bank's recent efforts have done little to limit the rise of the yen.

Getting Japan up and running will be possible only with a turnaround beyond the nation's borders. If the European Union can resolve its sovereign-debt crisis, that could stabilize the yen-euro exchange rate and also potentially drive demand for Japanese exports. That is a tall order. In the meantime, clouds over Japan's economy show little sign of lifting.

Call It Research in Demotion

Research In Motion shareholders are hanging up on the stock. Perhaps for good reason.

The BlackBerry maker's shares have fallen about 74% this year to date and are off 19% since the company said two weeks ago that it was taking a $485 million provision against the value of its disastrous Playbook tablets. Investors are realizing that, even though the stock currently fetches just 3.5 times this fiscal year's expected earnings, it could easily go far lower.

History hasn't been kind to handset makers whose devices go out of style. Palm racked up operating losses of nearly $400 million the two years before Hewlett-Packard mercifully scooped it up for $1.2 billion. After the RAZR fad fizzled, Motorola's handset business had operating losses of over $5 billion from 2007 through 2010.

RIM seems on a similar path as it loses market share. In the third quarter of 2010, RIM had 15% share of the smartphone market, estimates Strategy Analytics. That fell to 10% in this year's third quarter.

And those share losses are set to continue. On top of handset problems, the firm's reputation for offering a bullet-proof corporate-email service took a hammering from October's widespread network outage. Poor sales of the Playbook mean the company isn't competitive in tablets. Morgan Stanley projects sales of recent smartphone models could disappoint. And, perhaps most worrisome, is the late release of its new BlackBerry 10 operating system.

It is hard to say how cheap is too cheap for the shares. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski argued in a November note to clients that on a "sum-of-the-parts" basis the company is worth some $9.6 billion, about 21% above the current valuation.

But such analyses make aggressive assumptions. For starters, it is notoriously difficult to estimate the value of patents. Goldman estimates RIM's patents are worth a tidy $3.6 billion. Second, Goldman puts at $4.6 billion the present value of cash flows from RIM's highly profitable service business, which charges for routing messages through its own servers.

One hope is that a buyer will emerge. But it isn't clear who would step up.

One long-rumored acquirer is Microsoft, which has struggled to break into the mobile market. RIM is strong among enterprise customers, Microsoft's sweet spot. Plus, buying RIM would give Microsoft the ability to control both smartphone hardware and software in the future. Such a vertically integrated model has helped Apple leap ahead of its rivals.Google will have an opportunity to do the same once it completes its purchase of Motorola Mobility.

But Microsoft still would face the huge challenge of turning RIM around. The integration would be messy and Microsoft is instead likely focused on a recent deal that put its operating system inside Nokia's devices.

Nor does RIM seem cheap enough to attract interest from private-equity firms.

Meanwhile, co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie have resisted change. With 10% of the stock between them, any takeover might have to be hostile, adding to risks.

Shareholders need to take a more active role to force change and stop the company's downward spiral. Barring drastic changes at the company, BlackBerry shares still deserve a raspberry.

China's Stability Landed in Trouble

A village of 20,000 in open rebellion against local government points to the challenge Beijing faces in maintaining social stability in a challenging economic environment.

Like many instances of social unrest in China, the uprising in Wukan, a fishing village in Guangdong, has land at its center. Villagers claim local officials illegally sold land to a developer, pocketing the proceeds without properly compensating the residents.

Yu Jianrong, an expert on social disorder at China's Academy of Social Science, estimates that 65% of the tens of thousands of disputes that occur in China's countryside each year are related to land.

There may be more to come. Local governments' borrowing spree in 2009-10 was underpinned by the promise of land sales to repay debts. According to a National Audit Office report published in June, local governments are on the hook for 10.7 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion), and 2.5 trillion yuan of that is guaranteed by land sales.

To put that number in perspective, total local government revenue from land sales in 2010 came to 2.9 trillion yuan. In other words, local governments have to sell land equal to almost the entire amount sold in 2010 just to cover debts falling due over the next few years. If they want funds to continue paying for roads, schools and hospitals, they will have to sell even more.

Worse, prices are falling. Data from property agency Soufun show sales of residential land down 55% year over year in November and prices down 7%. That isn't a surprise as developers slow investment in preparation for a tough 2012.

In 2009, channeling the economic stimulus through local governments and bank loans looked like a smart option. Now there is a price to be paid.

Yanzhou Finds Keeping

A Vow Can Be a Burden

China's Yanzhou Coal made a promise to the Australian government in 2009. Now it must deliver without shooting itself in the foot.

When the Chinese coal miner bought Australia's Felix Resources two years ago for 3.5 billion Australian dollars (US$3.5 billion), it agreed to list at least 30% of its Australian assets by the end of 2012. The deal appeared to leave all parties happy.

With a year to go, however, Yanzhou's promise has left it with a dilemma. Australia's market for initial public offerings is in the doldrums. This year's biggest deal was for just US$217 million, and total IPO volumes are 87% below year-ago levels. The market could come back to life next year, but the chances of Yanzhou getting a good price for its assets look slim amid ongoing global volatility.

Yancoal -- the company's Australian subsidiary -- has spent around A$750 million on Australian assets on top of the Felix purchase, which means it would be looking at a listing of upward of A$1.3 billion. That would be one of the largest floats since late 2009. While coal assets are hot these days, investors know Yanzhou has a firm deadline for listing.

Breaking the promise isn't an option. Enter the possibility of a reverse takeover, which Yanzhou's deputy general manager said this week is on the table. This would involve using a smaller, listed company that would in essence buy the Yancoal assets. That would see Yanzhou come through on its deal with Canberra without having to go through the costly IPO process or risk unloading 30% of its Australian business into a tough equity market.

But the move wouldn't be without risks. The backdoor listing process is under intense scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and Canada, where a spate of accounting scandals has been partly blamed on misuse of reverse takeovers by Chinese firms. In Australia, the practice is less controversial, but mostly because it isn't very common.

Still, a reverse takeover could land Yanzhou with cumbersome and possibly unpredictable regulatory red tape. In 2009, when Gloucester Coal and Whitehaven Coal proposed a merger in which shareholders of Gloucester, the smaller of the two, didn't get a chance to vote, the case ended up in a complicated appeals process involving the takeover panel.

In theory, either an IPO or a reverse takeover should satisfy Yanzhou's commitment to the government and fulfill the goal of subjecting Yancoal to Australian disclosure laws.

But the Chinese company must tread carefully. A forced IPO would see it shed value. But a contentious reverse takeover could hurt Australian-Chinese business relations for which the Felix deal was once feted.

Euro Stress Indicators Are Flashing Red

Many weeks have been called the worst of the financial crisis. But this past one has as good a claim as any. Wild swings in euro-zone bond markets and a further deterioration in bank-funding conditions have raised many stress indicators to levels last seen after Lehman's 2008 collapse. The difference this time is that policy makers have fewer bullets to fire.

In government-bond markets, the gap between 10-year French and German debt rose above two percentage points Thursday, a level unseen since the early 1990s. That, together with moves in Dutch and Finnish debt, suggests investors are starting to see a real risk of a euro-zone breakup. Meanwhile, U.K. gilt yields have fallen to record lows.

Stresses in the banking system also are building. Long-term funding has evaporated. The cost of insuring 10 million euros ($13.46 million) of European bank and insurer debt for five years via the Markit iTraxx Senior Financials index was 300,000 euros Thursday, close to a record and far over March 2009's peak of 211,000 euros.

Short-term bank borrowing rates are failing to reflect declines in expected official interest rates, as measured by overnight index swaps. The three-month Euribor/OIS spread hit 0.91 percentage point this past week, the widest since March 2009, according to Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. That implies any central-bank rate cuts won't help much.

And European banks are having to pay through the nose to get dollars via the markets: The euro-U.S. dollar cross-currency basis swap was negative 1.3 percentage points Friday, based on RBS. This indicator went below minus-two percentage points after Lehman's collapse, but quickly recovered. This time, it has been deteriorating since April.

In 2008, central banks were able to ease strains by cutting rates and pumping liquidity into the system. But this time, interest rates are low and liquidity is abundant: Banks have 230.9 billion euros deposited overnight at the European Central Bank. They bid to deposit another 260.5 billion euros for seven days this past week at an 187 billion euro auction designed to sterilize ECB government-bond purchases. The ECB has announced new one-year refinancing operations and pledged unlimited cash to banks until the middle of 2012. That suggests there may be worse weeks to come.

Deutsche Boerse Throws Deal Dice Again

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext knew the European competition authorities wouldn't be a pushover. But they have encountered stiff antitrust objections to their planned $17.7 billion merger. In response, the exchanges have offered to open up their clearing business to third parties. But while the move is symbolically important, it is unlikely to satisfy the deal's critics.

Deutsche Boerse believes its offer to let third parties clear new equities-index and interest-rate derivatives on Eurex is a major concession that addresses concerns over future competition. Until now, it hasn't countenanced any breach of its integrated trading and clearing model.

As for current competition, the exchanges are confident Brussels accepts that Eurex and NYSE Liffe don't compete head on. Liquidity in a given product tends to concentrate in one exchange or another. Eurex and Liffe dominate, respectively, the markets for products based on longer-term and shorter-term rates. Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have also offered to sell their single stock-option trading and clearing activities that do overlap.

Even so, Eurex and Liffe are likely to retain a 90%-plus combined share of European exchange-traded contracts -- at least until new derivatives products emerge in Europe. Eurex won't clear rival versions of the exchanges' existing products. The exchanges' argument that the merger should be judged in the context of the broader market for derivatives, 80% of which are traded over the counter, has already been rejected.

But Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's fate will be determined by the full college of European Commissioners at a ruling set for Jan. 23. Their best hope may be to encourage the EC to look beyond immediate competition concerns to longer-term shifts in Europe's financial-markets. The merger could save hard-pressed banks and insurers $3 billion in collateral. Vertical integration is an industry trend. Take the London Stock Exchange's bid for LCH.Clearnet. Brussels-led reform is fostering competition and should ultimately diminish Deutsche Boerse's market share.

Ultimately, the prospect of a European-led exchanges champion may yet prove too politically tempting to resist.

Glencore Stock

Needs More

Than a Squeeze

Glencore's share price could do with a fillip. The Swiss company's stock has fallen 25% since its hyped flotation in May, as investors struggle with its unusual mix of mining and trading. Late this week, more of its shares will become tradable, offering hope of a technical bounce. For now, such hope looks overrated.

Glencore's free float is now a measly 11.7% of its share base. Its employees hold most of the rest, including CEO Ivan Glasenberg's 15.7% stake. But Glencore gained quick entry into the FTSE 100 on the promise its free float would expand to meet the 50% minimum required of foreign companies within a year of its May 24 listing. Thursday, cornerstone investors in the IPO -- including Abu Dhabi's sovereign-wealth fund, BlackRock and a Chinese mining company -- become free to sell their stakes, totaling 5.2% of shares.

For index purposes, Glencore's increased 16.9% float will be treated as a 20% free float. In turn, Glencore's weighting in FTSE and MSCI indexes will rise. Funds tracking these benchmarks will have to buy more shares. Assuming FTSE and MSCI tracker funds now hold 10% and 5% of Glencore's free float, they could have to buy 83 million more shares, Credit Suisse estimates. That will represent 7% of the increased free float, a significant chunk. Still, the impact will be phased: The FTSE's reweighting occurs Dec. 16, the MSCI's, not until the end of February. Existing investors will have had plenty of time to position themselves ahead of the changes. And some cornerstone investors might decide to sell part of their holdings.

Besides, Glencore's share price is unlikely to become detached from fundamentals for long. In May, employees are free to sell their 36% stake in the company, triggering another index reweighting. Whether this causes a stock squeeze or a share-price fall will depend on how many of Mr. Glasenberg's colleagues share his optimism about Glencore's future.

Overheard: Shedding Light on Nokia's Lumia

By one early measure, Windows Phone isn't going to stop Nokia's slide. Analyst Pierre Ferragu of Bernstein Research points to Google Trends data that show Nokia's newest smartphones aren't generating much buzz with consumers. Searches for "Nokia Lumia" -- its first high-end devices based on Microsoft's mobile operating system -- peaked just after the phones were announced. And at a level that trails the maker's 2010 device, the "N8," itself a bust.

That is bad news for Nokia, which has seen its share of the world-wide smartphone market collapse from 33% to 14% over the past year, according to Strategy Analytics. Dumping its own mobile operating system in favor of Windows Phone is CEO Stephen Elop's hail Mary to recapture momentum.

But Apple and others may be too far ahead. To wit: Searches for "iPhone 4S" peaked at a level 20 times that of the Lumia devices.

China's Day of Reckoning Isn't Here Yet

It is too early to start betting on the collapse of China.

A shaky world economy has investors understandably nervous. For many, a hard landing for China, with GDP growth for 2012 dipping sharply below the 8% mark, has moved from outlying risk to central scenario.

One measure of bearish sentiment, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, has fallen 35% since the end of June.

Markets have gotten ahead of themselves. Yes, China heads into the possibility of a second global downturn with more problems than it did the first. Its main weaknesses are dependence on exports, a real-estate bubble and burgeoning public debt. All are real problems. But it has enough growth momentum and room to maneuver to make a soft landing the most likely outcome.

The importance of exports as a driver of China's growth is overstated. Exports as a percentage of China's 2010 gross domestic product were 27%, down from 35% in 2007. In value-added terms, the real share of exports is even smaller. UBS economist Wang Tao sees a base case in which falling exports shave a percentage point from China's 2012 GDP growth. With GDP growth expected to be around 9% in 2011, all else being equal, that is hardly a disaster.

Real-estate investment is a key driver of China's growth, equal to around 14% of GDP in 2010. Ghost towns of empty houses raise fears that construction might be set to slow sharply. But with millions moving from the countryside to the city each year, and rising wages driving demand for higher-quality accommodations for existing city dwellers, fundamental demand is strong.

Rising debt is another worry. An investment-based response to the 2008 crisis saw local governments rack up enormous debts -- 10.7 trillion yuan ($1.68 trillion), according to the National Audit Office. Investors fear that much of that will end up as bad loans on the banks' balance sheets.

There is another way to look at the problem, though. Research firm Dragonomics calculates that China's per-capita capital stock in 2010 was just 6% to 7% of that in the U.S. Starting from a very low capital base, even an investment splurge like that in 2009-2010 is likely to have produced more bridges to somewhere than bridges to nowhere.

That should also allay the worst fears about a surge in nonperforming loans. Assets on the other side of the balance sheet mean that in many cases, local governments are good for their debts. Even if all the borrowing by local governments goes bad, China is still not maxed out on debt. The range of analysts' estimates for the total of national, local, and other debts that might end up on the Ministry of Finance's balance sheet is 60% to 85% of 2010 GDP.

That is far below public debt to GDP of 94% in the U.S. or 220% in Japan, according to International Monetary Fund figures. Unlike many other countries, China still has fiscal firepower to support growth.

China is getting riskier. Without reform, there will be a day of reckoning for the economy, but this is not it.

The Consequences From QE Gone Wild

The mantra of lower for longer doesn't just apply to short-term interest rates; it holds for bond yields, too.

The Bank of England's new GBP 75 billion ($116 billion) quantitative-easing program and a gloomy economic outlook will likely push U.K. government bond yields lower, particularly for long-dated debt. That will cause complications and distortions.

The BOE's program is assuming epic scale. Once total purchases reach GBP 275 billion, it will have spent the equivalent of 19% of 2010 gross domestic product. It already holds GBP 177.7 billion of non-inflation-linked gilts, or 23% of the total once government holdings are excluded, says Morgan Stanley. Purchases over the next four months, added to redemptions and interest payments, will outstrip new issuance by some GBP 60 billion, UBS estimates.

The BOE is splitting its purchases evenly between three baskets: bonds maturing in three to 10 years, 10 to 25 years and 25 years or more. Thus GBP 50 billion of buying will be beyond 10 years. But heavy issuance in recent years due to the financial crisis has been weighted toward shorter maturities.

The BOE will be buying where paper is relatively scarce. There are only GBP 74 billion of bonds maturing in more than 25 years that the BOE could buy, versus GBP 125 billion in the three- to 10-year bucket, Barclays Capital calculates. The gap between 10-year and 50-year gilt yields narrowed 0.1 percentage point Thursday.

Lower yields pose a threat to pension funds, reducing returns and increasing deficits. Companies have to make larger payments, eating into profits.

Worse, pension funds and insurers have to invest more in bonds to meet new regulatory rules on matching assets and liabilities. BOE purchases will compete directly with them.

But they should expect no respite. QE may one day reach GBP 500 billion, Citigroup thinks. The unintended savings market consequences are only starting to emerge.

Sony Makes

A Brave Call

On Handsets

A potential deal for Sony to take full ownership of its mobile-phone joint venture with Ericsson makes strategic sense. Whether Sony could pull it off successfully is less straightforward.

The electronics giant is in talks to buy the half of Sony Ericsson it doesn't already own, in a deal worth up to $1.7 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The deal isn't confirmed.

Certainly, a new approach would be welcome. Sony Ericsson returned to profit in the fiscal year ended in March, after a fairly dismal run, by focusing on higher-end smartphones using the popular Google-backed Android operating system. That has been at the expense of its lower-end handsets. Sony Ericsson's share of the global cellphone market halved to 2.1% in the second quarter from two years ago, estimates Strategy Analytics. But its share of global smartphones jumped to 4.1% from 0.6% over the period.

Even so, it remains subscale. It was the seventh-largest vendor behind such giants as Apple, with 18.5% and HTC with 10.9%. More scale is crucial for Sony Ericsson to lift operating margins.

Certainly, with a single owner in control, decisions on new phones and other matters would be taken faster. Sony may be able to better integrate the handset business with its tablet PCs and hand-held game consoles, and link up the phones to its nascent online music, movie and games business.

The question is whether Sony, grappling with red ink in the television unit and the yen's strength against the euro, has the resources necessary to focus on handsets.

While some recent Sony Ericsson smartphones have earned decent reviews, Sony's recent track record of producing must-have gadgets isn't good. Coming up with a winning smartphone strategy still looks like a tall order.

Louis Vuitton is hunting crocs -- and not the brightly-colored foam clogs that are staging something of a fashion comeback.

Rather the French luxury powerhouse is buying Heng Long International.

The Singapore-based business sources, tans and processes crocodilian leather.

It's a decent sized bite at $124 million.

And like, say, steelmakers buying iron ore mines, LVMH is employing classic vertical integration: It won't be dependent on suppliers if the supply of leather falls short of demand for fancy handbags and loafers.

It's anyone's guess which part of the supply chain will be gobbled up next.

How about an LVMH ostrich ranch?

A Fear Gauge Comes Up Short --- Analysis Shows Credit-Default Swaps, a Popular Indicator of Market Health, Are Thinly Traded

Corrections & Amplifications

CMA, a data analytics firm, is a unit of the CME Group. A Money & Investing article Wednesday on credit-default swaps incorrectly said CMA is a unit of CMA Group.

(WSJ September 29, 2011)

(END)

Wall Street is glued to a gauge of trading fear that has surprisingly few trades behind it.

In recent years, credit-default swaps -- contracts that give the buyer the right to collect a payment from the seller if a borrower defaults on its obligations -- have risen from obscurity to an avidly tracked barometer of the financial health of everything from Bank of America Corp. to Greece.

In some cases they have even come to serve as a stand-in for stock quotes when U.S. exchanges are closed.

Before stock markets opened in New York on Aug. 23, for example, the price quoted for the cost of insuring against a default on Bank of America rose sharply, hitting a record high. A Nomura Securities trader sent out an email alert citing the derivatives price: "Ugly out there this morning."

Yet a Wall Street Journal analysis shows that actual trades in these widely cited derivatives are few and far between -- and the quotes that market observers bandy about often aren't based on actual trades at all.

While the swaps can help investors hedge risks and bet on market trends, the thin trading underlines a key shortcoming of an instrument that has a huge influence on risk perceptions. During periods of stress, the actions of a few traders can have an outsize impact on delicate market psychology.

"The market does not fully understand the limitations in trading, or the lack of liquidity, as CDS spreads are often quoted as readily as the DJ industrial average nowadays," said Hong Yan, a professor of finance at Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance who is on leave from the University of South Carolina. "This could be potentially dangerous in a very volatile and uncertain market since CDS spreads are used much more frequently and prevalently."

The Journal analyzed data compiled by Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., a central warehouse that collects swaps trading information from investment banks. That analysis shows that even for the most popular credit-default swaps, such as those for Bank of America debt, daily trading is dwarfed by that in the stock market and often, too, in bonds.

For the week ending Sept. 16, the most recent data available, the gross notional value of swaps referencing Bank of America -- that is, the value of the contracts outstanding -- rose from the prior week by $700 million, according to Depository Trust.

By comparison, some $8.5 billion of the Charlotte, N.C., company's stock traded during the same week.

Despite the thin trading, investment banks and media outlets frequently point to swaps pricing as an indicator of the health of the global financial system's constituent parts.

On Tuesday, the limited trading was further highlighted in a Federal Reserve Bank of New York paper that analyzed three months of swaps data for both single-name corporate bonds and baskets of swaps. New York Fed officials sought to better understand how frequently the derivatives trade amid regulatory efforts to require investment banks to report real-time transaction data.

The study found little actual trading.

"A majority of the single-name reference entities traded less than once a day, whereas the most active traded over 20 times per day," the New York Fed paper said.

"The CDS market, in general, is not like the fast-trading stock market," said Darrell Duffie, a derivatives expert and finance professor at Stanford University.

That isn't to say there is no money at stake in the credit-default swap market. The net notional value of swaps outstanding on Bank of America, for instance, was $5.8 billion at Sept. 23, a similar level from the start of the year, according to Depository Trust. That is the maximum amount of money that would be exchanged in the event of a default.

The contracts have been used for years by banks to unload risks they don't want and by hedge funds and other investors to bet on changing market trends. But since the financial crisis of 2008, they have been best known as a measure of market stress.

In the case of credit-default swaps for corporate bonds, a buyer pays a sum quarterly for the derivative. If a bond defaults, the losses are covered by the seller of the contract.

Costs of the protection can rise if investors believe the underlying debt is getting riskier. Those trading the swaps often are big banks or, to a lesser degree, hedge funds.

Data vendors such as Markit Group Ltd. and CMA, a unit of CMA Group, use computer systems to extract swaps prices -- including quotes -- from electronic messages between investment banks and investors.

The companies aggregate that pricing data, which makes its way to a wider audience seeking a gauge of default risk -- an audience that may not recognize the limitations of the data they are looking at and the nature of how the derivatives trade.
