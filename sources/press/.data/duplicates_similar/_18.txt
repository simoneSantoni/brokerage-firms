Joseph Sullivan says industry has become used to  unsustainable  margins

The investment industry is facing a  hyper competitive and hyper disruptive period  as the rising tide of passive investing piles pressure on fees and technology fundamentally reshapes every aspect of asset management, according to the chief executive of Legg Mason.

US asset managers had a better 2017, with average performances improving sharply and rising markets swelling the amount of money they manage. As a result, the shares of US asset managers outperformed the broader market last year, climbing more than 26 per cent on average.

However, money continues to gush out of equity funds in particular   outflows reached nearly $200bn in 2017, according to EPFR   and into cheap, index-tracking alternatives such as exchange traded funds, which is ratcheting up pressure on fees.

Many investment groups are also scrambling to unlock the potential of new technology and data sources to both improve their investment performance and to trim costs by automating  back office  processes, reshaping what the industry will look like in the future.

 It s an incredibly challenging time,  said Joseph Sullivan, chief executive and chairman of Legg Mason, a venerable $754bn asset management group.  The industry is going to look very different when the smoke clears in five years. 

The strain on fees is considerable. The average net expense ratio of US equity mutual funds fell to 1.13 per cent last year, from 1.44 per cent in 2000, while the expense ratio of US bond funds has slipped from 1.14 per cent to 0.91 per cent over the same period, according to Morningstar data.

It is still an enviably lucrative industry: the average profit margin of listed US asset managers stands at over 23 per cent, the highest since 2013 and almost double the S&P 500 s 13.2 per cent average. But assets under management and thus profits have been flattered by buoyant markets, Mr Sullivan pointed out.

Even a deeper margin reduction would still leave asset management as one of the most lucrative industries, but the shrinkage is  painful , the Legg Mason chief executive admitted.  We got used to really good margins, unsustainable margins really. 

Costs are also likely to rise in the coming years. The asset management industry has traditionally been what analysts call a  capital-light industry  that has not needed a lot of investment in factories or research. But that is changing, as companies pour money into areas such as machine learning, Big Data and cyber security.

 Investing in technology is now fundamental, and will materially impact every pillar of the business,  Mr Sullivan said.

Given the rising expense of technology and increasingly onerous regulation, coupled with ongoing fee pressure, the money management industry has begun to cautiously consolidate. There have been a smattering of megadeals   such as the Janus-Henderson and Standard Life-Aberdeen combinations   but thus far there have been fewer mergers and acquisitions than some industry executives expected.

That is largely due to robust financial markets papering over the cracks, but there are plenty of discreet talks going on inside the industry, and if markets turn more turbulent then there is likely to be a lot more activity, Mr Sullivan predicted.

 Markets have taken the pressure off, but people haven t solved the problems. If markets start to get more challenging you will see a lot more than talk,  he said.  When the tides change   and they will   it will become clear who is retooling their model.

The investment industry is facing a "hyper competitive and hyper disruptive period" as the rising tide of passive investing piles pressure on fees and technology reshapes every aspect of asset management, according to the chief executive of Legg Mason.

Hackers and a Shrinking Talent Pool Top CEO Concerns for 2018; New pressures come during massive changing of guard in corner office; 'looking for a unicorn'

Corporate leaders see cybersecurity threats, disruptive technologies and stiffer competition for talent as some of their most pressing issues in the new year, according to interviews with nearly a dozen CEOs.

"I don't think there's any such thing as an easy year for CEOs anymore," said Jim M. Loree, who just finished his first full year in the highest job at Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

The growing pressures coincide with a massive changing of the guard in the corner office, creating one of the largest legions of new leaders in years to tackle those tough tasks.

Last year, 919 chief executives resigned, retired or got fired at publicly traded North American companies, the highest number in at least a decade, according to Liberum Research.

The feverish pace of turnover claimed some of the biggest names in corporate America, including the leaders of Equifax Inc., General Electric Co., Ford Motor Co., Caterpillar Inc., Arconic Inc., Macy's Inc. and Mondelez International Inc. And on Dec. 31, Papa John's International Inc. founder John Schnatter stepped down as CEO.

Departures of company chiefs continue in the new year. On Tuesday, Rent-A-Center Inc. said founder Mark Speese had stepped down from its top spot.

Under increased investor pressure, directors are making unprecedented demands of their chiefs, some leadership specialists say. "The expectations that boards have of CEOs is that they can do everything," said Hugh Shields, co-founder and principal at Shields Meneley Partners LLC, a career-transition and leadership-coaching firm for senior executives. "In some cases, they are looking for a unicorn."

The threat of data breaches poses a critical risk, according to Mr. Loree and several other chief executives.

"These bad actors keep getting smarter and more aggressive," Mr. Loree said. "It's an ongoing war."

Stanley Black & Decker, which makes power and hand tools, recruited Mark Maybury as its first chief technology officer in November. He is a cybersecurity specialist with a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence. Dr. Maybury's duties include overseeing cybersecurity, Mr. Loree said.

About 64% of 1,031 human-resources professionals believe data security and the threat of a cyberbreach will become a very challenging or extremely challenging issue in 2018, according to a recent survey by XpertHR, an online provider of compliance guidance.

Another challenge in the new year will be anticipating how emerging technologies open new markets or upend their industries, company leaders say. Julio Portalatin, president and CEO of Mercer Consulting, a unit of professional-services firm Marsh & McLennan Cos., said that high on his priority list is guarding against unforeseen, nimble rivals that could harness automation and artificial intelligence to poach customers in niche markets. "It's the [rivals] I don't know about that I'm concerned about,'' he said.

To gird Mercer's business against such attacks, Mr. Portalatin said Mercer formed a business this summer focused on helping employers use data analytics and other new technologies to recruit and manage employees and assist their workforces in adapting to a more digital economy.

New technologies are disrupting the war for top talent as well, said Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-founder and co-CEO of Atlassian Corp., which has headquarters in Sydney and San Francisco. The maker of workplace software tools no longer solely competes with other tech firms for staffers. In their quest to build highly sophisticated technology platforms, some financial-services giants now have more software engineers than bankers and traders on their payrolls, Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.

To fill more than 200 positions currently open at the 2,300-employee company, Atlassian is looking to hire people across four continents.

The imminent drop in U.S. corporate-tax rates may intensify political pressure on chief executives to expand their U.S. workforces, some business leaders say.

Polaris Industries Inc., a producer of snowmobiles, motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles, expects to hire nearly 100 engineers world-wide in 2018 and most will work in the U.S., said CEO Scott W. Wine. The company already employs nearly 900 U.S. engineers.

"With the additional money from tax reform, we can invest a bit more in our best [research] programs," Mr. Wine said. Those engineering projects typically generate a new technology, engine or vehicle.

The Polaris chief anticipates spending about $260 million on research and development in the new year, compared with just under $240 million for 2017.

Despite widespread revelations of workplace misconduct that toppled numerous powerful executives in 2017, most CEOs don't rank sexual harassment among their top concerns for 2018.

One exception is Anil Chakravarthy, head of software maker Informatica LLC. The recent scandals have prompted "an extensive look at our code of conduct [and] what protections we have for whistleblowers," Mr. Chakravarthy said.

Sexual harassment "is not an issue for us today," he added. "But I don't want it to be.''

About a month after announcing the close of its growth-focused technology fund, Apax Partners struck its second deal through the vehicle, investing in SoYoung, which operates an online marketplace for aesthetic medical treatments in China.

The firm, through its Apax Digital fund, led a $60 million Series D funding round in the Beijing company, which helps customers research aesthetic medical treatments, doctors and clinics as well as book services through its mobile application and other platforms.

CDH Investments, Matrix Partners and Trustbridge Partners also participated in the funding round for SoYoung, said Marcelo Gigliani, a managing partner with the Apax Digital team.

Mr. Gigliani said SoYoung "fell into the [firm's] sweet spot" for growth-focused technology strategy.

He said Apax made previous investments in the online marketplace space, while the firm's flagship fund recently backed "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apax-to-buy-beauty-treatment-company-syneron-candela-for-397-million-1491237960", a publicly traded company also known as Syneron Candela that makes and markets aesthetic medical devices for hair removal and skin rejuvenation.

Mr. Gigliani said Apax began its relationship with SoYoung's management team in early 2017 through its Apax Digital group and the firm's two teams in China.

The firm plans to help SoYoung increase its geographic presence and gain more customers in China, where the aesthetics medical treatment market has seen "growth that outpaces other geographies," according to Mr. Gigliani.

Mr. Gigliani said the firm has a "deep operating team in-house" that has dealt with the online marketplace category, along with technologists that can help the company expand.

Apax Digital "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apax-secures-1-billion-for-growth-stage-technology-deals-1512587608"in early December to invest in growth-stage companies, aiming to deploy $30 million to $150 million of equity per deal. The fund is focused on companies in vertical software, data and analytics, technology-enabled services, marketplaces, digital media and online commerce sectors, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.

FT writers predict what lies ahead in sectors ranging from technology to banking, accountancy and the gig economy

Leadership I n 2018, more business leaders will channel a potent combination of digitalisation, generational change and growing diversity, to streamline their hierarchies, distribute responsibility and transform their organisations.

Leaders of large companies such as Michelin, Microsoft and Ericsson are pushing more decision-making power out to their frontline workers. Others will follow as the success of this approach catches on.

Aspiring young leaders already place more emphasis on using their influence rather than trying to exert power through the authority of their position or their assigned title. Many are already gaining leadership experience, not through promotion at established institutions but by running bottom-up movements and voluntary groups, or by shaping their own start-ups.

I expect more companies to develop leaders who know how to manage networks   not just the traditional internal network of employees, but more loosely connected webs of suppliers and contractors, managed remotely via the internet and social media.

More companies will realise that if they constantly test innovative ways forward   as start-ups do   they will be more flexible and decisive than oldstyle bureaucracies and meritocracies.

Andrew Hill is management editor Technology The Big Tech backlash will spread to technology industry employees in 2018, as many question whether the work they do really is saving the world.

Large technology companies were criticised last year for using their size to dominate markets and not paying enough attention to how the tools they create can be used for ill.

The worries stretched from the global, such as alleged Russian attempts to influence the US presidential election in 2016, to the local   concerns about users' mental health and the drain on productivity as they drown in notifications and news feed posts.

Female founders in Silicon Valley will raise more money next year, as sexual harassment scandals have forced investors to rethink their habit of backing ventures founded by mainly young, white men. Some start-ups founded by men pursued by rumours of unsavoury pasts will not get funding. Hannah Kuchler is San Francisco correspondent Banking Big banks have more or less given up on trying to retain people with higher pay. Ever since the financial crisis it has been clear that if you want to get seriously rich, you go to Silicon Valley.

Banks just cannot afford to keep up.

At Goldman Sachs, for example, net revenues have dropped about a third since 2009, beaten down by structural shifts in trading and new rules crimping risktaking. The bank tries to keep its pay ratio stable, so that means smaller total packages for the typical employee.

No wonder banks have begun to get creative. According to Oliver Cooke, a financial-services recruiter at Selby Jennings in New York, banks have been stressing what they call "internal mobility", or redeploying staff from one department to another.

If a bank facing sluggish conditions in debt trading, for example, can convert a trader to a risk analyst or a compliance officer, it can keep people interested   and it can save money on severance.

Bank of America has just introduced a programme allowing employees of the global banking and markets unit to take a sabbatical   on full pay, but with conditions   for up to six weeks in a year. Perhaps it will not catch on in the cutthroat world of Wall Street. Some may see an extended absence as an admission that their jobs are expendable, and that colleagues can survive   and perhaps thrive   without them. But I expect other banks to follow suit.

Ben McLannahan is US banking editor Law Technology is hardly a brand new phenomenon in the legal world   many firms have partnerships with AI and machine-learning businesses, while some have set up their own "incubators" or invested in lawtech start-ups.

But the trend has reached critical mass and will accelerate sharply in 2018.

Lawyers are inherently cautious but most have realised that technology is crucial to crunching through the vast amount of information they handle. Without it, certain document-heavy processes, such as disclosure and compliance, would be nearly impossible. Bolder lawyers will start working with more "sci-fi" programs that claim to predict the outcomes of legal disputes before they have reached court, by analysing similar cases and past rulings, opposition tactics and win/lose statistics, the success rates of certain lawyers before certain judges, and so on.

Barney Thompson is legal correspondent The gig economy If 2017 was the year policymakers began to worry about the growth of the "precariat", 2018 will be the year they try to do something about it. The rise of populism, even in countries such as the US and UK where plenty of people are in work, has made politicians realise that the quality of jobs is as important as their quantity.

They are beginning to fret far more about insecure contracts, precarious scheduling, low wages and new forms of work via online gig economy platforms. The OECD club of mainly rich countries will publish a "jobs strategy" in 2018 that is likely to put more emphasis on the quality and inclusiveness of work.

The UK courts may land a heavy blow on ride-hailing app Uber. In 2017, the California-based company failed to persuade an appeal judge that two of its London drivers were independent contractors. In 2018, the test case will go to the Court of Appeal, possibly the Supreme Court. If Uber loses and is told to assume the responsibilities of an employer, the implications will ripple far and wide. Sarah O'Connor is employment correspondent Accounting and consultancy Management consultancies pride themselves on being expert advisers on "change"   from helping clients integrate after mergers, to keeping them at the cutting edge of new technology. Several of the world's largest consultancies will have to make use of their own advice in 2018 as they prepare for leadership changes   the first in years   that will have significant ramifications for their workforce.

Consulting firms are vocal proponents of the business case for improved gender diversity at the top of large companies. It will be interesting to see if any decide to practise what they preach. Madison Marriage is accounting and tax correspondent Start-ups The education sector has remained largely unchanged by online service delivery   but could be transformed dramatically in 2018. Despite the promise of downloadable courses, teaching for officially recognised qualifications continues to be a classroom-based activity undertaken in the real world. Startups have been busy getting examining boards to endorse their online courses so they can count towards a bachelor's or master's qualification.

This has given "edtech" start-ups, such as Silicon Valley-based Coursera and London-based FutureLearn, a foothold in the market. Expect them to continue this year, perhaps with a merger with a bricks-and-mortar higher education establishment. Jonathan Moules is business education correspondent

Bolder lawyers will start working with more 'sci-fi' programs that claim to predict outcomes of legal disputes

US considers mortgage credit check shake-up

Financial services

A new fight for a share of the lucrative US credit scoring market has broken out as Washington considers a major change in the way would-be mortgage holders are assessed.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled groups that guarantee US mortgages, have for years required lenders to use a system developed by analytics software company FICO to determine the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers. Critics complain the checks are outdated and lock millions of Americans out of home ownership. Almost 45m people do not have a regular credit score, according to a 2015 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Now the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, is seeking views about changing credit score requirements, potentially using an alternative metric from FICO's main rival VantageScore.

The review poses another potential challenge to FICO's dominance of US consumer credit ratings. Its algorithm aims to predict how likely consumers are to repay their debts by examining factors such as payment history.

FICO is still used in most credit decisions, though the rival VantageScore developed by the credit reporting companies Equifax, Experian and TransUnion has made inroads in credit cards and other areas outside mortgages.

VantageScore has seized on the FHFA's review to call for an end to FICO's stranglehold on the mortgage market.

However, FICO queries whether lenders would expand credit responsibly simply by switching to VantageScore.

"Our competitor is claiming millions [of borrowers] would get through the door" if it were used, said Joanne Gaskin, senior director at FICO. "All of our data would suggest absolutely the otherwise."

Peak Commercial Real-Estate Prices Force Investors to Get Creative; Brookfield, Blackstone and others opt for eclectic approach involving many geographies, asset classes

As 2017 came to an end, the good news for commercial real-estate investors was that values were near peak levels in many markets throughout the world, putting in the black most anything they bought in the past eight years.

The bad news as 2018 begins: Values in many markets throughout the world are near peak levels. That is going to make buying property this year particularly tricky.

"The biggest challenge is going to be finding attractive places to put new money to work," said Brian Kingston, chief executive of Brookfield Property Group, one of the world's largest real-estate investors. "Investors need to be cautious about the prices they're paying."

Add to that the likelihood that interest rates are going to rise this year, and 2018 is shaping up to be particularly precarious.

But that doesn't mean that Brookfield or any of the world's other leading real-estate investors are going to be sitting on the sidelines this year. Rather, they are pursuing an unusually eclectic assortment of strategies spanning a wide range of geographies and asset classes.

Brookfield is hoping to buy more property in Europe, where many economies are growing and banks have finally surfaced from the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent eurozone debt crisis. "There were a lot of zombie situations that people are now ready to deal with," Mr. Kingston said. "They seem to be more willing to create catalysts to make transactions happen."

PGIM Real Estate, which has over $69 billion in real-estate assets under management, this year plans to amp up its loan-fund business, which raises money from investors to lend to developers and others. Debt investments are more insulated from falling prices than equity investments.

When it comes to equity investments, along with traditional property types, PGIM will be focusing more on niche asset classes such as rental housing developments in the "active adult" sector, a bet that baby boomers are going to be looking for living situations that cater to people between 65 and 80 years old.

The number of people moving into that age bracket in the U.S. is sizable, said Alfonso Munk, Americas chief investment officer for PGIM. "They don't want to be hanging out with millennials," he said. "They want to be with people their own age with the amenities and activities that baby boomers are looking for."

Blackstone Group LP, the world's largest real-estate investor, with over $100 billion of assets under management, is planning to invest in assets such as Indian office buildings, Spanish residential property and Australian warehouses, according to Kenneth Caplan, the firm's chief investment officer for real estate.

This isn't going to be year for following the pack and "buying the index," Mr. Caplan said. "For us it's more and more about having these differentiated" views, he said.

Commercial real estate in 2017 did better than many expected. As early as 2015, some analysts were saying that the bull market that started in 2009 had run its course. Real-estate mogul Sam Zell famously warned at a conference in 2016 that "if someone needs a bell ringing to figure out that the real-estate market is pretty frothy right now, I'm in the business of selling hearing aids."

Commercial property showed some signs of a slowdown last year, most notably in sales volume in many markets.

In the U.S., $296.6 billion worth of property traded hands in the first nine months of the year of 2017, down 7% from the same period in the previous year, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. Overall, 2016 was down 11% compared with 2015.

Some property values fell. This was particularly true in the retail sector, which got hammered by competition from online shopping and the weak performance of numerous big-name retailers. Prices of many buildings in London are still off peak levels by about 10% largely because of uncertainty over the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union.

But in most markets, values remained stable, near the record peaks they hit in the postcrash recovery. The Green Street Commercial Property Price Index, which tracks major U.S. properties, has barely moved since hitting its highest level 18 months ago, more than double the level it fell to after the 2008 crash.

Prices have been propped up partly by low interest rates, which have increased the appetite for commercial property among yield-hungry investors. The 10-year Treasury rate ended 2017 at roughly the same level that it started the year.

Foreign competitors also played a growing role in many of the world's top cities, even as some Chinese investors such as Anbang Insurance Group Co. and Dalian Wanda Group"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-for-now-to-chinas-biggest-deal-makers-1498140875". "The influence of offshore capital, and in some cases new sources of capital, has led to demand for high-quality real estate to exceed the supply of what's for sale," said Jim Sullivan, president of Green Street's advisory group.

As 2018 gets under way, some investors are looking for opportunity in sectors that fell from favor in 2016 and 2017. Two of the biggest deals in the works are in the retail sector: "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brookfield-property-makes-14-8-billion-offer-to-acquire-remainder-of-ggp-1510534985"GGP Inc. and Unibail-Rodamco SE's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shopping-mall-operator-westfield-valued-at-15-7-billion-in-takeover-offer-1513061175", plus the assumption of $10 billion in debt.

Houston-based Hines is planning to be more active in London this year.

Cohen & Steers, which has about $38 billion of real-estate assets under management, has become more bullish on energy hot spots such as Houston, western Canada and Norway, which were beaten down in recent years as oil prices fell. "They had cyclical corrections and that created an opportunity," said Jon Cheigh, a global portfolio manager at the firm.

Some other markets that were weak in 2017 aren't expected to improve much this year. Brazilian property continues to suffer from that country's severe economic downturn.

Office rents in So Paulo in the third quarter were 30% lower than at the end of 2012, according to real-estate services firm JLL. The city's office-vacancy rate was 25%.

Deal-making also is expected to remain tepid in Russia, where new construction of office buildings has nearly stopped, said Veronika Lezhneva, head of research for Russia at Colliers International, a real-estate services firm. Some developers are beginning to evaluate new projects, but these efforts are in early stages.

"If you look at new completions, it's the story of maybe 2019 to 2020," she said.

Year-End Review & Outlook (A Special Report): Markets & Finance --- The Managers and Executives to Watch: Active investing held its own in 2017, but the new year holds new risks and opportunities for these leaders in the sector

Hedge funds and other active managers had a much better 2017 than many anticipated a year ago.

Hedge funds held their own and even posted their best relative performance in a rising equity market in almost a decade. There is still a lot of pressure on the business, especially when it comes to its historically high fees, but only a few large shops closed their doors in 2017.

As for other active managers, rising markets helped mitigate the pain of continued outflowsfrom stock fundsand some managers posted comebacks against their benchmarks. Broadly, however, nothing in the past 12 months has stopped the rise of passiveinvesting.

As 2018 starts, here are the money managers and executives to watch:

Abigail Johnson

One of the most senior women in asset management, Fidelity Investments' Chief Executive Abigail Johnson is leading the money-management and brokerage giant as both industries confront unprecedented cost pressures from the rise of low-cost index-tracking funds.

Under Ms. Johnson's leadership, the Boston-based firm has pushed further into exchange-traded funds, a type of product executives at the firm have long viewed as less important than traditional actively managed mutual funds. Fidelity also cut trading commissions in its brokerage business in early 2017 in a bid to capture more client assets flowing into ETFs. These are both passive plays.

Ms. Johnson has rarely made public speeches since succeeding her father as chief executive in 2014 and chairman in 2016, but over the past year she has stepped into the spotlight to discuss emerging technology in financial markets. In one 2017 speech she championed the prospects of bitcoin and other alternative currencies, an unusual stance for the head of a large financial services company, and in another discussed the promise of artificial intelligence in financial planning and asset management.

Ms. Johnson has had to respond to allegations of sexual harassment at the firm. That led to the departure of one of its star stock pickers and prompted the firm to hire a consultant to review workplace conduct and create a sexual-harassment task force.

-- Sarah Krouse

Jeffrey Gundlach

As bond investors prepare for a more challenging environment, all eyes are on how Jeffrey Gundlach will handle the new market.

Mr. Gundlach's DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund grew to $62 billion over its first six years, thanks to years of outsize performance, gaining Mr. Gundlach widespread recognition as "the new bond king." But after peaking in September 2016, the fund dropped to nearly $54 billion by the end of November 2017, even after adding nearly $500 million over the past two months, according to Morningstar Direct. Mr. Gundlach says his firm "had a record year" in inflows and performance for investors.

The DoubleLine fund gained 3.5% for the year through Dec. 26, compared with 3.38% for the average fund in the category, putting it in the 44th percentile for the year, Morningstar says.

Amid growing indications that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates, short-term Treasurys came under pressure in 2017, with the yield on two-year notes climbing to 1.87% from 1.19%. But yields on 10-year Treasurys barely moved, trading at 2.49% this week, raising questions about whether this "flattening" of the yield curve suggests an economic downturn is around the bend.

Mr. Gundlach, who didn't reply to a request for comment, has told investors he and his team don't see a recession in the offing, and on Twitter he warned of a possible "disaster" for corporate bonds when interest rates rise.

-- Gregory Zuckerman

David Einhorn

Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn has fallen on tough times.

The stock picker has lost more than 10% since 2014, compared with a 38% total return in the S&P 500. His Greenlight Capital Inc. rose 2% in 2017, while the S&P 500 climbed 25%.

Greenlight paid out more than $400 million to clients who chose to cash out midyear, helping shrink the firm to $7 billion in assets under management. More money was expected to flow out at year-end, said people familiar with the matter.

The 49-year-old Mr. Einhorn is far from the only fundamentally oriented investor who has lost his footing in recent years, raising questions about whether the rise of algorithmic trading and passive investing have changed their prospects.

-- Juliet Chung

Qi Wang

When Qi Wang arrived at Pacific Investment Management Co., she inherited one of the toughest seats at the firm -- in more ways than one.

Pimco hired Ms. Wang in 2010 to co-manage its hedge fund that places bets based on sweeping views on economic policy and geopolitics -- an investment strategy blunted by low interest rates and serene markets. What's more, her desk at the California bond manager sat next to Bill Gross, the famously hard-charging investment chief whose 2014 exit sent shock waves through Wall Street.

The 44-year-old manager appears to have succeeded: She now oversees some $7.5 billion in hedge-fund investments at Pimco.

Ms. Wang, who spent 12 years at hedge-fund firm HBK Capital Management before joining Pimco, has fared better. One of her funds was up 3.5% through October, according to a recent HSBC hedge-fund performance report, in part because she bet on Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election this past May.

"I don't consider myself an old-style macro investor," she said. "The toughest challenge for an investor, but especially a traditional macro investor, is to have the intellectual flexibility to understand the landscape has changed. You have to adjust."

US considers mortgage credit check shake-up

Critics complain current system is outdated and locks millions out of home ownership

A new fight for a share of the lucrative US credit scoring market has broken out as Washington considers the first big change for about two decades in the way would-bemortgage holders are assessed.

Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac, the government-controlled groups that guarantee US mortgages, have for years required lenders to use a system developed by analytics software companyFICO to determine the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers.

Critics complain the checks are outdated and lock millions of Americans out of home ownership. Almost 45mindividuals do not have a regular credit score, according to a 2015 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Now the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, is looking at opening up the market. It is seeking views about changing credit score requirements, potentially using an alternative metric from FICO s main rival VantageScore.

The review poses another potential challenge to New York-listed FICO s dominance of US consumer credit ratings. Its algorithm aims to predict how likely consumers are to repay their debts by examining factors such as payment history, rating them on a scale from 300 to 850.

FICO is still used in the vast majority of credit decisions in the US, although the big three credit reporting companies   Equifax, Experian and TransUnion   developed a rival model, VantageScore, that has made inroads in credit cards and other areas outside mortgages.

VantageScore has seized on the FHFA s review to call for an end to FICO s stranglehold on the mortgage market.  Monopolies never benefit markets or consumers and they create the opportunity for pricing power unchecked by competition,  it said.

However, FICO has hit back, highlighting that unlike VantageScore it is independent of the three credit reporting companies that collate the underlying financial data about consumers.

 FICO welcomes competition   we just want to have fair competition,  said Joanne Gaskin, senior director at the company. She also questioned whether lenders would expand credit responsibly simply by switching to VantageScore.

 Our competitor is claiming millions [of borrowers] would get through the door  if it were used, she added.  All of our data would suggest absolutely the otherwise. 

FICO has a newer version of its model that it says provides a more sophisticated analysis of creditworthiness than the earlier system currently required by Fannie and Freddie.

The FHFA is considering a series of options, including adopting scores from both FICO and VantageScore or giving lenders a choice.

Charles Gabriel, who runs the policy analysis group Capital Alpha, said there were also concerns about the costs if Fannie and Freddie demand additional scoring methods   with questionable benefits.

Alternative models, he said,  will still be based on the same repayment-history data that Experian, Equifax and TransUnion already provide .

The FHFA is seeking comment until February.

An executive of a UK-registered cryptocurrency exchange kidnapped in Ukraine this week has been released after paying a ransom of more than $1m in bitcoins, according to an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, in a crime he dubbed "bitcoin kidnapping and extortion".

Pavel Lerner, of the Exmo exchange, who is also a locally renowned cryptocurrency expert, was kidnapped near his office in Kiev on Tuesday but freed on Thursday, Anton Gerashchenko, the Ukrainian adviser, said.

"He was kidnapped by an armed gang for the purpose of extorting bitcoins," Mr Gerashchenko told the Financial Times, adding: "We have operative information that he paid more than $1m worth of bitcoins." He said Mr Lerner was held for one and a half days, "then released in a state of shock ... He got very lucky that he remained alive."

Exmo Finance, which is registered in the UK with Companies House but also has operations in Ukraine, is one of more than 400 unregulated exchanges that have sprung up across the globe to cater for crypto capital markets.

Cryptocurrencies, which can be converted into real-world money anonymously, have long attracted criminal elements. But soaring prices mean that exchange venues have become a lucrative target for cyber criminals. The value of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, has more than tripled in the past three months to trade around $14,750 today.

Last week, South Korean exchange Youbit was forced into bankruptcy after losing 17 per cent of its assets in a cyber attack.

The kidnapping of Mr Lerner, a Russian citizen, was first reported on Tuesday by local media, which said witnesses had seen him being bundled into a black Mercedes-Benz by people wearing dark clothes and balaclavas.

Exmo this week moved to quell concern that customers' money was at risk, stating that all users' funds were "absolutely safe" and that Mr Lerner's job at Exmo did not "assume access either to storages or any personal data of users". Mr Lerner's LinkedIn profile describes him as CEO, but Exmo reportedly told the BBC he was its analytics manager.

Exmo and Mr Lerner could not be reached for comment yesterday. Exmo said on Twitter that it had been hit by a cyber attack, which meant its website was down temporarily.

Banks

Next September marks the 10th anniversary of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, prompting much reminiscing about the event that sent shockwaves through the global financial industry.

As the landmark approaches, the banking sector finally seems to be leaving behind one of the most uncomfortable chapters in its history. Bank share prices across the globe rose almost 20 per cent in 2017, according to the MSCI world banks index, taking the sector 15 per cent above the level at which it was trading when Lehman collapsed.

In the coming year, much of the alphabet soup of postcrisis financial regulation will be completed   including Basel III, IFRS 9 and Mifid II   giving the industry the most clarity for almost a decade on the rule book it must follow.

The election of Donald Trump as US president has ushered in a lighter touch regulatory regime in the world's biggest banking market, helping the main American lenders to extend their dominance over their less profitable European rivals. Further rises in US interest rates next year should help them to keep rebuilding their profit margins.

US banks are also set to be among the top beneficiaries of the cut in the corporate tax rate that Mr Trump signed into law a few days before Christmas. While this will also benefit foreign banks with large US operations, these gains may be offset by rules that penalise interest their American offshoots pay to their overseas parents.

The next year will be a crucial one for banks to prepare for Brexit. As the March 2019 date for the UK's exit looms, banking jobs and assets are set to be moved out of London to other European cities without the promise of a multiyear transition period.

All of this comes as a wave of digital disruption sweeps across the industry, ranging from artificial intelligence to blockchain technology. This upheaval often has the blessing of regulators, as with European "open banking" rules, which come into force next year, forcing banks to give third parties access to their customers' accounts.

Exmo executive released after being grabbed in Ukraine by masked gang

An executive of a UK-registered cryptocurrency exchange kidnapped in Ukraine this week has been released after paying a ransom of more than $1m in bitcoins, according to an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, in a crime he dubbed  bitcoin kidnapping and extortion .

Pavel Lerner, who runs the Exmo exchange and is a locally-renowned cryptocurrency expert, was kidnapped near his office in Kiev on Tuesday but freed on Thursday, Anton Gerashchenko, the Ukrainian adviser, said.

Separately on Thursday, Exmo said on Twitter that it had been hit by a cyber attack, which meant its website was down temporarily.

While Exmo is not in the top handful of exchanges by market share, it has some 94,000 active traders and hosted trading of some $125m worth of bitcoin over the past 24 hours, according to its website.

US visa concerns prompt Silicon Valley start-ups to join Canada hiring drive

Start-ups backed by some of Silicon Valley's leading investors have joined a venture to hire more software engineers in Canada, as concerns persist over Donald Trump's efforts to restrict immigration.

Eventbrite, the events start-up funded by Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management, Zola, an online wedding list site that raised money from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital, and Plays.tv, an esports company backed by Accel and Founders Fund, have all signed up to Terminal in the past month.

Terminal launched earlier this year with a mission to help tech start-ups hire staff abroad, initially focusing on Canada. The business is providing companies with offices in Waterloo, Ontario, Montreal and Vancouver as well as human resources support, including helping employers navigate Global Talent Stream, Canada's new two-week visa service to bring in migrant employees.

Dylan Serota, co-founder and general manager of Terminal, said tightening immigration was a "tailwind" for many US companies.

He said: "It is now the tech elites versus the Trump administration, and it is very difficult to find common ground for economic growth. A lot of other countries are very tech forward, building partnerships with tech companies." Fears that the US government might scrap the H-1B visa, used to hire highly skilled software engineers from abroad, or reduce the numbers of visas available, are putting pressure on an already tight staffing market in Silicon Valley.

"If you're in the Bay Area, companies are hiring 30,000 engineers, and you're trying to hire 10   you've got to get in line," Mr Serota said.

Tech companies have expanded in Canada, which is attractive for its talent in artificial intelligence.

Amazon and Facebook have opened new offices in the country in 2017, after Google, Apple and Microsoft expanded operations there last year. Uber announced earlier this year that it would build an AI team to help develop its self-driving vehicle unit.

A year in charts: From bitcoin to Trump and chess playing robots

The data set that illuminates the best stories of 2017

What were the big stories of 2017? The answer depends on who is telling the story and who is listening. It also depends on when the question is being asked. One test of an important story is that it will still seemso when another year has passed or10, or even 100. We can only guess at that.

For example, my guess is that in10 years  time, the post-Weinstein outpouring of accusations and confessions about sexual assault andharassment will seem like a cultural milestone. In contrast, the bitcoin price boom will be universally recognised as a moment of madness   like the dotcom boom, the railway mania and the tulip bubble.Yet it is not impossible thatbitcoin s price will stabilise while discussion of sexual assault will seem, with hindsight, like a brief cultural focus.

Donald Trump took office at the beginning of 2017, and our main chart tells two sides of that story. On one hand, theUS president is viewed with a disdain unmatched by any modern predecessor; on the other, none of the much-feared catastrophes have materialised yet, leaving stock markets blithely unconcerned about President Trump and cheered by his tax cuts.

Barring disaster, technological progress tends to have more of an impact on everyday life than politics. Alongside the bitcoin delirium our charts show a dramatic increase in the use of solar and wind power and impressive progress in artificial intelligence.

There is scepticismabout both, however. Solar energy continues to be a marginal part of the global energy system, which goes some way to explaining why carbon dioxide emissions arelikely to hit another record in 2017, after three years in which theyplateaued. And Google s deep-learning software, AlphaZero, taught itself in a matter of hours to be, apparently, the strongest player on the planet of Chess, Shogi and Go. Some of the details of that achievement have yet to be disclosed. It also remains an open question as to how flexible the technology will prove: perhaps it will solve mathematical theorems or have powerful medical applications. Perhaps.

It is always easy to focus on the problems, challenges and threats that surround us, butgood news stories tend todevelop on a slow burn. Charles Kenny of the Center for Global Development and Max Roser of the online publicationOur World In Data were asked to nominateideas and were not short of suggestions. They ranged from the recent fall in the price of solar energy to improvements in child mortality. We chose to highlightthe cases of polio worldwide. Since polio is a human-borne virus, it is in principle possible to eradicate it; that goal is now tantalisingly close.

There is, however, a danger in the seductive simplicity of a good chart. Florence Nightingale s celebrated  coxcomb diagrams  showed the deadly toll of disease in the Crimean war, and the huge gains available from better standards of hospital hygiene. On closer inspection, however, the diagram proves to be an elegant piece of persuasion, highlighting Nightingale s concerns and obscuring otherinterpretations. We have tried with these graphs not to persuade but to illuminate.

The chartabove shows the two most prominent barometers of public confidence in the US. One of the puzzles of the year is why the two have shown such different results. Mr Trump has so far proved to bethe most consistently unpopular president in postwar history; no other holder of that officehas come close to achieving such consistently negative ratings in polls in their first year. Yet while the president keeps touching new lows, the stock market has broken record after record.

Part of the explanation is simple: investors have hoped that post-tax profits would surge if and when Congress passed a large corporate tax cut. There was also some hope that an infrastructure spending package would boost growth; the prospect seems to have faded.

Yet the stock market s buoyancy is puzzling. Many political observers regard the Trump administration as chaotic. It is economically isolationist, sceptical of trade agreements in general and the North American Free Trade Agreement in particular. Militarily, the leader of the free worldhas been belligerent in the face of a nuclear-armed North Korea.

One possibility is that Mr Trump is not nearly as destructive a president as many fear   at least not to the profits of large US businesses. Another possibility is that the market simply cannot process catastrophic risks. Relative to long-run earnings, the S&P 500 is now around the level seen just before the great crash of 1929. Fingers crossed for 2018.

In France s presidential election run-off in May, the youthful centrist Emmanuel Macron soundlydefeated Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. Many who had feared another against-the-odds triumph of the populists breathed a sigh of relief. Yet the fact that Ms Le Pen eliminated the candidates from all established parties should give pause for thought   as should the strength of far-right parties in general electionresults across Europe.

InSeptember thepopulist Alternative for Germany   launched in 2013 to protest against the Greek bailouts  won 13 per cent of the national vote and entered the Bundestag for the first time, the only far-right party to do so in 60 years. While in Austria the Eurosceptic Freedom party has taken several senior cabinet positions in a new coalition government expected to toughen the country s stance on immigration.

AlphaZero is a flexible machine learning system developed by Google-subsidiary DeepMind. It has conquered Go and Chess with startling speed and virtuosity. Four hours of training was enough to let AlphaZero crush the world computer chess champion, Stockfish. Question marks remain over the details, and whether Stockfish had a level playing field. But the symbolism of themarch of these flexible learning systems is undeniable.

Early pioneers in computing believed that chess was perfecttrainingfor learning about artificial intelligence. But those hopes were soon dashed, as brute-force approaches, most notablyIBM s Deep Blue, conquered chess without yielding much in the way of broader insights. AlphaZero promises to do better. The next challenge for DeepMind will be to demonstrate AlphaZero s capabilities on a real-world problem such as discovering new drug compounds.

The use of solar power has been rising and the costs falling dramatically   thanks in part to basic economies of scale and simple snap-together installation familiar to anyone who has bought flat-pack furniture. The rapid growth in sales of electric vehicles has brought similar scale economies to the production of batteries. These batteries, whether in vehicles or fixed installations, promise in turn to smooth the fluctuations inherent in solar, wind and tidal energy by storing and releasing energy back to the grid.

Meanwhile coal production, a carbon-intensive source of power, fell almost 10 per cent between 2013 and 2016. All this might suggest that global warming is a solved problem, but fossil fuels still dominate global energy production, and 2017 is likely to be another record year for carbon emissions. A transition to clean fuels is still in its early stages.

The good news rarely unfolds as swiftly as the bad, so this graph dates back to 1980. Polio was once a global scourge, and was endemic in 125 countries as recently as 1988. Polio clings on in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and particularly Pakistan   but the world is on the verge of eliminating it entirely. Jonas Salk, who developed the first polio vaccine in the 1950s, did not patent it, declaring,  could you patent the sun? 

It is tempting to call it a bubble. However, the usual definition of a bubble is a rapid surge in prices unjustified by fundamentals. The bitcoin price certainly meets the first criterion, but the second is harder to call. Unlike the price of a share or a bond, there are no fundamentals from which to depart. There is no stream of dividends or interest payments. Bitcoin can only ever be worth what people are willing to pay for it.

Bitcoin is a curious asset; perhaps, as with gold, it will be sustained indefinitely by a pool of willing buyers. It is often described as a cryptocurrency, yet successful currencies have always maintained a reasonably stable value relative to goods and services. Stability is not part of the appeal here.

Nor is bitcoin yet a medium of exchange; it is far too cumbersome for that. Social media platforms are full of horror stories from investors who faced Kafkaesque obstacles to cash in their bitcoin gains.

A further problem is the energy devoted to  mining  bitcoin, which is hard to assess with precision but is more than the energy consumption of a small nation. The higher the price, the keener the energy-burning competition to produce more bitcoin. It seems ever further from its early promise of an efficient, near-frictionless decentralised currency.

Something is going to pop.

New venture aims to help companies find staff as US looks to restrict immigration

Start-ups backed by some of Silicon Valley s leading investors have joined a new venture to hire more software engineers in Canada, as concerns about President Donald Trump s efforts to restrict highly skilled immigration persist into his second year in office.

Eventbrite, the events start-up funded by Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management, Zola, an online wedding list site that raised money from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital, and Plays.tv, an esports company backed by Accel and Founders Fund, have all signed up to Terminal in the past month.

Terminal launched earlier this year with a mission to help tech start-ups hire staff abroad, initially focusing on Canada. The company is providing companies with offices in Waterloo, Ontario, Montreal and Vancouver as well as human resources support, including helping employers navigate Global Talent Stream, Canada s new two-week visa service to bring in migrant employees.

Dylan Serota, co-founder and general manager of Terminal, said tightening immigration was a  tailwind  for many US companies.

 It is now the tech elites versus the Trump administration and it is very difficult to find common ground for economic growth. A lot of other countries are very tech forward, building partnerships with tech companies, not breaking them up or pushing them down,  he said.

Concerns that the US government could scrap the H-1B visa, used to hire highly skilled software engineers from abroad, or reduce the numbers of visas available are putting pressure on an already tight labour market in Silicon Valley.

 If you re in the Bay Area, companies are hiring 30,000 engineers, and you re trying to hire 10   you ve got to get in line,  Mr Serota said.

Technology companies have expanded significantly in Canada, which is particularly attractive for its talent in artificial intelligence. Amazon and Facebook have opened new offices in the country in 2017, after Google, Apple and Microsoft expanded operations there last year. Uber announced earlier this year that it would build an AI team to help develop its self-driving vehicle unit.

In the past five years, the number of tech jobs in Waterloo, a centre for tech talent centred around its university, grew by almost two-thirds, according to a recent report by CBRE, the real estate and investment company.

Terminal aims to help smaller start-ups that are struggling to compete for talent in Silicon Valley. Chester Ng, a partner at Atomic, a fund that has backed Terminal, said the company came out of his company s own work to build teams in Canada.

 We had built this thing that everyone in Silicon Valley wanted,  he said, comparing the process with how Amazon developed its internal cloud computing unit into Amazon Web Services.

Terminal has 100 engineers working for about 20 clients, including marketing start-up Zenreach, customer service software maker TalkIQ and men s wellness company Hims. It aims to expand beyond Canada next year, looking at locations in South America.

 We re looking in central and South America for late 2018. Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Columbia have all invested heavily in creating a technical culture since the 1980s, their education is very technical, very early, and it is applied maths and science, not theory,  Mr Serota said.

Business
Some of the World's Largest Employers No Longer Sell Things, They Rent Workers; Outsourcing firms' workforces grow as more companies look to cut their headcounts

The list of the world's largest employers was once dominated by household names like Ford Motor Co., J.C. Penney Co., and General Electric Co., companies that made and sold things.

A new analysis conducted for The Wall Street Journal shows those names are nowhere to be found on that list today. In their place are large outsourcing companies like Compass Group PLC, Accenture PLC and other businesses that essentially lease workers to clients.

Of the top 20 global employers in 2017, five are outsourcing and "workforce solutions" companies, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. In 2000, only one employer in the top 20 International Business Machines Corp., which offers outsourced IT services among its many businesses fell into that bucket.

Outsourcing companies are vacuuming up the world's workers as traditional employers are handing over more of their tasks to nonemployees, a shift that has transformed "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-employees-1486050443" and had "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-contractors-life-overlooked-ground-down-and-stuck-1505400087".

The past two decades have been boom times for the outsourcing sector, with the annual value of contracts growing to $37 billion in 2016 from $12.5 billion in 2000, according to research and advisory firm Information Services Group Inc. The market is expected to rise again in 2017 and 2018, thanks partly to double-digit growth in big technology projects as more companies transfer massive volumes of data to the cloud.

For employers, dispatching work to outside companies saves money and lets them access skills they need without adding to their headcount. Workers in jobs that have gone to outsourcers, though, can feel moved around like chess pieces, either displaced entirely or re-badged as employees of a service provider, sometimes with fewer benefits and lower pay. A growing body of economic research suggests that outsourcing is a significant factor fueling the rise of income inequality in the past decade.

"If all the engineers are in one firm and the cleaners are in another, you get less diversity within firms and more inequality across firms," says Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University.

Dublin-based Accenture, best known as an information-technology and consulting firm, has become the de facto back office for hundreds of client companies. The firm employs 435,000 people globally up from some 200,000 in 2010 and serves 95 of the Fortune Global 100 with consulting or outsourcing services or both. Outsourcing comprised 46% of the company's 2017 revenue, or $16.1 billion, up from 41% in 2011.

On behalf of loan-servicing companies, Accenture's people collect debts from homeowners who defaulted on their mortgages. For large insurance clients, doctors and nurses employed by Accenture make wellness calls to diabetes patients. For Alphabet Inc.'s Google, it oversees "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worst-job-in-technology-staring-at-human-depravity-to-keep-it-off-facebook-1514398398" for the search giant.

"We become part of our clients' operations, we become part of the talent that's in their operations," says Debbie Polishook, group chief executive of Accenture Operations, which houses the company's outsourcing work.

Companies say that unloading tasks to outside firms allows employees to do more high-value jobs. Providers like Accenture tell companies they can do their work better and more cheaply, prodding executives to view labor as an on-demand resource they can rent as needed.

"When CEOs tell me they want to keep all of their talent, my response is 'Why?' " says longtime Kelly Services Inc. boss Carl Camden, who retired earlier this year. " 'If they're not our people, how can they be our people?' is a tautology you have to work them through."

The breadth of services on offer from outsourcing firms is staggering. Compass Group was founded in 1941 to run factory cafeterias in wartime England, eventually branching out into corporate catering. It now employs more than 550,000 and counts among its subsidiaries firms like Eurest Services, which staffs and manages mailrooms for clients, provides them with full-time receptionists, sets up their conference rooms for meetings and operates their warehouses. Eurest's clients include Google, SAP and Pfizer Inc.

With so much work done outside the company, businesses employ fewer kinds of workers than they used to, a change that economists say has fueled income inequality.

Outsourcing leads to workers being clustered in companies according to their skills, which affects pay and benefits. A bank used to employ janitors and security guards, in addition to traders and salespeople. For the sake of morale and a sense of fairness, management had an incentive to limit the disparities in employees' compensation. That had the effect of boosting the pay of lower-skilled staff.

Now, those janitors might just as often work for an outside firm like Denmark's ISS AS, one of the largest facility services companies in the world, while the high-skilled workers remain employed by the bank a trend economists call occupational sorting. Pay for outside workers tends to be lower because outsourcing firms need to keep costs low to compete for contracts and because the workers don't reap rewards from the financial successes of the bank.

Companies that provide security guards or IT help-desk workers have to show they can do the job more cheaply than the client can, keeping a tight lid on wages for those workers, says David Weil, a Labor Department official in the Obama administration and an expert on contract labor.

Outsourcing firms' workforces, though, may shrink as algorithms take on more tasks, says Steve Hall, a partner at ISG.

"The large outsourcers are using a combination of analytics and automation to significantly reduce the need for labor," he says.

Biggest market trades that lit up 2017

Cobalt s rise, Enigma trade, Portuguese bonds, bitcoin, Snap and shorting the dollar

Investors have enjoyed a banner year, with the FTSE All World index up nearly 20 per cent, but several specific trades generated far more spectacular returns. Here, FT market reporters highlight some of the eye-popping trades that lit up 2017.

Cobalt s rise as EV demand soars

Cobalt has been the hottest commodity trade, driven by demand for electric vehicles, which use the metal in their batteries.

The price of cobalt has surged by over 120 per cent, boosting shares of the largest producers Glencore and China Molybdenum.

That has left carmakers scrambling to secure supplies as they unveil ambitious plans for electric vehicles. In September Volkswagen issued a tender for five years worth of cobalt at a fixed price. That was rebuffed by miners, with Ivan Glasenberg, the chief executive of Glencore, saying it does not do fixed price deals.

Adding to the shortage of cobalt, investors have bought up stockpiles of the metal, betting that prices will continue to go higher. Cobalt 27, a Canadian-listed vehicle, has amassed a hoard of over 2,800 tonnes of the metal, worth about $209m at current prices.

Over half of the world s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where some of it is mined by hand by artisanal miners. That s likely to come under greater scrutiny in 2018 as cobalt enters electric vehicle supply chains. Henry Sanderson

The Enigma trade

A group of interconnected, Hong Kong-listed small-cap stocks experienced an inexplicable sharp drop in their share prices.

The so-called Enigma Network of companies, identified by independent investor David Webb for having holdings in other firms within the group, came under scrutiny after shares in almost half the 50 firms plummeted on a day in June, wiping out about $6bn in market capitalisation.

The companies embroiled in the web are diverse, ranging from an umbrella maker to brokers. While investors would have been burnt from the plunge, those who shorted the stocks before their crash would have reaped gains.

Figures from Markit, an analytics and data provider, reveal investors were shorting a few of the Enigma companies before the crash at the end of June.

The data show China Jicheng Holdings Ltd, for example, had 0.1 per cent of shares outstanding on loan, while China Shandong Hi-Speed Financial Group had 0.03 per cent.

Long investors in other Enigma stocks hoping for a recovery since this year s crash have had to weather other bad news. Emma Dunkley

Sovereign bonds   Portugal

Portugal has been the big winner in the compression of eurozone spreads, as the bond market reacts to the bloc s improving economic performance.

The Iberian nation began 2017 with 10-year paper yielding 3.7 per cent; it ends it hovering around 1.84 per cent. The spread over its neighbour Spain has also compressed sharply, and sits at just 36 basis points for 10-year debt   down from 235bp at the start of the year.

Portugal s bond investors ended the year on a high after a rating agency, Fitch, restored the country to investment grade status. With two of the major agencies now rating Portugal investment grade, the country s bonds are once more eligible for inclusion in major indices, something that may spur further buying by index-tracking investors. Kate Allen

Bitcoin believers

Cryptocurrencies as assets of value are quite unlike anything seen in any stock market in the modern era.

Bitcoin is the biggest and best known of several digital currencies whose value has mushroomed this year. Among them, bitcoin has gone from $950 to $16,620; Ethereum from $8 to $600; Litecoin from $4.5 to $324 and Dash from $11 to $821, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. Prices fell sharply over Christmas before bouncing back, but the price is expected to remain volatile.

The currencies are building on blockchain   a potentially revolutionary technology   and the enthusiasm has spurred waves of private investments, usually through lightly regulated schemes called Initial Coin Offerings. The coins have different characteristics. Bitcoin and Litecoin are seen as alternatives to central bank currency, while Ethereum is  crypto-fuel  for industry growth. Speculation and fear of missing out have also played their part in the price rises.

By the end of the year Wall Street, once dismissive, could not ignore it any longer. CME Group and Cboe Global Markets launched futures contracts tied to bitcoin prices. Executives said their emergence would in time damp price volatility by allowing investors to hedge the asset.

But to some adherents cryptocurrencies are tokens of a new financial world outside existing systems, a piece of history to be hoarded and not sold. To others, they are a collective bubble that draw comparisons with the 17th-century Dutch tulip craze. As they are not valued like a traditional security, it is difficult to see where prices go next. They could collapse; or be one of the trades of 2018 too. Philip Stafford

Short Snap at IPO

Snap, the owner of the messaging app Snapchat, listed in March to much fanfare. The largest US-based tech listing in nearly five years, shares initially drew white-hot demand. After listing at $17, shares jumped to $29.44 in the days after the initial public offering, but since falling back to trade at $15, shaving billions of dollars from the initial market capitalisation when shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

This wild ride has provided three profitable trades for clever investors and traders.

Those given allocations in the IPO that sold, or  flipped,  shares when the price topped out in the days after earned a quick 73 per cent return.

Snap has also been a winning short position as competition from rival Facebook proved intense and early earnings reports disappointed.

Investors and traders that shorted the shares   or borrowed shares and sold them in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price for delivery   early on are sitting on paper profits of more than $350m, according to IHS Markit, but that is down from a high of more than $650m when the share price slipped below $13 in November.

But those with long positions in Snap shares have found some solace in that very short selling.

With a small float, Snap shares have been relatively expensive to borrow. That means even investors and traders nursing losses on Snap holdings have been able to earn more than $100m since the IPO by lending out their shares to short sellers. Nicole Bullock

Short dollar, long EM

Twelve months ago, Donald Trump s election victory and his promises of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and  making America great again  had strategists lining up to predict that 2017 would be a strong dollar year, and in turn a tough one for emerging market currencies. All except one.

Thomas Fleury at UBS  chief investment office went contrarian, arguing the dollar was  extremely overvalued  and that while US growth would improve, other factors, including  unexpected policy bumps , would get in the way.

He reckoned out that US growth momentum would transfer to other trading partners,  particularly Europe , and lead to the euro rebounding, helped by a European Central Bank shifting towards tapering.

And not just the euro. UBS CIO also expected a rising oil price to benefit the currencies of a series of oil-producing countries, while several EM high-yielding currencies would rise, including the rouble, the Brazilian real, the Indian rupee and the South African rand.

How right he and his colleagues have proved. The dollar is ending a torrid year, the basket that measures it against its peers down 8.7 per cent. The euro is shaping up to be 12.7 per cent up on the dollar, and while the EM picture is varied, most have enjoyed decent rises on the greenback. Roger Blitz

It's been a weird year. In 2017, technology spread its tentacles into our lives in ways we couldn't have imagined see the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weve-been-breached-inside-the-equifax-hack-1505693318", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-ads-targeted-facebook-users-by-profile-1509563354", and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-for-13-7-billion-1497618446". In 2018, expect the invasion to get even weirder and more aggressive.

Artificial intelligence will touch so many of the gadgets and services we use, we won't even realize that machines, not humans, are behind them. Hackers will continue to pursue the institutions that hold our most sensitive information. The consolidation of power by the big four Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple will have an even bigger impact on what we see on our screens and what we buy.

And while you won't necessarily pay for your new electric car with Bitcoin, you'll continue to hear more about it and other cryptocurrencies. (Yes, you'll soon consider buying an electric car.)

Tech is more powerful than ever. To help you prepare, here's our annual roundup of the tech that will affect us in the year ahead.

Electric Cars Get Cheap

In 2018, consumers will get decent choices for electric models priced around the U.S. average for new cars: $35,000 even before factoring in state and federal tax credits and lifetime savings in both "https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/saving-fuel-and-vehicle-costs" and "https://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_maintenance.html".

Not only is the eagerly awaited Tesla Model 3 ($35,000) due in significant numbers, but the recently released all-electric Chevrolet Bolt ($36,620) will soon be followed by Nissan's 2018 Leaf ($29,990), with a new look and 150-mile range up from 107.

There are also more affordable plug-in hybrids, with enough range to make most people's daily commute an all-electric ride. The Chevrolet Volt ($33,220) can go 53 miles on electricity, while the Toyota Prius Prime ($27,100) can carry you 25 miles without burning gas. In 2018, Honda will finally roll out its own 47-mile-range plug-in hybrid, the Clarity ($33,400).

Facebook Returns to Its Roots

It was a bruising year for Facebook from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-and-google-step-up-efforts-to-combat-fake-news-1486396476"that spread during the 2016 presidential race to the revelations that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-ads-targeted-facebook-users-by-profile-1509563354". The 2018 damage control? Put the "social" back in social network.

"We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interactions," "https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104146268321841". His comments suggest Facebook will do more to push commenting, especially on video, rather than passively consuming media.

We'll also get greater control over what we see. In mid-December, "https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-fighting-engagement-bait-on-facebook/" that asked for likes and shares, and "https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-is-spending-time-on-social-media-bad-for-us/"that allows you to hide a person or page for 30 days without having to unfollow or unfriend them.

Amazon Takes Over (Even More)

While it's already possible to spend your entire day "https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-amazons-worldbut-do-you-want-to-live-there-1512586126", the company will continue creeping into more corners of your life. Take video: Analysts estimate Amazon spent $4.5 billion on video content this year; next year, the company "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4117120-amazon-com-amzn-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single" as much as Netflix did in 2017. Why? People who come to Amazon for video tend to renew Prime memberships and spend more on other stuff, a company exec said.

So where is Amazon going next? "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-makes-major-push-into-furniture-1494581401". "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-plans-to-send-alexa-to-the-office-1512008730". How about "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-reason-cvs-wants-to-buy-aetna-amazon-com-1509057307"? What the company learns from Whole Foods stores can be applied to supply chains for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-bookstores-offer-peek-into-whole-foods-future-1507887003".

The company is "https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-will-exceed-500k-employee-milestone-new-hq-whole-foods-acquisition/"in 2018, making it America's second largest private-sector employer, "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/22/ten-largest-employers/2680249/".

The Net Loses Neutrality

In December 2017, cable companies and telcos got what they wanted from the Federal Communications Commission: the rollback of net-neutrality regulations. In the short term, you're not likely to notice anything different your internet provider likely won't "https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-ready-for-a-faster-pricier-and-more-confusing-internet-1513515601".

But providers may unveil some new carrots and sticks: A wireless plan with "https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumers-are-going-to-love-the-end-of-net-neutralityat-first-1486922483", say, or a home broadband cap you discover when your internet speed slows to a crawl after too much 4K video streaming.

You might even see a different sort of plan, a cheap one subsidized by and centered on the internet giants themselves. This is how Facebook operates in vast swaths of the developing world, where users see the internet and the social network as "https://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/".

Cryptocurrency Feels Less Cryptic

Currently, crypto "currencies" are more like crypto "gold" the mania over Bitcoin and its ilk makes them better for hoarding than spending (if you can stomach the ups and downs).

No one knows which of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-cash-litecoin-ether-oh-my-whats-with-all-the-bitcoin-clones-1514037600" will be around for the long haul. Meanwhile, the ease of buying and selling them means that the wild ride of 2017 Bitcoin exploding from around $1,000 per coin to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-plunges-25-in-24-hours-in-a-cryptocurrency-market-rout-1513928835" could repeat in 2018.

High transaction fees mean that Bitcoin is largely failing one of its original missions to become easily transacted digital money. The crush of systems and alternative coins designed to fix that is going to be a major theme of 2018. By the end of the year, you might actually be able to use digital currency to buy a pizza "http://www.wsj.com/video/what-you-can-buy-with-bitcoin-a-10-pizza-for-76/9FE251D5-1BC4-4E6B-BA0F-E3424CDA9263.html".

Software Drives Smartphone Progress

Smartphone hardware leapt forward in 2017."https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-x-review-yes-there-are-reasons-to-pay-apple-1-000-1509724800" and"https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-great-phone-but-thats-not-all-that-matters-1492527651" crammed bigger screens into smaller phones, got rid of home buttons and"https://www.wsj.com/articles/androids-best-smartphones-raise-the-bar-for-the-next-iphone-1505041201". What happens in 2018? Software.

With the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-x-review-yes-there-are-reasons-to-pay-apple-1-000-1509724800", Apple has already changed how we interact with our screens with a new set of swipes and taps. The next iOS and the 2018 iPhones should push the new screen interaction further. As Apple's face-unlocking system develops, our facial glances and movements likely will do even more. There is also"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps".

In the Android world, as phones get the latest "https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/" software, phones will benefit from battery-life improvements and new notification-taming tricks.

AI Moves in Everywhere

While our conversations with Alexa and Siri show no signs of letting up, artificial intelligence will move more quietly into other aspects of our digital lives.

Already you can see it in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/8-things-you-hate-about-gmail-and-how-to-fix-them-1495044178". Google's machines analyze your email style to suggest appropriate instant responses. And ever receive an alert from Facebook"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/managing-your-identity-on-facebook-with-face-recognition-technology/" Its bots are looking out for your face.

All this will get faster, too. In late 2017, Google, Facebook and Apple launched mobile machine-learning tools for app developers, and new AI-optimized chips from companies like"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-makers-are-adding-brains-alongside-cameras-eyes-1507114801"are starting to pop up in smartphones.

The Assault on Security and Privacy Continues

There is a good chance you were hacked in 2017. There is a good chance it will happen again in 2018. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weve-been-breached-inside-the-equifax-hack-1505693318", which exposed the Social Security numbers of nearly 143 million Americans, revealed just how exposed our information is.

Security experts warn that "https://www.symantec.com/blogs/feature-stories/2018-cyber-security-predictions", particularly in their internet-connected TVs, toys and other "smart" appliances. Marketers and social media platforms will get more aggressive, too, compiling everything from your location to your credit card transactions to tailor ads to you.

But you can "https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-biggest-online-security-risk-is-you-1487786578". And the broad data-protection regulations going into effect in Europe this May could "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/12/13/europes-upcoming-privacy-mandate-brings-strict-rules-hefty-fines/", too.

Many Comments Critical of 'Fiduciary' Rule Are Fake; Wall Street Journal analysis shows 40% of respondents didn't write the posts that were attributed to them

A significant number of fake comments appear among thousands criticizing a proposed federal rule meant to prevent conflicts of interest in retirement advice, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.

At issue is the Labor Department's "fiduciary rule," which would require investment advisers handling retirement accounts to act in the best interest of clients. Written during the Obama administration, the proposed rule won't be fully implemented until July 2019, and the Labor Department is still gathering feedback about it on its website.

Many of the comments weren't written by the people they were attributed to, the Journal analysis found.

Consider the experience of Robert Schubert, a Devon, Pa., salesperson. A comment posted in his name on the Labor Department website opposed the rule, saying: "I do not need, do not want and object to any federal interference in my retirement planning."

In an interview, Mr. Schubert said the comment was a fraud. He didn't post it and doesn't agree with it. "I am disgusted that people can post comments using my name," Mr. Schubert said.

Mr. Schubert is among 50 people who responded to a survey last week conducted by research firm Mercury Analytics for The Journal 40%, or 20 of whom said they didn't post the comment listed under their name, address, phone number and email.

Asked about the Journal findings, a Labor Department spokesman said the agency removes fraudulent comments brought to the agency's attention. Submitting fraudulent statements or representations to the federal government is a felony.

The Labor Department is the fifth agency identified by The Journal to have posted unauthorized comments on its website. Most federal agencies make it difficult to independently check the authenticity of public comments; only a few publish email addresses along with the comments.

The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-people-post-comments-on-federal-regulations-many-are-fake-1513099188" at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. The Journal's findings were cited by calls from Congress to delay the repeal of the FCC's net-neutrality rule.

The fiduciary rule has been fiercely opposed by brokerage firms, insurance companies and mutual fund providers that worry it will make it difficult to sell lucrative financial products that come with high fees. They also are concerned it will add costs through new disclosure requirements and procedures, which in turn will discourage some companies and financial advisers from serving investors with small nest eggs.

The Trump administration's Labor Department "https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-department-seeks-18-month-delay-in-fiduciary-rule-1502305970" while it reviews the economic impact.

It is unclear who is posting the fraudulent comments. The rule so far has been a boon to the brokerage industry because firms have been pushing customers toward accounts that charge an annual fee on their assets rather than commissions that can violate the rule. These fee-based accounts typically are more lucrative for the industry.

The Journal survey was sent to 345 people among more than 3,100 comments. The surveys were sent to those identified by The Journal as those who appeared to be unaffiliated with industry or consumer groups or firms. Most of the 345 comments were critical of the fiduciary rule.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, agencies must take comments under consideration but needn't pay heed to them. The impact often comes afterward, when the regulated parties appeal to the next administration, the courts or Congress, which can alter a rule or slow its implementation. Failure to consider comments has become a factor in litigation, with judges sometimes forcing an agency to address comments it ignored.

Mercury said the results of the survey indicate "that the practice of submitting comments without the approval of the individuals identified occurs with frequency."

Some of those surveyed said they liked the comments attributed to them, even though they hadn't filed them.

A comment attributed to Gina Nakagawa of Winterville, Ga., said: "My husband and I have worked very diligently since an early age."

In an interview Mrs. Nakagawa, a retired schoolteacher and insurance sales agent, said: "It is not factual &I wish I had said it. But I can't claim that I wrote it."

Ralph Litten of Liberty, Mo., is no fan of government regulations. But he says in an interview the comment attributed to him was false and he was unhappy it included his personal information.

"The Federal Government under the Constitution has no authority to define or regulate in any manner how or when I make use of my retirement accounts," states the comment attributed to Mr. Litten.

In the interview, Mr. Litten said: "The older I get the less and less I trust our federal government, particularly today. It is a quagmire."

U.S. News: Low-Tax States See Housing Market Boon

By Laura Kusisto

The tax overhaul is expected to create winners and losers in housing markets across the U.S., dealing a blow to high-cost coastal regions but potentially fueling demand in the middle of the country.

The law caps the amount of property and state income tax filers can deduct, a provision that hits states like New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and California especially hard. It also limits the size of a loan on which homeowners can deduct mortgage interest to $750,000, down from $1 million, which could put a dent in pricey markets.

On the other hand, real-estate agents and economic-development officials in less-expensive states believe they can benefit if the tax-law changes encourage people to reconsider their home address.

"At some point this draws attention to the cost gap in high-cost areas and growing areas with growing resources like Raleigh, Austin and Charlotte," said Scott Hoyt, a real-estate agent in North Carolina. "That's going to be a boon."

At peak impact in the summer of 2019, home prices in Essex and Union counties in New Jersey and Westchester County in New York could be about 10.5% lower than they would have been without the tax bill, according to Moody's Analytics. For roughly 80% of counties in the country, the effect of the bill on home prices is likely to be negative, the firm estimates.

But some markets could see a slight boost to their economies and to home prices thanks to the bill, including parts of North Carolina, Alabama, Nebraska, Indiana and Tennessee.

"They don't get nailed by the elimination of the [state and local tax] deduction, but they do benefit in the change from the standard deduction and some of the manufacturers benefit from the lower marginal rates for businesses," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

Mr. Zandi cautioned the changes are modest. Even areas likely to see an additional increase in home prices are expecting a boost of around 1%. Overall, the national impact is likely to be negative. "What this is going to do is it's going to throw a wet blanket on [the housing market]. It's still going to move forward, but more slowly," he said.

People are already migrating from high-cost states to lower-cost areas as home prices and rents in large urban centers skyrocket and it becomes easier to work remotely. The tax law is likely to accelerate that trend, economists said. Idaho, Nevada and Utah saw the largest percentage growth in population in the country from July 2016 to July 2017, according to U.S. Census data released this month. New York, New Jersey and California, meanwhile, ranked below the top 20 for percentage growth.

Economists said the tax impact is likely to be felt more by businesses deciding to expand operations in lower-cost states, viewing local taxes as an even greater hindrance.

"There's a neon billboard now [and] the critical mass to induce companies to leave, to induce employees to leave. 2018 is going to see a lot of pressure on this," said Edward McCaffery, a professor of law and economics at the University of Southern California.

The average New York household that itemizes its tax return pays roughly $17,500 in state income and property taxes -- well above the $10,000 limit, according to an analysis by Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. A typical California household that itemizes pays close to $14,000 in taxes. Even in slightly less pricey states, such as Illinois, Maryland, Oregon and Vermont, the average taxpayer who itemizes exceeds the new cap.

For some homeowners, the differences can be stark. A top income earner in New York who owns a home in the top-third price tier of the metro area pays more than $23,000 in property and state income taxes a year, according to an analysis by Zillow. Meanwhile, an affluent homeowner with an expensive home in Raleigh would pay just over $10,000.

A homeowner in similar circumstances in Chicago would pay about $12,000 in property and state income tax, while one in the same circumstances in Nashville would pay about one-quarter that much.

Steve Bellone, county executive of Suffolk County on New York's Long Island, said he worries the law will hurt the area economically in the form of lower home values and less consumer spending. Long Island has struggled to retain younger residents.

"The cost of living is high and that's something we're always grappling with to try to keep people in the region and keep young people in the region. This is really a devastating blow to all those efforts," he said.

Retail Holiday Sales Go Ka-Ching

Retailers are enjoying some extra Christmas cheer.

Fueled by high consumer confidence and a robust job market, U.S. retail sales in the holiday period rose at their best pace since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.

Sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve, compared with a 3.7% gain in the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Inc. unit, which tracks all forms of payment. E-commerce continued to drive the gains, rising 18.1%.

"It started with a bang in the week leading up to Black Friday," said Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president of marketing insights at Mastercard. She said retailers also benefited from Christmas Day falling on a Monday, giving shoppers a full weekend to scoop up last-minute purchases. Dec. 23 ranked next to Black Friday in terms of spending, according to Mastercard. "Overall, this year was a big win for retail," Ms. Quinlan said.

That newfound buoyancy is a relief to retailers, from department-store giants like Macy's Inc. to mall favorites like Gap Inc., which struggled through a difficult year of store closures, declining foot traffic and bankruptcies by chains including the Sports Authority, Toys 'R' Us and Payless Shoes.

Investors, who have abandoned many retail stocks even amid a broader stock-market surge, have started to return. Shares of Macy's and Gap have jumped 24% and 18%, respectively, in the past month, compared with a 3% gain in the S&P 500. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has rallied 40% on the year and, just like its online nemesis Amazon.com Inc., is trading near its highs.

In past years, spending was driven by high-income shoppers. This holiday season a broader swath of the population opened their wallets, encouraged by rising wages and low unemployment, analysts and economists said.

"Fewer people are living paycheck to paycheck," said Chris Christopher, executive director of economic-research firm IHS Markit. "There is a lot more spending from the lower- and middle-income groups, while the upper-income groups are splurging."

Consumer credit-card debt reached its highest level since the end of 2008, jumping 11% from a year earlier to $757 billion in the third quarter of 2017, according to Experian PLC, a credit-reporting agency. This time around, the surging debt levels are due to economic confidence, said Alan Ikemura, a senior product manager with Experian's analytics unit.

Consumer confidence rose to a 17-year-high in November, while unemployment fell to a 17-year low in October. Personal-consumption expenditures, a measure of household spending on items such as airfares and washing machines, increased 4.5% in November from a year earlier, an increase from year-over-year gains of 4% during the summer.

In a cautionary sign, however, credit-card delinquency rates jumped 16% in the third quarter, indicating consumers may be spending above their means and could slow their purchasing next year.

For now, consumer balance sheets are in good shape, according to Jack Kleinhenz, the National Retail Federation's chief economist. "The stock market has been rising, and the wealth effect has kicked in," he continued. "People are saving less because they feel they have some job security."

Marie Fernandez, a 52-year-old nurse practitioner, said she is using a work bonus to renovate her pool and add more landscaping to her Miami home. She also splurged on items for herself this year, including handbags, shoes, clothes and perfume.

"Things are better," Ms. Fernandez said. "The economy is picking up."

Sales of electronics and appliances grew 7.5%, the strongest increase of the past decade, according to Mastercard. Home furnishings and home improvement grew 5.1%. And jewelry sales grew 5.9%, driven by last minute purchases.

Pockets of weakness remain, a reminder of the challenges facing traditional retailers as they grapple with consumers' shift to e-commerce. Online shopping typically accounts for roughly 10% of U.S. spending. IHS Markit expects it will account for nearly one-fifth of holiday sales this year, and much of those sales go to Amazon.

Ashley Wilkins, who lives in Brooklyn, says she hasn't felt much economic relief. "Money's just as tight this year as it was last year," said the 24-year-old stay-at-home mom as she browsed racks of apparel with her husband at Macy's flagship store in Manhattan on the Friday before Christmas.

Apparel retailers have been among the hardest hit by the changes in consumer shopping behavior. Overall, apparel sales rose 2.7%, but women's apparel didn't contribute to the gain, according to Mastercard.

A silver lining for department stores and other apparel retailers is that they entered this season with less inventory than last year, reducing the need for companies to cut prices more than planned.

This year there was less discounting of computers, electronics and toys and games, according to Market Track LLC, which analyzed 50,000 printed promotions that ran between Nov. 1 and Dec. 16 and compared them with similar ads a year ago. Apparel promotions were slightly deeper. Overall, the average level of discounting was unchanged from a year ago at 39%.

The final tally for individual retailers won't be known until they begin reporting results early next year. And one of the biggest shopping weeks of the season is still to come.

During the week between Christmas and New Year's, consumers are expected to spend $69 billion, or about 11% of the season's total, according to the consulting firm Customer Growth Partners, as they return unwanted presents and redeem gift cards.

Retailers will be ready, dangling more deals as well as spring merchandise. By the first week in January, J.C. Penney Co. will refresh its entire store with new goods, including sunglasses and flip-flops. Kohl's Corp. is offering 15% off most purchases that week.

"The week after Christmas is really big," said Kohl's chief marketing officer, Greg Revelle.

How Tax Law Will Help Some Housing Markets; Tax overhaul is a boon for housing markets in low-tax states

A homeowner in similar circumstances in Chicago would pay about $12,000 in property and state income tax, while one in the same circumstances in Nashville would pay about one-quarter that much.

Scott Mosley, a Redfin real-estate agent in Nashville, said he has one client moving from Chicago who fast-tracked his closing to just three weeks, out of fear he will take a hit on his tax bill next year because of the cap on state and local tax deductions. Tennessee has no state income tax, although it does level a tax on investment income.

To be sure, the tax law is merely likely to nudge those already considering moving to a cheaper state. Most homeowners are likely to make other sacrifices before they uproot their lives over a modestly larger tax bill.

Steve Bellone, county executive of Suffolk County on New York's Long Island, said he worries the law will hurt the area economically in the form of lower home values and less consumer spending. Long Island has already struggled to retain younger residents.

"The cost of living is high and that's something we're always grappling with to try to keep people in the region and keep young people in the region. This is really a devastating blow to all those efforts," he said.

Felicia Fleitman, a 34-year-old who owns a consulting business, Savvy Hires, that helps companies create internships and apprentice programs, said she and her husband pay about $10,000 on property taxes and another $5,000 on state income taxes for their 1,100-square-foot home on Long Island.

The couple has two children and Ms. Fleitman is pregnant with a third. She said they would make sacrifices such as taking fewer career risks or buying fewer toys for their children, in order to stay in their home close to family and friends.

"At the end of the day, we're just going to have to figure it out and come up with the money, which means that other things might have to give a bit, which stinks," she said.

Ride-Sharing App Didi Attracts $4 Billion in New Funding

BEIJING -- Chinese ride-sharing platform Didi Chuxing Technology Co. raised $4 billion in fresh funding, pushing its valuation closer to rival Uber Technologies Inc. and giving it ample money to spend on self-driving vehicles and other artificial-intelligence systems.

Investors in Didi's new funding include Japanese mega-fund-manager SoftBank Group Corp. and Mubadala Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi state fund, people familiar with the matter said Thursday. The company announced the funding without naming the investors.

The injection gives Beijing-based Didi $12 billion in cash reserves and a valuation of $56 billion, these people said. It also means that added together Didi has raised about $19 billion, the most venture capital ever raised by a startup, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

While Uber's valuation was roughly $68 billion based on its last funding round in June 2016, a current SoftBank offer to purchase a sizable stake at a large discount would lower the U.S. ride-sharing company's valuation in the range of about $50 billion.

With its new financial power, Didi is in a better position to develop intelligent driving technologies against deep-pocketed competitors such as Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo LLC, Tesla Inc. and Chinese internet company Baidu Inc., industry analysts and consultants said. Didi, they said, is escalating its efforts, aided by the data it collects from its more than 450 million active users.

"The penetration of the average user is so much greater in China than in the U.S., so you actually could argue Didi is much better positioned from a perspective of training autonomous vehicles," said Chris DeAngelis, general manager of consultancy at Alliance Development Group.

Two years ago Didi's cash reserves totaled $3.5 billion. Much of the new cash Didi raised will be used to develop autonomous vehicles, such as self-driving buses, and developing public-transportation management programs to dispatch buses, subway trains and taxis based on traffic patterns, according to people familiar with the matter.

Didi faced a bruising subsidy-fueled battle with Uber for dominance in China, before the Chinese company acquired the U.S. rival's China operations last year. While Didi has invested in other ride-sharing platforms including GrabTaxi Holdings Pte., which operates in Thailand, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, it has primarily focused on the domestic market.

In March, Didi opened a research-and-development lab in Silicon Valley, which focuses on intelligent driving technologies and AI-based security. The lab now has about 100 employees.

Some of the new funding will also be spent building an electric-car charging network.

GOP Tax Overhaul Makes Homeownership Less Appealing; Prices in more expensive markets are forecast to be as much as 10% lower by mid-2019 than they otherwise would have been

The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-passes-gop-tax-overhaul-bill-1513711679"wipes out decades-old perks designed to encourage homeownership.

By almost doubling the standard deductions for individual and joint tax filers, the legislation blunts the advantage of the mortgage-interest deduction, which is often a key factor in home-buying decisions, particularly in pricey markets. The legislation also caps the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, a hammer blow to homeowners in high-tax states. Taken together, the changes significantly diminish the perks of homeownership built into the tax code.

"There's really no difference between owning and renting in the tax code anymore for most Americans," said Ed Mills, a Washington policy analyst at financial-services firm Raymond James & Associates.

At least 23 million fewer U.S. homeowners will be incentivized to buy a home under the new rules, according to home-search website Zillow. The share of homeowners who are likely to itemize and therefore take advantage of the mortgage-interest deduction is expected to decline to about 14% from about 44%, according to Zillow.

At peak impact, U.S. home prices will be about 4% lower in the summer of 2019 than if there had been no tax changes, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics. Similarly, in pricier markets in states like New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania, prices could be as much as 10% lower, according to Moody's.

The National Association of Realtors, one of the largest and wealthiest lobby groups in the U.S., lobbied vigorously and unsuccessfully against the changes. Housing lobbyists said they first spotted trouble when a 2014 Republican blueprint from then-Chairman of the House Ways and Means Dave Camp proposed to nearly double the standard deduction. It neutered the mortgage-interest deduction by ensuring the vast majority of households no longer would be incentivized to itemize their tax returns.

But it was hard to argue against what likely would amount to a tax break for many Americans.

"When you increase the standard deduction, many, many fewer taxpayers are going to itemize, and the ones that do are only going to be the very wealthy," said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders.

Insight Venture Partners has taken a minority stake in PrecisionLender, a provider of pricing- and profitability-management software for banks.

The investment is the Charlotte, N.C., company's third round of funding, according to Carl Ryden, chief executive of PrecisionLender, also known as Lender Performance Group LLC.

He added that Century Capital Partners committed $11 million in 2014 and Georgian Partners, a Toronto investor targeting business software companies, committed $20 million in a Series B round of funding in September 2016.

Century Capital Partners later separated its private-equity arm from the rest of its operation under the Century Equity Partners name. PrecisionLender is listed as a portfolio company of Century Equity Partners.

Mr. Ryden said the proceeds from Insight's investment will go toward the company's continuing expansion in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the opening of facilities in Europe and a bolstering of the company's marketing strategy.

PrecisionLender's software products include Andi, a virtual pricing analyst that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze loan packages for commercial bankers. The company's services are used by more than 200 banks world-wide, according to a news release.

Richard Wells, a managing director at Insight, said the investment was the result of a relationship between the firm and PrecisionLender spanning several years, starting when the company was at an early stage. Mr. Wells said Insight aims to help the company expand its customer base with its growth-equity investment.

PrecisionLender has been busy in 2017. The company expanded into the Australian market. Clients are using the software to price deals at a run rate of $400 billion a year, a rate that has been doubling every six months, according to the news release.

In addition to Insight's private-equity and growth investments, the New York firm has been busy on the venture-capital front.

Insight, which targets companies in the software and technology space, in November led a $25 funding round into Spot.IM, a company that allows publishers to increase and monetize social engagement on their websites; and participated in a $26 million Series B round of funding for LeanTaaS Inc., a company that increases patient access in health care by reducing wait times and increasing operational performance.

Retail

Retailers are set to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the new tax legislation, which lowers the corporate rate to 21% from 35%.

Retailers have mostly U.S.-based operations and little manufacturing or research and development, so they don't usually benefit from deductions on those activities. Retailers paid an average tax rate of 30.6% in 2016, according to PwC, the highest of any industry it tracked.

The tax cut could have significant effects on an industry spending heavily to fight Amazon.com Inc. and adapt to shifting consumer habits. Traditional retailers have generally paid higher taxes than online retailers like Amazon, which can often place intellectual property in countries with lower rates and benefit from deductions given to companies that don't earn a profit.

The biggest beneficiaries would be U.S.-based ones that derive the majority of their profits in the U.S., including department stores such as Macy's Inc. and Kohl's Corp., and some apparel retailers, Cowen & Co. said in a research note.

Realtors

The National Association of Realtors, one of the largest lobby groups in the U.S., is among the biggest losers in a tax-code overhaul that wipes out decades-old perks designed to encourage homeownership.

By almost doubling the standard deductions for individual and joint tax filers, the legislation blunts the advantage of the mortgage interest deduction, which is often a key factor in homebuying decisions. The legislation also caps the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, a blow to homeowners in high-tax states.

At least 23 million fewer U.S. homeowners would be incentivized to buy a home under the new rules, according to home-search website Zillow. The share of homeowners who are likely to itemize and therefore take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction is expected to decline to about 14% from about 44%, according to Zillow.

At peak impact, U.S. home prices would be about 4% lower in the summer of 2019 than if there had been no tax changes, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics. In pricier markets in states like New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania, prices could be as much as 10% lower, according to Moody's.

Health Insurers

Health insurers, an overwhelmingly domestic industry, initially could see sharp increases in earnings from the tax bill's sharp cut to the corporate rate -- perhaps in the 15% to 20% range, said Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners LLC.

Many nonprofits in the industry, a category that includes most Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers, also would see a drop in their tax bills, but not as large. The nonprofit Blue insurers do generally pay federal taxes, analysts said, but often at lower rates than their for-profit competitors.

Over time, the tax-cut windfall could shrink. Shawn Guertin, chief financial officer of Aetna Inc., told analysts the immediate benefit would be large, but cautioned that it could be chipped away somewhat by rules in the Affordable Care Act that dictate a minimum share of premium dollars that must go toward health costs. He also said that the extra margin would be trimmed over time as insurers used it to push down rates in competitive markets.

Another aspect of the tax legislation could increase the challenges for some insurers, by ending enforcement of the ACA's individual insurance mandate. Insurers generally believe that the upshot would be to shrink enrollment in ACA plans, particularly among healthy people who don't receive federal subsidies to help with their premiums. That could lead to an increase in premiums, insurance officials say.

Telecom

Because most telecommunications carriers' revenue comes from domestic operations, the corporate-rate cut could save them billions annually. Another provision lasting through 2022 that allows companies to immediately write down the full value of their capital investments also would lead to big savings near-term.

Bonus depreciation, a tax benefit that allows businesses to write off the falling value of machinery and equipment upfront rather than over time, gave a boost to telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. when it was added to the tax code nearly a decade ago.

This bill extends and expands that stimulus measure for the next five years, giving big capital spenders an extra break from an already slimmer corporate tax bill.

Network operators are among the biggest beneficiaries of bonus depreciation because of the amount of gear needed to keep their systems up-to-date. The depreciation write-off would hit as wireless companies ramp up spending on new hardware designed to support fifth-generation, or 5G, networks.

Wells Fargo estimates the depreciation benefit would add about $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, to free cash flow for AT&T and Verizon in 2019.

-- Drew FitzGerald and Ryan Knutson

---

Agriculture

The final tax bill eliminated the Domestic Production Activities Deduction, also known as Section 199, which has allowed farmers to reduce their income by deducting some costs of agricultural cooperatives, the grower-owned organizations that market farmers' crops and supply fertilizer and pesticides. Agricultural groups have said the deduction amounts to about $2 billion annually.

But the bill does include a new 20% deduction on co-op payments to farmer members, and a similar deduction for co-ops themselves.

Farm groups generally backed other aspects of the legislation, which they said expanded some exemptions from the federal estate tax and improved depreciation provisions for agricultural machinery.

-- Jacob Bunge

---

Manufacturers

The tax bill likely would make the U.S. more attractive as a base for manufacturing.

International provisions aimed at repatriating and taxing overseas profits would generally favor domestic manufacturers that export from the U.S. or companies with production in the country, said Paul Green, a tax partner who focuses on the industrial sector at Ernst & Young LLP in Chicago.

U.S. manufacturers are likely to benefit from the ability to immediately write off the costs of equipment purchases, tax experts said. That could mean more sales for equipment makers and spur manufacturers to invest in new factory machines.

Within the food-manufacturing sector, companies with international brands such as Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International Inc. and M&M's owner Mars Inc. would save money when they repatriate overseas earnings.

-- Andrew Tangel and Annie Gasparro

---

Oil & Gas

Corporate-tax cuts would be a boon to oil-and-gas producers in a variety of ways, but it isn't expected to be as meaningful for big companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., or shale drillers, as it would be for refiners.

Like other multinational corporations, oil giants such as Exxon and Chevron Corp. would be able to bring profits made abroad back into the U.S. at a lower tax rate, according to Niloufar Molavi, the global oil and gas leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers.

That is among the changes that signal a transition to "territorial taxation," where large U.S. companies with global operations wouldn't necessarily have to pay domestic tax on activity abroad for which they already paid tax to another country, she said.

The bill also has provisions that continue to provide breaks to energy partnerships whose earnings are taxed once they are paid out to shareholders. Often called master-limited partnerships, or MLPs, many companies within that corporate structure operate pipeline assets around the country.

-- Bradley Olson

---

Hospitals

The nation's nonprofit hospitals -- which account for about 60% of the sector -- dodged a bullet as the bill would preserve their access to tax-exempt bond markets.

Hospitals went to market for $37 billion in tax-exempt bonds in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters. The risk hospitals could be shut out sent borrowers scrambling to raise funds in recent weeks.

But hospitals said the repeal of the ACA mandate that most people get health insurance would increase the number of uninsured patients seeking medical care.

The lower corporate tax rate would benefit major hospital companies including HCA Healthcare Inc.

But due to another provision in the bill, Tenet Healthcare Corp., Quorum Health Corp. and Community Health Systems Inc. wouldn't fare as well as would rivals with less leverage, said RBC Capital Markets Analyst Frank Morgan.

-- Melanie Evans

---

Airports and Security

The tax bill would preserve "private activity bonds," tax-exempt financing that local governments that own airports sell to fund new or rebuilt terminals, parking garages and other infrastructure. A provision of the House tax bill would have ended the bonds, which also help raise money for ports, hospitals and universities.

Airports estimate they have $100 billion in infrastructure needs over the next five years, and 60% of those projects were expected to be financed through these types of bonds.

The overall tax package would incentivize further airline investment in equipment and jobs, according to Airlines for America, the industry's leading trade association. U.S. passenger airline capital expenditures totaled $17.5 billion in 2016. The corporate rate reduction more than makes up for limits on business interest deductions, changes in deductible expensing and the elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, the group said.

Delta Air Lines Inc., for one, said it expects the drop in the corporate rate to save it $800 million a year and push up its expected earnings by $1 per share to $6.35.

-- Susan Carey

---

Restaurants

The tax overhaul is largely favorable for restaurant companies and their shareholders, according to several analysts.

But multinational chains such as McDonald's Corp., Restaurant Brands International Inc. and Yum Brands Inc. that have a higher mix of U.S. debt to earnings could take an earnings hit due to limits on the tax deductibility of U.S. interest expenses, according to Credit Suisse analysts.

Based on the reduction of the corporate tax rate alone, analysts say fast-casual dining chains such as Shake Shack Inc. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. would benefit the most because they currently pay the highest corporate tax rates.

Softbank has become the latest big name investor to take a stake in New York-based insurance start-up Lemonade.

The Japanese company has taken part in a $120m funding round for Lemonade. It joins Allianz, Sequoia Capital and Google Ventures, which had already backed the company.

Lemonade, which sells insurance to people who rent property in the US, is one of the most high profile of the wave of so-called insurtech start-ups aiming to disrupt the centuries-old insurance industry.

The company recruited behavioural economist Dan Ariely to give it insights into customer behaviour, and says that it has paid out on claims as little as three seconds after they were made. It also has a novel business model, taking a flat fee for its services and giving a portion of unused premiums to charity each year.

Unlike many other start-ups, Lemonade has been going through the laborious process of securing its own insurance licences. It now has licences in 25 US states and has sold 80,000 policies since launching a year ago.

The company says it will use the new money raised for global expansion in 2018.

 By combining big data and AI with a seamless user experience, Lemonade is truly revolutionizing the insurance industry,  said David Thevenon, a senior investment professional at SoftBank.  We have been impressed by the team s creative approach to disrupting the traditional insurance model. 

Lemonade is not SoftBank s first foray into insurtech. Earlier this year it was a cornerstone investor in ZhongAn s $10bn IPO in Hong Kong.

Holiday Shopping With Bitcoin? Good Luck With That! The recent Bitcoin run-up has swelled its value, but trying to spend the cryptocurrency can be tough

When Bitcoin began its crazy run-up this month, I was pleased to discover the $100 investment I made on a lark in 2014 suddenly was worth $1,200. Free money! And just in time for some holiday shopping.

But it's harder to spend Bitcoin in New York City than one might expect.

Determined to shop local with my little windfall, I tried a gift shop, grocery, pet store and kitchen-supply joint. None accepted Bitcoin, and the clerks looked a little creeped out when I asked.

I found several prospects on Coinmap, an online directory of businesses that accept Bitcoin. But if these shops took Bitcoin in the past, they sure don't now most were out of business.

A more recent listing looked promising: something called "the Bitcoin Store" in lower Manhattan. When I clicked on its website, however, I was startled to encounter a wide selection of drugs including XTC, codeine syrup and "High Grade Premium Quality Cocaine."

"Well," said a friend, "there's your Christmas shopping!"

Experts say it's no surprise most stores still refuse Bitcoin.

Amine Rahal, founder of digital-marketing firm IronMonk Solutions, tells clients that they can increase sales by accepting Bitcoin. "A lot of people these days have more Bitcoin than they have dollars," he notes.

But while it's as simple as accepting PayPal thanks to Bitcoin payment-processing services, shoppers simply can select a Bitcoin-payment option and send money from their online Bitcoin wallet "most small businesses are super busy, and when it comes to new technology they are intimidated," he says.

Bitcoin has drawbacks, says Patrick Chen, the founder of tech shop xCubicle who sold me my original Bitcoin. During high-volume periods, processing speeds slow down, while transaction fees climb, making small, in-store purchases impractical.

BitPay is among the most popular processing services that accept Bitcoin payments for retailers and convert it into U.S. currency. The fee is 1% compared with the 2-3% fee typically charged by credit-card companies. However, the Bitcoin system itself charges an additional fee for transactions.

During low-volume periods, the fee often is just a few cents per transaction. But in recent weeks, when supply has outstripped demand, it can cost $10 or more, according to BitPay.

In many cases, the customer pays this in the form of a transaction charge tacked on by his wallet provider.

Still, there are a few area outfits that happily accept Bitcoin. Bullion Exchanges, a precious-metals retailer in Manhattan's Diamond District, offers a small discount to those who pay in Bitcoin rather than a credit card.

Visiting the tiny storefront last week, I told clerk and Managing Partner Ben Tseytlin about my windfall, now worth $1,800.

"You could buy a gold coin with that," he said.

I wouldn't be the first to swap Bitcoin for gold.

"We've done more Bitcoin business in the past two weeks than we have all year," says Eric Gozenput, another managing partner at Bullion Exchange. "It's gone up 2,000%, so people are moving it into something underperforming."

Most business owners who accept Bitcoin, like Mr. Gozenput, are Bitcoin enthusiasts.

"It was to show support for cryptocurrencies," says Tom Capo, owner of KPODJ Lighting & DJ Gear in Hopatcong, N.J., of his decision to accept Bitcoin.

Only a few customers have paid in Bitcoin, he says. "But if 1% of our transactions in 2018 are cryptocurrencies, I think it would be really cool."

My best bet looked to be Astro West, an Upper West Side shop offering minerals, meteorites and fossils. Who wouldn't want a piece of the asteroid belt for Christmas?

Gemologist Filip Klein, decked out in a three-piece suit and long braid, showed me mineral formations in a big display case, including a $600 azurite, a gigantic $45,000 amethyst and a spectacular $500,000 tourmaline.

He also shared his pet Bitcoin theory. Some say the currency was invented by an artificial intelligence. "By getting us to build computers and do more Bitcoin mining, we're building the body of the artificial intelligence," he said. "It's terrifying."

Astro West owner Marc Tanjeloff declared himself a Bitcoin skeptic. Like many retailers, he only accepts Bitcoin online, using a service that immediately converts it to U.S. dollars.

"Cash is still king," he says. "And wire transfers are better."

I never managed to spend my Bitcoin, but no matter my $100 investment just hit $2,360. And if I hang on, Mr. Chen tells me, it is likely to be worth 50 times that.

Meteorites for everybody!

Anodot's Machine Learning  Helps Companies Predict Problems; Redline Capital leads $15 million funding round

Large companies are always looking for new ways to use troves of data to help improve their bottom line.

Israel-based Anodot's artificial intelligence software aims to give large companies a kind of early-warning system that scours their data sources to glean critical insights.

"When we see leading indicators that say something exceptional is going on it can be good or bad then we will notify you ahead and we let you know what is happening," said Anodot Chief Executive and co-founder David Drai, who was co-founder of Cotendo, which was acquired by Akamai and who was chief technology officer for taxi app Gett.

Anodot, which also has an office in San Francisco, has raised $15 million in new funding. Redline Capital Management led, with existing investors Aleph Venture Capital and Disruptive Technologies Venture Capital. The funding adds to the company's Series B round, which now totals $23 million. Anodot has raised $26.5 million in total.

With the large amount of data and digital dashboards that companies have, it's difficult for people to manage it all. Anodot, founded in 2014, provides software that can analyze this data and automatically predict problems that may arise.

For example, for a finance analyst at an e-commerce company, Anodot can sort through data indicating a competitors' campaign for shoes and notice a drop in its own company's shoe sales. This could enable the company to quickly respond, avoiding a drop in sales.

In another example, Anodot saw a mobile gaming client have an unexplained drop in revenue. After sifting though various data sources, Anodot was able to identify the problem as a result of a particular new version of the application on the iPhone.

Customers include e-commerce, fintech and manufacturing clients, such as Lyft, Microsoft, Google's Waze, Foursquare and Upwork.

While there are many competitors in this sector, many others are trying to add machine learning and artificial intelligence on top of existing software, said Mr. Drai, who co-founded the company with Ira Cohen, a former HP executive, and co-founder Shay Lang.

"The advantage we have is we're designing this from scratch," Mr. Drai said.

Thoma Bravo Targets $2.3 Billion For Latest Software-Focused Fund

Software-focused private-equity firm Thoma Bravo is targeting $2.3 billion for its second lower-midmarket Discover fund, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Thoma Bravo, which has offices in Chicago and San Francisco, is seeking to raise more than double the $1.07 billion it collected for its maiden lower-midmarket fund.

The strategy targets investments in software companies deemed too small for Thoma Bravo's flagship fund, the firm said when it announced the close of the first Discover fund in February 2016.

Thoma Bravo didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Technology-focused firms have been among the industry's best performers in recent years. Thoma Bravo, which hit the $7.6 billion hard cap for its flagship fund in September last year, was recently named the world's top-performing buyout firm in an annual ranking by analytics firm Peracs.

San Francisco-based Vista Equity Partners, which this year raised more than $11 billion for software deals, topped the same list in 2015.

The returns available from fast-growing tech companies and surging demand from investors has prompted firms known for large-cap buyouts to launch specialist strategies.

Earlier this month, London-based private-equity firm Apax Partners said it raised $1 billion for its maiden technology-dedicated fund, beating its $800 million target.

Last year KKR & Co. raised $711 million to invest in growth-stage technology, media and telecoms companies. Permira Advisers is also currently raising its first technology fund.

As competition in the sector has increased, prices have risen to eye-watering highs.

The average price private-equity firms paid for software companies reached 18.1 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, nearly double the 10.2-times multiple firms paid for other companies, according to Bain & Co.'s 2017 report.

Thoma Bravo was founded by a group of deal makers who left Golder Thoma & Co. in the late 1990s. The firm manages a number of private-equity and debt funds totaling more than $17 billion.

Recent investments include the $1.6 billion take-private of data security company Barracuda Networks Inc. and the November acquisition of ABY Financial Services Inc., a software and payment processing company.

Insurance company Lemonade Inc. said Tuesday it has raised $120 million in an investment round led by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.

The Series C funding round is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2018, Lemonade said, and will be used to help the New York-based company expand globally next year. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurance-startup-lemonade-raises-34-million-1480957751" also participated in the funding round.

With its latest investment, SoftBank will also gain a seat on Lemonade's board. Lemonade said David Thevenon, a managing director at SoftBank, will join its board.

SoftBank is joining current Lemonade investors Aleph, Allianz, General Catalyst Partners, GV, Sequoia Capital, Sound Ventures, Thrive Capital, Tusk Ventures and XL Innovate.

The insurance company uses both behavioral economics and artificial intelligence to offer both renters and homeowners insurance. Launched in late 2016, Lemonade is licensed to sell products in 25 states.

Banking & Finance: Leveraged Lending Makes a Comeback

By Christopher Whittall 
673 words

Banks are ramping up a business that was popular before the financial crisis: offering investors ways to lever up sometimes illiquid and complex investments to amplify their returns.

Years of ultralow interest rates have pushed down returns across markets, making such strategies increasingly appealing to funds in Europe and the U.S.

A decade ago, overleveraged banks and investors nearly crashed the global financial system.

While leverage is nowhere near those levels and new banking regulations restrict how high it can go, some bankers and funds are still concerned about signs of leverage creeping back into the system.

The level of leverage across debt markets can be hard to track given many transactions are private, but funds report that banks have been stepping up their efforts to lend to investors and they are increasingly saying yes.

Recently, several banks offered London-based Cheyne Capital's Strategic Value Credit unit finance to leverage a 300 million euros ($353.4 million) pool of loans to Irish midsize firms, potentially doubling the London-based fund's returns on that investment to roughly 12% to 15%.

Cheyne SVC Chief Investment Officer Anthony Robertson hadn't previously thought of using leverage but found the prospect of levering this niche investment by two times to be a tempting offer.

"In a world where rates are so anemic, investment-management funds desperately need to bolster returns," said Mr. Robertson, who hopes to close the deal in the new year. But "clearly it does enhance the risk profile," he said.

Corporate bonds are trading near levels not seen before the financial crisis, when rampant demand for income pushed returns lower. Government bonds continue to offer low returns, with the 10-year Treasury note yielding 2.392% Monday.

Adding leverage can multiply gains when investments are steady or rising in value. Put simply, funds borrow to bet more money on an investment. But it also magnifies losses, sometimes ensnaring investors in a vicious circle in which they are forced to sell as prices fall, triggering further declines and more fire sales.

Funds say they are being offered leverage that would allow them to increase their investments in loans to large, highly indebted companies by up to four times.

Banks are also offering up to 10 times leverage on the highest-rated slices of collateralized loan obligations, products that carve up pools of risky loans. More esoteric investments such as bundles of midcap loans, real estate or troubled loans can get closer to two times leverage, they say.

"The most worrisome thing I see is people levering more credit," said David Allen, chief investment officer of AlbaCore Capital.

Mr. Allen said he is being offered leverage more frequently when he buys debt, though he prefers not to use it. "It's like going to McDonald's and being offered french fries: It's always available," he said.

Providing leverage is a growth market for investment banks struggling with declines in traditional trading units. Fixed-income financing activities at the top 12 global investment banks are on course to increase 10% to 15% this year, according to analytics firm Coalition.

That has come as banks have increased their lending against a variety of debt securities, ranging from high-grade bonds to more complex instruments like asset-backed securities, said Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition.

Bankers in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s London office have discussed with investors options that would allow them to lever their whole fund roughly two times over, according to people familiar with the matter.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s disclosed plans in a September presentation to double by 2020 the size of its balance sheet dedicated to financing "bespoke pools of collateral" for its clients, from around $5 billion in 2016.

Other banks are wary. Citigroup Inc. has been financing fewer structured credit assets this year as competitors have been lending at ever lower rates, according to people familiar with the matter.

Markets
Banks to Funds: Have Some Leverage With That Deal; Funds get financing to lever up risky loans and esoteric investments

Banks are ramping up a business that was popular before the financial crisis offering investors ways to lever up sometimes illiquid and complex investments to amplify their returns.

Years of ultralow interest rates have pushed down returns across markets, making such strategies increasingly appealing to funds in Europe and the U.S.

A decade ago, overleveraged banks and investors nearly crashed the global financial system. While leverage is nowhere near those levels and new banking regulations place restrictions on how high it can go, some bankers and funds are still concerned about signs of leverage creeping back into the system.

The level of leverage across debt markets can be hard to track given many transactions are private, but funds report that banks have been stepping up their efforts to lend to investors and they are increasingly saying yes.

Recently, several banks offered London-based Cheyne Capital's Strategic Value Credit unit finance to leverage a  300 million ($353.4 million) pool of loans to Irish midsize firms, potentially doubling the London-based fund's returns on that investment to roughly 12% to 15%.

Cheyne SVC's Chief Investment Officer Anthony Robertson hadn't previously thought of using leverage, but found the prospect of levering this niche investment by two times to be a tempting offer.

"In a world where rates are so anemic, investment-management funds desperately need to bolster returns," said Mr. Robertson, who hopes to close the deal in the new year. But "clearly it does enhance the risk profile," he said.

Corporate bonds are trading near levels not seen before the financial crisis, when rampant demand for income pushed returns lower. Government bonds continue to offer low returns, with 10-year Treasurys currently yielding 2.355%.

Adding leverage can multiply gains when investments are steady or rising in value. Put simply, funds borrow to bet more money on an investment. But it also magnifies losses, sometimes ensnaring investors in a vicious circle where they are forced to sell as prices fall, triggering further declines and more fire sales.

Funds say they are being offered leverage that would allow them to increase their investments in loans to large, highly-indebted companies by up to four times. Banks are also offering up to 10 times leverage on the highest-rated slices of collateralized loan obligations, products that carve up pools of risky loans. More esoteric investments like bundles of midcap loans, real estate or troubled loans can get closer to two times leverage, they say.

"The most worrisome thing I see is people levering more credit," said David Allen, chief investment officer of AlbaCore Capital.

Mr. Allen said he is being offered leverage more frequently when he buys debt, though he prefers not to use it. "It's like going to McDonald's and being offered French Fries: It's always available," he said.

Providing leverage is a growth market for investment banks struggling with declines in traditional trading units. Fixed-income financing activities at the top 12 global investment banks are on course to increase 10% to 15% this year, according to analytics firm Coalition.

That has come as banks have increased their lending against a variety of debt securities, ranging from high-grade bonds to more complex instruments like asset-backed securities, said Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition.

Bankers in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s London office have discussed with investors options that would allow them to lever their whole fund roughly two times over, according to people familiar with the matter.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s revealed plans in a September presentation to double by 2020 the size of its balance sheet dedicated to financing "bespoke pools of collateral" for its clients, from around $5 billion in 2016. That could generate an additional $100 million of annual revenue, the bank said.

Barclays PLC said it would deploy leverage across its financing and macro units to help drive income growth in its latest quarterly results.

Other banks are wary. Citigroup Inc. has been financing fewer structured credit assets this year as competitors have been lending at ever lower rates, according to people familiar with the matter.

To be sure, there are big differences between conditions before the financial crisis and now.

The amount of leverage being offered is far lower than before that crisis, when it was possible to lever some investments up to 80 times over, investors say. Among other differences, trades these days are less reliant on short-term funding compared with a decade ago. Investors have to post cash to cover mark-to-market losses on a position, which should limit how much they are willing to borrow.

There are also regulations designed to cap banking system leverage. This year the Federal Reserve introduced a measure designed to calculate banks' total leverage in its stress tests.

While systemic risk appears to be lower, many investors are still uneasy about the increase in debt in some investment strategies. That is particularly so for more niche assets, such as midmarket loans, that are harder to value and could be tricky to unload when markets fall.

"You always have to be a bit concerned of the lowering of credit standards and the proliferation of more leverage. That's always a canary in a coalmine," said Stephen Ketchum, managing partner at New York-based Sound Point Capital.

Online lenders count cost of push for growth

Financial services. Credit quality Platforms have come unstuck as rising defaults unnerve investors and loan buyers

Tianqiao Chen still wants to be part of LendingClub. Last week, while shares in America's biggest listed online lender were tumbling after another cut to profit forecasts, the chief executive of Shanda Group bought 4m more of them, further cementing his position as the company's biggest shareholder.

Plenty of other investors have had their faith tested, though, and not just in LendingClub.

Over the past few years, billions of dollars has flowed into online platforms that connect borrowers with yield-hungry investors, crunching vast amounts of data to get loans to consumers and small businesses quickly and cheaply   and promising to make brick-and-mortar banks redundant in the process. But dozens of platforms have come unstuck as rising defaults cause equity investors to balk at providing more funding and loan buyers to seek better risk-adjusted returns elsewhere.

"The one thing that can blow this whole thing up is losing control of credit," said Brian Graham, chief executive of Alliance Partners, a big buyer of LendingClub loans.

LendingClub said last month that it would stop issuing loans to the lowestquality borrowers following rises in prepayments and delinquencies.

Many operators are feeling the effects of a big push for market share in the latter half of 2015 and early 2016, says David Snitkof, chief analytics officer at Orchard. As the platforms rushed to offer new loans, credit quality suffered and loans originated during that period were among the worst performers, with loss rates well ahead of projections.

Platforms "faced a lot of pressure to grow quickly, and some of them grew too quickly", Mr Snitkof says.

Across the sector, valuations have fallen. Earnest, a San Francisco-based student loans specialist, sold itself in October to Navient, the loan-servicing company, for $155m, or about 40 per cent of its peak valuation. The personal lender Prosper, once a "unicorn", saw its price tag drop from a peak of $1.9bn to $550m in a fundraising last month.

One of the casualties was Dealstruck, a San Diego-based online lender to small businesses, which collapsed just over a year ago after supplying a few key clients with more debt than they could handle.

"When you've raised capital and generated an investor base ... you feel this tremendous pressure to find ways to grow," says Ethan Senturia, Dealstruck's former chief executive and co-founder. "And there's no more immediate way to boost volumes than to lower price."

The pitches for online lending businesses were many and varied but came down to the same thing: banks are ripe for disruption.

As Mr Senturia put it in a memoir published this month, Unwound: Realtime Reflections from a Stumbling Entrepreneur, the reason banks can't pay more interest on deposits is because they have expensive branch networks, paper-heavy processes and burdensome compliance regimes.

If you remove the buildings, digitise the underwriting and shield the business from regulatory oversight, the same interest income that funds the bank's overhead could instead accrue to the buyers of the loans. That was   and remains   an attractive proposition.

But the assumption on oversight did not really pan out. Last year, for example, following a governance scandal at LendingClub, regulators such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation tightened the screws.

In guidance put out last summer, the agency said it would assess banks' lending activities conducted through third parties   such as buying loans from an online lender   "as though the activities were performed by the institution itself ".

That meant platforms had to spend heavily to bring compliance and controls systems up to scratch. Lending-Club's latest quarterly filing, for example, shows it had $1.21 of operating expenses for every dollar of fee income over the first nine months   up from $1.03 at the same point two years ago.

The biggest miscalculations, however, were in underwriting. Some operators boasted of sifting thousands of data points, on top of traditional assessments of creditworthiness such as a credit report, arguing that gave them better insights into the risk of default.

But models have consistently misfired, forcing near-constant tweaks and upgrades. LendingClub is on its fifth iteration, G5, "our next-generation credit model and our most powerful risk differentiator yet", according to Scott Sanborn, the company's chief executive. Prosper, which has originated about $10bn of loans since inception in 2006, is on number seven.

The result is that investors big and small have been nursing losses. Sean Murray, a New York-based publisher who writes the blog debanked.com, has been winding down his portfolio of 3,262 notes since May last year, hurt by consistently subpar returns. He says he is on course to generate a loss for 2017   which "seems even worse" when he considers that he could have got about 18 per cent in an S&P 500 index fund or more than 1,500 per cent in bitcoin.

Loan portfolios are best grown slowly, says Mr Senturia, who is now advising fintechs and specialty finance companies.

"The way to separate the wheat from the chaff with a high degree of certainty is to plant crops, wait to see what's left come harvest time, and adjust ... for next season based on the results," he writes in his memoir. "By the time your portfolio is giving off smoke, there's likely a fire burning below."

South Korea's Kakao Seeks $1 Billion by Selling Shares in Singapore; TPG is an investor in Kakao's mobility subsidiary

South Korea's Kakao Corp., one of the country's earliest and most successful technology startups, is seeking to raise $1 billion by selling shares in Singapore to fund overseas acquisitions.

Kakao, whose flagship KakaoTalk mobile messaging app has been ubiquitous in South Korea since its launch in 2010, will seek a secondary listing of global depositary receipts on the Singapore Exchange, the company said in a regulatory filing on Friday.

The listing is expected to be completed by early February. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citibank are advising Kakao on the fundraising.

Kakao said it would use the funds to acquire artificial-intelligence companies and mobile-based content providers.

Kakao's stock sale is large by the standards of South Korean mobile companies. In 2015, South Korean e-commerce startup Coupang, known formally by its corporate name Forward Ventures Co., raised $1 billion from Japan's SoftbBank Corp.

Earlier this year, Fort Worth, Texas-based private-equity giant TPG led a consortium of investors that invested 500 billion won ($460 million) in Kakao Mobility, a Kakao subsidiary that focuses on transportation services.

Kakao is seeking to raise funds at a time of strong earnings and share-price performance. The company's operating profit jumped 57% year on year during the quarter ended September 30, while net profit jumped 193%, driven by robust content and advertising sales.

Shares of the company have roughly doubled over the past year, giving Kakao a market capitalization of about $9 billion.

Kakao operates services including taxi hailing and banking in addition to its core messaging app, which has roughly 43 million monthly active users, 84% of the country's population.

Technology
China Circuit: Venture Capital Is Gushing Into Tech

By Li Yuan

David Su was one of China's first venture capitalists. A month after he started out in 2000, the dot-com bubble burst. For much of the year, he and his partners tried to scrape together $33 million to invest in China's nascent internet industry.

Despite that initial challenge, Mr. Su proved adept in early-stage investing. His portfolio includes search-engine giant Baidu Inc., ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and bike-sharing app Ofo. His Matrix Partners China, which he co-founded in 2008, has nurtured 20 "unicorns," or startups valued at $1 billion or more.

Even with all that experience and success, Mr. Su says he feels as anxious now as he did back in 2000, if for a very different reason.

While capital back then was hard to come by, now the market is flooded with funding. Mr. Su and other venture capitalists compete with Chinese government-backed funds, mega-investors like SoftBank Group Corp. and tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

"In my 18 years in the industry, the tide of capital is riding extremely high this year," Mr. Su says.

In the first 11 months of this year, 3,418 new venture-capital and private-equity funds in China raised 1.6 trillion yuan ($241.76 billion), more than double the amount of 2015 and more than 10 times that of 2006, according to consultancy Zero2IPO Group. It estimates about 12,000 investment firms manage 8.5 trillion yuan in capital, an increase from 8,000 firms managing 5 trillion yuan in 2015.

Internet businesses rank as the top investment target in terms of amount of funding and numbers of deals.

This results in over-the-top valuations, intense competition for good startup targets and greater uncertainty for funders about whether or when their investments will pay off.

Mr. Su used to spend weeks and months researching companies and getting to know the founders. With founders now flush with offers, Mr. Su and his colleagues are under pressure to move much faster. In some instances, he says, he was negotiating with a startup in his office in Beijing while rival financiers waited downstairs in the building lobby with contracts in hand.

A few times, he and his partners had to decide whether to invest in a startup in three hours, he says. There was no time to do due diligence.

Three of the world's five most valuable startups are Chinese -- ride-hailing company Didi, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and lifestyle-services internet platform Meituan-Dianping, according to data-analytics firm CB Insights. At $68 billion, Uber Technologies Inc. still ranks No. 1. Airbnb Inc.'s No. 5 spot may soon be in jeopardy, with Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., the creator of newsfeed app Toutiao, raising a new round valuing the company at $30 billion.

Out of 221 unicorns in the world, 59 are in China, according to CB Insights. While that may lag behind the 127 from the U.S., it's ahead of the U.K.'s 12 and India's nine. Many Chinese investors want to invest in Silicon Valley because they think the valuations there are more reasonable.

The financing bonanza has also seen startups wage expensive subsidy wars as they try to grab market share before worrying about profits. Nothing exemplifies the trend as much as the bike-sharing apps. First praised for the convenience they brought, bike-sharing apps such as Ofo and Mobike are now scorned for clogging cities with millions of bikes.

As in the U.S., easy access to capital in China allows startups to stay private longer. For venture capitalists, that means their shares in those startups get diluted and returns dwindle with each successive funding round. By the time of an IPO, the returns can be much lower than initially expected.

Some of those putting money into startups seem to care little about direct returns and much less about a public listing.

Government agencies and local governments have announced 1,040 venture funds since 2015 aiming to raise about 8 trillion yuan, according to Zero2IPO. Much of the money is used to lure businesses to set up local offices, to help boost employment and tax revenues. Hubei province's 200 billion yuan fund is believed to the largest of its kind.

Tech giants Alibaba and Tencent are also investing heavily, to snap up new technologies, quash budding competition and expand core businesses, such as mobile payments. Tencent has invested in more than 600 companies, according to its President Martin Lau.

All this is leading some venture capitalists to use the B word. "The bubble is too big and the prices too high," said Liu Zhou, founding partner of Fortune Capital in Shenzhen, at a conference last week. "I'm worried the industry is overheated."

To Mr. Su, the situation is beginning to look like the internet bubble he saw in his early career. He expects some of the biggest Chinese tech startups to go public in 2019, with the risk that their shares might fetch lower prices than suggested by current valuations.

"I'm worried about what's going to happen in 18 months," says Mr. Su. "I feel it's going to be like from the end of 1997 to early 2000. I hope I'm wrong."

One thing to start: It's Fox-Disney deal day. Here's the FT'slatest infoandour latest analysis on what it means for the media industry. US readers, you should be expecting to wake up to a $60bn deal announcement.

Remember that time you decided to start accepting payments in bitcoin and everyone thought you were crazy? You still are. But if you'reOverstock.com, your stock has also soared in the wake of bitcoin mania. And if you're Overstock chiefPatrick Byrne, it's time to sell.

Byrne, a cryptocurrency enthusiast known to some as a visionary and to others for his, er,rather unconventional libertarian views, announced last month thatGuggenheim Partnerswas looking into options for the online retail business, which hawks everything from watches to discount furniture but is stuck in a painful fight for online market share. Byrne s family owns 40 per cent of Overstock, which now has a market value of more than $1.4bn.

 I don't want to run a 1 per centmargin business forever,  he said at the time. So why is he selling? Well, it seems he wants to fund a global land registry where informal titles are formalised on a blockchain database, a partnership with Peruvian economistHernando de Soto. They claim this is a workable solution for tackling poverty. Yolo.

This is not Byrne s first eyebrow-raising venture. Highlights include acrusade against short sellers, a news website of questionable journalistic credentials calledDeep Capture, and a$10m hoard of goldand silver as insurance against financial apocalypse. 

But perhaps not so coincidentally, the decision to sell comes at a time when Overstock is more valuable than ever.

Two factors seem to have boosted Overstock s 219 per cent share price rise this year. One is the bitcoin frenzy. Overstock has been accepting payments in cryptocurrencies since 2014, and ICYMI, those digital assets are worth a lot more now than they were in January.

The other is a rather strange reconciliation between Byrne andMarc Cohodes, a short seller who Byrne once sued but has now very loudly gone long Overstock. (Both men told the FT they first met in the gents during a trial but buried the hatchet in Utah this summer).

Byrne also claims that Overstock has already received an approach from a multibillion-dollar investment fund that does not  want to cede the earth toAmazon . He would not name the fund, but hinted that interest from Asia was especially strong. 

We re not quite sure what to make of Byrne, so we re just going to let him leave you with this quote:  I feel a great moral obligation to refocus my life around this.

Today in activism

PrimeStone, one of the latest additions to the roster of European activist funds, is launching one of its first public campaigns by acquiring more than 5 per cent stakes in US and Danish professional cleaning equipment suppliersTennantandNilfiskandis urging themto merge.

The Mayfair-based fund was launched in late 2014 by three formerCarlyleportfolio managers and targets mid-cap European companies, writes the FT'sLindsay Fortado. The founders, a French trio  Jean-Pierre Millet,Franck FalezanandBenoit Colas  have worked together for more than 15 years.Industry peers have expected the fund to thrive, but PrimeStone's efforts have mostly remained behind the scenes until now.

Elsewhere,Elliotthas released the report it commissioned fromUBSto support its assertion thatQualcomm sbid for NXP   agreed at $110 a share   undervalued the company. To no one's surprise, UBS found that the midpoint of the trading multiples valuation comes out to around $136.50 a share   even more than the $135 Elliott demanded earlier this week.

Qualcomm repeated its earlier statement   that the valuation for NXP  is unsupportable and clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda.

Truce betweenWestern Digital andToshiba and

After months of uncertainty, the cards appear to have firmly fallen in favour ofBain Capitaland its consortium's $18bn bid forToshiba's prized memory chip business.

The deal itself was signed months ago, but the largest remaining snag has always been an acrimonious legal dispute between Toshiba and its joint venture partner in the chip business,Western Digital.

That battle drew to a close this week.Here is the FT storyon the situation.

The dispute, over whether Western Digital was owed a say in the sale of the unit, had robust arguments on both sides, and carried the threat of a legal process that could stretch into years.

In reality, both sides   facing shareholder pressure and hard commercial deadlines   urgently needed the dispute to go away. The legal dispute had posed a serious risk to Western Digital, which was facing being frozen out of investing alongside Toshiba in next-generation flash memory production. That could have ended its supply agreements with Toshiba, starving the company of an important product line.

The truce was duly declared this week and all actions have been dropped, clearing the way for Japan's deal of the year.

Last year, for example, in the wake of a governance scandal at Lending Club, regulators such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation tightened the screws. In guidance put out last summer, the agency said it would assess banks  lending activities conducted through third-parties   such as buying loans from an online lender    as though the activities were performed by the institution itself. 

That meant platforms had to spend heavily to bring compliance and controls systems up to scratch. Lending Club s latestquarterly filing, for example, shows it had $1.21 of operating expenses for every dollar of fee income over the first nine months   up from $1.03 at the same point two years ago.

The biggest miscalculations, however, were in underwriting. Some operators boasted of sifting thousands of data points, on top of traditional assessments of creditworthiness such as a FICO score or a credit report, arguing that gave them better insights into the risk of default.

But models have consistently misfired, forcing near-constanttweaks and upgrades. Lending Club is on itsfifth iteration, G5,  our next-generation credit model and our most powerful risk differentiator yet , according to Scott Sanborn, the company s CEO. Prosper, which has originated about $10bn of loans since inception in 2006, is on number seven.

The result is that investors big and small have been nursing losses. Sean Murray, a New York-based publisher who writes the blog debanked.com, has been winding down his portfolio of 3,262 notes since May last year, hurt by consistently subpar returns. He says he is on course to generate a loss for 2017   which  seems even worse  when he considers that he could have got about 18 per cent in an S&P 500 index fund or more than 1,500 per cent in bitcoin.

Loan portfolios are best grown slowly, says Mr Senturia, who is now advising a handful of fintechs and specialty finance companies.

 The way to separate the wheat from the chaff with a high degree of certainty is to plant crops, wait to see what s left come harvest time, and adjust 	. 	. 	. 	for next season based on the results,  he writes in his memoir.

 By the time your portfolio is giving off smoke, there s likely a fire burning below.

Ability Network Inc., a health-care information technology company backed by Summit Partners and Bain Capital Ventures, said it closed a debt issuance totaling $545 million.

Proceeds will be used to replace existing debt "at lower rates and extended maturities, fund cash to the balance sheet for growth and pay a dividend to shareholders," according to a news release.

The Minneapolis company said the new debt financing helps return leverage ratios to "the same level as when" growth-equity firm Summit and Bain Capital Ventures invested in Ability in 2014.

Ability provides applications and analytics that help with revenue-cycle management, care-quality management and performance improvement through a cloud-based, software-as-a-service platform.

Jefferies Finance LLC, Macquarie Capital Inc. (USA) and Nomura Security International Inc., were joint lead arrangers and joint book runners for Ability. Ropes & Gray LLP provided legal counsel.

The venture-capital arm of Bain Capital and longtime backer Lemhi Ventures invested $27 million in Ability Network in 2011.

Boston firm Summit focuses on growth-equity, fixed-income and public-equity deals in industries such as health care and technology.

Andreessen Horowitz has raised a $450 million fund dedicated to investments at the intersection of biology and computer science.

This is the second designated bio fund from the firm, which raised a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120151119ebbjeexnm" in 2015 and hired former Stanford professor Vijay Pande as the general partner to head it. Mr. Pande was joined by Jorge Conde as the bio fund's second general partner in June of this year.

The new fund comes as more startups are operating in areas where life sciences and computer science overlap, Mr. Conde said.

"We see this as a very unique time as it exists in biology, where engineering is putting us on the precipice of radically transforming health care, food, economics and many other areas," Mr. Conde said.

The bio fund will focus broadly on three primary areas: computational medicine, where machine learning and artificial intelligence come into therapeutics; new utilities including diagnostic tools; and technology that enables researchers to read, write and execute biological processes, such as how Illumina Inc. was able to take biological understanding of DNA and translate it into genetic sequencing tools now widely in use.

Examples of this are already evident in existing portfolio companies from the first bio fund, Mr. Pande said, including diagnostic startup Freenome Inc. and agricultural-technology company Apeel Technologies Inc. He said the firm expects to make its first investment from the fund in early 2018, and will most likely write checks for large seed rounds and the occasional Series A and B.

"We really see the widening of the aperture in terms of investment opportunities," Mr. Pande said. "The great thing about the intersection of biology and computer science is that it's not just health care."

Swedish payments group given an extra  40m to help growth and product innovation

iZettle, one of Europe s fastest-growing companies, has raised an extra  40m in funding as the Swedish payments business prepares for a potential stock market listing next year.

Jacob de Geer, co-founder and chief executive, told the Financial Times that the equity would be used to take what he called iZettle s hyper growth mode and accelerate it even further .

He added: We are preparing so that we have all our ducks in a row to go for a listing some time in 2018. 

The latest investment bythe Fourth National Swedish Pension Fund (AP4), early-stage venture capital firm Dawn and some unspecified existing shareholders comes after previous rounds included MasterCard, American Express and Santander.

Mr de Geer declined to comment on what the company was now valued at amid reports it could be $950m, up from $500m two years ago. He said only it was more than in 2015 while dismissing rumours that iZettle was looking to sell itself.

He added: Valuation discussions are always tricky. The only people valuation matters to is investors. For us as a company, we don t really care. We are trying to access capital and the market tells you a price. 

iZettle is one of the top25fastest-growing businesses in Europe having expanded from its Nordic base into countries such as the UK, Mexico and Brazil. It first become known for its credit card readers that plug into smartphones or iPads and are used by everybody from dentists to homeless sellers of magazines.

But it has expanded away from having only payment solutions to offer small businesses a range of services including sales analytics, invoicing, and cash advances.

 We started off as a mobile payments solution. Now we have taken steps into a small business commerce platform. That has gone beyond expectations,  Mr de Geer said.

The payments industry has seen a wave of consolidation in recent months, headed by the 9bn acquisition of Worldpay by Vantiv. But Mr de Geer said that its payments business was a smaller niche, with iZettle s main rival, US group Square   founded by Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey   present in only one market where the Swedish company is: the UK.

iZettle said it would use its new funds for growth and product innovation. Mr de Geer said iZettle aimed at some sort of market leadership  in all countries it operates.

Mr de Geer founded iZettle in 2010 after his entrepreneur ex-wife could not accept credit card payments from potential customers at a trade fair. The company still loses money, according to its latest accounts from 2016, although losses were narrower than the previous year.

AQR ventures into machine learning

Capital markets Hedge fund experiments with artificial intelligence to trawl through 'big data'

The $208bn hedge fund group led by Clifford Asness has begun to explore how "big data" such as satellite imaging can help it manage money, a departure for the firm that has been sceptical of the field.

AQR is a "quantitative" investment group that uses academic research to find and systematically trade factors that have over time proven to beat the broader market, but has generally eschewed the purely computer-powered strategies of quant peers such as Renaissance Technologies or DE Shaw.

That is now shifting, with AQR running several experiments to see whether it can find profitable patterns in markets using machine learning to parse through novel data sets such as satellite pictures of shadows cast by oil wells and tankers, according to Mr Asness.

"We're feeling our way," Mr Asness said. "If our first few experiments bear fruit we'll do more of them. If we find out we're good at this it will become a bigger part of AQR."

Although so-called quants are often grouped together as a homogenous bunch of computer scientists, there are in reality different tribes and approaches. AQR has historically been more oriented around financial academia, and especially the swelling world of "factor investing".

In factor investing   which is increasingly implemented through so-called smart beta exchange traded funds   asset managers systematically take advantage of certain characteristics that have over time proven to provide market-beating returns.

These can range from big factors, such as cheaper stocks generally performing better over time, or more esoteric ones, such as the volatility risk premium investors can harvest by systematically exploiting the difference between actual and implied volatility.

But fundamentally, factor investors rely on market data and deep research rather than the increasingly trendy world of alternative data, which can range from credit card receipts, mobile phone location data to linguistic analysis of speeches or social media.

The alternative data industry has expanded dramatically, as many asset managers seek to improve their returns after a poor post-crisis period for many stockpickers. There are now more than 200 providers of esoteric, digital and market-relevant information, according to AlternativeData.org.

These data sets can be so large that they require artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning to parse, another term that has become lingua franca on Wall Street.

Indeed, Morgan Stanley noted that only 23 per cent of its quant clients say they are not considering using or already using machine learning, down from 44 per cent in 2016. But AI can be prone to finding dud signals as well, AQR's founder noted.

"In the factor investing world we worry a lot about finding spurious patterns by data mining. In big data combined with machine learning this is even more dangerous because the data sets are so big and machine learning is so good at finding patterns," Mr Asness said.

Despite AQR's early experimentations, Mr Asness remains sceptical about the hype surrounding the explosion of alternative data sources being used by investors.

"You have to fight the next war all the time," he said. "People doing this are probably occasionally finding good signals, but in a matter of months they are competed away."

Disaster Losses Close In On Record

Raging wildfires in Southern California could push the amount of insured losses from natural disasters this year to a record.

Insurers and reinsurers are already on track for one of the largest ever annual losses for the industry from natural catastrophes. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with two Mexican earthquakes, caused between $66 billion and $111 billion in damage, according to estimates from catastrophe-modeling firms. Wildfires in California in October caused $9.4 billion in insurance claims, the state insurance commissioner said last week.

Insurers have yet to estimate the scope of damage from the more recent fires in Southern California. The Thomas Fire in Ventura County had burned 230,500 acres as of Monday morning and was 15% contained, according to estimates by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. At that size, it is one of the five biggest wildfires in state history.

"My sense is most records are going to be broken" for insured catastrophe losses this year, said Cathy Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA Research.

Once the Southern California fires are factored in, total insured losses from natural disasters this year could reach a record $130 billion, Wells Fargo Securities LLC said Sunday. The global insurance and reinsurance industry's worst year was 2011, when companies paid out $126 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars following earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and floods in Thailand, according to Wells Fargo.

One of the reasons the California fires have been so devastating for insurance companies this year is that much of the damage was done to homes worth millions of dollars each. The average value of burned homes in Southern California is likely to be more than double the value of the Northern California homes that burned in October, said Tom Jeffery, senior hazard scientist at analytics firm CoreLogic.

Fire damage is covered by typical policies for homeowner and commercial-property insurance, meaning most of the economic losses from the California fires should be insured, Ms. Seifert said. In contrast, much of the hurricane damage this year wasn't insured because standard homeowner insurance doesn't cover flooding.

Portions of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties were evacuated due to the Southern California fires, which will add to the insurance toll. Homeowner insurance typically covers additional living expenses, and in some cases those expenses are covered if homeowners are ordered to evacuate but their homes aren't damaged.

The top two homeowner insurers in California by premium revenue are State Farm and Farmers Insurance, which account for almost 36% of the market, according to ratings firm A.M. Best.

State Farm had already received 1,050 homeowner claims and 160 auto claims stemming from the Southern California fires as of Sunday, a spokesman said. The insurer received 5,700 homeowner and auto claims from the October wildfires.

A Farmers spokesman said the insurer had received almost 1,000 claims as of Monday related to the Southern California fires from all lines of business and more than 4,000 claims from the October wildfires, mostly from homeowners and mobile-home residents.

Insurers could also face commercial liability claims if investigators find that any of the wildfires were sparked by power lines, transformers, or other equipment maintained by utility companies.

California fire officials and utility regulators are still investigating the cause of the Northern California wildfires in October, which killed more than 40 people. Several lawsuits already have been filed against PG&E Corp., parent of the state's largest investor-owned utility, in connection with the October fires.

PG&E Chief Executive Geisha Williams said in November that it was "simply too early to make an assumption about liability." In an October financial filing, the company said it had about $800 million in liability insurance to cover any potential losses resulting from the fires, but warned that losses beyond that amount could have a material effect.

The October wildfires destroyed or damaged more than 21,000 homes and 2,800 businesses, according to the state insurance commissioner. Residential property losses added up to $8.4 billion, or nearly 90% of the total insured loss, with commercial property, auto and other sectors accounting for the rest.

Technology will help Dutch bank s traders to gather better prices faster

Dutch lender ING has become the latest bank to embrace the trading room robot revolution with the introduction of technology that will help human traders to swiftly gather better bond prices.

The bank, which has won plaudits for its early adoption of fintech in retail banking, introduced its new artificial intelligence bond trading tool  Katana  on Tuesday morning.

Katana will use data from hundreds of thousands of trades to help the bank s traders to get better bond prices faster. In a six-month trial at ING s emerging markets desk, the AI tool led to faster pricing decisions for 90 per cent of trades, and cut trading costs by 25 per cent.

Katana is now being launched across ING s fixed income business; its users will sharply increase from a  handful  of emerging markets traders to about 100 fixed income traders across the lender.

Other banks including JPMorgan and UBS have already introduced AI on their trading floors.

Santiago Braje, global head of credit trading at ING Wholesale Bank, said ING s approach was unique because the AI empowers traders instead of replacing them.

 What we use Katana for is to improve the quality of the decisions 	. 	. 	. 	our traders make, it s a performance improvement tool,  he said, describing Katana s suggested price as something a trader  may or may not  follow.

Earlier this year, JPMorgan began using AI to execute trades in some equities businesses; UBS is using AI to handle post trade allocation and develop strategies for trading volatility.

Experts, including consultants at Accenture, have issued bleak warnings about AI s potential to put thousands of bank workers out of a job by performing their tasks faster and to a higher standard.

Frank Derks, head of ING s advanced analytics team, said ING s approach was about enabling workers and improving performance.  Further ahead in the future, it [AI] will probably have an impact on our workforce [numbers] 	. 	. 	. 	It s not a key focus for ING to go for that goal immediately. 

ING has 250 experts, including data scientists, advanced analytics and machine learning experts, working on AI and related projects across the bank.

In the case of Katana, the bank believes better and faster pricing will help it win more business.  These are highly competitive markets,  said Mr Braje.  Every price that we quote, we are competing with 10 people 	. 	. 	. 	We only win if we provide the best price. 

He added that Katana is an evolving platform and may ultimately provide quotes directly to clients instead of advising ING s traders. The bank also sees broader market potential for the platform created by a 10-strong team of ING developers.

 We are in fact already working with a major 	. 	. 	. 	asset manager in the Netherlands to develop a tool to tackle a completely different investment problem based on the same principles and on the same platform,  Mr Braje said.

New big data  trend tracks  digital footprints 

When Dutch financial services group APG tried to understand better why clients rang up its call centre, they noticed a small group taking up a lot of time: a high number of divorcees had been calling in the run-up to their legal separation, asking an expert to explain the intricacies of pension entitlements.

This was unwelcome news for APG: each call cost an average of  13 and it already had a website which it thought was tailored to clients, so calls were unnecessary.  We were trying to find out: why do people need to call three or four times, in some cases even more?  says Rachid El Hasnaoui, a business intelligence specialist at APG.

The solution, he says, was to employ  process mining , an emerging field in big data analytics that is helping some of the world s biggest companies   including GM, Airbus, KPMG and UBS   to automate tasks and adapt to the digitisation of industry.

Early adopters say the concept will eventually be as common as terms such as Industry 4.0 and predictive maintenance. The idea is to gather all of a company s internal decisions, from invoicing to logistics, and then visualise them as  digital footprints . Process mining maps these images into flowcharts that can be filtered and reworked, offering an overall view of what steps are taken following any decision. It works in real time or by looking backwards.

 It s a brand new science   five years ago nobody talked about process mining. These kind of capabilities did not exist,  says Israel Expsito-Peraza, who oversees an eight-member big data group at telecoms group Vodafone.

APG used process mining to aggregate data from their clients  search terms, emails and phone calls, then sequenced them to create a  customer journey . It could then detect patterns and personalise its website, making future calls from clients in a similar position unnecessary. It was one thing to gear the site toward the needs of a 25-year old or someone nearing retirement, but quite another to suit a client with a failing marriage.

 Before we could only see part of the picture, and we didn t know the context,  says Mr El Hasnaoui.  We can [now] see the whole flow of the customer journey, the whole lifecycle 	. 	. 	. 	if the customer is getting married, getting divorced, we can even look at if the customer is getting worried. Those things have an impact on how we can be help the customer make the right choice. 

The concept of process mining emerged out of Dutch academia and has been put into practice by a few start-ups, including Celonis, a Munich-based software company founded in 2011 by three graduates of the Technical University of Munich. The trio now oversee 250 employees, up from 70 last December, with offices in Munich, the Netherlands and New York.

Bastian Nominacher, co-chief executive and co-founder, can sound a bit dreamy as he describes how process mining is  universally applicable  for more than 300,000 companies across the world. He estimates the global process mining market today at about  150m. But he reckons that by 2025 it will reach  at least a similar size as the business intelligence market , which last year had revenue of  15bn.

Celonis says it has already acquired more than 350 clients across 15 industries   including Swedish robotics company ABB, railway operator Deutsche Bahn and consultancy Deloitte   and it has partnered with SAP, Europe s largest software company, to offer process mining within a broader package of enterprise solutions.  There is no difference if you apply this is in Japan or the US,  Mr Nominacher says.  There are always the same challenges, always the same benefits. 

Lars Reinkemeyer, head of global process mining services at Siemens, says 4,000 employees are using Celonis to translate big data, which he describes as a lake of raw, undifferentiated files, into  smart data    defined sequences for business processes, deliveries and customer orders. The visualisation allows Siemens to contrast best practices with loopholes and bottlenecks that can be improved.

As far as Mr Reinkemeyer knows, he is the only person anywhere to hold his job title. But he thinks that will not be true for long as more companies see the value in automating tasks. He describes process mining as giving Siemens X-ray images of its internal operations, making it easier to spot inefficiencies.

Users say discovering such anomalies usually requires an expensive team of consultants to diagnose them and recommend solutions. But in this case it is the consultants themselves whose jobs may be at risk, as teams of data engineers are now doing their own prognoses.

 We are actually being our own consultants,  says Vodafone s Mr Expsito-Peraza.  A consultant can watch this and that and make recommendations. But once the report is done he says goodbye. Our team is finding the problem, finding solutions and driving the transformation. 

Vodafone, which has been using Celonis since 2015, says process mining has helped reduce costs per purchase order by 11 per cent and improved time to market by a fifth. Process mining has allowed Vodafone s completion rate of  perfect deals    internal orders done without any manual rework   to improve from 73 per cent to 92 per cent in two years.

For some clients, optimising internal processes is not just something that helps its business   it is the business.  We won t be inventing a new iPhone tomorrow,  says Thomas Reichmann, manager of logistics at Schukat, a family-run supplier of electronics in Germany s Mittelstand (its small and medium-sized enterprise sector).  As a wholesaler our processes are ultimately all that we have. 

The bulk of work at Celonis is building software to visualise and automate internal processes, supply chains and back-office management. Mr Nominacher says it is now moving into the more glamorous internet-of-things arena, enabling companies to track, say, a robot that picks up and distributes packages in a warehouse.

The group says it has been profitable since its first year, but to expand operations it has received funding from Accel, an early stage investor in Facebook and Dropbox, and 83North, an Israeli venture capital firm. Last year it raised $27.5m, a big amount for a Series A funding round. Mr Nominacher says he hopes Celonis will be Germany s next  unicorn  and will have an IPO at a valuation above  1bn in 2020.

Santiago Braje, global head of credit trading at ING Wholesale Bank, said ING's approach was unique because the AI empowers traders instead of replacing them.

"What we use Katana for is to improve the quality of the decisions ... our traders make, it's a performance improvement tool," he said, describing the price Katana suggests as something a trader "may or may not" follow.

Earlier this year JPMorgan began using AI to execute trades in some equities businesses; UBS is using AI to handle post trade allocation and develop strategies for trading volatility.

Experts, including consultants at Accenture, have issued bleak warnings about AI's potential to put thousands of bank workers out of a job by performing their tasks faster and to a higher standard.

Innovative Individuals From upstarts to long-time leaders, the standout legal sector trailblazers

The10finalists for the2017 legal innovator awardforNorthAmericawerevery strong, but the judges eventuallyconcentratedonthree very different entries.

TheywereimpressedbyChristopher Bogart, chiefexecutive of Burford Capital,andhis role in thedevelopmentof litigation finance.While this is a fast-developing field, they recognised the pioneering part thatMrBogarthadplayed.

Thesecond finalist the judges focusedonwas JoshuaBrowder believedtobe the first student tomakeourlegal innovator shortlists. Basedat StanfordUniversity,wherehe is studyingcomputerscience, the British-bornMr Browderhas receivedanimpressiveamountof funding for hisDoNotPayapplication,which has savedmotorists millions in parking fines.

Theultimatewinner,however,wasStephen Manning, legal director of theInnovationLaw Lab. Hisworkin creating a large probono networkto defend refugees in theUSwas impressive, butwhatswungthe judgeswere the technologyanddata analyticsbehindthe project.

Michael Skapinker, Chair of judges Stephen Manning Legal director, Innovation Law Lab Stephen Manning draws his inspiration from two places: "The refugee and the US constitution."

His work on improving access to representation for refugees and immigrants at risk of deportation has helped create one of the largest pro bono networks in the US.

The Innovation Law Lab, based in Portland, Oregon, has built a platform that uses data analytics and intelligent project management tools to determine where lawyers can win immigration and refugee cases.

Its highly repeatable processes can be employed by lawyers and volunteers in defending vulnerable people held at detention centres across the US.

Called Massive Collaborative Representation, the results have been dramatic. In 2016, the project advocated the release from detention of over 30,000 women and children, representing a 99 per cent success rate. In 2014, by comparison, nearly all women and children who had been held in detention centres were deported, he says.

Mr Manning has also helped foster wider collaboration between lawyers and activists in the US, resulting in a range of projects that are dedicated to providing legal support to detainees in all areas of the country.

This unpaid work is supported through an online platform that brings together immigrant and refugee resources in one place and helps link immigrants' rights attorneys, policy analysts and other volunteers.

In many forums, defence lawyers are treated as though they are "getting in the way" of convictions and deportations, he says. "A corporate merger without lawyers? Unthinkable. A deportation without lawyers? Happens every day."

John Bautista Partner, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe John Bautista is one of the most influential lawyers in the technology ecosystem of Silicon Valley. Over the past three years, he has advised on more than 165 deals, including General Motors' $1bnplus acquisition of Cruise Automation, a driverless vehicle start-up.

More broadly, Mr Bautista has had a big impact on the financing and corporate structuring of start-ups. He collaborated with Y Combinator, a leading accelerator for young businesses, on its Simple Agreement for Future Equity (Safe), an alternative to convertible notes for seed fundraising. He has played a strong role in the founding of innovative companies such as Clerky, which simplifies the legal and administrative burdens for start-ups.

A long-term adviser to Stripe, the online payments company, Mr Bautista was instrumental in forming Stripe Atlas, a collaboration between his client and Orrick that helps smaller companies across the world with their corporate legal processes. Along with Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, Mr Bautista last year founded the Long-Term Stock Exchange for tech companies, to encourage long-term investing in them.

Joshua Browder Student, Stanford University; chief executive and founder, DoNotPay Aged just 20, Joshua Browder has disrupted the legal industry even though he is not a lawyer. The computer science student created the DoNotPay "chatbot", which has saved thousands of motorists a total of $13m in parking fines. Mr Browder is expanding the service to legal fees for couples in no-fault divorces.

Mr Browder has also created a bot to help people affected by the Equifax data breach to lodge complaints against the credit-scoring company. His mission is to remove layers of unnecessary but expensive lawyers so that consumers can access justice for free. He says: "People may say I have created robot lawyers but I say that my products empower consumers." He cites the inspiration of his father, financierturned-human-rights campaigner Bill Browder, for "risking his life standing up against Russian torturers and murderers which is a lot harder than fighting parking ticket bureaucrats".

DoNotPay has received $1.1m of funding from Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and hired its first employee. Other funders include Greylock Capital and Highland Capital.

John Rosenthal Partner and chair of ediscovery and information governance practice, Winston & Strawn John Rosenthal is a seasoned litigator with almost 30 years of experience who has been, by his own admission, "perhaps by accident, hard work or luck", at the forefront of electronic discovery in the US.

He has worked with a wide range of groups that have helped shape the rules and best practice that surround ediscovery.

As chair of Winston & Strawn's ediscovery and information governance practice, he frequently writes and lectures on this subject as well as the fields of privacy and data breaches.

He acts as ediscovery counsel for a range of companies. More broadly, his practice also involves advising clients on a variety of trade regulation, trademark and commercial issues.

Mr Rosenthal's commitment to new technology has been apparent since early in his career, when he was in a team that was one of the first to use video to cross-examine witnesses. He argues that "to advance as a profession, as a law firm, or as a person, one needs to embrace innovation or be run over by it like a truck".

Christopher Bogart Co-founder and chief executive, Burford Capital When Christopher Bogart co-founded Burford Capital in 2009, litigation finance was largely unknown. Eight years later, that has changed dramatically.

Mr Bogart has built Burford Capital into a force in the global legal market as a publicly traded company with a market capitalisation of $3bn-plus.

One recent investment, backing the bankruptcy trustees of Magnesium Corporation of America (MagCorp), netted the firm a significant return (see Collaboration ranking in this report). Its innovation was to develop a way to help bankrupt companies hedge against appeals to their winning settlements. Litigation finance has become a driver of legal innovation, by blending the legal and financial disciplines of litigation to develop expertise in "understanding the ever-changing economics of high-stakes commercial litigation", Mr Bogart says.

The legal sector is ripe for disruption because it is an industry that does not generally use external capital, he says. "We are dragging it into a new world. .. in order to allow law firms to meet client demand for wholesale change in how legal services are provided and financed."

John Fernandez Partner and US chief innovation officer, Dentons One of John Fernandez's central roles at Dentons is as chair of Nextlaw Labs, a venture designed to bring new products and services to market, whether through direct investments in existing companies or by building its own services.

Nextlaw Labs has a portfolio of interests in 10 technology companies that aim to disrupt the provision of legal services. One example of this is the Nextlaw global referral network. The platform connects 450 law firms that together have 25,000 lawyers in 180 countries. The network is free for firms to join, provided they meet certain criteria. It promotes reciprocal referrals among members, and clients benefit from access to a vetted global network of lawyers.

Before Mr Fernandez became Dentons' US chief innovation officer, he had two stints in public life. He was mayor of Bloomington in Indiana from 1996 to 2003. He also served at the US Department of Commerce between 2009 and 2012, working on the revival of economically distressed regions, after being appointed as assistant secretary of commerce for economic development by President Barack Obama.

LeeAnn Black Chief operating officer, Latham & Watkins When LeeAnn Black took on her role as chief operating officer at Latham & Watkins in 1999, the idea of innovation in legal services was a novelty. Even the concept of a COO at a law firm was rare and Ms Black was one of the first professional managers in the legal sector.

Since then, the scope of her role has evolved and expanded. Today, she is responsible for critical functions in her firm's success, covering infrastructure, developing talent and service delivery. "Earning a seat at the table" of the firm's executive committee has been critical in the execution of these tasks, Ms Black says.

During her period as COO, Latham & Watkins has grown into one of the largest law firms in the world, with practices in 14 countries. Maintaining cultural consistency across the firm, as well as building an integrated and scalable infrastructure, has been critical to fostering this growth. Latham has built an industry-leading legal IT platform, she argues. "As a result of the firm's size and reputation, vendors often seek to collaborate with Latham to help refine their products."

Andrew Smulian Chairman and chief executive, Akerman Challenging traditional norms has helped Andrew Smulian succeed in expanding his Florida-based firm to a national enterprise with more than 700 lawyers and business professionals.

Mr Smulian joined Akerman's Miami office in 1995 and became the firm's chief executive in 2008. During his tenure he has been committed to anticipating and embracing change. Four years ago he backed Law 2023, an investigation designed to predict the shape of legal practice in the coming decade and provide a "set of guidelines for law firms seeking to thrive" from disruptive change.

Mr Smulian then established a research and development unit at the firm. Claimed as an industry first, it is aimed at mimicking the role of business incubators and accelerators in other fields.

More recently, Akerman has launched its Data Law Center, a service that advises clients on data privacy and security laws across jurisdictions  a burden that is increasing rapidly, along with the proliferation of corporate data and threats of data breaches. The advance of big data, Mr Smulian says, "is now influencing the way all lawyers practise law".

SethWaxman Partner and co-chair of appellate and Supreme Court litigation practice, WilmerHale When Seth Waxman began to practise law in 1978, he pledged to spend 20 per cent of his professional time on pro bono work.

In his first year, he volunteered to represent an inmate on death row in the US state of Georgia. In the case, he challenged the constitutionality of the inmate's trial. Mr Waxman's experience led eventually to the formation of the American Bar Association's post-conviction death penalty representation project in 1986, under the leadership of Sara-Ann Determan. In 2016, he won a significant case contesting a death sentence in Hurst v Florida. The Supreme Court set aside the planned execution of Timothy Lee Hurst by finding that Florida's death penalty statute violated the requirement that a jury, rather than a judge, must determine the death penalty. The outcome forced the Florida legislature to amend its law on the death penalty immediately. Juries in the state must now vote unanimously in favour of execution   a policy that could affect other states with similar statutes. Mr Waxman served as the US solicitor general between 1997 and 2001 before returning to private practice.

Nicholas Groombridge Partner and patent litigation chair at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison Nicholas Groombridge has emerged as a favoured lawyer for many companies involved in patent suits. In particular, he has won several cases in the field of biopharmaceuticals, where laws related to patent protection are evolving to cover the emergence of "biosimilar" products and areas of development such as "personalised" or "genomic" medicine.

"Our practice group deliberately sought out clients and cases that we believed would be in the forefront of the biosimilar field," says Mr Groombridge. As a result, he has been at the centre of seven of the eight appellate cases that have made law for the development of biosimilar products.

Though Mr Groombridge has handled many of the highest-stakes cases in the biopharmaceutical sector, he has a consensual approach, designed to avoid unnecessary expense to clients involved in litigation. He seeks to meet opposing counsel before a matter begins, to reduce wasteful confrontation during the case. He estimates such an approach can save a client $200,000-$400,000 over the course of a dispute.

 Artificial intelligence  is guiding venture capital to start-ups

One of the biggest challenges for venture capital companies is finding interesting investment targets before anyone else. It is often a laborious, travel-intensive job. But machine learning and predictive analytics are starting to transform how an investor puts a portfolio together.

 My job used to be about getting on a plane once a week and going to a different European city to try to find people who were doing interesting things,  says Roberto Bonanzinga, co-founder of InReach Ventures and previously a partner at Balderton Capital, a UK-based VC firm which invests primarily in early-stage European technology companies.

It was inefficient, he says.  I would look at 50 companies a day, maybe 1,500 a month, and of those maybe 100 would get to the next level. We would do one deal a month. 

Often, Mr Bonanzinga adds, promising companies would fall under the radar because they were not actively looking for money. Unless start-up founders were well connected, or in a tech hub such as London or Silicon Valley, investors would have little chance of discovering them.

Mr Bonanzinga thought he could combine internet data and machine learning to do a better job of ferreting out prospects. It took two years and 5m in investment for InReach Ventures to create the software, which has so far trawled through 95,000 European start-ups, picking out 2,000 that Mr Bonanzinga might be interested in.

The software determines this based on the people they are hiring, the products they are developing and the traffic on their website, among other things. For example, InReach identified Oberlo, a Lithuanian start-up, as an investment target because it was advertising for engineers to solve a particular type of ecommerce problem.  We did a deal before any other VC firm in Europe even knew they existed,  Mr Bonanzinga says.

 What used to be a handcrafted job has become significantly scalable,  Mr Bonanzinga says.  You become 10 times more productive.  InReach Ventures has invested in seven companies so far, and while it is still too early to say how well the portfolio will perform, Mr Bonanzinga has already had one exit, selling Oberlo to Shopify, a Canadian ecommerce company, just 12 months after investing.

SignalFire, based in San Francisco, was one of the first VC companies to move to this kind of data-driven model. Founder Chris Farmer started applying data to venture capital around 2007, at a previous company, using basic algorithms to track factors such as how well products were performing in Apple s App Store. He grew interested in building a more complex system that could track companies in a more comprehensive way and thus founded SignalFire in 2013.

It took eight years and tens of millions of dollars to build what Mr Farmer calls a  mini-Google . The software now tracks 8m start-ups across the world, drawing on sources from sales data to academic publications to financial filings. Companies that are outperforming or doing something notable are flagged up on a dashboard. SignalFire can then deploy some of its $375m under management.

Ten years ago, Mr Farmer says, the project would have been impossible.  These kinds of data storage and processing capabilities weren t available. We needed the kind of computer power and storage that was only available in the bigger consumer internet companies. 

Now, however, even smaller companies can crunch data at a large scale, thanks to database tools such as Hadoop and Apache Spark, and the possibility of renting cheap server capacity from Amazon Web Services.

Like Mr Bonanzinga, Mr Farmer says the system is helping him discover companies he would not have seen before.  There is a broader geographic scope to where our portfolio companies come from. We backed a company from Romania that we never would have seen otherwise. We ve passed on some very well-connected founders and we have gone with some first-time founders. It doesn t entirely eliminate bias but it does make it more of a meritocracy. It makes you take a second look,  he says. It is still too early to judge how well the portfolio will perform, however.

Aaron Joyce, co-founder of Aibl Tech, a Stockholm-based start-up, has benefited from the data-driven approach. Aibl, which helps companies analyse customer data, was discovered by Mr Bonanzinga only a few months after it had been started.

 We had started approaching a few local investors for funding, but we were not having much luck getting through, just talking to the junior guys. Then Roberto [Bonanzinga] emailed us. I was suspicious at the beginning, here was this partner contacting me. I would never have thought we had a chance of raising money with someone of his calibre,  says Mr Joyce.  It is a much more meritocratic way of investing. It s not who you know or where you went to school. 

Andreas Thorstensson, partner at Stockholm-based EQT Ventures, says around 30 per cent of his investment decisions now come through a data-analysis platform he has built, called Motherbrain, which monitors around 2m companies on a daily basis. Mr Thorstensson says he regularly passes on investing the kinds of entrepreneurs that might typically have got funding before.  The data doesn t lie,  he says.

As well as giving opportunities to a different set of start-ups, machine learning is likely to change the structure of the VC industry. SignalFire is built like a tech firm   data scientists and engineers are vital to the business and own shares in the company.  We don t treat them like the IT department. They are the heart of the business,  Mr Farmer says.

Mr Bonanzinga, meanwhile, is the only investment partner at InReach, which has software and a team of data scientists doing the work that would have been done by an army of associates at a traditional VC firm.

The cost of running and maintaining the data platforms is considerable. Mr Farmer says he spends over $10m a year, while Mr Bonanzinga plans to spend at least 1m annually.  It will change how venture capital firms spend their fees. Traditionally most of it went on salaries. In the future it will go to data and computer scientists and into buying in good data sources,  says Mr Bonanzinga.

EQT Venture s Mr Thorstensson says, however, that he does not believe machines will significantly decrease jobs across the industry.  It will enable us to spend more quality time with the companies we are investing in, instead of going to general events and doing the tedious jobs,  he says.  AI is good for filtering out the noise, but the decision to invest or not will always be about instinct at the end.

The Future Is Bumpy: High-Tech Hedge Fund Hits Limits of Robot Stock Picking; Voleon is among investors deploying machine learning , a technology in which computers develop trading strategies. It's harder than it sounds.

BERKELEY, Calif. For Michael Kharitonov, building a hedge fund based on machine learning has been a rule of threes: It was three times as hard, and it took three times as long, as anticipated.

"Most of the things we've tried have failed," said the co-founder of a little-known firm called Voleon Group.

Machine learning, a set of techniques that empowers computers to find patterns in data without using rules prescribed by humans, has been producing advances in a range of fields, from robotics to weather forecasting to language translation. The technique is at the heart of efforts to build self-driving cars.

Why not use it to crack financial markets? The notion has led to an arms race of sorts, as multibillion-dollar investment firms that already were mathematically focused have been signing up the smartest computer scientists and statisticians they can find.

The gambit seems to be working for two of this year's top-performing hedge funds. Quantitative Investment Management LLC, up 68% this year in its biggest fund, attributes its success to the technique. Teza Capital Management LLC credits machine learning in part for its more than 50% gain so far this year.

Yet instances of parlaying machine learning into investing success over a sustained period are rare. Much of the reason can been seen in the yearslong struggle of Voleon, one of the first investment firms to commit itself fully to the kind of machine learning that is producing many advances in other fields.

One early lesson: Those other advances might not apply to trading, a messier environment where patterns are often muffled. "The idea that we could just take the machine-learning techniques in speech recognition and computer vision to generate better forecasts just didn't work," said Mr. Kharitonov, a curly-haired computer scientist who immigrated from Russia with his family when he was 18. "That was our initial idea."

Mr. Kharitonov, 54 years old, and co-founder Jon McAuliffe, 43, have Ph.D.s. in computer science and statistics, respectively. Both went into finance and became researchers at D.E. Shaw Group, one of the oldest and most successful "quant" hedge funds. Mr. Kharitonov at one point reported to a young Jeff Bezos, before his boss left to found Amazon.com.

For several years, Messrs. Kharitonov and McAuliffe believed the tools of machine learning, which both had studied, were too crude to use in investing. The methodology was sound, but computers weren't fast enough and there weren't enough large data sets to comb.

In contrast to the more common case where a scientist has a hypothesis and writes an algorithm for a computer to carry out, in machine learning a person seeds the computer with vast quantities of data and asks it to figure out patterns all by itself.

The computer, in effect, writes its own algorithm, and uses it to make predictions. How it came up with these, it doesn't say.

By 2007, new data sets and more-powerful computers had persuaded Mr. Kharitonov, who is known as Misha, and Mr. McAuliffe to start their own firm devoted to investing via machine learning. They formed Voleon, picking the name, which has no particular meaning, because the domain for the website was available to register.

Raising money, they faced deeply skeptical institutional investors. Big quant firms can explain fairly well what their algorithms are doing, having built them. In machine learning, only the computer knows why it did what it did.

The inherent mystery of the approach, where computers detect patterns too subtle for humans to easily comprehend, gave the Voleon principals little hope of being able to explain to potential investors why their firm would buy or sell a stock.

"A lot of people simply weren't interested," said Mr. Kharitonov. "But we found a few who understood the potential of machine learning."

Live trading began in fall 2008, the depths of the financial crisis. For the following two full years, the firm lost money, despite the U.S. stock market's gradual recovery from its low in March 2009. The Voleon founders plowed ahead, believing they were tackling one of machine learning's hardest problems and it would take time to hone their system enough to earn profits.

The basic problem they faced was that markets are so chaotic. Machine-learning systems have been best applied so far to situations where patterns are more of a repeating nature, and thus easier to discern, such as in playing the ancient game of Go or even guiding a driverless car. The financial markets are "noisier" continually being affected by new events, the relationships among which are frequently shifting.

The protean nature of the markets also means yesterday's relationships can vanish as investors figure them out and move to take advantage of them. This isn't a problem faced by machine learning in other fields, such as converting human speech to text; computer engineers can count on human speech continuing to have the same basic characteristics.

Even though the success of machine learning in other fields was partly what persuaded them to try it in investing, by late 2011 the Voleon founders had thrown out most of the techniques from other applications. Replacing them was the founders' own, custom-designed system for the unruly markets.

Books with titles such as "Elements of Large-Sample Theory" and "BDA3" lined the bookshelves in the tidy office of Mr. McAuliffe on a recent visit. Mr. Kharitonov's office sported a circuit board he had taken apart and a jumble of boxes overflowing with papers.

One challenge the two faced was the need to run 15-year simulations of the stock market using every "tick" of the price of every share. This involved terabytes of data. Voleon needed to run the simulations in hours, but they were taking days and weeks.

At the time, the whole company was around 10 or 12 people. The team tried buying more computing power and using special chips built for computer gaming known as graphics processing units, or GPUs. But it still took too long.

Mr. McAuliffe spent months alone in his office working the problem through in a painstaking process, focusing on intricate details. Finally he cracked it, and Voleon was able to launch a second-generation platform in July 2012.

"The brute-force approach didn't work," Mr. Kharitonov said. "The standard techniques didn't work."

Their new trading system brought in much better profits, and more investor interest. After modest 2011 returns in its flagship fund, Voleon notched gains of 34.9% in 2012 and 46.3% in 2013, according to an investor.

Still, following two more up years, Voleon suffered a loss of more than 9% in 2016, prompting concern among some of its investors.

"Nothing focuses your mind like a drawdown," Mr. Kharitonov said, referring to the loss. "We learned a lot from last year."

This year has been better. The firm, which has about $1.8 billion under management, was up about 4.5% through October in its flagship fund, one investor said. Its annualized return since inception is about 10.5%.

The firm's uneven results, complicated strategy and Mr. Kharitonov's habit of occasionally pausing client meetings to hold phone conversations in Russian haven't stopped Voleon from growing. It is broadening its investing target beyond U.S. and European stocks and has expanded into another building near the University of California, Berkeley, campus.

Some investment firms that have tried machine learning use it only for limited tasks, among them AQR Capital Management LLC, which is experimenting with the technique to find the optimal time to roll over futures contracts. Voleon not only is fully focused on machine learning  trading more than $1 billion worth of stocks a day using the technique  but stands out for its complete lack of interest in the reason its system buys one stock and sells another.

The more predictive a machine-learning system is, the more difficult it is for people to comprehend what it is up to, according to Mr. Kharitonov. "You can have maximum explainability or maximum predictive power," he said, paraphrasing the late Berkeley statistician Leo Breiman.

At the root of this, mathematicians say, is that the human mind is set up to understand scenarios with about three dimensions, while dozens or hundreds are within the grasp of machine-learning systems. Their power comes in discovering connections, often nonlinear, among those dimensions.

This "doesn't mean we don't think about what's going on," Mr. McAuliffe said. Voleon researchers sometimes design what they call "perturbations" to study the importance of various inputs into the prediction system.

This testing also helps them figure out whether, in certain cases, it might be too tuned to historical data to be useful for forecasts. In statistics, this is known as the problem of "overfitting."

Voleon's computers look for relationships in not just financial information but also nonfinancial data sets. Broadly, these could include anything from analyses of satellite images and shipping manifests to credit-card receipts and social-media sentiment about particular companies. Successfully analyzing such data is a goal of quants and non-quants alike as they look for a heads-up about changes in the health of an industry or the supply of a commodity.

The Voleon principals won't reveal what data they feed into their system, to say nothing of how they have trained it to assess the data. Like other quant firms, Voleon guards its techniques and strategies. Frosted glass on its quarters provides privacy. No sign on the property identifies the firm.

Investors uncomfortable with the mystery of it all have "self-selected" out of the firm, Mr. Kharitonov said. While he understands their discomfort, he believes computers make fewer mistakes than people.

"The application of machine learning science to financial prediction is still in its early stage," he said. "We are just scratching the surface."

Apax's $1 Billion Fund Joins Digital Chase

As firms dash to carve out a niche in the hot technology space, many have raised capital for technology-dedicated funds with varying mandates.

Last week, globally minded player Apax Partners threw its hat in the ring to invest in growth-stage technology companies. The firm "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apax-secures-1-billion-for-growth-stage-technology-deals-1512587608" for its new fund, Apax Digital, surpassing a goal of $800 million.

The vehicle is targeting subsectors which include vertical software, data and analytics, technology-enabled services, marketplaces, digital media and e-commerce.

The new tech strategy is a far cry from the large buyouts typically made by London-based Apax.

Marcelo Gigliani, a managing partner and co-leader of Apax Digital, said the decision to invest in the category has been years in the making. He said since Apax's inception some four decades ago, "tech has been the power alley," and in its early days, most of the tech deals Apax made were in growth-stage businesses.

Apax isn't alone in growth investing. Other firms have zeroed in on different subsectors of investment and size. KKR & Co. collected money for its KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund, which focuses specifically on technology, media and telecommunications companies. Other buyout firms sporting tech growth funds include Thoma Bravo, whose Discovery fund backs application, infrastructure and security software businesses as well as technology-enabled business services companies; and CVC Capital Partners, which backs software and technology businesses in North America and Europe.

Mr. Gigliani said competition on the tech front from rival buyout firms is nothing new, adding the firm is banking on differentiating itself through its global platform, its operating team of technologists working alongside the companies and the firm's expertise, having deployed $9 billion of equity in tech companies over the years.

Mr. Gigliani said another distinct factor is that Apax can either do growth buyouts or minority investments in companies, depending on the situation.

"Tech expertise is core to our DNA," said Mr. Gigliani.

He added the fund is likely to be home to 15 or 16 companies, and that Apax will consider investments in targets with revenue of $30 million to $100 million. The firm will make equity investments of $30 million to $150 million per business.

It is no secret that multiples in the software space are high, and that sometimes getting in on the ground floor or through a growth-stage investment can be less competitive and may, in some cases, lead to higher returns. However, with a number of growth tech-based funds coming to fruition over the past few years, proof of concept is still unclear.

Time will tell just how well growth technology funds will perform in the coming years as the timeline for exits nears. One thing is for sure: Firms want to be part of the hot tech sector and through as many different strategies as possible.

Derby's Take: Bitcoin May Be Sexy, But Cash Is Still Where It's At

Bitcoin May Be Sexy, But Cash Is Still Where It's At

The stratospheric rise in bitcoin's price over recent weeks obscures a mundane reality: In the real world of paying for goods and services, Americans are still quite wedded to cash.

A San Francisco Fed report on consumer payments last month shows a broad swath of Americans of all income levels and ages still use cash to buy things rather than credit and debit cards and newfangled services like Apple Pay.

Paper money and coins remain U.S. consumers' favorite payment method, accounting for just under one third of all their transactions, the report said. The report also said cash is widely held and used, regardless of race or income.

Cash dominates small-value transactions: 60% of in-person payments under $10 were made in cash. Debit and credit cards dominate payments between $25 and $100, with checks and other electronic payments coming into play for larger transactions.

"Since the majority of all consumer payments are for less than $25, cash is overall the most frequently used instrument," the bank said.

Whether cash will remain king in the future is an open question, however.

A continued preference for cash is of course driven by habit and ease. There are few merchants that won't take paper money, and there remain plenty of places where electronic payments require a minimum payment. In the U.S., phone-based payment systems are in their infancy. Bitcoin, the privately created digital currency, may be a speculator's dream wrapped up in libertarian idealism, but try buying a can of soda with it right now.

This seeming anachronistic environment will likely give way at some point. Apple's pushing its payment system and is trying to enable its customers to shift cash directly to one another. Other companies like Venmo are already doing this, and other Silicon Valley firms are looking to apply modern tech to payments and finance. Once ubiquitous, checks are dying a slow death amid the rise of other payment methods.

More broadly, the Fed is itself looking at ways it might offer its own digital money to speed up and reduce the cost of electronic payments. An official digital dollar could finally put a real crimp in cash usage if it is easy to use and has something like the privacy protections inherent in cash.

Key Developments Around the World

As the Fed Deliberates, Amazon Is Making Its Job More Difficult

By Harriet Torry and Laura Stevens

Holiday shoppers with smartphones can retrieve instant price comparisons that make bargain hunting easier and the Federal Reserve's job tougher.

Web-driven comparison shopping complicates Fed decisions on how much and how fast to raise interest rates. Consumer knowledge is keeping a lid on prices that retailers can charge on a wealth of goods, a small but growing factor holding down inflation in the U.S., Japan and other advanced economies

The Fed is likely to announce Wednesday the raising of its benchmark short-term rate by a quarter percentage point, to a still-low range of 1.25% to 1.50%. Officials also will release their latest projections for the likely path of rates in the years ahead, which will influence mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans, business borrowing and global financial markets.

Fed officials, along with central bankers in Europe and Japan, want inflation to rise to an annual rate of around 2%, considered a healthy level for spending, business investment and higher wages. With the U.S. economy expanding and showing very low unemployment, an interest-rate increase would help forestall asset bubbles or other financial dangers.

Most Fed policy makers agree they should keep gradually raising short-term rates in the months ahead to prevent the buoyant U.S. economy from overheating. But some are hesitant because inflation remains puzzlingly weak, running below 2% for most of this year. Moving too quickly could stall growth.

Persistently weak inflation has stumped Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues. Some Fed officials have argued for holding rates low a bit longer to give inflation a nudge. Most, though, want to raise them.

Economists attribute feeble inflation across developed economies to several causes, including aging populations, slow productivity growth and globalization, which have reined in the ability of companies to raise prices and wages. With consumer spending accounting for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, the explosion in e-commerce has been added the list.

Stacy Peterson, 34 years old, of North Little Rock, Ark. said she started her holiday shopping in October, researching and comparing prices online. On Thanksgiving Day, she sprang for a trampoline she had been eyeing. It was marked down online at Academy Sports + Outdoors to $129.99 from $179.99.

The mother of two plans to check the holiday sales at her local stores, she said, but mostly will look online and buy from "whoever has it cheapest."

In a nod to the growing practice, Ms. Yellen said in September that increased competition created by online retailers "may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise prices in response to rising demand." She said in October that online shopping "could be helping to hold down inflation in a persistent way in many countries." The Bank of Japan in has attributed part of the price declines at supermarkets to online shopping.

Kayla Weaver Blake of Lufkin, Texas, frequently researches prices online. On a trip to buy diapers at a Toys "R" Us Inc. store, she pulled out her phone and noticed a carton of 128 Pampers Swaddlers was $34 on Amazon.com Inc., or roughly 20% cheaper than in the store. The mother of three showed the screenshot to the cashier. Paired with a $10-off coupon, Toys "R" Us sold the diapers to her for a net price of $24.

"I do that with everything," said Ms. Blake, 29, who price checks such items as laundry detergent and toilet paper. "If it's full price, I'm not going to buy it."

The same applies for holiday shopping. Ms. Blake saw a PJ Masks toy set for $89 in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. It was $59 on Amazon. Every retailer, she said, is "competing with every other business out there."

The growth of e-commerce is well understood, tracking the smartphone's ubiquity and a global supply chain that delivers consumer goods quickly and cheaply. Its impact on inflation the so-called Amazon effect is still being explored by economists.

Research by Goldman Sachs found that online price competition may be subtracting as much as a tenth of a percentage point from core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, and quarter of a percentage point from core-goods inflation, as measured by the personal-consumption expenditures index. It may not sound like much but with annual core inflation at just 1.4% in October, it is significant.

Alberto Cavallo, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, said the expanding ability of consumers to comparison shop has constrained retailers' ability to charge different prices online and in stores, according to data compiled in MIT's Billion Prices Project.

Retail's share of e-commerce is growing, another consideration for Fed policy makers. Online shopping accounted for 9.1% of U.S. retail spending in the third quarter, according to the Census Bureau, up from 3.6% in the same quarter of 2008. It comprises most retail growth: More than half the sales of books, music, videos and DVDs are done online, according to retail data analysis firm Boomerang Commerce Inc. Sales of sporting goods and consumer electronics are getting close to that level.

Consumer prices for many of those goods fell in the year to October: Books were down 2.7%; sporting goods fell 1.9%; televisions dropped 10.3%; toys declined 8%, the Labor Department said. The consumer-price index for commodities, excluding food and energy, dropped 1% over that time. It has shown deflation, compared with a year earlier, nearly every month since early 2013, though that partly reflects a drop in import prices from the strengthening dollar over that time.

By contrast, the annual rate of inflation for services hasn't dipped below 2% in six years, largely driven by the rising costs of rent, health care and education.

With more sales conducted online, retail pricing now mirrors gas stations, where prices are clearly marked and competitors quickly match their rivals, said Tracy Issel, Microsoft Corp.'s general manager of world-wide retail and consumer goods. "It's a race to the bottom."

The competition helps drive innovation and productivity, according to economists, while giving consumers more for their money. And some believe it will have a growing influence over central bank policy.

"If the Amazon effect is big, or more broadly if structural forces pushing down on inflation are big, then at the margin that means an easier monetary policy" going forward, said Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius.

Central bankers should rethink their inflation targets, given the continued downward pressure on inflation from globalization and technological change, said Claudio Borio, chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based consortium of central banks in a recent speech.

Amazon captures more than 40 cents of every dollar spent online, according to a panel of 5 million U.S. shoppers tracked by Slice Intelligence. The internet giant chooses which categories it leads and matches on pricing by electronically checking thousands of websites a day, according to former employees.

When Pradnya Haldipur of Silver Spring, Md., first got pregnant, "I started doing as much comparison shopping as my brain could tolerate," she said.

Ms. Haldipur, 43, typically checks Target.com and Amazon.com, and sometimes Google's shopping search engine, before clicking buy. She does so for such basic goods as toilet paper, as well as toys she buys for her two children.

"If I can avoid going into a physical store, I will do so," she said. "The majority of my holiday shopping, that's been done on Amazon."

Some economists are skeptical of the Amazon effect. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said his economists "do not see much evidence to suggest that e-commerce is depressing inflation in the euro area today at least to extent that we can measure it."

Accurately measuring the impact of the Amazon effect is indeed one problem. Few statistical agencies collect extensive online price data. In the consumer-price index, the survey sample of where people shop rotates only every two to four years. The CPI doesn't capture the money saved when a consumer switches from a brick-and-mortar store to an online retailer, said Steve Reed, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That factor, known as outlet bias, is another reason economists could be underestimating the impact of online shopping and overstating inflation.

An earlier example was known as the "Wal-Mart effect," coined in the 1990s to describe the company's disruption of the retail sector. A 2005 study found Wal-Mart's entry into a new market offered lower prices, and prompted competing supermarkets to respond by either lowering prices or not raising them.

The shift toward outlets like supercenters and big-box discounters between 2002 and 2007 lowered the average prices of most categories of food by about 1.5% from 2002 to 2007, according to a BLS study.

With the Wal-Mart effect, however, it was one dominant retailer that pushed prices lower through its large-scale purchasing power and supply-chain management. Today, smartphones and online price transparency mean "it's the consumer that now has extraordinary buying power," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income for BlackRock Inc.

Economists Give High Marks to Departing Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen

By Ben Leubsdorf

Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is getting a positive report card from outside economists as she prepares to leave office after four years leading the U.S. central bank.

Asked to grade Ms. Yellen's performance, 60% of the economists surveyed in recent days by The Wall Street Journal gave her an A and an additional 30% gave her a B. About 8% rated her a C and 2% gave her a D.

"She is not given enough credit," said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial . "Economic results have been nearly optimal."

That's better than the report card her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, got on his way out the door four years ago.

In a January 2014 survey, 34% of economists gave Mr. Bernanke an A for his performance as Fed chairman and 45% gave him a B. He received grades of C from 8% and D from 5%, while 8% gave him a failing grade.

It's also an improvement from Ms. Yellen's perceived performance earlier in her time at the Fed.

In April 2016, midway through her tenure, 22% of economists gave Ms. Yellen an A while 51% gave her a B, with grades of C from 20% and D from 7%.

In August 2014, six months after she took office, 27% gave her an A while 39% gave her a B, with a C grade from 18% and a D from 12%, while 3% failed her. The figures don't add to 100% due to rounding.

"Her thoughtful leadership to normalize short-term rates and unwind the Fed's balance sheet has impressed investors worldwide," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, in this month's survey.

Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, praised Ms. Yellen as "a dedicated public servant who put her service to the country above all else" as well as "fair, even handed, intelligent and skilled; we were very lucky to have her at the helm of the Federal Reserve."

The Journal's survey of 62 business, financial and academic economists was conducted Dec. 8-11. Not every economist answered every question. An A was defined as 90 or higher out of 100. A B was 80 to 89, a C was 70 to 79, a D was 60 to 69 and an F was any grade under 60.

Ms. Yellen's term as chairwoman ends Feb. 3. President Donald Trump broke with recent precedent by declining to reappoint her to a second term, instead nominating Fed governor Jerome Powell to take over the central bank.

He faces a smooth path to confirmation, and Ms. Yellen said last month she plans to resign as a member of the Fed's board of governors after her successor has been sworn in.

She can point to a number of accomplishments at the end of her term: the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years, steady if puzzlingly low inflation, healthy economic growth and progress on the Fed's plan to unwind its crisis-era stimulus efforts by raising short-term interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet.

In her resignation letter, Ms. Yellen said she was "gratified by the substantial improvement in the economy since the crisis. The economy has produced 17 million jobs, on net, over the past eight years and, by most metrics, is close to achieving the Federal Reserve's statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability."

SEC Chairman Warns Investors Against Bitcoin

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON Wall Street's top regulator on Monday raised alarms about the money flooding into bitcoin trading and other cryptocurrency markets, warning the red-hot corner of less-regulated finance is burning with risk for retail investors.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton issued a lengthy statement spelling out his concerns about bitcoin, which the agency doesn't regulate, and other deals that piggyback off excitement about the cryptocurrency. The SEC has come down particularly hard on initial coin offerings, in which startups raise money sometimes by soliciting bitcoin from investors in exchange for giving them a new digital coin that may be traded or grow in value.

"The world's social media platforms and financial markets are abuzz about cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings," Mr. Clayton said. "There are tales of fortunes made and dreamed to be made. We are hearing the familiar refrain,  this time is different.'"

Mr. Clayton's alert came on the same day the SEC intervened to halt a $15 million initial coin offering that it said should have been conducted under the regulator's longstanding rules for securities sales. Because it wasn't, investors didn't get the extensive disclosures that enable informed investment decisions. Munchee Inc. offered investors a new digital token, the MUN, in exchange for investors' bitcoin or Ethereum.

Bitcoin futures are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a sister agency to the SEC. The CFTC approved the contracts that began trading on Cboe Global Markets Inc. on Sunday, creating a new avenue for bitcoin exposure. CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said Monday that he supports Mr. Clayton's statement.

"Virtual currencies are unlike any commodity that the CFTC has dealt with in the past, and I know they pose challenges for the SEC as well," Mr. Giancarlo said. "Investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in these markets."

The price of bitcoin soared to $17,840 in futures trading on the Cboe market on Monday, above the spot price quoted on CoinDesk of $16,953 around 6:15 p.m. Eastern time Monday. Cboe's larger competitor, CME Group Inc., plans to launch bitcoin futures next week.

A person familiar with Mr. Clayton's thinking said he voiced his views now because the run-up in bitcoin's price has captivated retail investors, and because the commission's prior statements on bitcoin and ICOs have generated substantial interest.

The SEC has staked its claim to regulate ICOs, which it says are securities offerings. Mr. Clayton said "to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC," an indication the agency could take more enforcement actions against the deals.

"By and large, the structures of initial coin offerings that I have seen promoted involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements and other investor protection provisions," Mr. Clayton said.

Mr. Clayton's statement laid out 14 topics for investors to ask about before purchasing a cryptocurrency or ICO interest. The questions included asking whether someone who is promoting a project has been paid to tout it, what legal recourse they have in case something goes wrong, and whether new investment proceeds are used to "cash out" other investors a sign of a Ponzi scheme.

The SEC chairman warned professionals involved in the deals brokers, accountants and lawyers that they, too, could have liability if an ICO or similar deal is found to have violated securities laws. Exchanges or similar platforms that allow trading in certain digital tokens could run afoul of the law, he said, if they don't have the SEC's approval to operate.

"I believe that initial coin offerings whether they represent offerings of securities or not can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects," Mr. Clayton said. "However, any such activity that involves an offering of securities must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other investor protections that our securities laws require."

Quick Hits: ECB Reinvestments Seen Lasting Until 2020 at Least

ECB Reinvestments to Last Until 2020 at Least: Barclays

Although the European Central Bank will likely stop being a net buyer of bonds by the fourth quarter of 2018, it should keep reinvesting maturing bonds at least until 2020, Barclays says. The ECB will have to reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds that it holds under its quantitative-easing program, otherwise the size of its asset purchase program will decline naturally. The ECB currently holds more than  2 trillion ($2.354 trillion) of assets under its QE program.

ECB Forward Guidance Could Evolve, Allianz GI Says

It wouldn't be a surprise to see the European Central Bank's forward guidance evolving at Thursday's meeting in a way that cuts the link between continuing asset purchases and inflation, says Franck Dixmier, global head of fixed income and chief investment officer for fixed income Europe at Allianz Global Investors. This evolution would take into consideration the pace of asset purchases, the horizon at which asset purchases would come to an end and the potential for optionality, Mr. Dixmier says. Allianz GI believes the forward guidance must evolve to reduce expectations for sustained low yields and the ECB will also have to manage expectations about the pace of future rate rises.

New RBNZ Chief Upbeat on Global Economy

The incoming head of New Zealand's central bank is relatively upbeat on the state of the global economy, according to a speech given in his role as chief executive of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, as reported by New Zealand media in November. While some have raised concerns about the prospect of a global economic shock Mr. Orr said that "we are in a very, very positive situation" with strong real gross domestic product growth and equity markets across the globe that are neither especially undervalued, or overvalued, the reports said. They added that Orr said the global economy was in a "Goldilocks zone" of strengthening economic growth and low interest rates. A fund spokeswoman verified the comments.

PBOC Opens Tap Ahead of Fed's Expected Rate Increase

China's central bank injected a small amount of cash into the financial system for the first time in two weeks, marking an interesting policy shift ahead of the Fed's almost certain rate increase later this week. The People's Bank of China offered a symbolic 20 billion yuan ($3.02 billion) into money markets Monday, after draining a combined 550 billion yuan in the past two weeks. The PBOC's recent lack of generosity has been interpreted by some as a saving of ammunition to support markets in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's likely Fed move.

Underlying Credit Growth in China Slowing: Capital Economics

Underlying credit growth in China further slowed last month despite People's Bank of China data suggesting a jump in new loans, says Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics. Growth in augmented total social financing, a measure designed by Capital Economics, fell to the slowest pace in over two years, he says. China's central bank might ease monetary policy in the coming months as slower credit creation continues to weigh on economic growth, he adds.

Swiss National Bank May Revise Inflation Outlook, Says SocGen

The Swiss National Bank is among the central banks that announces a policy decision this week more precisely on Thursday and Socit Gnrale forecasts a revision of the inflation outlook. But the SNB "is likely to reiterate its willingness to intervene and weaken the CHF," SocGen says. "CHF [is] near the lowest level since [central bank] dropped the EUR/CHF floor back in January, 2014."

BOE to Guide What Sonia Market Already Prices In

The Bank of England is unlikely to change course at its final monetary policy meeting of the year and is set to keep indicating two rate rises in the coming two to three years, Socit Gnrale says in a note. This is what Sterling Overnight Index Average, or Sonia, derivatives price in: 45 basis points, or just under two rate rises of 25 basis points each, over the next two years. The BOE's Monetary Policy Committee meets Thursday.

Monetary Policy Normalization More Perceptible Next Year, KfW Says

Monetary policy normalization will be more perceptible in 2018 with the European Central Bank scaling back its asset purchases and the U.S. Federal Reserve's balance-sheet reduction getting increasingly important, says Joerg Zeuner, chief economist at KfW. Consequently, Mr. Zeuner says bond markets should orient themselves more toward the strong global economic upturn. The situation is less clear with price developments, which will probably remain somewhat muted in the euro area and accelerate in the U.S., he adds.

Unemployment Back to Pre-Crisis Level In Rich Countries: OECD

By Paulo Trevisani and Jeffrey T. Lewis

BRASLIA Brazil's central bank indicated Tuesday it is ready to cut its benchmark Selic interest rate again and said its next rate decision will be "more susceptible" to economic data than the previous ones.

"The current stage recommends caution," the bank said in the minutes from last week's monetary policy meeting, at which the bank cut the Selic by half a point to 7%. Consumer price increases remain moderate, with Brazil's 12-month inflation rate below the bank's 4.5% target.

The Selic is now at its lowest level on record. The next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for Feb. 7.

The bank said the pace of rate cutting might slow, which could mean a quarter of a percentage point cut is in store.

The bank reaffirmed that economic reform is needed to keep rates low for the long run. Brazil is struggling with large budget shortfalls that economists say could lead to a debt crisis. This would devalue the currency and bring inflation back, forcing the central bank to raise rates.

A key reform is for Brazil's insolvent pension system. Congress is debating a controversial bill meant to keep Brazilians in the workforce for longer before retiring.

"The approval and implementation of reforms, mainly the ones of a fiscal nature...is fundamental for the sustainability of the low-inflation environment," the bank said in the minutes.

There have also been big differences in the pace of recovery across developed economies. At 4.1% in October, the jobless rate in the U.S. was below its 5% precrisis level. By contrast, the eurozone's jobless rate remained well above its precrisis level of 7.4%. That gap reflects the fact that whereas the U.S. jobless rate peaked in late 2009, the eurozone's government debt and banking crisis delayed the bloc's jobless peak until mid-2013.

But, even within the currency area, there were large differences in the pace of repair. In April 2008, Greece's jobless rate was only slightly higher than Germany's, at 7.9% compared with 7.6%. In August, which is the most recent month for which comparable figures are available, Greece's jobless rate stood at 20.6% while Germany's was 3.7%.

The OECD expects jobless rates to fall further over coming years, to 8% in the eurozone by 2019 and to 3.7% in the U.S. during the same year.

To the surprise of most economists, the steady fall in the OECD unemployment rate since its peak in early 2010 hasn't led to a strong pickup in wages. That is partly due to the fact that the headline jobless rate overstates the strength of the jobs market, as many workers are putting in fewer hours than they would like, while others have accepted temporary contracts that typically come with lower pay.

And while it may have reached its end, the long period of higher unemployment that followed the financial crisis may have had a profound impact on political preferences that continues to play out. One paper published Tuesday found a strong link in Europe between higher unemployment rates and support for antiestablishment political parties.

Brazil Indicates Readiness to Cut Rate Again

By Paulo Trevisani and Jeffrey T. Lewis

BRASLIA Brazil's central bank indicated Tuesday it is ready to cut its benchmark Selic interest rate again and said its next rate decision will be "more susceptible" to economic data than the previous ones.

"The current stage recommends caution," the bank said in the minutes from last week's monetary policy meeting, at which the bank cut the Selic by half a point to 7%. Consumer price increases remain moderate, with Brazil's 12-month inflation rate below the bank's 4.5% target.

The Selic is now at its lowest level on record. The next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for Feb. 7.

The bank said the pace of rate cutting might slow, which could mean a quarter of a percentage point cut is in store.

The bank reaffirmed that economic reform is needed to keep rates low for the long run. Brazil is struggling with large budget shortfalls that economists say could lead to a debt crisis. This would devalue the currency and bring inflation back, forcing the central bank to raise rates.

A key reform is for Brazil's insolvent pension system. Congress is debating a controversial bill meant to keep Brazilians in the workforce for longer before retiring.

"The approval and implementation of reforms, mainly the ones of a fiscal nature...is fundamental for the sustainability of the low-inflation environment," the bank said in the minutes.

Does the Stock Market Make Firms More Productive?

There is a positive relationship between stock price informativeness and productivity, "http://papers.nber.org/tmp/73321-w24102.pdf" paper by Benjamin Bennett, Ren Stulz and Zexi Wang. Firm size, firm age, acquisition, complexity and capital intensity all influence the effect of stock prices on firm-level productivity. The researchers conclude that management either directly or indirectly learns more from informative stock prices, so that more informative stock prices make firms more productive. They measure stock price informativeness using annual measures based on high frequency tick size trading or daily trading activities.

Economists Think Potatoes Helped Promote World Peace

The humble potato may have caused a dramatic and lasting decline in bloodshed during the 18th and 19th centuries in parts of the Old World, "https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2017/12/11/economists-think-potatoes-helped-promote-world-peace/" by three economists Murat Iyigun, Nathan Nunn and Nancy Qian. The study found areas of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East that were better suited to growing potatoes a hardy, high-calorie crop native to South America saw significant reductions in deadly fighting after 1700, when the tuber was entering widespread cultivation. It isn't clear exactly why, though the economists speculated potatoes may have reduced the need to fight over territory by raising agricultural productivity with implications for some modern conflicts in parts of the world. The working paper was circulated last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Expect the Fed to Stand By Its 2018 Outlook

Financial markets see that solid growth will prompt the central bank to stick to three rate increases despite low inflation, "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-11/expect-the-fed-to-stand-by-its-2018-outlook" Tim Duy in Bloomberg View. "This may come as a surprise given the dovish Fed minutes, but the recent surge in short-term rates indicates that financial markets are waking up to the reality that solid economic growth will prompt the bank to keep hiking rates despite low inflation. All else equal, the stage will be set for an inversion of the yield curve by the end of next year."

The hiring rate, or the share of newly filled jobs to total employment, has "https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2017/12/11/hiring-doesnt-break-out-even-with-historically-low-unemployment/" for three and a half years.

Banks are competing with tech titans like Google and Facebook for data scientists, meaning they need to change how they attract, hire and develop talent, Gurjeet Singh of Ayasdi, an artificial intelligence company, "https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/to-compete-with-big-tech-firms-banks-need-big-tech-talent" in an American Banker opinion piece. Banks should hold data science competitions to find interested and talented individuals, and then offer competitive pay, pair them with mentors and give them time to do original research, he says. Banks should also look internally and "nurture data science talent in house that will understand the business, the culture and the math," he writes.

Pro Private Markets
Thoma Bravo's Software Wagers Stole Stellar Returns; The tech-focused firm has come first in a new set of rankings looking at crisis-era investments

"Software is the magic thing whose importance only goes up over time," Bill Gates once famously said.

His words were an omen for the private-equity industry: as software-focused strategies are reaping the rewards of seeds planted in the boom-era days of speculation, they reverberate through the asset class.

The latest independent global analysis of private-equity firms' performance shows that, for the second time in three years, a software specialist has outperformed against the asset class.

Stormed to the Top

Software-focused private-equity and growth capital firm Thoma Bravo has stormed to the top of the annual global performance ranking compiled by analytics firm Peracs, in the first time it has been included in the list to date. The U.S.-based firm had an overall performance score of 4.14, based on an analysis of absolute and relative returns over the past decade, nearly double (72%) that of last year's top-ranking firm Waterland Private Equity Investments.

The study looked at funds' performance between 2004 and 2013, excluding more recent return data because it typically takes three years to generate a profit.

Software's ubiquity, together with the recurring revenue generated by software-as-a-service products and the growth of e-commerce and payment-processing technologies, have attracted investors to the industry. Last year a record-setting $13.6 billion was invested in the European tech sector, according to a report by venture-capital firm Atomico.

Global private-equity behemoths such as The Carlyle Group and Apax Partners have doubled down on software and other cutting-edge technologies. This month Apax Partners said it had secured $1 billion to invest in growth-stage technology, shortly after strengthening its technology bench so it could start investing its first digital fund.

Breathtaking Prices

The average price private-equity firms paid for software companies soared to a breathtaking 18.1 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, nearly double the 10.2-times multiple firms paid for other companies, according to Bain & Co.'s 2017 report.

The strong record of firms like Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity Partners before it which was top of the ranking two years earlier show there is substance behind the froth, and could allay fears software valuations are overheating.

"It took some time for these firms to be mature enough for private equity," said Oliver Gottschalg, an associate professor at business school HEC Paris and head of research at private-equity analytics provider Peracs. He said it has taken time for software companies to mature, make profit and attract interest from risk-averse private-equity backers, since the dot-com boom of the early 2000s.

Thoma Bravo has made a string of rapid-fire exits in recent years and generated stellar returns throughout the global financial crisis. Its recent exits include the sale of Global Healthcare Exchange LLC, an automated trading platform for suppliers to the health-care industry, to Temasek for an undisclosed amount in July and its sale of software provider Mediware Information Systems to TPG Capital in February. Former Intel Corp. cybersecurity company McAfee LLC and security solutions provider DigiCert Inc. sit among a raft of its active investments, which include IT service providers, software makers and technology solutions platforms.

Shortly after the financial crisis took hold, Thoma Bravo earned four times its money through the sale of higher-education software business Datatel Inc. to Hellman & Friedman for $570 million in 2009. By that year, the Thoma Cressey Fund VII LP it closed in 2001 had made a healthy internal rate of return of 48%, the firm's managing partner Orlando Bravo said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

Crisis-era vintages have tested the mettle of firms. A defining feature of the latest top-performing firms is that their strategies are so diverse, which Professor Gottschalg attributes to the crisis, the most significant macroeconomic upheaval of the past 10 years.

Valuable Vintages

Like a fine wine whose crop is blighted by bad weather, vintages that do survive are extremely valuable, and those firms that weathered the crisis proved their resilience through distinct, niche strategies.

Peracs' analysis looked at performance data from 486 private-equity firms and 882 aggregate funds. Firms analyzed in the ranking typically had one fund before the crisis, one during, and one after, Professor Gottschalg said.

It examined a decade of funds between 2004 and 2013, which brought the peak crisis years of 2007 to 2009 squarely into view, and excluded those raised in the past three years as it takes that amount of time for acquisitions to make a profit.

Some private-equity firms with specialized niche strategies such as Thoma Bravo and Vista have been able to achieve exemplar operational improvements due to their focus on software, while firms such as Apollo's and Clayton Dubilier & Rice's recurring revenue from strong debt strategies carried them through the crisis, according to Professor Gottschalg.

"GPs with a value creation approach [were] better suited to weather the crisis," he said.

Last year's top-ranked firm, Waterland Private Equity Investments, came second in this year's ranking party thanks to its buy-and-build strategy, which allowed it to "grow during the crisis," he added.

Waterland was followed closely in the ranking by Hellman & Friedman, Platinum Equity and Vista Equity Partners, Clayton Dubilier & Rice, Advent International, GTCR, Abry Partners and Apollo Global Management.

For the Next Housing Crisis, Lessons From the Last One; New research says federal efforts to help homeowners didn't help much. But there might have been a better way

Could a new study ease the next housing crisis?

When the housing bubble burst in 2008, federal policy makers thought they could limit the economic damage by helping to reduce amounts of principal owed on many mortgages, thus preventing foreclosures especially for the millions of people who saw the value of their homes fall below the value of their mortgages.

But, according to a new working "https://scholar.harvard.edu/noel/publications/effect-debt-default-and-consumption-evidence-housing-policy-great-recession", lowering principal had very little effect on defaults for underwater borrowers. Moreover, it turned out to be a very expensive initiative. The federal government spent about $4.6 billion on principal reduction to prevent foreclosures from 2010 to 2016, but the policy's impact was so small, each avoided foreclosure ended up costing taxpayers at least $800,000, says Pascal Noel, an assistant professor at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, and co-author of the paper with Peter Ganong, an assistant professor at University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy.

This new research sheds light on what went wrong with the government's efforts to help underwater borrowers in the 2007-09 recession, which by early 2010 included more than 11 million people or about 24% of residential properties with mortgages, according to Core Logic, a data and analytics company.

"If borrowers' mortgage balances were much higher than their home value, policy makers and academic researchers worried the borrowers might decide to walk away, " says Dr. Noel. But a more effective policy to help those homeowners and give the economy a boost, he says, might have been to temporarily lower the underwater homeowners' mortgage payments, freeing up cash flow and thus spurring consumer spending.

The Wall Street Journal spoke to Dr. Noel about the research. Edited excerpts follow.

WSJ: Why did you decide to pursue this topic?

DR. NOEL: I was working in the Obama White House, helping design the government's response to the foreclosure crisis, but we didn't have the right research to make the most informed policy decisions. That motivated me to figure out what exactly would have been the most effective response to that and future crises.

WSJ: Explain the study?

DR. NOEL: It has always been difficult to tease apart the effect of principal and monthly payment reductions because prior research had studied them together. But we were able to exploit policy variation in the government's Home Affordable Modification Program, which modified about 1.6 million mortgages between 2009 through 2016. One group of borrowers, which became our control group, received a modification temporarily reducing their mortgage payments for five years. The second group received the exact same short-term payment reduction, but also received about $70,000 in mortgage principal reduction, writing down, on average, a third of their mortgage balance.

WSJ: What did you find?

DR. NOEL: The principal reduction had no statistically significant effects on borrowers' short-term default rates. Reducing borrowers' loan-to-value ratio by about 11 percentage points affected default rates by less than 1 percentage point. That is within the first three years of receiving the modification.

It also had very little effect on consumption. A $70,000 reduction in mortgage principal increased borrowers' monthly credit-card expenditures by less than $1 and their auto spending by less than $5.

The main message is that underwater borrowers during the financial crisis were much less sensitive to changes in their housing wealth than the average borrower during normal times, and that was very surprising.

WSJ: Why was it so surprising?

DR. NOEL: The link between housing wealth and consumption is very well documented empirically. But we find that relationship completely broke down. In most cases, the mortgage-principal reduction wasn't enough to bring homeowners above water.

If, for example, a borrower owes $80,000 more on their mortgage than their home is worth and $70,000 is forgiven, the home is still underwater. There is no collateral. So a homeowner can't take out a home-equity line of credit or a second mortgage, which is typically how housing wealth increases consumption.

We calculate that if the government spent $4.6 billion the amount of money it used to subsidize principal reductions during the financial crisis and used it instead to reduce short-term mortgage payments, the spending response would have been 10 times greater. It would have increased consumer spending by about $1.4 billion.

WSJ: How big a role did a homeowner's leverage play in default rates?

DR. NOEL: During the crisis, many experts looked at the historical relationship between leverage ratios and default rates and believed there was a causal relationship between them. But our findings suggest short-term income shocks, like job loss, rather than leverage in and of itself, primarily drive mortgage defaults.

We have a new version of the paper coming out soon where we look at a different source of variation in the Home Affordable Modification Program over the same period and find a 1% reduction in monthly mortgage payments reduces default rates by about 1%. That is a much bigger effect than we get from reducing mortgage principal without changing payments.

DR. NOEL: Our results are for borrowers who are moderately underwater. About 90% of the borrowers in our data have a loan-to-value ration of 160% or below that means that their mortgage is [as much as] 60% more than the value of their home. It is entirely possible that for people even more underwater, you would start seeing a tighter relationship between leverage and default. You might get to a tipping point where the leverage is just too high and people walk away from their homes.

WSJ: What lessons does the paper suggest in hindsight?

DR. NOEL: The main lesson looking back is that the government would have been better off if it had used the same amount of money to finance deeper reductions in mortgage payments or reduce more borrowers' monthly payments. Still, writing down mortgage debt before borrowers are underwater might be an effective policy and is worth further investigation.

California House Republican Hears It at Home Over Tax Bill; Rep. Mimi Walters's constituents worry about mortgage-interest cap, end to local deductions

IRVINE, Calif. In her district's biggest city and across its conservative bastions, Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters is facing criticism over the GOP tax overhaul bill that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-hits-vote-threshold-to-pass-gop-tax-bill-1510858107". The bill might increase taxes for many of her constituents, rather than lower them.

Under pressure from frustrated supporters, she is now working to modify the bill to ease the blow as lawmakers try to hash out a compromise with a measure passed by the Senate.

Three of California's 14 House Republicans voted against the bill last month, citing measures that would curb or even eliminate some key deductions used widely by Californians. Mrs. Walters's support for the bill, by contrast, has drawn scrutiny from some at a tense moment for the state's Republicans, ahead of competitive midterm elections next year.

"I'm not going to vote for a Democrat, but am I going to vote for a Republican that is going to raise my taxes? That is the question," said Jeffrey Lalloway, a divorce lawyer and Republican member of Irvine's City Council.

Stephen Miller, a registered Republican until 2016 he switched to independent ahead of the presidential election said he was furious with Mrs. Walters's endorsement of the bill. A former corporate tax attorney in Irvine, Mr. Miller created a spreadsheet calculator for Orange County residents to estimate how much in taxes they would owe if the bill passes.

"When I step back at 30,000 feet, I see a bill that is taxing the rising middle class people going to college, getting ahead by their own labor at higher rates in order to lower taxes on income from existing wealth," said Mr. Miller, 45 years old. "I'm trying to spread information about this tax bill. I think that is most effective in switching independents, swing voters."

Analysts have said the GOP tax bill would give most people a modest tax break, at least in the first few years. But those benefits would be curbed in districts like Mrs. Walters's, where some affluent residents could be pinched by new limits on deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, and mortgage interest that are still being negotiated.

In an interview Tuesday, Mrs. Walters acknowledged the tax bill's limits to the SALT deduction sparked some worries and said she was pushing for changes to give constituents more flexibility. Currently, both the House and Senate bill only preserve the property-tax deduction up to $10,000.

Though she isn't part of the formal group of negotiations, "I've been making my feelings known what I think is important in a final bill," she said.

Mrs. Walters also said she is focused on trying to boost the mortgage-interest deduction, which the House voted to limit to loans totaling up to $500,000, down from $1 million in current law, which is also the level preserved by the Senate.

In 2015, the median property value in Orange County, where Mrs. Walters's 45th district sits, was $625,300, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In the last quarter, the average price paid for a home in most neighborhoods in Mrs. Walters's inland district hovered around or above the county median, according to data from CoreLogic, a data analytics firm.

"I'd like to see us come to a compromise on that," potentially at around $750,000, said Mrs. Walters, who was first elected to Congress in 2014.

Without a change, people in Orange County worry that the measure would spur higher mortgage-interest rates, suppress home buying or bring other knock-on economic effects.

"You basically are creating a disincentive for people to buy those more expensive houses. It will have an impact on our real-estate prices here," said Max Chao, continuing lecturer in accounting, tax, and law at the University of California, Irvine.

In addition to raising taxes on some upper middle-income professionals such as teachers, dentists, and engineers, the bill may also increase taxes on the highest-income brackets including people like lawyers or bankers who, in some cases, are paying off student loans or starting and supporting families.

High-paid lawyers in Orange County are calling the bill the "millionaires-subsidizing-billionaires tax plan," in a nod to some of their own clients, who would benefit from lower taxes on businesses and estates.

Orange County is known as a Republican center in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, but Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won Mrs. Walters's district last year with 49% of the vote, even as the incumbent congresswoman was re-elected with nearly 59%. Mrs. Walters already has several Democratic challenges for what should be a competitive race next year.

Of the 23 GOP-controlled House districts won by Mrs. Clinton in 2016, Mrs. Walters's has the fourth-highest percentage of tax filers taking the state and local deduction, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis of IRS data.

"People are obviously concerned about the state and local tax income deduction," she said. "That makes it difficult for somebody like myself."

On Tax Plan, Many Questions

In several neighborhoods in California's 45th District, from upscale Mission Viejo to more blue-collar Lake Forest, many people said they weren't sure how the revised tax laws would affect their families.

Realtors and tax accountants said they were surprised they weren't being flooded with questions from clients.

Jackie Stashik, a Realtor in Lake Forest, said the current mortgage deduction is what has allowed many of her clients to make the purchases they did.

"When we first bought our home, it was the difference in us being able to afford our house. For many of my first time home buyers, it is the difference," Ms. Stashik said.

One of her clients, Amanda Penny, is looking for a new home for a better commute to her work at a mortgage company. Ms. Penny, 32 years old with a nearly-year old baby, said she hopes this next home would be the one she and her husband retire in.

A voting Republican, she said she and her husband are watching what a tax overhaul might mean for them, but "it hasn't impacted our decisions because, ultimately, we have to make the move."

If their taxes rise overall, she said they would look to make adjustments, including other deductions, to lessen the impact. Still, she said, the proposed lower mortgage-deduction cap "was kind of a slap in the face for us."

Michael McClellan, a Republican activist in Orange County who opposes the bill, said people may not be scrutinizing the tax plan or following the ins and outs of negotiations because, "I think by and large people trust the Republican Party on taxes."

"Which is why if this goes the wrong way, and people actually get a tax increase, the sense of betrayal will be so profound," Mr. McClellan said.

Mr. McClellan's congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, voted against the bill. His district neighbors Mrs. Walters's.

Tech
China's Startups Are Only Pawns in the Game; Bike-sharing battles are the latest evolution in China's tech titan wars

China's tech world doesn't believe in the story of David and Goliath.

Startups and investors are abandoning the dream that a smarter, nimbler upstart can topple a gargantuan company. Instead, internet behemoths Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., among the world's biggest companies by market value, use their deep pockets to swallow startups and guard against potential disrupters.

Their ability to turn deep-rooted David-and-Goliath gospel in the tech world on its head was again on display this week in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/braking-bad-thieves-and-pranksters-lay-waste-to-chinas-share-bikes-1491230284".

In recent months, speculation has been rife about a possible merger between the two leading bike-sharing apps: Ofo, formally named Beijing Bikelock Technology Co., and Mobike, or Beijing Mobike Technology Co.

Tencent is a top investor in Mobike, while Alibaba and its finance affiliate Ant Financial Services Group back Ofo. Tencent and Alibaba have backed the two to access their rapidly increasing user numbers, in their latest proxy war to dominate mobile payments.

Ofo and Mobike have each raised more than $1 billion since early 2016. They've flooded Chinese cities with millions of their orange (Mobike) and yellow (Ofo) bikes while charging as low as 7 cents for a ride. At times, they've given rides away for free. They grew their monthly active users from tens of thousands in mid-2016 to more than 40 million each in October.

Both companies deny they want to merge, despite good reasons for doing so. Some smaller rivals have gone bust in the past few months, putting pressure on the two unicorns to prove their business models work. A few investors have become vocal about a merger so the two can stop burning cash.

Wang Gang, an early investor in Ofo, says he's all for a merger. So is Jenny Zeng, a Mobike investor.

Mr. Wang and Ms. Zeng saw it happen before. He was an investor in Didi Chuxing Technology Co., and she in Uber Technologies Inc. and its China operation. Didi, backed by Tencent, created a monopoly in ride-hailing by first "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-alibaba-backed-chinese-taxi-hailing-apps-to-merge-1423883210", which was backed by Alibaba, and then "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403".

"The ending is as predictable as Hollywood movies," said Ms. Zeng. "They will merge!"

This week, the prospect for an Ofo-Mobike merger became more complicated after Ant Financial announced a 2 billion yuan ($302 million) investment in Hellobike, a smaller player focusing on smaller cities.

With a new competitor on the horizon, Ofo and Mobike will need to raise more funding to defend their user base. It's especially tough on Ofo, which now finds that its backer Ant is also funding a competitor.

Alibaba says its investment is meant to encourage healthy growth of the bike-sharing industry. Tencent didn't respond to requests for comment. Mobike says it sees no value in an acquisition or a merger. Ofo declined to comment.

In the U.S., tech giants have also been copying and investing in leading startups think of Facebook's imitation of Snapchat and acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But the variety and reach of their portfolio companies and products pale in comparison with the Chinese titans.

Alibaba and Tencent not only dominate their core businesses, they own the biggest online video sites and have stakes in the biggest meal delivery apps. They're investors in the most promising artificial-intelligence startups with businesses ranging from surveillance to health care. Critically, the two handle about 94% of mobile-payment transactions in China.

What's really going on with Ant's Hellobike investment, according to investors and industry people, is the latest evolution in Alibaba and Tencent's contest over mobile payments.

After the news of the Hellobike deal, Tencent founder Pony Ma took to WeChat, saying that the bike-sharing apps "are being used as marketing tools for payment. The poor minority shareholders are stuck."

A few hours later Alibaba founder Jack Ma told Chinese media that he knows that Tencent wants the bike-sharing companies to merge. Alibaba won't do deals "for the sake of a monopoly or making a quick profit," he was quoted as saying.

Tencent was once an also-ran in the mobile-payment business, until its proxy war with Alibaba over ride-hailing. As Tencent-backed Didi gobbled up competitors, Tencent's share of the mobile-payment market in China ballooned from 19% in the third quarter of 2015 to 40% two years later, while Alipay's market share fell from 70% to 54% during the same period, according to iResearch.

In bike-sharing services, the dynamics now favor Alibaba. Bike-sharing companies usually require deposits between 100 yuan ($15) and 299 yuan. Alibaba now wants to do away with those deposits, taking advantage of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-missing-piece-in-chinas-economy-consumer-credit-ratings-1506304981".

Launched two years ago, Sesame Credit mines data on a consumer's e-commerce and other online activity to derive a credit score. Ofo users with high scores won't need to pay a bike deposit.

Tencent is way behind in offering a similar product. With its investment in Hellobike, Ant Financial will have more users for Sesame Credit.

Startups are getting used to their role as pawns. Many see that, if they do well, they'll have to choose at some point whether to take Tencent's or Alibaba's investment. If they don't, their competitors will.

"Startups used to have the chance to grow into skyscrapers," says a venture investor. "Now they only grow to be a few stories tall."

Faster and more accurate: machine translationis nearly here

Companies such as Unbabel and Mymanu are helping us understand each other

Sci-fi loves the idea of being able to understand every language effortlessly. Doctor Who s Tardis taps into telepathy; the Babel Fish in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy reads brainwaves, while the robot C-3PO, in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, tells Luke Skywalker he is  fluent in over 6m forms of communication .

Multilingualism is close to becoming a reality as we use new ways to harness speech recognition and machine-learning. Translation of websites is already a reality thanks to (still imperfect) Google Translate, and other projects are pushing the boundaries.

One example is Unbabel, a group that usesartificial intelligence to help human translation. The four-year-old company   based in San Francisco and Lisbon, and supported by Y Combinator, the seed-funding specialist   has developed a technological intermediary so that messages can be sent and received in a native tongue. It translates everything from customer-support emails to live chats.

When such technologies become seamless, they will be life-changing. As the 20th-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein put it:  If we spoke a different language, we would perceive a different world. 

Like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, Unbabel uses deep learning to process data and information it has not encountered before.

To ensure accuracy, it reviews translations using measures such as fluency, tones of speech and specialised terminology. It has to reach 90% accuracy; if not, the translation will be edited by one of the company s community of 55,000 human translators, who are all freelancers. Unbabel combines the strengths and limits the weaknesses of machine and human intelligence to achieve a high-quality translation,  says Vasco Pedro, the company s chief executive.

50 ideas to change the world

We asked readers, researchers and FT journalists to submit ideas with the potential to change the world. A panel of judges selected the 50 ideas worth looking at in more detail. The first tranche of 10 ideas are about meeting the challenges of a growing world population. The next 10 ideas, looking at solutions for growing energy and resource needs, will be published on January 8, 2018.

* Superfast land travel

* Urban congestion

* Translation technologies

* Six Japanese care robots to watch

* Toilet technologies

* Revolutionising reproduction

* Family planning

* Precision farming to save water and fertiliser

* Finding alternatives to meat

 Once the grunt work has been performed by machine, they [the translators] provide the  final and human touch , smoothing out hard-to-catch errors and ensuring the final result sounds fluent,  says Mr Pedro. He says that four years ago the community was made up mainly of translators and linguists, but as the technology evolved,  bilinguals with no professional experience became the majority .

Mr Pedro does not expect machines to take over.  We firmly believe that there will always be a human component [ &] the less work they do on individual tasks, the more work they are able to process on the whole,  he says. The company works across 28 languages and the technology is fast enough for almost-real-time video subtitling.

Another company that is prominent is Mymanu, of Manchester. It plans to launch a set of earbuds that translate as someone speaks.Danny Manu, the chief executive, came up with the idea after the lack of a translator at a meeting left him stranded. The wireless earbuds are paired with a smartphone and offer real-time translation in 37 languages.

 Mymanu Clik uses speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology and voice-recognition technology to deliver the live translation,  says Mr Manu.The company raised fundswith a Kickstarter campaign and is taking orders through its website. Mr Manu says his experiences abroad before Clik often left him despondent about his inability to connect with those around him.

Recalling an initial trip to China, he says:  It was like I was on a different planet   I was completely lost. But when I returned with my translation technology, I could learn more, speak to the people, learn about the culture and it motivated me to go back.

Self-driving finance could turn into a runaway train

The mysteries of bitcoin are turning heads yet again this week. At the start of the year, the digital token was worth $1,000; on Thursday, it breached $16,000. This is eye-popping, particularly given that so few investors actually understand how cryptocurrencies really work.

But amid this frenzy, here is a more startling idea to ponder: what is happening with bitcoin is not actually the most head-spinning technological development in finance today. Far from it. Away from the public gaze, there are a host of other digital innovations emerging that have attracted little public attention, yet have more far-reaching implications.

Consider the structure of markets. A few decades ago, most investors assumed that markets were a place where human brokers traded securities, on behalf of flesh-and-blood investors, driven by strategies devised in their brains (or investment committees).

But today that idea is as quaint as assuming that currencies are controlled by a central bank. Marko Kolanovic, a JPMorgan analyst, estimates that a mere 10 per cent of US equity market trading is actually now conducted by discretionary human traders; the rest is driven by various rules-based automatic investment systems, ranging from exchange traded funds to computerised highspeed trading programs.

Of course humans write this code, and sometimes oversee trades. But at a recent financial technology conference at Michigan Law School, regulators and academics estimated that computers are now generating around 50-70 per cent of trading in equity markets, 60 per cent of futures and more than 50 per cent of treasuries. Increasingly, machine learning and artificial intelligence are being added to the mix, to analyse data, trade securities and offer investment advice.

What we are seeing, in other words, is the rise of self-driving investment vehicles, matching the auto world. But while the sight of driverless cars on the roads has sparked public debate and scrutiny, that has not occurred with self-driving finance.

This needs to change. Theoretically, digital finance could deliver huge benefits. As the Basel-based Financial Stability Board noted in a report last month, computers trade faster and more accurately than humans, and analyse bigger volumes of data to exploit price differentials. In good times, that should make markets more liquid and efficient.

But, as with self-driving cars, there is a catch: technology is moving faster than politicians (or voters) understand, and outstripping the legal and regulatory frameworks. Nobody yet knows how to assign liability if a self-learning financial program goes haywire. "How are we supposed to think about intent?" asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University.

There are gaps in software laws. In the US, it is generally presumed that manufacturers have legal liability for product flaws. But as Washington's Office of Financial Research has noted, "software developers are not generally subject to US product liability requirements".

Another problem is regulatory fragmentation: although digital finance straddles geographical borders and asset classes, regulators do not. That creates a high risk that issues fall between the cracks. In turn, this fuels another issue: the technology is so fastmoving and opaque, that regulators find it hard to assess the cumulative impact or risks of contagion.

This is worrying. In recent years we have already seen some mysterious flash crashes, or sudden wild price swings, erupt in equity, bond, commodity and currency markets, apparently sparked by automated trading. This has not caused lasting damage, since these events were temporary and exchanges introduced measures to offset them in future. But nobody quite knows why these flash crashes keep occurring; and regulators admit that the arrival of AI will make it even harder to determine what is happening.

"Applications of AI and machine learning could result in new and unexpected forms of interconnectedness," the FSB notes, adding that the "lack of interpretability or 'auditability' of AI and machine learning methods could become a macro-level risk".

Digital evangelists will retort that since the arrival of the telegram, new technology has posed challenges for regulators; they also insist that the benefits of innovation more than offset the risks. Hopefully so. But the key point is this: just as we are scrutinising self-driving cars, we need to have a public debate about the computing revolution in finance. If the crazy antics of cryptocurrencies spur this, then bitcoin will have performed a public service.

No one knows who s liable if a program goes haywire, as regulators struggle to keep pace

The world s largest banks are pushing back on the introduction of bitcoin futures, raising concerns the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared.

On Thursday, the price of bitcoin climbed to a fresh record high of more than $14,000. Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset, but only via a regulated market. However, the planned launch in the next 10 days of futures contracts by established Chicago exchanges has prompted a backlash among the major brokers, who backstop trading across the industry. The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group whose members include all the largest Wall Street banks, said the rapid introduction of bitcoin futures  did not allow for proper public transparency and input .

Former Fed chair Alan Greenspan told CNBC on Wednesday that bitcoin was not a rational currency, yet Koreans are prepared to pay premiums of more than 20 per cent to get their virtual hands on it. The FT s Alphaville asks what happens when bitcoin s market cap overtakes world GDP. (FT, CNBC)

In the news

Putin to run for re-election

Russia s President Vladimir Putin is to run for re-election next year, putting him on course to extend his time in power to 24 years and become Russia s longest-serving leader since Joseph Stalin. Mr Putin, who has run Russia since 2000, said during a televised meeting with factory workers in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on Wednesday that he would run for a six-year term. (FT)

Cytora aims to revolutionise the insurance industry by using artificial intelligence

Former AIG chief executive Hank Greenberg, one of the biggest names in the insurance world, has backed a funding round for Cytora, a start-up aiming to revolutionise the industry by using artificial intelligence.

Mr Greenberg, now chairman of Starr Companies, has joined others including insurer QBE and Cambridge Innovation Capital, in backing the company in a 4.4m funding round.

Artificial intelligence is attracting huge excitement in insurance. Underwriters say that it could help them to make better assessments about the kind of risks that their customers present, leading to more accurate pricing. It could also help them to manage claims.

Mr Greenberg said:  With ever-increasing levels of available data, we can really see the benefits that artificial intelligence and other similar technological advances bring to the industry. We believe that Cytora can use this information in a powerful way to provide a competitive edge to Starr and its other clients. 

London-based Cytora was spun out of Cambridge university four years ago, but has only been focusing on insurance for the past 12 months.

Richard Hartley, chief executive, said:  We are working on questionless underwriting, moving the insurance industry to a point where you can deliver a superior underwriting profit while reducing the need to ask questions. 

He added:  Every company can be priced and ranked purely using data on the web and from external sources 	. 	. 	. 	Today a lot of underwriting is subjective. That s really bad for businesses as they get unfair pricing. Data will bring more objective pricing. 

Mr Hartley said his company s systems had thrown up some surprising results. Businesses located close to similar companies, for example, were better risks than those that are more isolated.

Some insurers are already planning to put Cytora s systems into practice. QBE will use Cytora s  risk engine  across its property and casualty lines from next year.

Richard Pryce, chief executive of QBE s European operations, said:  This is an incredibly innovative use of the ubiquitous open source data available. Combining external information with our own internal intelligence gives a more complete view of a risk which in turn enables QBE to provide protection to our customers at a fairer price that reflects the true level of exposure.

Pro Private Markets
Brookfield to Raise up to $10 Billion Private-Equity Fund in 2018

Real asset manager Brookfield Asset Management Inc. plans to return to market to raise its fifth global private-equity fund at the start of next year, targeting more than double the amount it raised for its fourth global fund less than 18 months ago, WSJ Pro Private Equity can reveal.

The fundraising plan illustrates the rapidity at which firms are returning to market amid an amenable climate for attracting capital that has been spurred by investors hungry for yield and disappointed by the relative underperformance of stocks.

Brookfield aims to collect between $8 billion and $10 billion for its latest global fund, more than twice the amount it gathered for its fourth fund in 2016, according to a person familiar with the matter. That last vehicle closed on $4 billion and exceeded its original fundraising target by about 14%.

With $240 billion of total funds under management, the Canadian asset manager's private-equity business is just a fraction of its overall assets, which largely comprise real assets such as real estate and energy holdings. The Toronto-based asset manager's private-equity arm, which spans five continents and employs about 50 investment professionals, has $28 billion of assets equaling about a 12% share of its overall holding.

The firm's private-equity strategy is to focus on companies that complement its real assets businesses, such as real estate, logistics and facilities management, though it also invests in financial services and has recently put capital toward the growing area of nonperforming loans.

This year its private-equity business secured an 85% stake in a U.K.-based road fuels provider Greenergy Fuels Holdings Ltd. and last year it agreed to buy a 70% stake in Brazil's largest water treatment and distribution business Odebrecht Ambiental SA. In 2015, it bought GrafTech international, which produces graphite products supplying the steel and electronics industries. However, last year it also plowed $1 billion into nonperforming loans in India in a deal with the State Bank of India to assist and manage its corporate debtors to bridge repayments.

This year has been record-beating for private-equity fund managers after both the largest global and European funds were raised in the asset class by Apollo Global Management LLC and CVC Capital Partners respectively.

Private capital fundraising hit a postcrisis high last year amid a surge of appetite from investors hungry for yield. The asset class's outperformance of the stock market has been rising since 2010, according to analytics firm Peracs' latest alpha benchmark report.

European private capital fundraising rose by 41% to around $127 billion in 2016 a post-2008 high and during the first nine months of this year the amount raised had already exceeded the whole of 2015, at $111 billion, according to Dow Jones & Co.'s LP Source database.

Many funds have been significantly oversubscribed in recent months, with PAI Partners receiving  15 billion of interest for its latest fund which closed this month, nearly quadruple the volume of capital targeted.

Management Top 250 (A Special Report) --- The Most Effectively Managed U.S. Companies -- and How They Got That Way: A landmark ranking puts Amazon on top, followed by Apple and Alphabet

A nearly century-old timber company is an unsung management gem. Investor-favorite blue chips haven't lost their luster in terms of how well they are run. And the tech giants shaping much of today's society are the most effectively managed U.S. companies.

Those are among the many insights revealed in the inaugural Management Top 250, a landmark ranking marking the first time the ideals and teachings of the late business guru Peter Drucker have been used to analyze and compare the performance of major U.S. companies. Hailed as the father of modern management, Mr. Drucker influenced generations of business leaders with his writings. His principles of what makes a well-managed organization have never before been translated into a quantitative model to measure how effectively a company is run.

The Management Top 250 does just that. The ranking -- compiled by the Drucker Institute, founded in 2007 to advance the ideals of the management sage -- differs from other "best of" lists in that it doesn't measure any single aspect of a company's prowess, such as profits or productivity. Rather it takes a holistic approach, examining how well a business does in five areas that reflect Mr. Drucker's core principles: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength.

Amazon.com Inc. tops the list of the nation's most effectively managed businesses. On the online retail juggernaut's heels are Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., in second and third place, respectively.

Tech behemoths International Business Machines Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. and Silicon Valley up-and-comer Nvidia Corp. take four of the other top 10 spots. Rounding out the Top 10 are old-line stalwarts Johnson & Johnson (No. 4), consumer-products giant Procter & Gamble Co. (tied with Microsoft at No. 6) and 3M Co. (No. 8), the company behind Post-it Notes and Ace bandages.

To measure a business's success in each dimension, the Drucker Institute scored how companies stacked up in 37 specific metrics, from market-share data to patent applications to employee ratings on the career-review site Glassdoor. The companies listed in the Management Top 250 are the highest scorers among 608 U.S. corporations studied that in the fall of 2016 belonged either to the S&P 500 stock index or Fortune 500 list or had a market value of more than $10 billion. The ranking methodology hasn't been formally peer reviewed.

Why do so many of the biggest names in tech -- some of which didn't even exist three decades ago -- make the Management Top 250 list?

For the most part, the tech companies at the top get high grades across all five categories, landing in all but a few instances in the upper 15% to 20% of the more than 600 companies analyzed by the Drucker Institute.

Amazon, Apple and Alphabet are innovation and customer-satisfaction standouts because so many of their products -- from cloud-computing platforms to smartphones to the burgeoning field of drones and driverless vehicles -- are reshaping entire industries as well as social behavior.

Tech firms such as Alphabet and Microsoft also contract out much of their front-line work. The official staff that remain tend to be highly paid and enjoy generous perks, a likely factor in those companies' high employee scores, says Rick Wartzman, director of the Drucker Institute's KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society. "Their workforces are the winners of the knowledge economy," he says.

No. 1 Amazon is actually one of the Management Top 250's most uneven performers. Within the larger universe of analyzed companies, it scored in the bottom 20% on social responsibility. The lackluster grade comes after years of critical news reports about the working conditions of its warehouse workers and poor marks from activists for not being more transparent about its environmental record. Yet, its mighty innovation score -- so high that it lies off the charts compared with other companies' scores -- catapulted it to first place.

Amazon, which has assembled a high-profile corporate-responsibility team over the past few years, declined to comment for this article.

The company's $20.85 billion research-and-development spending in the 12 months through September outstripped all other U.S. companies, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. It has kept ahead despite its swelling size by moving quickly and sticking to its founding principle of starting with the customer, says Reid Greenberg, executive vice president of digital and e-commerce at research and consulting firm Kantar Retail.

Its agility, he says, comes from grouping workers in small teams. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos instituted the "two-pizza team" concept, where the ideal team size is one that can be fed on two pizzas. When it was instituted in the early 2000s, it was "really jarring," says Eric Heller, CEO of Marketplace Ignition, a consulting firm for brands and retailers, and a former senior manager at Amazon. But by getting rid of bureaucratic layers, it fueled innovation. Each team owned projects as small as a single button on the website and was responsible for improvements.

At Amazon, potential product ideas get written up into dummy news releases that get marked up. Creators must answer questions such as the cost of the project, how much the product or service would sell for and the launch date.

It's always day one for Amazon -- "today we're starting day one of the next five years or the next 10 years and we're not dwelling in the past" -- says Mr. Greenberg. "That's really how the company thinks and breathes, and. . .that helps them maintain a competitive advantage."

The company's early emphasis on frugality led to creative ideas, the most impressive of which were rewarded with a highly coveted trophy that looked like a typical worker's desk. Ideas ranged from how to better affix shipping labels to packages to how to save money on conference-room equipment.

In contrast to Amazon, six companies were particularly consistent in their strengths, scoring in the top 15% to 20% in all five categories: Apple, Alphabet, P&G, 3M, Nike Inc. and Colgate-Palmolive.

The ranking and its approach can highlight strengths and weaknesses that might be otherwise harder to spot. While this is the first year the list has been published, the Drucker Institute calculated the performance for most companies back to 2012 to be able to identify potential trends. For instance, the score of Intel, ranked No. 14 overall, has steadily slipped over the past five years, weighed down by its customer-satisfaction grade as the chip maker has struggled to catch up to the mobile revolution. Intel has made big bets in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving as it moves into data-centric growth markets, but they have yet to bear fruit.

The ranking reveals a handful of hidden management champions that typically fly under the radar, such as Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman Corp., electrical-equipment maker Eaton Corp. and commercial real-estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle. And who knew that 17th-place Weyerhaeuser Co., a forest-products company with relatively little public name recognition, would score in the top 1% of companies in terms of innovation?

Weyerhaeuser, which owns or controls about 13 million acres of timberland in the U.S. and manages additional timberland under licenses in Canada, stands out for the resources it continues to dedicate to research and development, says Mark Wilde, managing director at BMO Capital Markets. Unlike many other forestry companies, many of which rely on universities and other outside institutions for research, Weyerhaeuser spent $17 million on R&D last year, much of which goes toward forestry management and determining which trees and methods yield the most valuable timber growth where.

In the timber industry, "they are the last man standing in terms of their own independent forestry research," Mr. Wilde says.

The Management Top 250 also provides both a counterpoint and insight into the critiques of activist investors who have targeted corporate stalwarts such as P&G and General Electric Co. Both companies score high -- P&G at No. 6 overall and GE in 20th place -- despite coming under pressure from Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP to revitalize profits.

P&G in particular scores in the top 2.5% of the more than 600 analyzed companies in terms of innovation and financial strength, the latter because brands such as Tide, Gillette and Tampax dominate so many consumer-product markets. Yet two of Mr. Peltz's chief criticisms are that the company isn't innovating enough and has let upstarts such as Dollar Shave Club cut into its market share. Indeed, a closer look at the metrics behind P&G's overall score affirm a slip in the company's overall market dominance in recent years, but from a very large position to begin with. "Yes, there are some red flags," Mr. Wartzman says of the data. But what you also see built into the ranking, he says, "is the excellence of their management over incredibly long periods of time."

P&G CEO David Taylor argues the company has taken steps to accelerate innovation in the two years since he became CEO and has won customers with new products or enhancements to existing brands.

"The point of contention is the rate of progress -- an activist investor often has a shorter time frame than a company that looks over many stakeholders," Mr. Taylor says, echoing the holistic philosophy behind the Drucker model. Over time, he adds, "it is a combination of a few key capabilities that determine whether you win: superior products that delight consumers, technology that sustains that. . .and what underpins it all is acquiring the best people."

Management Top 250 (A Special Report) --- Tech Innovation Isn't Just for Tech Firms: Among the companies scoring well in the category: Wal-Mart and P&G

Information-technology executives at companies of all kinds among the Management Top 250 have found ways to incorporate the best strategies from the technology sector to promote innovation, collaboration and new business models.

IT executives at companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. -- both among the 20 companies with the highest scores for innovation -- and Capital One Financial Corp. are taking on a more central role in the business, helping their companies adapt to the digital age. To that end, they're using cloud services and collaborative work models to speed up the development and delivery of technology, automating mundane work processes for employees and embracing cutting-edge technologies that add business value.

"We're modeling ourselves off the best technology companies out there," says Rob Alexander, Capital One's chief information officer. "Not legacy tech companies, but companies that have been built in the era of the cloud and the internet."

At Capital One, IT and business groups work together instead of in silos to develop, test, revise and deploy software in days and weeks instead of months and years. "We're taking software engineers who write code and putting them in the room with product owners who know the things they want to build," Mr. Alexander says.

Some features in Capital One's voice-controlled customer assistant and artificially intelligent chatbot were released in a few weeks with this process, he says. Such projects would have taken up to 18 months in the past, he says.

Capital One, which began migrating data and applications to Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services cloud in 2014, is on track to reduce its data centers from eight to three next year and expects to see cost benefits in the process, Mr. Alexander says.

The cloud has also been a godsend for Procter & Gamble. "What was previously cost-prohibitive is now cost-effective with the use of the cloud," says Javier Polit, P&G's chief information officer.

Cloud services have helped Procter & Gamble's data scientists deploy "game changing" data-analytics capabilities in recent years, Mr. Polit says. For example, analytics tools built in the cloud are helping create a smarter supply chain by helping managers better predict shifts in inventory, he says. One such tool drastically reduces out-of-stock and overstock inventory and is saving the company hundreds of millions of dollars annually, he says.

"We're able to forecast now in ways that we couldn't before," Mr. Polit says. "We've seen improvements in regards to the quantity of raw materials we buy, and the costs associated with ship and restock."

New technologies also have helped generate new lines of revenue for Procter & Gamble. For example, it offers an Oral B toothbrush that links over Bluetooth with a mobile app to alert users to problems with their brushing routines. Another mobile app the company launched last year can assess a customer's skin through advanced facial recognition and recommend particular products or skin-care regimens.

Mr. Polit says his teams are conducting "global industry scans" to find small and large business partners across the world -- those that have a clear grasp on technologies such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and robotic process automation, the term for automation of mundane processes with artificially intelligent software robots.

Process automation has freed up time for employees to work on more-strategic initiatives at companies including Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart. For instance, P&G is working toward automating as much as 90% of claims investigations in the accounts-receivable division next year, and a bot named Lucy helps quickly answer questions from employees about technical issues and benefits, Mr. Polit says. Early tests this year show the bots are increasing productivity in their areas by as much as 30%, he says.

In November, Wal-Mart posted its strongest sales growth in nearly a decade, boosted by a 50% jump in e-commerce sales from a year earlier, part of a broader effort to embrace digital technology. About 500 software robots have been deployed throughout the company, says Clay Johnson, executive vice president and enterprise chief information officer at Wal-Mart. Some AI-powered chatbots are used to answer employee questions. Others help workers sift through 30,000 pages of audit documents, and supervisor robots manage teams of bots to determine ways they can be more efficient, Mr. Johnson says.

Since he was appointed enterprise CIO in January, Mr. Johnson says he has tried to foster a culture of speed, agility and risk-taking throughout Wal-Mart's 10,000-person technology and services department, which includes employees and contractors.

He recently implemented a system in which IT employees are hyper-focused on specific technology applications for departments such as finance and human resources, whereas before, they would oversee multiple applications at once. That will allow IT teams to "fail fast and move quickly," particularly when employees want to tackle challenging projects such as integrating artificial-intelligence capabilities into software, he says.

Corporate IT has changed immensely over Mr. Johnson's two-decade career. But the pace of change has accelerated over the past two years, he says, as corporations have looked to IT departments to play a deeper role in the business.

"You're starting to see IT become a strategic, competitive advantage for the company," he says.

Senate Tax Revisions Mostly Favorable to Venture-Capital Firms; Carried interest and stock options get favorable treatment under current language

Corrections & Amplifications

"Don Dixon serves as managing director of Trident Capital and Trident Capital Cybersecurity. A correction on a previous version of this article incorrectly said that the title didn't apply to Trident Capital. (Dec. 5)

The Senate's passage of a proposed overhaul to the U.S. tax code caps a period of uncertainty for the tech industry, spurring a sigh of relief from venture-capital investors.

In the months leading up to the landmark bill, Silicon Valley was rife with uncertainty over how new provisions would treat partnership profits at venture firms and the taxation of employee stock options. Investors feared that changes to the carried-interest deduction, which is the roughly 20% share in the profits enjoyed by general partners of venture firms, would have weakened the incentives for taking risks on investment in private companies.

"Six months ago, there were a bunch of proposals that felt hostile to the entrepreneurial ecosystem and seemed targeted to harm the innovation economy we seem to have avoided most of them," said Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Ventures and former chairman of the National Venture Capital Association.

The GOP tax plan, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-passes-sweeping-revision-of-u-s-tax-code-1512197717", was a big victory for Republicans, lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. The tax measures, which also provide for a one-time tax cut to U.S. companies for repatriation of earnings and cash held overseas, stand to boost financial markets.

It will still require House and Senate reconciliation of the different versions, which lawmakers aim to do before Christmas.

"Chairman [Kevin] Brady actually came out here and listened," said Don Dixon, managing director at Trident Capital and Trident Capital Cybersecurity, of the House Ways and Means Committee chairman's commitment to talk with Silicon Valley.

Codified treatment of carried interest as long-term capital gains requiring a three-year holding period, versus a one-year holding time, is seen by many venture-capital investors as a reasonable compromise, particularly amid concerns over removing the deduction altogether.

"We want to encourage the long-term investing that leads to disruptive innovation," said Bob Ackerman, managing director of venture firm Allegis Cyber, via email.

Long-term holding requirements for the deduction might not be ideal in all situations, as some startups reach liquidity in a shorter time period.

"About 20% of deals get sold in less than three years," Mr. Dixon said.

Carried interest wasn't the only thing at stake for Silicon Valley, as startup employees faced a potential tax on unvested stock options. Now lawmakers propose deferring taxes until a liquidity event such as if the startup gets acquired or holds an initial public offering.

Initially there were worries that employees would become liable for taxes without a liquidity event, said Reza Zadeh, founder of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Matroid, a machine-learning startup.

"This change regarding option taxation is likely to be helpful to startups," Mr. Zadeh said. "It will help us recruit world-class talent and let those employees share in our success."

Imagine if you could pay anyone, anywhere in real time, using only your mobile phone. If you have ever struggled to find your IBAN number, or been shocked by the size the fee for a cross-border payment, this may sound like an impossible utopia.

Yet it is fast becoming a reality. The heads of several large European banks have told the Financial Times that they are in talks about jointly setting up a cross-border instant payments service.

The details are sketchy so far and the talks may not be very advanced. But one thing is clear: the decision by the banks to discuss teaming up is a response to the increasingly competitive landscape for payments in Europe.

As well as dozens of fintechs, such asTransferwiseor Azimo, offering to move money overseas quicker and more cheaply than the banks, there is growing interest in the payments space from big technology groups like Facebook, Google and Apple.

Several banks are already offering instant euro payments to some of their clients in Europe afterEBA Clearing launched a new real-time service last month. The so-called RT1 system is already being tested by 17 banks to handle more than  1m of transactions a day.

Andreas Treichl, chief executive of Austria s Erste Bank, told the FT last week it was talking to several other European lenders about creating a real-time payments service that would allow consumers to send money to each other and pay for goods across borders.

Mr Treichl said the talks were designed to see off the threat of technology companies like Paypal, which are offering consumers convenient, quick and low-cost payment services - such as its Venmo app in the US - by piggybacking on the banking system.

Paypal, which expects its revenues to grow by a fifth to almost $13bn this year - more than many European banks -boasts that it can send money in 25 currencies to millions of people around the world in only 20 seconds using their email address.

 We can kick Paypal out,  says Mr Treichl.  Some threats are an opportunity,  he adds, referring to the EU s second payment services directive, which will force banks to provide access to their customers  accounts for any fintechs that are given permission.

The new EU law, which comes into force early next year, is expected to intensify competition in the payments market. For banks, this is a double threat. It could shrink their market share and squeeze profit margins on their remaining business.

Potentially more painful, though, is the risk that banks lose control of the data on what their clients are doing, which could soon become the most valuable part of the payment transaction. This data could help banks to cross-sell other suitable products or to collate consumer spending trends and sell it to companies.

 It is all about keeping the relationship with the customer,  said Rune Bjerke, chief executive of Norway s DNB, another of the banks discussing the new pan-European instant payments service.

 We will lose some margin in some areas, but we will have revenue opportunities in others,  Mr Bjerke told the FT.  The value of information - that has not been part of the business model until recently, but it could be a revenue opportunity for banks. 

A PayPal spokesperson said: "No single company can realise the full potential of technology in financial services. It s going to take a great deal of collaboration, which is why we have agreed so many partnerships with major players in finance and technology in recent years, including with some companies long perceived to be our competitors."

Torry's Take: Beware the "Debt Trap"

Richmond Fed Selects McKinsey Executive Thomas Barkin as President

New Bank of Mexico Chief: All Options on the Table Ahead of Policy Meeting

BOJ's Kuroda Says Weak Yen Has Both a Positive and Negative Impact

Beware the "Debt Trap"

It is still party time in financial markets, but the Bank for International Settlements is warning that the hangover could be painful.

This isn't the first time the BIS has been the proverbial Grinch at ebullient financial markets' celebrations. The institution, based in Basel, Switzerland, has long warned that ultralow borrowing costs risk pushing asset valuations into risky territory.

Historically, higher interest rates have led to tighter financial conditions. Yet the Federal Reserve's rate increases -all four of them over a two-year stretch- don't appear to have cooled financial markets.

Quite the contrary. Since the Fed raised rates in December 2015 for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained nearly 37%. This worries economists at the BIS since low borrowing costs and loose financial conditions are encouraging consumers and businesses to take on more debt, perhaps more than they can afford if the economy takes a turn for the worse.

In its latest quarterly report, the BIS highlighted similarities between current monetary conditions and the mid-2000s, just before the housing market tanked. Ahead of the financial crisis, long-term rates declined despite increases in the Fed's short-term benchmark rate, a development then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan described as a "conundrum."

Bringing rates up to a more normal level today appears to be hampered by high levels of debt in many major economies, according to the BIS. That poses a conundrum: economies with higher debt are more sensitive to higher interest rates, so central banks might be more cautious about raising rates there. That, in turn, raises the risk of a so-called debt trap: "high debt makes it harder to raise rates, but keeping rates low induces further debt accumulation."

There are no easy answers, as Bank of England policy maker Gertjan Vlieghe pointed out early last year.

"A high debt economy faces headwinds and needs lower interest rates. A high debt economy with adverse demographic trends needs even lower interest rates. And a high debt economy with adverse demographic trends and higher inequality  & well, you get the picture."

Key Developments Around the World

Richmond Fed Selects McKinsey Executive Thomas Barkin as President

By David Harrison and Nick Timiraos

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has selected Thomas Barkin, a top executive at McKinsey & Co., as its next president and chief executive, the bank said Monday.

Mr. Barkin, 56 years old, succeeds Jeffrey Lacker, who stepped down from his post in April after admitting his involvement in the unauthorized disclosure of internal Fed information to an analyst in 2012.

Mr. Barkin has worked for McKinsey for about 30 years and is based in the firm's Atlanta office, where his clients include financial institutions and travel and transportation companies. He is currently the global consulting firm's chief risk officer and previously served as its finance chief.

From 2009 to 2014, he sat on the board of directors of the Atlanta Fed, serving as chairman in 2013 and 2014. He studied economics as an undergraduate at Harvard University and earned law and business school degrees there as well. Mr. Barkin will start his new job Jan. 1.

"Tom's exceptional academic credentials, his analytical and research-based thought leadership, combined with his understanding of the Federal Reserve System, were important considerations for this key leadership role," said Margaret Lewis, who chaired the Richmond Fed's search committee. Ms. Lewis also highlighted Mr. Baskin's experience leading information technology efforts at McKinsey. The Richmond Fed plays key roles in implementing and overseeing information technology for the Fed system.

The selection of Mr. Barkin, who is white, disappointed critics who have said the system lacks diverse leadership and have urged reserve bank directors to replace their retiring leaders with candidates who would better reflect the nation as a whole.

In March, the Atlanta Fed named Raphael Bostic, an economist who has specialized in housing issues, as the first African-American president of a reserve bank in the 104-year history of the system. Two of the 12 Fed banks are led by women, and one is led by an American whose parents are from India.

The Richmond Fed had said it was looking to identify diverse candidates with strong backgrounds in economics, finance and information technology.

"They spent a whole year doing a search, and they came up with somebody who doesn't seem to meet their stated criteria or bring diversity," said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC, a New York economics advisory firm. "I don't know how long [the Fed] can keep talking about diversity as a priority and not deliver."

The criticism was echoed by Fed Up, an advocacy campaign that has pushed the Fed to make the selection process for bank presidents more transparent and to pick more diverse candidates. Before Mr. Bostic's appointment, the last three new bank presidents were men who had either worked for Goldman Sachs or served as trustees at Goldman.

Congressional Democrats led by California's Maxine Waters, the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, wrote twice this year to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and to Ms. Lewis asking them to consider "minority, gender and occupational diversity" in its search for a new Richmond boss.

In a statement released by the Richmond Fed, Mr. Barkin said he plans "to be heavily engaged across the Fifth District to learn more about the challenges and opportunities facing our communities and bringing these perspectives forward as part of my monetary policy considerations and contributions."

Mr. Barkin's appointment breaks new ground in one way: He will be the first leader of the Richmond Fed who hasn't worked for the bank since the institution was founded in 1914.

The critiques of Mr. Barkin's selection illustrate how the search committee tasked with replacing retiring New York Fed President William Dudley will face scrutiny. Mr. Dudley has said he plans to leave the bank in the middle of 2018 once a successor is found.

"We make better decisions when we have diverse voices around the table," Fed governor Jerome Powell, who President Donald Trump has nominated to succeed Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, said at his Senate confirmation hearing last week. "It's about recruiting. It's about going out of your way to bring people in."

Some critics say the Fed banks face a collective action problem when it comes to appointing more diverse leadership because each bank primarily views its responsibility as picking the candidate it feels is the best fit for the institution ahead of improving the diversity of the overall system. "How do you make sure that those individual decisions add up to your objective of increasing diversity? There is nothing in the process to ensure that," said Ms. Coronado.

The heads of the Fed's 12 reserve banks are chosen by the nonbank directors of each institution. Finalists must also interview with and win approval from the Fed's Washington-based board of governors. The Richmond Fed began its search in January, when Mr. Lacker originally said he would retire this October.

Mr. Barkin isn't an academic and doesn't have a published body of work that indicates how he will weigh in on key monetary policy debates facing the Fed over inflation, labor markets and interest rates. He will serve as a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee next year.

Mr. Barkin has deep civic ties in the Atlanta area, where he has served on the executive committee of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and the board of trustees at Emory University. In the last 15 years, he has made two donations to candidates for federal offices, both Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

New Bank of Mexico Chief: All Options on the Table Ahead of Policy Meeting

By Juan Montes

MEXICO CITY The new governor of the Bank of Mexico said Monday that all options are on the table ahead of next week's policy decision, his first at the helm of the bank, as inflation remains above expectations and the U.S. Federal Reserve has hinted at a December rate increase.

Mexico's central bank has been on hold since June after a prolonged cycle of interest-rate increases that put borrowing costs at 7%, the highest since early 2009.

But Alejandro Daz de Len, in one of his first interviews since taking up the post Friday, made it clear the bank is concerned about the uncertain backdrop.

"We are concerned about what we have seen in the recent months &We are fully aware of the complex backdrop we are facing; inflation has been considerably impacted and it hasn't come down as quickly as expected," he said at the central bank's headquarters in Mexico City.

Mr. Daz de Len said the central bank would be "extremely prudent." He suggested that inflation data for November to be reported later this week and the Fed's December rate decision would be key factors in the bank's policy decision.

Most analysts expect the Bank of Mexico to keep rates unchanged next week, although several say an increase can't be ruled out as annual inflation, currently at 6.6%, remains stubbornly above the 3% target. The Bank of Mexico's policy meeting is Dec. 14.

Mr. Daz de Len's wooden-paneled office was occupied until last week by Agustn Carstens, who left after nearly eight years to become the head of the Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements. The ancient maps that had decorated one of the office's walls Mr. Carstens was known for being an avid collector have been replaced by a large abstract painting in blue and black hues.

The appointment of Mr. Daz de Len, who has been a deputy governor at the bank for the past year, spells continuity of Mr. Carstens's handling of monetary policy and the bank's focus on inflation. Mr. Carstens was Mr. Diaz de Len's boss in the 1990s when both were at the central bank as staff officials.

Mr. Daz de Len, a U.S.-educated technocrat with more than 25 years of experience in public service, takes over the bank at a turbulent time. Inflation accelerated in early November to 6.6%, surprising investors and the central bank itself, while the Mexican peso is likely to face bouts of volatility in the coming months as the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Canada enters a critical phase, and Mexico's July presidential election approaches.

Regarding the Nafta talks, Mr. Daz de Len said that "it's difficult to think that all possible scenarios are incorporated in the exchange rate, as the range of possible outcomes is wide," from highly positive to highly negative.

The Bank of Mexico, which is known for its orthodoxy, raised interest rates by 4 percentage points between December 2015 and June of this year. Inflation suffered different shocks, from a weaker peso that pushed up import costs to a 20% rise in gasoline prices at the beginning of the year as the government gradually removed price caps for motor fuels.

Still, Mr. Diaz de Len said the bank's goal to have inflation near the 3% target by the end of next year is achievable, assuming the peso remains stable.

Mr. Daz de Len faces the challenge of imprinting his own style on the bank following the departure of Mr. Carstens, who is well known in Mexico and on the international financial stage.

The new governor said the bank is evaluating whether to make public how each one of the five board members votes at policy meetings, a move that could increase the accountability of the bank. Unlike the Fed and some other central banks, the Bank of Mexico doesn't reveal how individual members vote when there is a split decision.

Mr. Daz de Len studied economics at Mexico's private ITAM university, and earned a master's degree in public and private administration from Yale University.

From 2011 to 2015, he was in charge of public credit at the Finance Ministry where he managed Mexico's public debt under both Jos Antonio Meade, a former finance minister set to be the ruling party's candidate in next year's election, and Luis Videgaray, currently Mexico's foreign minister.

Those political connections have raised some eyebrows, but Mr. Daz de Len rejected the idea that it could compromise central bank autonomy.

"At the end of the day, it's actions that matter," he said. Those experiences were useful for professional development, "but in no way do they condition my way of evaluating things and taking decisions &I am very clear that my responsibility is to preserve and consolidate and maintain that autonomy that has served Mexico well."

BOJ's Kuroda Says Weak Yen Has Both a Positive and Negative Impact

By Megumi Fujikawa

TOKYO Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said Tuesday a weak yen could have both a positive and negative impact, avoiding directly addressing an opposition lawmaker's question if the BOJ is willing to adopt monetary policy to weaken the yen.

"It is true that the weak yen pushes up prices through rises in import prices," Mr. Kuroda said in a parliamentary committee.

While falls in the Japanese currency could inflate exporters' profits, they could also weigh on non-manufacturers and households through higher import costs, Mr. Kuroda said.

Asked about potential risks of the BOJ's aggressive easing, Mr. Kuroda said it wouldn't hurt the yen's credibility and pledged to keep the current easing program in place.

"It is still distant from our 2% price goal. It is necessary to patiently continue powerful easing" under the current yield-curve-control policy, he added.

Mr. Kuroda also repeated that it would be presumptuous to say whether he was willing to serve another five-year term.

Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Kuroda met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe but he said the two leaders didn't discuss the possibility of Mr. Kuroda staying on as the head of the central bank.

Mr. Kuroda's term as BOJ governor ends next spring and though he looks well positioned to stay on in his post, Mr. Abe has said that the decision remains a blank sheet.

The meeting between the prime minister and the BOJ governor was the first at the Prime Minister's Office in more than six months. They hold the meetings on a fairly regular basis to exchange views over the economy and markets, but rarely disclose what other topics they might have discussed.

Mr. Kuroda said he told the prime minister that the global economy was on a solid growth path with improvements in advanced economies, as well as emerging nations, and that the Japanese economy was also in a good shape led both by both external and domestic demand.

Australia's RBA Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged

By James Glynn

SYDNEY The Reserve Bank of Australia has ended 2017 without a change in interest rates, with next year promising to deliver more of the same.

The central bank's board kept its cash rate target at a record low of 1.5% Tuesday as universally expected by economists.

The bank's holding pattern, stretching back to August 2016, leaves the RBA lagging many of its global counterparts, including the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, which have already raised interest rates this year, or are preparing to reduce the level of policy accommodation.

The decision comes after RBA Governor Philip Lowe told economists in late November there was no compelling case for a change in interest rates.

When announcing the on-hold decision Gov. Lowe reiterated Tuesday that the board judged that "holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time."

Foremost in the minds of policy makers are record low wages growth, ongoing slack in the job market and a dearth of inflation pressures.

That weakness comes with consumers reluctant to spend more, weighed down by record household debt and concerns that incomes aren't growing.

Still, there are signs of some pep building in the economy, with investment strengthening, jobs growth improving, and profits high. All that comes as business surveys indicate firms are experiencing the best conditions in 20 years.

Economists expect the impression of a two-speed economy will keep policy makers watchful, unlikely to either raise or lower interest rates for the foreseeable future.

Portugal's Mrio Centeno Chosen to Lead Eurozone Finance Ministers

By Todd Buell in Brussels and Jeannette Neumann in Madrid

BRUSSELS European Finance Ministers on Monday shifted power from the north of the continent to the south, providing a boost to opponents of austerity policies.

They chose Portugal's Finance Minister Mrio Centeno to lead the group of finance ministers, known as the Eurogroup, which steers policy in the eurozone. Mr. Centeno's peers elected him to succeed former Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem as president of the group, which plays an essential role in important eurozone policy discussions, such as those pertaining to Greece's bailout.

The press office of the European Council said in a Monday Twitter post: "#Eurogroup just elected Mrio Centeno, Minister of Finance of Portugal, as its new President. He will take office on 13 January 2018."

Mr. Centeno has been Portugal's finance minister since November 2015, when Socialist leader Antnio Costa was appointed prime minister. Since then, the 50-year-old Mr. Centeno has helped to oversee Portugal's continued recovery from a crisis-era bailout. Unemployment has fallen and once-teetering banks in Portugal, a country of 10.3 million inhabitants, have generally stabilized. Credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's raised Portugal's debt to investment grade from junk in mid-September.

Opponents of austerity policy welcomed the selection of Mr. Centeno, whose country has in recent years rejected the spending cuts often pushed by European authorities and northern European countries. Sven Giegold of the Green group in the European Parliament, said that Mr. Centeno was the "anti-Schuble among Europe's finance ministers," a dig at former German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schuble, a staunch advocate of balanced budgets.

"Portugal has successfully refuted the austerity dogma. Centeno has shown that, after the necessary structural reforms, investing is the right way forward. The country is recovering not in spite of the fact that it is raising pensions and incomes, but because of it," Mr. Giegold said.

Mr. Centeno could face a problem at home, however. Two parties maintaining his government are euroskeptic. Asked about this at a press conference Monday, Mr. Centeno ducked, saying that in his capacity as president-elect of the Eurogroup it wasn't appropriate for him to discuss domestic questions. "Domestic policies are addressed domestically," he said. He added it was the "firm determination" of the Portuguese government "to contribute to the construction of the European Union and of the eurozone. We will continue in this vein."

Mr. Centeno was an economist at Portugal's central bank from 2000 to 2004, when he was appointed deputy director of the bank's economic studies department, a post he held until 2013. He then served as an adviser to the Bank of Portugal's board of directors. From 2004 to 2013, he was a member of the European Commission's economic policy committee, according to his official biography.

Mr. Centeno completed a Ph.D. in economics in 2000 from Harvard University, where he also earned a Master of Science in economics.

Resigned to Not Getting Special Treatment, London's Bankers Brace for Brexit

By Max Colchester

After Britain voted for Brexit, the U.K.'s finance industry launched a vast lobbying offensive: The European Union had better help London's banks, or the continent's businesses and consumers would suffer.

That pitch hasn't worked.

Bankers in London, in private conversations and public comments, say they're now resigned to not getting any special treatment. They're moving from contingency planning for Brexit to executing those plans. "We are prepared for the most severe outcome," Barclays PLC Chairman John McFarlane told a U.K. parliament committee.

The reason for the gloom: European officials are playing hardball, saying financial services aren't high on their list of Brexit worries, according to people familiar with their thinking. And so far there appears to be muted political appetite in the U.K. to press the matter.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels Monday for talks with EU counterparts aimed at breaking a serious deadlock in negotiations. But even if those talks succeed, focus will then likely switch to several more-pressing matters, including strategies for keeping complex manufacturing supply chains humming across the continent, European officials say.

Britain's bank lobbyists have argued that centralization of financial services in London promotes efficiencies that keep costs down for consumers across the trade bloc. They also say that bruising London's investment banks will harm an EU attempt to create a capital-markets union across the trade bloc.

But those arguments haven't resonated. On Wednesday Andrew Bailey, one of the U.K.'s top banking regulators, said that his European counterparts "don't put a lot of weight" in them. Michel Barnier, who is leading the negotiations for the EU, recently played down the notion that financial services would get special treatment during negotiations. "Brexit means Brexit everywhere," he said.

For years the U.K. acted as Europe's de facto investment bank. About 90% of euro-denominated interest-rate swaps flow through London-based clearinghouses. Banks from across the world built up offices in London to service clients across Europe and beyond.

After Brexit, banks based in the U.K. are likely to lose their right to sell to customers across the EU. There is a pricey but practical solution: Create a hub in the EU. Bankers and capital are considered relatively mobile. "There will be pragmatic solutions found," says Jean Pierre Mustier, chief executive of Italy's UniCredit SpA.

The initial unwinding is unlikely to be huge, bankers say. The Bank of England expects 10,000 banking jobs to have left by March 2019, the time of the U.K.'s expected departure. That's around 2% of people employed in the City of London. Big banks' preparations are well under way, according to people familiar with them. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has leased more office space in Frankfurt. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. booked spaces in a school in the German city for future employees' children. Morgan Stanley is pushing ahead with license applications in Europe. Barclays is hunting for board members for its future European hub in Ireland.

The scaling-up of these operations will be gradual. Take Bank of America Corp., for instance. It plans to move around 200 people in sales and trading to Paris and Frankfurt. The bank has leased office space in Paris that will take several months to refurbish. It aims to start putting more staff into its Paris office in the latter half of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter. It's still unclear exactly how many staffers will have to move into its EU hub. "We'll see what actually happens and what they allow us to do and don't do," Bank of America's chief operating officer Tom Montag said at a recent conference.

Over time European regulators could require that international banks bolster their presence in the EU. The European Central Bank has warned lenders not to game the system by setting up lightweight entities that just shuffle risk back to their London offices. "We won't accept more inventive setups," Sabine Lautenschlger, a member of the ECB's executive board, said recently.

Bank executives believe it could take years for the horse-trading over future trade agreements between the U.K. and the EU to play out. And banks don't have time on their side. It can take around two years to create a fully licensed and capitalized European banking hub, according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Banks want time after Brexit in 2019 to get their businesses in order. But finding a legally binding way to maintain the regulatory status quo after the U.K. has left the EU is proving complex.

"It is work in progress," says Barclays's Mr. McFarlane. "We are trying to find that solution, and we have not found it so far."

Banks don't want to risk alienating European clients, so they have to have a fall-back plan in case negotiations collapse. Once money is spent on new European offices replete with technology and licenses, "it's hard not to use them," says one senior U.S. banker.

Quick Hits: Kuroda Says Fintech Is Changing Definition of Systemic Importance

Kuroda: Fintech Changing Definition of Systemic Importance

The emergence of fintech is changing the definition of systemic importance in the banking industry, said Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda at a Paris Europlace forum in Tokyo. In the traditional definition, the systemic importance is measured by the size of a bank's balance sheet, he said. But in the digital world, "factors such as global IT platforms, the huge volumes of big data and widely used algorithms might become more systemically important from the viewpoint of financial stability."

Kuroda: Fintech Can Help Boost Growth Potential

Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday said fintech could boost economic growth potential through enhancing productivity not just in finance but through creating new networks between the sector and others such as the Internet of Things and the sharing economy. The Bank of Japan has been unsuccessful for years in its efforts to get the country's inflation to 2%. Partly hurting the cause is online shopping's pressure on overall prices.

 Megumi Fujikawa

Kuroda Still Worried About Protectionism

Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda remains concerned about protectionist tendencies in some countries, and he hopes those nations will stick with bilateral trade partnerships with Japan or build further relationships. He didn't name any specific nations in his comments at the Paris Europlace financial forum in Tokyo. The U.S. and Japan have been working closely on a bilateral deal with the U.S. having abandoned the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. During last month's trip to Tokyo, U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for Japan to buy "massive" amounts of military equipment from the U.S.

What's Behind Ebbing Indonesian Inflation?

Inflation continued to ebb in Indonesia last month, which may reflect success of the government and central bank in controlling prices. The central bank has been tirelessly urging local authorities to cap inflation in their jurisdictions while police have arrested those found manipulating prices of basic food commodities. On the downside, ebbing inflation may also signal that purchasing power remains lackluster. The November consumer-price index rose 3.3% on year, versus October's 3.6%. After rising just 0.01% sequentially that month, November's figure increased 0.2%, the official Statistics Agency said.

Turkey's Annual Inflation Rate Rises in November

Turkey's annual inflation rate in November jumped to its highest level in 14 years, as food prices remain elevated, bolstering expectations that the central bank may tighten monetary policy at its meeting next week. The annual consumer-price index rose to 12.98% in November the highest reading since 2003 from 11.9% in October, the state statistics agency said Monday. This exceeded forecasts in a survey by The Wall Street Journal and is more than double the central bank's 5% inflation target. After the data, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek tweeted on his official Twitter account that a persistent downward trend in inflation is likely from December onward. "The government will provide the necessary support to achieve a lasting reduction in inflation," Mr. Simsek tweeted. The central bank last month raised the year-end inflation forecast to 9.8% from 8.7%, while policy makers lifted their inflation estimate for next year to 7% from 6.4%, citing the recent depreciation of the Turkish lira. Turkish lira slumped 15% against the dollar since mid-September due to concerns over central bank policy and strained relations between the U.S. and Turkey. The central bank recently took a series of measures to counter the falling value of the Turkish lira and raised average funding costs for banks by 0.25 percentage points to 12.25%.

Greek Economy Grows for Third Consecutive Quarter

Greece's economy grew for a third consecutive quarter for the first time in more than a decade, but at a slower pace, according to figures published Monday. The latest snapshot of the Greek economy shows the country is on course for returning to growth this year after being in recession for most of the past decade. But the slower pace of expansion makes it more challenging to reach the already downwardly revised annual growth target of 1.6% set by Greece and its European creditors. Gross domestic product increased by 0.3% in the July-to-September period from the previous quarter, compared with an upwardly revised 0.8% growth in the second quarter, data from Greece's statistics service Elstat showed.

QE-to-Issuance Argues Against ECB/Fed Comparisons: Deutsche Bank

There is good reason not to use the experience of the U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative-easing tapering to predict what happens when the European Central Bank reduces its own purchases: The ratio of purchases-to-net government bond issuance is much higher in Europe, according to Deutsche Bank. In fact, Fed purchases never exceeded net Treasury issuance. On the other hand, the size of ECB purchases is seven times that of net issuance. Therefore, the ECB's withdrawal is much more significant in relative terms and could create more volatility, Deutsche says.

ECB QE Tapering Could Boost IG-Junk Gap

The gap between investment-grade and junk euro corporate bonds, measured by spread ratios and spread differentials, remains near its tightest levels on record, but the European Central Bank's quantitative-easing tapering could boost it, Deutsche Bank says in its 2018 credit outlook. The so-called corporate-sector purchase program should remain largely unscathed as other QE schemes bear the brunt of tapering. This should continue to support investment-grade spreads. But the overall tapering of QE should reduce broader market support, weighing on junk bonds, the bank adds.

Bank of Canada  Cannot Ignore' Strong Jobs Market

Strong employment gains and a gradual pickup in inflation will compel the Bank of Canada to raise rates in 2018 by more than the markets anticipate, says the economics team at National Bank Financial. The firm has a solid track record on the rate outlook, as it was among the first in Canada to predict rate rises this year when most forecasters anticipated they wouldn't start until next year. NBF says the BOC "just cannot ignore the strong labor market," which added nearly 80,000 jobs in November while the jobless rate fell to a near-decade low and below the 6% level. NBF adds that it "would not be surprised," if USD/CAD revisits the 1.25 level in early 2018 as the BOC again embraces a hawkish tilt.

RBA to Keep Rate, Forecasts Unchanged

The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate at 1.5% at its last meeting of the year on Tuesday, according to Morgan Stanley. "Governor [Philip] Lowe has said that the RBA's main focus is on wage growth so, even with stronger capex expectations and stabilizing iron ore prices, it will be hard to strike a hawkish tone." The RBA isn't likely to update any forecasts either, Morgan Stanley says.

Why Some Times Are Different: Macroeconomic Policy and the Aftermath of Financial Crises

How much a country's output declines after a financial crisis can, in part, be explained by how much monetary and fiscal policy maneuvering room policy makers had prior to the downturn, "that is, whether the policy interest rate is above the zero lower bound and whether the debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively low," Christina Romer and David Romer "http://papers.nber.org/tmp/3928-w23931.pdf" in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper. The decline in output is less than 1% after a crisis if a country had both monetary and fiscal space to change policy, while that decline was about 10% if a country had neither. "We find that monetary and fiscal policy are used more aggressively when policy space is ample. Financial distress itself is also less persistent when there is policy space," they write.

Aggregate Productivity and the Rise of Mark-Ups

The slowdown in pure technology growth could be even slower than suggested by aggregate productivity statistics, David Baqaee and Emmanuel Farhi "http://voxeu.org/article/aggregate-productivity-and-rise-mark-ups" in a VoxEU column. "Mounting evidence suggests that average mark-ups in the US economy have been increasing. [We] argues that about half of measured aggregate productivity growth over the last 20 years can be accounted for by firms with higher mark-ups increasing their relative size," they write.

The Effectiveness of Macroprudential Measures

Macroprudential measures "http://voxeu.org/article/new-evidence-effectiveness-macroprudential-measures" and limit the risks assumed by lenders, according to an analysis by Yener Altunba_, Mahir Binici, Leonardo Gambacorta and Andres Murcia. "A tightening of macroprudential measures is associated with an average reduction of annual credit growth of 4.6% after three months, and 7.2% after one year," they write on VoxEU. "However, the propagation of the effects is quite heterogeneous across macroprudential tools   it is more rapid for prudential measures that aim at dampening the cycle (the effects are significant after one quarter) than for those aimed at fostering resilience (the effects materialise within a year). Finally, the effectiveness of macroprudential measures on credit growth is affected by monetary policy conditions. In particular, macroprudential tools that were adjusted to reinforce monetary policy (i.e. pushed in the same direction, when both were tightened or eased) were relatively more effective."

Optimal Quantitative Easing

Central banks should not have a permanently enlarged balance sheet, "https://bankunderground.co.uk/2017/12/04/optimal-quantitative-easing/"of quantitative easing in the decades to come, according to Richard Harrison's modeling of the way in which that form of stimulus works. " Active' QE improves welfare precisely because it is active," writes the Bank of England economist. "It works through an expectations channel: bond holders recognise that the central bank will activate QE if and when the short-term rate hits its lower bound. If the central bank merely holds a fixed proportion of long-term debt on its balance sheet, then it will not replicate this feature of an active QE policy. Though the model does not support the idea that central banks should maintain permanently large balance sheets, it does suggest that we may see more quantitative easing in the future."

Greece's Dangerous Budget Surplus

"At first glance, Greece's traumatic 2015 bailout its third in five years appears to be working. The government's budget is back in surplus, excluding debt service, after the years of deficits that contributed to the country's first crisis in 2010," Yannis Palaiologos "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greeces-dangerous-budget-surplus-1512337875" for The Wall Street Journal. "The radical leftist prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, now touts the "restoration of Greece's fiscal credibility." As recently as 2014 he savaged his predecessor, who achieved much lower surpluses, for "austerity." The only problem is that the bailout is not in fact working, if you think the goal should be to restore Athens to sound public finances and to offer Greeks economic hope for the future."

Trump's Economic Revolution Is All About Investment

"I've seen hundreds of articles on President Donald Trump and trade, but the real significance of the Trump economic revolution -- for better or worse -- is a focus on investment. There is no coordinating mastermind, but if you consider the intersection between what the Trumpian nationalists want and what a Republican Congress will deliver, it's this: wanting to make the U.S. a new and dominant center for investment, including at the expense of other nations," Tyler Cowen "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-04/trump-s-economic-revolution-is-all-about-investment" for Bloomberg View.

Easing U.S. Financial Conditions Put Investors on Alert

"U.S. financial conditions have eased to their loosest levels in decades, according to numerous popular barometers, despite a shift in central bank policy that investors fret could have a consequential impact on markets. Measures from the St. Louis and Chicago Federal Reserves and a number of banks including Goldman Sachs show a rally in US stocks and weakness in the dollar, as well as ample access to credit, have helped ease business conditions and financial market stress," Eric Platt "https://www.ft.com/content/dd5d087a-d6f0-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44" for the Financial Times. "Financial conditions refer to the impact of currency movements, bond yields, volatility, money flows and the stock market on the real economy. With policymakers set to rein in bond-buying programmes and raise interest rates off historic lows, investors are agonising over how the shifts will filter back into markets and the economy."

The U.S "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-accuses-chinese-banks-but-treads-lightly-1512388800" only one small Chinese bank with sanctions so far, even though American officials and analysts believe financial institutions in China represent key nodes in Pyongyang's illicit finance network. With North Korea now boasting that it has the entire U.S. in range of its missiles, the Trump administration has navigated a diplomatic path between the threat of stronger unilateral action and giving China room to act on its own, which officials say has yielded a measure of success even as the threat has grown.

Greece and its international creditors "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-creditors-reach-deal-on-latest-reforms-1512248235" on the measures Athens must adopt, thus paving the way for the disbursement of around  5 billion ($5.95 billion) in funds next month and bringing the country a step closer to the end of years of bailout regimes.

Citi poaches eBay s chief data officer in Asian retail push

Banks push back against tech groups  raiding of their digital talent

Citigroup has poached eBay s chief data officer to head up data and analytics for its retail operations in Asia, a sign that banks are pushing back against a trend that is sapping their talent to feed a boom in financial services at competing tech companies.

In recent years, technology groups in the US and Asia have expanded into financial services, and have looked to executives at global banks to help make investments and drive new lines of business.

The flow of talent from banks to tech groups has been viewed as a coup for financial services outside of the banking industry, and a sign that traditional financial institutions are losing their edge.

Google, for example, hired Morgan Stanley chief financial officer Ruth Porat in 2015 to take a similar role at the US internet group. The same year, Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba poached Michael Evans, formerly vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, to lead its overseas expansion.

While most of the movement in top talent has been away from financial institutions, global banks are starting to poach from large internet companies.

 I think where you are seeing this is in the highly technical roles, where banks have traditionally lacked talent,  said John Mallally, a director for financial services at recruitment consultancy Robert Walters Hong Kong.  If you look at absolute numbers, banks are probably hiring more from tech companies, but at a lower level of talent. But we are still seeing the prime talent go in the other direction. 

Citi said on Monday it had hired Zoher Karu, who led eBay s data operations since 2013. Before that he was head of marketing analytics at Sears, the US department store.

Along with peers HSBC and Standard Chartered, Citi is competing for a share of Asia s valuable retail banking market. The bank has sought to appeal to a generation of young, wealthy clients that prefer to bank on their mobile phones as opposed to visiting physical branches.

But it also faces competition from local companies, such as Ant Financial in China and Kakao Bank in Korea, which already operate strong digital banking and electronic payments franchises.

Kakao Bank opened 300,000 new accounts within its first 24 hours of business when it launched in June this year, demonstrating pent up demand for fully digital banking services in the country.

By tapping into client data, Citi says it can tailor more suitable product offerings to clients.

Mr Karu will oversee data and analytics at the US bank s expanding digital retail franchise in Asia, covering 17 markets.

Over the past year, Citi has made several technology hires to its bank. In June, it appointed Shinjini Kumar to head retail operations in India. She was previously the chief executive at Paytm, an Indian payments and ecommerce company. It has also hired executives from PayPal and Amazon to its financial technology operations Citi FinTech.

In November, HSBC said it had hired the former Europe chairman of Google payments, Mike Warriner, as chief information officer for its retail bank. Tesco s chief digital officer Thomas Nielsen moved to Deutsche Bank in September to take a similar job for the bank s global transactions business.

Central banking has never looked more daunting

OPINION

T he Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has just celebrated its 20th birthday. In its first decade, growth was steady and inflation close to target. We   along with our peers   thought we had this central banking business cracked. Nemesis arrived in the shape of the global financial crisis. Rates have been rock bottom ever since and central banks' balance sheets have ballooned. Banking regulations are being tightened. And macroprudential policy is still a work in progress. Central banking has never looked more daunting.

The past couple of decades have witnessed a remorseless fall in the real rate of interest consistent with macroecoregion nomic equilibrium   the "natural" rate. The causes are still a matter of debate. Some point to higher savings, others to the impact of slow productivity growth on investment. Balance-sheet repair has surely been important, too.

While central banks can set any policy rate they want in the short run, if they are to achieve their objectives over the long term it must converge to the sum of the natural rate and their target inflation rate. Criticism from politicians that central banks' policies are penalising savers and driving up asset prices misses the point: the decline in interest rates ultimately reflects forces that central bankers are powerless to change. Does the current state of affairs represent a new normal? Some rebound in the natural rate may be in the offing. The global demographics are at a turning point, with a substantial fall in the share of the middle aged relative to the elderly in prospect. And the former are the big savers, while the latter typically run their savings down. Moreover, a pick-up in the demand for funds to invest may materialise as new technologies such as artificial intelligence and nanotechnology come to fruition.

But any resulting rise in the natural rate seems likely to happen gradually. Central banks will need to set policy against the background of a low natural rate for some while yet. That means more episodes when policy rates are near their lower bound. Further largescale asset purchases may be needed. Broadly speaking, the monetary arrangements introduced in 1997 have served us well. But two aspects are worthy of note. The distinction between monetary and fiscal policy has become increasingly blurred. And the distributional consequences of monetary policy have become increasingly contentious.

Monetary policy has fiscal consequences even in normal times, but issues are starker when large quantities of government bonds or private sector assets sit on the central bank's balance sheet. Even small changes in the yield curve have significant consequences for the public finances. Fiscal considerations become more prominent if the central bank buys risky private credits. And purchasing equities is potentially even more contentious since it involves the acquisition of control rights.

For these reasons, the fiscal authorities need to own the fiscal consequences of the central bank's asset purchase decisions. Happily, the BoE's Asset Purchase Facility meets that requirement, with the Treasury holding the economic interest, even though the MPC decides the amount of assets to buy. Moreover, whenever the MPC wants to increase the stock of assets there is an exchange of letters with the chancellor.

Adding distributional concerns to the MPC's objectives would be worrying. It is one thing for the MPC to use its "constrained discretion" to limit output volatility. It is quite another to refrain from cutting interest rates or undertaking asset purchases to protect one segment of society at the expense of another. That goes to the heart of politics; such decisions should not be delegated to technocrats.

If the government of the day is unhappy about the side effects of the monetary policies necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability, then it is better for them to take mitigating fiscal action. And, if a government is really set upon the need for a different monetary policy, it should do so directly and openly by invoking the monetary policy override clause.

How Well Do You Know Real Estate? Time to Find Out; Is real estate a countercyclical sector? Answers to these and other questions in this WSJ quiz

By Jane Hodges 
1,304 words

The Wall Street Journal Online

Real estate is an important component of the U.S. and global economies. For many Americans, homeownership doubles as a first investment. Beyond a primary residence, investors also can buy into the commercial real-estate market: Office buildings, multifamily housing, hospitals, parking lots, storage facilities, retail properties, call centers, distribution hubs, hotels and restaurants form a sector with its own economic ups and downs.

In 2016, the S&P 500 recognized real estate as its own sector, separating it from financial services where it had been buried for years a move some view as a portent of more real-estate investment to come and that others view with indifference. Currently, real estate accounts for less than 5% of the S&P 500 by market cap.

How much do you know about real estate and real-estate investing? Let's start with a few basics (but we assure you, they will get harder).

1. How do investors participate in the real-estate sector?

A. Mutual funds and ETFs

B. Stocks

C. As direct owners/landlords

D. All of the above

ANSWER: D. Many investors inadvertently own real estate. Broad-themed mutual funds typically allocate a portion of their holdings to real estate. They own it directly, too, sometimes in the form of an exchange-traded fund. You can buy stock in home builders or REITs. You also can buy investment properties for income, and in some cases you can carry these properties within an IRA. Some argue that owning a primary home makes the average investor "overweight" in real estate, so portfolio allocations to real estate need not comprise a large percentage of holdings.

2. What is a REIT?

A. Real-estate investment trust

B. Real-estate investment tax

C. Real-estate insurance tariff

D. Real-estate investor trade

ANSWER: A. Real-estate investment trusts are investment vehicles that contain securitized portfolios of commercial properties such as office buildings, apartment buildings, retail sites, hotels, storage facilities, parking garages, data centers, even cannabis farms. You can buy shares (typically called units) in a REIT, or invest in REITs indirectly since REIT units are often found within mutual-fund portfolios or inside target-date funds.

3. True or false: Real estate is a countercyclical sector.

ANSWER: It depends. Real estate's fortunes usually rise in a bullish economy, since indicators such as high employment and a strong regional economy can push up demand and prices for housing, office space, storage, retail and other categories of real estate. But some financial advisers and fund managers consider real estate "countercyclical" since it can zig when the rest of the economy zags. For example, even in a slow economy, consumers still need housing (they may opt to rent an apartment from a REIT, rather than buy a new home) and will continue to shop at retail outlets, pay for parking garages and storage facilities, etc.

4. Which commercial real-estate subsector is least prosperous now?

A. Multifamily housing

B. Industrial

C. Office

D. Retail

ANSWER: D. Retail real estate ranks last among six commercial categories both in terms of its investment and development prospects, according to a "http://www.pwc.com/us/en/asset-management/real-estate/emerging-trends-in-real-estate.html" on the 2018 commercial real-estate market from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Urban Land Institute. Headwinds in the retail category stem from department-store obsolescence, changes in apparel spending, consumer demographics and the impact of e-commerce and other technology on shopping experiences.

Now, some history questions:

5. What were typical residential mortgage terms before the creation of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Federal National Mortage Association (Fannie Mae) in the 1930s?

A. 3.5% down with a 30-year payoff

B. 20% down with a 20-year or 30-year payoff period

C. 50% down with a 10-year payoff

D. 0% down, interest-only loans with a 30-year payoff period

ANSWER: C. Before the creation of the FHA and Fannie Mae, it was hard for the average American to come up with a 50% down payment and then pay off the remaining 50% of a home's value in only a decade; at that time, the homeownership rate was below 49% (versus "https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf" of 63.9%, according to U.S. Census data). When the FHA and Fannie Mae were created, insurance against defaults became available to borrowers and banks loosened loan terms to 20% down with a longer payoff. ADDED, per your request:In the ensuing decades, borrowers could make much lower down payments as little as 0% or 3.5%.

6. How did real estate contribute to the most recent financial crisis and related recession?

A. Lenders relaxed standards and underwrote loans that wouldn't fly today

B. Banks knowingly and unknowingly sold mortgage securities containing unsound assets, and ratings firms failed to accurately rate real-estate debt sold to the secondary market

C. Investors speculated on housing and homeowners

D. All of the above

ANSWER: D. All of the above. You can read all about it in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's "https://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report". For a more fun look at what happened, watch the movie "The Big Short."

7. During the real-estate bubble, which economist was known as "Dr. Doom"?

A. Robert Shiller, author of "Irrational Exuberance" and co-developer of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index

B. Nouriel Roubini, NYU professor, formerly an economist advising the White House Council of Economic Advisers

C. Karl Case, the late professor/researcher who co-developed the Case-Shiller Home Price Index

D. Ben Bernanke, former Fed chairman, now a Brookings Institution economist

ANSWER: B. Nouriel Roubini, a global macroeconomist, boasts the title "Dr. Doom" for his prognostications about the 2008 real-estate and credit-market meltdowns. He is predicting more economic drama.

And some market questions:

8. What foreign country's investors are buying the most U.S. commercial real estate?

A. China

B. Canada

C. Germany

D. Japan

ANSWER: B. Canada, according "http://www.us.jll.com/united-states/en-us/Research/US-Investment-Outlook-Q2-2017-JLL.pdf" from JLL Research and Real Capital Analytics. During the first half of 2017, Canada accounted for 30% of all foreign investment in U.S. commercial real estate, followed closely by China (21%), Singapore (15%) and Germany (7%).

9. What U.S. city has the lowest rate of apartment vacancy?

A. New York

B. Seattle

C. San Francisco

D. Boston

ANSWER: A.New York has a 1.9% vacancy rate, tightest in the U.S., followed by Boston (2.6%), San Francisco (2.8%), Los Angeles (2.9%), Seattle (3%) and Washington, D.C. (3.8%), says "http://www.nreionline.com/multifamily/apartment-vacancy-rates-remain-low-single-digits-gateway-markets".

10. Which commercial real-estate approach isn't recommended in 2018?

A. Take advantage of demand for new housing

B. Bet on property price appreciation

C. Invest in "experiential retail"

D. Senior housing

ANSWER: B. Investors are advised to look at cash flow from income as a source of benefit rather than property-value appreciation, according to the PwC-Urban Land Institute report on commercial real estate. "Rent recoveries have matured in many markets and across property types. Cap rates have been compressed, but are leveling off," the report says. "Appreciation is likely to be muted even in secondary and tertiary markets. That means focusing on cash flow and asset management in the immediate and midterm future."

Quick Hits: Kuroda Says Fintech Is Changing Definition of Systemic Importance; The Bank of Japan governor also says fintech can help boost growth potential

Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said the emergence of fintech is changing what systemic importance means in the banking industry, and Deutsche Bank said the size of the European Central Bank's bond-buying program suggests market volatility is possible when the ECB tapers. Here are quick hits on central banking and related market views from around the world.

Kuroda: Fintech Changing Definition of Systemic Importance

The emergence of fintech is changing the definition of systemic importance in the banking industry, said Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda at a Paris Europlace forum in Tokyo. In the traditional definition, the systemic importance is measured by the size of a bank's balance sheet, he said. But in the digital world, "factors such as global IT platforms, the huge volumes of big data and widely used algorithms might become more systemically important from the viewpoint of financial stability."

Kuroda: Fintech Can Help Boost Growth Potential

Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday said fintech could boost economic growth potential through enhancing productivity not just in finance but through creating new networks between the sector and others such as the Internet of Things and the sharing economy. The Bank of Japan has been unsuccessful for years in its efforts to get the country's inflation to 2%. Partly hurting the cause is online shopping's pressure on overall prices.

Kuroda Still Worried About Protectionism

Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda remains concerned about protectionist tendencies in some countries, and he hopes those nations will stick with bilateral trade partnerships with Japan or build further relationships. He didn't name any specific nations in his comments at the Paris Europlace financial forum in Tokyo. The U.S. and Japan have been working closely on a bilateral deal with the U.S. having abandoned the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. During last month's trip to Tokyo, U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for Japan to buy "massive" amounts of military equipment from the U.S.

What's Behind Ebbing Indonesian Inflation?

Inflation continued to ebb in Indonesia last month, which may reflect success of the government and central bank in controlling prices. The central bank has been tirelessly urging local authorities to cap inflation in their jurisdictions while police have arrested those found manipulating prices of basic food commodities. On the downside, ebbing inflation may also signal that purchasing power remains lackluster. The November consumer-price index rose 3.3% on year, versus October's 3.6%. After rising just 0.01% sequentially that month, November's figure increased 0.2%, the official Statistics Agency said.

Turkey's Annual Inflation Rate Rises in November

Turkey's annual inflation rate in November jumped to its highest level in 14 years, as food prices remain elevated, bolstering expectations that the central bank may tighten monetary policy at its meeting next week. The annual consumer-price index rose to 12.98% in November the highest reading since 2003 from 11.9% in October, the state statistics agency said Monday. This exceeded forecasts in a survey by The Wall Street Journal and is more than double the central bank's 5% inflation target. After the data, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek tweeted on his official Twitter account that a persistent downward trend in inflation is likely from December onward. "The government will provide the necessary support to achieve a lasting reduction in inflation," Mr. Simsek tweeted. The central bank last month raised the year-end inflation forecast to 9.8% from 8.7%, while policy makers lifted their inflation estimate for next year to 7% from 6.4%, citing the recent depreciation of the Turkish lira. Turkish lira slumped 15% against the dollar since mid-September due to concerns over central bank policy and strained relations between the U.S. and Turkey. The central bank recently took a series of measures to counter the falling value of the Turkish lira and raised average funding costs for banks by 0.25 percentage points to 12.25%.

Greek Economy Grows for Third Consecutive Quarter

Greece's economy grew for a third consecutive quarter for the first time in more than a decade, but at a slower pace, according to figures published Monday. The latest snapshot of the Greek economy shows the country is on course for returning to growth this year after being in recession for most of the past decade. But the slower pace of expansion makes it more challenging to reach the already downwardly revised annual growth target of 1.6% set by Greece and its European creditors. Gross domestic product increased by 0.3% in the July-to-September period from the previous quarter, compared with an upwardly revised 0.8% growth in the second quarter, data from Greece's statistics service Elstat showed.

QE-to-Issuance Argues Against ECB/Fed Comparisons: Deutsche Bank

There is good reason not to use the experience of the U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative-easing tapering to predict what happens when the European Central Bank reduces its own purchases: The ratio of purchases-to-net government bond issuance is much higher in Europe, according to Deutsche Bank. In fact, Fed purchases never exceeded net Treasury issuance. On the other hand, the size of ECB purchases is seven times that of net issuance. Therefore, the ECB's withdrawal is much more significant in relative terms and could create more volatility, Deutsche says.

ECB QE Tapering Could Boost IG-Junk Gap

The gap between investment-grade and junk euro corporate bonds, measured by spread ratios and spread differentials, remains near its tightest levels on record, but the European Central Bank's quantitative-easing tapering could boost it, Deutsche Bank says in its 2018 credit outlook. The so-called corporate-sector purchase program should remain largely unscathed as other QE schemes bear the brunt of tapering. This should continue to support investment-grade spreads. But the overall tapering of QE should reduce broader market support, weighing on junk bonds, the bank adds.

Bank of Canada  Cannot Ignore' Strong Jobs Market

Strong employment gains and a gradual pickup in inflation will compel the Bank of Canada to raise rates in 2018 by more than the markets anticipate, says the economics team at National Bank Financial. The firm has a solid track record on the rate outlook, as it was among the first in Canada to predict rate rises this year when most forecasters anticipated they wouldn't start until next year. NBF says the BOC "just cannot ignore the strong labor market," which added nearly 80,000 jobs in November while the jobless rate fell to a near-decade low and below the 6% level. NBF adds that it "would not be surprised," if USD/CAD revisits the 1.25 level in early 2018 as the BOC again embraces a hawkish tilt.

RBA to Keep Rate, Forecasts Unchanged

The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate at 1.5% at its last meeting of the year on Tuesday, according to Morgan Stanley. "Governor [Philip] Lowe has said that the RBA's main focus is on wage growth so, even with stronger capex expectations and stabilizing iron ore prices, it will be hard to strike a hawkish tone." The RBA isn't likely to update any forecasts either, Morgan Stanley says.

Central banking has never looked more daunting

The line between fiscal and monetary policy is increasingly blurred

The Bank of England s Monetary Policy Committee has just celebrated its 20th birthday. In its first decade, growth was steady and inflation close to target. We   along with our peers   thought we had this central banking business cracked. Nemesis arrived in the shape of the global financial crisis. Rates have been rock bottom ever since and central banks  balance sheets have ballooned. Banking regulations are being tightened. And macro-prudential policy is still a work in progress. Central banking has never looked more daunting.

The past couple of decades have witnessed a remorseless fall in the real rate of interest consistent with macroeconomic equilibrium   the  natural  rate. The causes are still a matter of debate. Some point to higher savings, others to the impact of slow productivity growth on investment. Balance-sheet repair has surely been important, too.

While central banks can set any policy rate they want in the short run, if they are to achieve their objectives over the long term it must converge to the sum of the natural rate and their target inflation rate. Criticism from politicians that central banks  policies are penalising savers and driving up asset prices misses the point: the decline in interest rates ultimately reflects forces that central bankers are powerless to change.

Does the current state of affairs represent a new normal? Some rebound in the natural rate may be in the offing. The global demographics are at a turning point, with a substantial fall in the share of the middle aged relative to the elderly in prospect. And the former are the big savers, while the latter typically run their savings down. Moreover, a pick-up in the demand for funds to invest may materialise as new technologies such as artificial intelligence and nanotechnology come to fruition.

But any resulting rise in the natural rate seems likely to happen gradually. Central banks will need to set policy against the background of a low natural rate for some while yet. That means more episodes when policy rates are near their lower bound. Further large-scale asset purchases may be needed.

Broadly speaking, the monetary arrangements introduced in 1997 have served us well. But two aspects are worthy of note. The distinction between monetary and fiscal policy has become increasingly blurred. And the distributional consequences of monetary policy have become increasingly contentious.

Monetary policy has fiscal consequences even in normal times, but issues are starker when large quantities of government bonds or private sector assets sit on the central bank s balance sheet. Even small changes in the yield curve have significant consequences for the public finances. Fiscal considerations become more prominent if the central bank buys risky private credits. And purchasing equities is potentially even more contentious since it involves the acquisition of control rights.

For these reasons, the fiscal authorities need to own the fiscal consequences of the central bank s asset purchase decisions. Happily, the BoE s Asset Purchase Facility meets that requirement, with the Treasury holding the economic interest, even though the MPC decides the amount of assets to buy. Moreover, whenever the MPC wants to increase the stock of assets there is an exchange of letters with the chancellor.

Adding distributional concerns to the MPC s objectives would be worrying. It is one thing for the MPC to use its  constrained discretion  to limit output volatility. It is quite another to refrain from cutting interest rates or undertaking asset purchases to protect one segment of society at the expense of another. That goes to the heart of politics; such decisions should not be delegated to technocrats.

If the government of the day is unhappy about the side effects of the monetary policies necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability, then it is better for them to take mitigating fiscal action. And, if a government is really set upon the need for a different monetary policy, it should do so directly and openly by invoking the monetary policy override clause.

Woodford: there are tough times ahead, but opportunities too

After a torrid period in which investors withdrew almost 1bn from his fund, Neil Woodford talks to Claer Barrett and Kate Beioley about a bubble, Brexit and keeping the faith

He is Britain's best-known fund manager, responsible for managing about 15.5bn of assets, with a no-nonsense approach that has won the backing of leading institutions and legions of private investors over his 30-year career. Yet, after what Neil Woodford freely admits has been a "pretty poor 18 months", growing numbers of the faithful are departing.

Nearly 1bn has flowed out of his flagship 8.3bn equity income fund in the past six months, following a string of corporate setbacks, the most damaging being Provident Financial. Its shares crashed 65 per cent in a single day; something many think an experienced investor like Mr Woodford should have seen coming. But investment underperformance is also due to his contrarian bet on the UK economy. One of the few fund managers openly to admit that he sees Brexit as a buying opportunity, he has been building stakes in UK banks, retailers and housebuilders   which he believes are discounted for economic Armageddon   as he refuses to "chase the zeitgeist" and invest in companies he considers overvalued.

"It's an incredibly uncomfortable place to be, where I am now. It is the most uncomfortable position I have been in during my career," admits Mr Woodford. "But I believe I'm absolutely right. I don't know when I'm going to be proved right, but I'm utterly convinced that I am right, as I have been right before."

In an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, he reveals that his conviction rests on his belief that current equity valuations are "a bubble", the likes of which he has "only witnessed two or three times in my career as an investor".

Yet, at the same time, he insists there are "profoundly undervalued businesses", ranging from domestic blue chips to unlisted knowledge-intensive growth companies seeking early-stage capital which, given time and patience, will deliver a better performance for his investors.

Bubble territory Ten years on from the financial crisis, Mr Woodford says, markets have seen "the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history". "Investors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations. Whether it's bitcoin going through $10,000, historic low levels of volatility or triple-leveraged exchange traded funds attracting gigantic inflows   there are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count."

So far this year, the FTSE All-Share index has risen nearly 10 per cent while CF Woodford Equity Income fund has fallen 1.4 per cent, making it the worst performer among its peers. But Mr Woodford will not be shaken.

"This is a period when stock markets have the ability to seduce investors [into believing] that making money is easy," he says. But to abandon investment principles and "buy what's going up, just because it's going up ... is the route to penury".

Looking back at the dotcom bubble and the 1990s recession, he feels the market "appears to be making the same mistakes again   but this time the bubble has grown even bigger and more dangerous.

"Those were the two periods when I added most value as a fund manager," he says. His reputation was built on investing in businesses that nobody wanted to own "as my investment discipline told me these are the businesses that are the most attractive, these are the valuation opportunities in this stock market".

Today, what he describes as a "prolonged period of market inefficiency and mispricing" means Mr Woodford and investors face an unnerving wait.

Does he ever doubt his judgment? "Daily," he replies. "You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying 'everybody go away, I'm right, I'm right, I'm right'. You've always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong."

Woodford Investment Management was the first to publish details of companies its funds hold   which are normally held close to fund managers' chests   as well as disclosing costs typically hidden from investors.

Rather than talk to the press, Mr Woodford prefers to communicate directly to investors via YouTube or his blog. In September, he apologised for his poor performance on camera, notching up nearly 40,000 views.

A section of his website labelled the "Awkward Corner", answers questions such as "Has Neil Woodford lost it?" and "Do you have a big enough team?". Some are answered with more patience than others.

"As a fund manager you are always challenged by the stock market," he says. "You can go through a period where daily markets are saying you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, and you'd have to be incredibly thickskinned [and] rather arrogant not to sort of take that on board," he says.

Yet by insisting that he is right, doesn't he also run the risk of sounding rather arrogant? Successful fund management, he says, is a balance between arrogance and humility. "You have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn't, you would end up with a portfolio that looks like the index. But you must have the humility to accept you will get things wrong."

Divine providence Mr Woodford, 57, made his name at Invesco Perpetual, where he gained a reputation for taking large positions for, or against, entire sectors   and eventually winning. Over 25 years of managing funds, he would have turned a 1,000 investment into 23,000.

His previous jags in performance have been sector-driven, but the bad news over the past 18 months has been more stock-specific.

AstraZeneca suffered its largestever one-day fall after the failure of a lung cancer drug trial, and other Woodford favourites including Allied Minds, Imperial Tobacco and the AA have been punished. But these were eclipsed by Provident Financial, in his words, "a major blow-up that we are in the process of rehabilitating".

"I'll put my hand up. This was a mistake," he says. "The company spectacularly failed to deliver the business reorganisation that they talked to us about, at length."

As a long-term investor, with such a concentrated position, should he have seen this coming? "The management team that presided over this disaster were the management team that had 10 years of uninterrupted success in this business," he says. "The fact is that it went wrong. You can't jog backwards. What you can only do, at a time like that, is make a judgment about whether it is appropriate to exit this business now."

To sell shares at 4.50 after the second profit warning, he says, would have "compounded that error".

The share price has nearly doubled from those lows, but he has courted controversy by adding further to his stake, maintaining the business is still undervalued. While his investment approach may be unemotional, he is visibly upset at the recent death of executive chairman Manjit Wolstenholme, aged 53.

"What happened to her is tragic," he says. "I think the management team and the business owes it to her, not least to continue the really hard work that she put in to repair what had gone wrong."

Brexit hysteria "Brexit-driven hysteria" has influenced Mr Woodford's recent acquisition strategy. He has built stakes in housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments, and bought back into banking stocks, a sector he has shunned for many years.

"In retail, housebuilding, construction, property, leisure, all sorts of different areas of the domestic economy, you will see valuations the likes of which I've only ever really seen on two occasions in my career," he says.

"I've rarely witnessed such an overwhelming consensus view   which I believe to be profoundly wrong   that the UK economy is going to hell in a handcart. And I think your own paper has gone a little bit mad, actually. People have become so extreme in their view that Brexit is a pre-determined disaster, that share prices are discounting literally economic Armageddon for the UK economy." He says the share price of Lloyds Bank, now the fifth-largest holding in his flagship fund, is an example.

"It is a big liquid bank whose fortunes pivot on the relative or absolute health of the UK economy. What the share price is expressing is a view that the UK economy is going to hell in a handcart. Definitely, absolutely, without doubt."

Mr Woodford is also a champion of Next   a stock he describes as "one of Britain's biggest online retailers" thanks to its Directory and Label businesses, which produce earnings that eclipse Asos, the online retailer.

"Yet everybody hates Next, it is an example of broken Brexit Britain [in the public's eyes]. People run towards online-only retail, and away from bricks and mortar retail. They don't want to let the details get in the way."

He has a lot to say about Brexit, but goes silent when asked if he voted to leave in last year's referendum.

"Instinctively, I want to answer that question," he says, looking for a second as if he might. "Put it this way, I would have been a happier, less stressed fund manager if we'd voted to stay. But we didn't. The remoaners need to get over themselves."

Before news of the divorce settlement broke, he was already confident that "progress" was being made, and fully expects the UK to wrangle "two years in which to negotiate some kind of trade agreement with the EU".

Mr Woodford thinks the UK will look back on Brexit as being like "the millennium bug".

"Exactly the same thing will happen with respect to Brexit, whether we negotiate a deal or not," he predicts. "I'm not saying that it won't be disruptive. But this notion of a cliffedge event for the UK economy, where unemployment rises massively, consumer and business confidence evaporates and companies desert the UK is just not how the real world works."

Contrarian bets Mr Woodford takes pride in doing many things differently. His aversion to popular thinking extends to the way he runs Woodford Investment Management, the company he founded in 2014.

He has thrown down the gauntlet to the rest of the industry on fees and transparency. His funds were launched with a single, straightforward charge, aided by the company's decision to take on the burden of fund-related expenses formerly paid by the investor.

Based in an Oxfordshire business park, Mr Woodford's office is more like a lounge of a Shoreditch hotel than a fund manager's corporate lair. He shuns the corporate uniform of suits and shirts. Colleagues in jeans and T-shirts sip artisan coffee in zones furnished with plush armchairs and pineapple-shaped lamps. It is a calm atmosphere well away from the fray of the City of London, punctuated only when Mr Woodford jabs his finger on the table to make a point. This happens several times as we discuss the Patient Capital Trust, which he set up in 2015 to invest in early-stage, disruptive technology and biotechnology companies. Its shares, which once traded on a 15 per cent premium to net asset value, are now on a 5.4 per cent discount.

Again, there have been high-profile company-specific setbacks, notably Northwest Biotherapeutics. But Mr Woodford will not earn a penny in management fees unless the trust beats set performance hurdles.

Critics have argued that Mr Woodford's small and unlisted tech stocks   many of which are also in his flagship fund   have been a distraction. "We have some incredible competitive advantage in this space," he says. "We have great universities, great people doing fantastic science. Yet we have lamentably failed to translate that into a commercial reality."

At root, he blames investor shorttermism. "The capital markets have failed to provide capital, because they're impatient," he says. "Rewarding the short term is cultural as much as it is industrial. The average tenure of FTSE chief executives is too short. The average tenure of fund managers is way too short. So is the way we measure fund performance.

"When you invest in these businesses ... when things go wrong, they go wrong early, and things that go well take time. That's why we encourage a long-term view."

He applauds the government's Budget decision to establish a 2.5bn investment fund targeted at innovative, disruptive businesses. He was in many ways instrumental to the measure, having sat on the Patient Capital Review panel, a study aimed at funnelling more money to UK start-ups. "I'm getting a bit emotional about this," he says. "But the fact is that [negative public opinion] has a massive impact, it reinforces the lack of ambition... in this country because we're not been able to scale great technology into commercial success."

Message to investors Having promised us one hour of his time, we have now been talking for more than two and Mr Woodford's colleagues have been peering through the frosted glass of the interview room with increasing frequency.

What, if anything, can he say to reassure investors that his strategy will be proven right? "Investor trust is something hard fought and hard won. And I think it is, in reality, less fragile than people think," he says, stressing that his flagship fund has still delivered high single-digit returns per annum over a three- to five-year view.

"We've had a pretty poor 18 months. But in the context of our long-term strategy, I believe we will meet and beat the return expectations that we've encouraged our investors to believe in. I would say, stick with me. To chase the things that are going up a lot now means that you embrace massive investment risk. You're buying into things that are profoundly, fundamentally overvalued and running away from businesses that are profoundly, fundamentally undervalued."

And with that, he exits through the glass doors and is gone.

After a torrid period in which investors withdrew almost 1bn from his fund, Neil Woodford talks to Claer Barrett and Kate Beioley about a bubble, Brexit and keeping the faith

He is Britain's best-known fund manager, responsible for managing about 15.5bn of assets, with a no-nonsense approach that has won the backing of leading institutions and legions of private investors over his 30-year career. Yet, after what Neil Woodford freely admits has been a "pretty poor 18 months", growing numbers of the faithful are departing.

Nearly 1bn has flowed out of his flagship 8.3bn equity income fund in the past six months, following a string of corporate setbacks, the most damaging being Provident Financial. Its shares crashed 65 per cent in a single day; something many think an experienced investor like Mr Woodford should have seen coming. But investment underperformance is also due to his contrarian bet on the UK economy. One of the few fund managers openly to admit that he sees Brexit as a buying opportunity, he has been building stakes in UK banks, retailers and housebuilders   which he believes are discounted for economic Armageddon   as he refuses to "chase the zeitgeist" and invest in companies he considers overvalued.

"It's an incredibly uncomfortable place to be, where I am now. It is the most uncomfortable position I have been in during my career," admits Mr Woodford. "But I believe I'm absolutely right. I don't know when I'm going to be proved right, but I'm utterly convinced that I am right, as I have been right before."

In an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, he reveals that his conviction rests on his belief that current equity valuations are "a bubble", the likes of which he has "only witnessed two or three times in my career as an investor".

Yet, at the same time, he insists there are "profoundly undervalued businesses", ranging from domestic blue chips to unlisted knowledge-intensive growth companies seeking early-stage capital which, given time and patience, will deliver a better performance for his investors.

Bubble territory Ten years on from the financial crisis, Mr Woodford says, markets have seen "the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history". "Investors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations. Whether it's bitcoin going through $10,000, historic low levels of volatility or triple-leveraged exchange traded funds attracting gigantic inflows   there are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count."

So far this year, the FTSE All-Share index has risen nearly 10 per cent while CF Woodford Equity Income fund has fallen 1.4 per cent, making it the worst performer among its peers. But Mr Woodford will not be shaken.

"This is a period when stock markets have the ability to seduce investors [into believing] that making money is easy," he says. But to abandon investment principles and "buy what's going up, just because it's going up ... is the route to penury".

Looking back at the dotcom bubble and the 1990s recession, he feels the market "appears to be making the same mistakes again   but this time the bubble has grown even bigger and more dangerous.

"Those were the two periods when I added most value as a fund manager," he says. His reputation was built on investing in businesses that nobody wanted to own "as my investment discipline told me these are the businesses that are the most attractive, these are the valuation opportunities in this stock market".

Today, what he describes as a "prolonged period of market inefficiency and mispricing" means Mr Woodford and investors face an unnerving wait.

Does he ever doubt his judgment? "Daily," he replies. "You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying 'everybody go away, I'm right, I'm right, I'm right'. You've always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong."

Woodford Investment Management was the first to publish details of companies its funds hold   which are normally held close to fund managers' chests   as well as disclosing costs typically hidden from investors.

Rather than talk to the press, Mr Woodford prefers to communicate directly to investors via YouTube or his blog. In September, he apologised for his poor performance on camera, notching up nearly 40,000 views.

A section of his website labelled the "Awkward Corner", answers questions such as "Has Neil Woodford lost it?" and "Do you have a big enough team?". Some are answered with more patience than others.

"As a fund manager you are always challenged by the stock market," he says. "You can go through a period where daily markets are saying you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, and you'd have to be incredibly thickskinned [and] rather arrogant not to sort of take that on board," he says.

Yet by insisting that he is right, doesn't he also run the risk of sounding rather arrogant? Successful fund management, he says, is a balance between arrogance and humility. "You have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn't, you would end up with a portfolio that looks like the index. But you must have the humility to accept you will get things wrong."

Divine providence Mr Woodford, 57, made his name at Invesco Perpetual, where he gained a reputation for taking large positions for, or against, entire sectors   and eventually winning. Over 25 years of managing funds, he would have turned a 1,000 investment into 23,000.

His previous jags in performance have been sector-driven, but the bad news over the past 18 months has been more stock-specific.

AstraZeneca suffered its largestever one-day fall after the failure of a lung cancer drug trial, and other Woodford favourites including Allied Minds, Imperial Tobacco and the AA have been punished. But these were eclipsed by Provident Financial, in his words, "a major blow-up that we are in the process of rehabilitating".

"I'll put my hand up. This was a mistake," he says. "The company spectacularly failed to deliver the business reorganisation that they talked to us about, at length."

As a long-term investor, with such a concentrated position, should he have seen this coming? "The management team that presided over this disaster were the management team that had 10 years of uninterrupted success in this business," he says. "The fact is that it went wrong. You can't jog backwards. What you can only do, at a time like that, is make a judgment about whether it is appropriate to exit this business now."

To sell shares at 4.50 after the second profit warning, he says, would have "compounded that error".

The share price has nearly doubled from those lows, but he has courted controversy by adding further to his stake, maintaining the business is still undervalued. While his investment approach may be unemotional, he is visibly upset at the recent death of executive chairman Manjit Wolstenholme, aged 53.

"What happened to her is tragic," he says. "I think the management team and the business owes it to her, not least to continue the really hard work that she put in to repair what had gone wrong."

Brexit hysteria "Brexit-driven hysteria" has influenced Mr Woodford's recent acquisition strategy. He has built stakes in housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments, and bought back into banking stocks, a sector he has shunned for many years.

"In retail, housebuilding, construction, property, leisure, all sorts of different areas of the domestic economy, you will see valuations the likes of which I've only ever really seen on two occasions in my career," he says.

"I've rarely witnessed such an overwhelming consensus view   which I believe to be profoundly wrong   that the UK economy is going to hell in a handcart. And I think your own paper has gone a little bit mad, actually. People have become so extreme in their view that Brexit is a pre-determined disaster, that share prices are discounting literally economic Armageddon for the UK economy." He says the share price of Lloyds Bank, now the fifth-largest holding in his flagship fund, is an example.

"It is a big liquid bank whose fortunes pivot on the relative or absolute health of the UK economy. What the share price is expressing is a view that the UK economy is going to hell in a handcart. Definitely, absolutely, without doubt."

Mr Woodford is also a champion of Next   a stock he describes as "one of Britain's biggest online retailers" thanks to its Directory and Label businesses, which produce earnings that eclipse Asos, the online retailer.

"Yet everybody hates Next, it is an example of broken Brexit Britain [in the public's eyes]. People run towards online-only retail, and away from bricks and mortar retail. They don't want to let the details get in the way."

He has a lot to say about Brexit, but goes silent when asked if he voted to leave in last year's referendum.

"Instinctively, I want to answer that question," he says, looking for a second as if he might. "Put it this way, I would have been a happier, less stressed fund manager if we'd voted to stay. But we didn't. The remoaners need to get over themselves."

Before news of the divorce settlement broke, he was already confident that "progress" was being made, and fully expects the UK to wrangle "two years in which to negotiate some kind of trade agreement with the EU".

Mr Woodford thinks the UK will look back on Brexit as being like "the millennium bug".

"Exactly the same thing will happen with respect to Brexit, whether we negotiate a deal or not," he predicts. "I'm not saying that it won't be disruptive. But this notion of a cliffedge event for the UK economy, where unemployment rises massively, consumer and business confidence evaporates and companies desert the UK is just not how the real world works."

Contrarian bets Mr Woodford takes pride in doing many things differently. His aversion to popular thinking extends to the way he runs Woodford Investment Management, the company he founded in 2014.

He has thrown down the gauntlet to the rest of the industry on fees and transparency. His funds were launched with a single, straightforward charge, aided by the company's decision to take on the burden of fund-related expenses formerly paid by the investor.

Based in an Oxfordshire business park, Mr Woodford's office is more like a lounge of a Shoreditch hotel than a fund manager's corporate lair. He shuns the corporate uniform of suits and shirts. Colleagues in jeans and T-shirts sip artisan coffee in zones furnished with plush armchairs and pineapple-shaped lamps. It is a calm atmosphere well away from the fray of the City of London, punctuated only when Mr Woodford jabs his finger on the table to make a point. This happens several times as we discuss the Patient Capital Trust, which he set up in 2015 to invest in early-stage, disruptive technology and biotechnology companies. Its shares, which once traded on a 15 per cent premium to net asset value, are now on a 5.4 per cent discount.

Again, there have been high-profile company-specific setbacks, notably Northwest Biotherapeutics. But Mr Woodford will not earn a penny in management fees unless the trust beats set performance hurdles.

Critics have argued that Mr Woodford's small and unlisted tech stocks   many of which are also in his flagship fund   have been a distraction. "We have some incredible competitive advantage in this space," he says. "We have great universities, great people doing fantastic science. Yet we have lamentably failed to translate that into a commercial reality."

At root, he blames investor shorttermism. "The capital markets have failed to provide capital, because they're impatient," he says. "Rewarding the short term is cultural as much as it is industrial. The average tenure of FTSE chief executives is too short. The average tenure of fund managers is way too short. So is the way we measure fund performance.

"When you invest in these businesses ... when things go wrong, they go wrong early, and things that go well take time. That's why we encourage a long-term view."

He applauds the government's Budget decision to establish a 2.5bn investment fund targeted at innovative, disruptive businesses. He was in many ways instrumental to the measure, having sat on the Patient Capital Review panel, a study aimed at funnelling more money to UK start-ups. "I'm getting a bit emotional about this," he says. "But the fact is that [negative public opinion] has a massive impact, it reinforces the lack of ambition... in this country because we're not been able to scale great technology into commercial success."

Message to investors Having promised us one hour of his time, we have now been talking for more than two and Mr Woodford's colleagues have been peering through the frosted glass of the interview room with increasing frequency.

What, if anything, can he say to reassure investors that his strategy will be proven right? "Investor trust is something hard fought and hard won. And I think it is, in reality, less fragile than people think," he says, stressing that his flagship fund has still delivered high single-digit returns per annum over a three- to five-year view.

"We've had a pretty poor 18 months. But in the context of our long-term strategy, I believe we will meet and beat the return expectations that we've encouraged our investors to believe in. I would say, stick with me. To chase the things that are going up a lot now means that you embrace massive investment risk. You're buying into things that are profoundly, fundamentally overvalued and running away from businesses that are profoundly, fundamentally undervalued."

And with that, he exits through the glass doors and is gone.

Farmer's Business Network Raises $110 Million for Crowdsourced Agriculture; Company has raised over $200 million to date

Farmer's Business Network Inc., a digital platform that crowdsources a range of agricultural data and services, has raised $110 million in Series D funding.

T. Rowe Price Group and Temasek led the round, which was joined by existing investors DBL Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and GV. The latest financing brings the company's total raised to date to over $200 million.

Founded in 2014, FBN serves as a farmer-to-farmer communication and e-commerce channel. To help farmers be more cost-effective, FBN enables anonymous sharing of agronomic data including seed performance, soil treatment techniques and crop management. Membership is $600 a year.

San Carlos, Calif.-based FBN works with wholesalers, warehouses and manufactures to provide a an online marketplace for farming products like fertilizers, tools, chemicals and seeds with transparent pricing.

Charles Baron, who co-founded FBN with former Kleiner Perkins partner Amol Deshpande, said the company aims to democratize information and create market transparency in an industry where retailer consolidation has led to low profitability for the farmers working in the middle of it. With FBN, farmers have access to product information free of company bias, Mr. Baron said, as well as localized data to improve farming practices.

"The large data analytics network allows for precision agriculture, because it looks objectively at what's working in the real world," he said.

Since its commercial launch in 2015, FBN has grown to cover farmland throughout 42 states and Canada. The latest funding is slated for hiring more employees and building out new technologies in agronomic analytics and e-commerce systems.

DBL Investors Managing Partner Nancy Pfund, who sits on FBN's board and has been an investor in each financing round, said she saw not just a company, but a platform for a series of businesses all aimed at leveling the playing field for farmers.

"It allows communication between high tech and farmers, but on the farmers' terms, not Silicon Valley's. " Ms. Pfund said. "This can lead to all kinds of modernization and sustainability results."

Rolet goes but doubts remain over LSE future

Activist investor refuses to call a halt to bruising battle with stock exchange board as search for successor begins

Less than 24 hours after the governor of the Bank of England called for a resolution, the London Stock Exchange sought to draw a final line under the damaging power struggle that has gripped investors in the City of London in recent weeks.

Having walked out of the doors of the exchange the night before to an awards ceremony, Xavier Rolet, the LSE chief executive, confirmed yesterday that he would not be returning to the company "under any circumstances".

After being handed a lifetime achievement award at the event, he later tweeted: "To all my colleagues. This one's for you and I will miss you."

But his categorical statements may still not mark the end to the infighting, with one of the LSE's biggest shareholders, the Children's Investment Fund (TCI), refusing to call an end to the war with the board over Mr Rolet's future.

His abrupt departure more than a year earlier than expected has also made the questions hanging over the future of the LSE even more urgent, with a pressing need for a new chief to rebuild bridges with shareholders, heal rifts in the board and find a long term post-Brexit strategy plan for the weakened exchange.

No side has comes out of the fight well, says one shareholder.

As many as 10 shareholders had separately written to the LSE board urging the situation be resolved over recent weeks, according to people familiar with the situation.

The LSE was already working through an amicable settlement with Mr Rolet, but the comments from Mark Carney   as the head of one of the LSE's regulators   carried the weight. The BoE couldn't "envisage a situation where a CEO stays beyond the agreed period", the governor said.

One top 20 investor said "we agreed with Mr Carney that it was time to move on", adding that TCI's actions "just got rid of [Mr Rolet] quicker than expected, and it might make the job of getting a new CEO that much harder".

With Mr Rolet will go the LSE chairman, Donald Brydon, who will stand down in 2019 to leave "a new team at the helm to steer the future progress of the company".

Mr Brydon's departure at least makes a resolution with TCI, led by the activist shareholder Christopher Hohn, more likely.

Sir Christopher had accused Mr Brydon of forcing Mr Rolet out against his will and gagging him with confidentiality clauses.

People close to the LSE board say it is acutely aware that the embarrassing affair will not be over until TCI withdraws its request for an extraordinary shareholder meeting next month to vote on the futures of Mr Rolet and Mr Brydon.

With the agreement with Mr Rolet, the board has sought to relieve the pressure on itself, which had been building publicly and privately over the past month amid regular calls for transparency from TCI, a 5 per cent shareholder.

But TCI kept the board guessing yesterday, saying only that it would take a day to respond to Mr Rolet's statement and ignoring a request to withdraw its call for the shareholder meeting.

By the end of today, with no other response, the LSE will publish a circular to shareholders setting out its reasons for starting a succession plan, along with the date for the vote.

It is expected to focus on Mr Rolet's sometimes hard-driving management style.

TCI may find itself with few friends if it continues the campaign. Mr Rolet described yesterday "the unwelcome publicity" over his departure as having "not been helpful to the company".

The LSE further accused its shareholder of launching a "concerted and highly personalised campaign" designed to upset its succession plan.

TCI's campaign also hurt the company's relationships with Mr Rolet and other company stakeholders, it said. "We very much regret that you chose this course of action."

Mr Rolet has otherwise kept a discreet silence over the affair, as he heads to gardening leave for 12 months. Previously, he had been expected to leave in 2018 and will still be paid his salary in full and be eligible to receive a bonus for the financial year to December.

The search for a successor has already begun, with the exchange expected to look internally and externally for a candidate with the industry's sometimesarcane specialist knowledge. The LSE's business encompasses data and indices, clearing and equities trading, and is centred on Europe and the US.

For many years, David Lester, Mr Rolet's head of strategy and the architect of many of his deals, was touted as a potential successor. But Mr Lester left over the summer after more than 16 years at the LSE. Another potential internal candidate is Mark Makepeace, group director of information services, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of LSE profits. For now the exchange is in the hands of David Warren, its chief financial officer.

Mr Rolet's strategy had been to merge with Deutsche Brse, a move that was blocked by European antitrust authorities in March.

A new chief will inherit a company needing to adapt to a new status following the UK's departure from the EU. It also faces challenges in its data and clearing businesses, two markets which underpin its high valuation.

"There is significant uncertainty now with regard to who will be the new head of LSE and how that will impact its strategy," said Michael Werner, an analyst at UBS.

But without a chief executive and carrying a chairman who has been badly hobbled, analysts are already speculating that rivals may look to make an opportunistic bid. Some are tipping the US group Intercontinental Exchange, which considered a bid to compete with Deutsche Brse 18 months ago, to run the rule over the LSE again.

Even so, rival executives have said that they are wary of tabling a bid while the UK's legal status with the EU was uncertain.

That may yet give the LSE the breathing space it needs.

Banking & Finance: Royal Bank Profit Pressed by Costs Of New Technology

TORONTO -- Higher technology spending weighed on Royal Bank of Canada's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, as Canada's largest bank by market capitalization continues to pour money into artificial intelligence, mobile banking and cybersecurity.

The bank, which this month said it had been designated a systemically important institution by the Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board, reported earnings of 2.83 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.2 billion), or C$1.88 a share, compared with C$2.53 billion, or C$1.65, a year ago.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were predicting profit of C$1.87 a share.

For the year ending Oct. 31, the bank reported net income of C$11.47 billion, up 10% from the prior year. The results take into account C$3 billion of spending on technology, more than 7% of revenue. The tech spending, which included opening a new AI lab in Montreal, tempered growth in units like wealth management and personal and commercial banking.

David McKay, the bank's chief executive, who has a bachelor of mathematics and computer science degree, said the spending is higher than the bank's Canadian peers but in line with U.S. banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. Royal Bank is unlikely to keep up that pace of spending, he said.

"I think it's at an elevated level, so you will not see the same type of growth in that as our revenues grow," he said, during a conference call with analysts.

Royal Bank has been cutting costs to help pay for investments in digital technology, which have been translating into highercustomer-retention rates, said Rob Bolger, the chief financial officer, in an interview.

Royal's high spending reflects the difficulty of keeping pace with changing technology, said John AIken, a Canadian banking analyst with Barclays. "A lot of this is trying to make sure you've got your fingers in enough pies," he said. "We're in early stages right now, and no one knows what technology is going to win or, really, what the technology will even look like five years out."

For the quarter, noninterest expenses were C$5.61 billion, up 5.9% from the year-earlier period. Total revenue rose 12% to C$10.52 billion. The bank's net interest margin expanded by 0.02 percentage point to 1.72%.

Net income in the personal and commercial banking unit rose 10% to C$1.4 billion.

The bank is expecting mortgage growth to "slightly moderate," after new rules meant to curb risky lending take hold at the beginning of 2018, Mr. McKay said. Some customers pulled their borrowing ahead to avoid the new rules, which may have helped boost the mortgage business during the quarter, he said.

Net income from wealth management was up 24% to C$491 million. Net income for insurance and capital markets rose 16% and 21%, respectively. Investor and treasury services reported a 10% decline in net income compared with a year ago. Loans rose 4% to C$542.62 billion. In September, the bank increased its prime lending rate to 3.2%, up one-quarter percentage point.

The bank also announced Wednesday that group chief risk officer Mark Hughes would retire April 9 and would be succeeded by Graeme Hepworth. Mr. Hepworth will become deputy chief risk officer Feb. 1. Mr. Hughes, who has held his position since 2013, has worked for the bank for 37 years.

During the quarter, Royal Bank completed a share-buyback program and bought back five million shares for C$462.8 million.

Wall Street Buffalo Wild Wings deal sparks stampede into restaurant chains

Investors were drawn to restaurant stocks yesterday after a move by Arby's Restaurant Group to buy Buffalo Wild Wings at a significant premium set off speculation on which companies in the sector could attract a bid next.

Under the tie-up, Arby's will pay $157 a share in cash for Buffalo Wild Wings, representing a premium of 38 per cent to its one-month average stock price as of November 13, before reports emerged that a merger could be on the horizon.

Including debt, the deal values the beer-and-wings chain at $2.9bn.

Buffalo Wild Wings is famous for its large selection of wings. Its restaurants are often cavernous spaces with a large beer selection and televisions that cater to sport fans. Meanwhile, Arby's, majority owned by private equity firm Roark Capital Group, operates a more traditional fast food franchise specialising in roast beef sandwiches and curly fries.

But like other restaurant chains, both companies have in recent years been hit by softening US restaurant spending.

Turmoil in the industry has already prompted the company behind Joe's Crab Shack to file for bankruptcy in mid-2017, while Ruby Tuesday agreed to be taken private in a $146m deal last month.

Buffalo Wild Wing shares, which closed on Monday at $146.40, rose more than 6 per cent to $155.57 yesterday after Arby's takeover offer was announced.

The news also lifted shares in Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, up 1.1 per cent to $81.14. Cheesecake Factory added 1.5 per cent to $45.93, Shake Shack gained 1.2 per cent to $38.16 and Wendy's climbed 2.7 per cent to $14.07.

Elsewhere, retail stocks continued their march higher amid signs that the all-important holiday shopping season had got off to a strong start. A record $6.6bn was spent online on Cyber Monday, a near 17 per cent increase from last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics.

TheS&P 500 retail index rose as much as 0.6 per cent to 1,676.25, putting it on track for another record closing high and keeping it within a hair of the intraday record of 1,676.53 set on Monday. Within this, department store operators Nordstrom and Macy's both added more than 1 per cent while Gap was up 0.6 per cent and Victoria's Secret owner L Brands advanced 0.9 per cent.

In the wider market, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average set all-time highs as traders awaited the latest news on US tax reforms.

TheS&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent at 2,614.05 by midday trading while the Dow advanced by a similar margin to 23,705.69. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 6,895.62.

Turmoil in the industry has already prompted the company behind Joe's Crab Shack to file for bankruptcy in mid-2017, while Ruby Tuesday agreed to be taken private in a $146m deal last month.

Buffalo Wild Wing shares, which closed on Monday at $146.40, rose more than 6 per cent to $155.57 yesterday after Arby's takeover offer was announced.

The news also lifted shares in Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, up 1.1 per cent to $81.14. Cheesecake Factory added 1.5 per cent to $45.93, Shake Shack gained 1.2 per cent to $38.16 and Wendy's climbed 2.7 per cent to $14.07.

Elsewhere, retail stocks continued their march higher amid signs that the all-important holiday shopping season had got off to a strong start. A record $6.6bn was spent online on Cyber Monday, a near 17 per cent increase from last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics.

TheS&P 500 retail index rose as much as 0.6 per cent to 1,676.25, putting it on track for another record closing high and keeping it within a hair of the intraday record of 1,676.53 set on Monday. Within this, department store operators Nordstrom and Macy's both added more than 1 per cent while Gap was up 0.6 per cent and Victoria's Secret owner L Brands advanced 0.9 per cent.

In the wider market, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average set all-time highs as traders awaited the latest news on US tax reforms.

TheS&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent at 2,614.05 by midday trading while the Dow advanced by a similar margin to 23,705.69. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 6,895.62.

Investors were drawn to restaurant stocks yesterday after a move by Arby's Restaurant Group to buy Buffalo Wild Wings at a significant premium set off speculation on which companies in the sector could attract a bid next.

Under the tie-up, Arby's will pay $157 a share in cash for Buffalo Wild Wings, representing a premium of 38 per cent to its one-month average stock price as of November 13, before reports emerged that a merger could be on the horizon.

Including debt, the deal values the beer-and-wings chain at $2.9bn.

Buffalo Wild Wings is famous for its large selection of wings. Its restaurants are often cavernous spaces with a large beer selection and televisions that cater to sport fans. Meanwhile, Arby's, majority owned by private equity firm Roark Capital Group, operates a more traditional fast food franchise specialising in roast beef sandwiches and curly fries.

Royal Bank of Canada Beats Estimates, But Tech Spending Weighs on Results; Results from wealth management division helps boost earnings in fiscal fourth quarter

TORONTO Higher technology spending weighed on Royal Bank of Canada's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, as Canada's largest bank by market capitalization continues to pour money into artificial intelligence, mobile banking and cybersecurity.

The bank, which earlier this month said it had been "https://www.wsj.com/articles/PR-CO-20171121-902855" by the Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board, reported earnings of 2.83 billion Canadian dollars ($2.2 billion), or C$1.88 a share, compared with C$2.53 billion, or C$1.65 a share a year ago.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were predicting a profit of C$1.87 a share.

For the year ended Oct. 31, the bank reported net income of C$11.47 billion, up 10% from last year. The results take into account C$3 billion of spending on technology, more than 7% of annual revenue. The tech spending, which included opening a new AI lab in Montreal, tempered growth in units like wealth management and personal and commercial banking.

David McKay, the bank's CEO, who has a mathematics and computer science degree, said the spending is higher than the bank's Canadian peers, but in line with U.S. banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America. Royal Bank is unlikely to keep up that pace of spending, he said.

"I think it's at an elevated level, so you will not see the same type of growth in that as our revenues grow," he said, during a conference call with analysts.

Royal Bank has been cutting costs to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/royal-bank-of-canada-profit-tops-expectations-despite-slip-in-revenue-1503488355", which have been translating into higher customer retention rates, said Rod Bolger, chief financial officer, in an interview.

RBC's high spending reflects the difficulty of keeping pace with changing technology, said John Aiken, a Canadian banking analyst with Barclays.

"A lot of this is trying to make sure you've got your fingers in enough pies," he said. "We're in early stages right now, and no one knows what technology is going to win or, really, what the technology will even look like five years out."

For the quarter, noninterest expenses were C$5.61 billion, up 5.9% from the same period a year ago. Total revenue rose 12% to C$10.52 billion. The bank's net interest margin expanded by 2 basis points to 1.72%.

Net income in the company's personal and commercial banking unit rose 10% to C$1.4 billion.

The bank is expecting mortgage growth to "slightly moderate" after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-eyes-further-rules-to-curb-mortgage-growth-1499366532" meant to curb risky lending take hold at the beginning of 2018, said Mr. McKay. Some customers have borrowed ahead to avoid the new rules, which may have helped boost the mortgage business during the quarter, he said.

Net income from wealth management was up 24% to C$491 million in the quarter. Net income for insurance and capital markets rose 16% and 21%, respectively. Investor and treasury services reported a 10% decline in net income compared with the same quarter a year ago.

Loans, net of which was allotted for loan losses, rose 4% to C$542.62 billion in the fourth quarter. In September, the bank increased its prime lending rate to 3.2%, up 25 basis points.

The bank also announced Wednesday that Group Chief Risk Officer Mark Hughes would retire April 9 and would be replaced by Graeme Hepworth. Mr. Hepworth will become deputy chief risk officer Feb. 1. Mr. Hughes, who has held his position since 2013, has worked for the bank for 37 years.

During the fourth quarter, the Royal Bank of Canada completed a share-buyback program and bought back 5 million shares for C$462.8 million.

Shares were up 0.56% in afternoon trading.
