Quick Base Inc., a software company that allows people without coding experience to build business applications, has a new private-equity backer.

Technology-focused Vista Equity Partners is buying a majority stake in the software company, Quick Base Chief Executive Rick Willett confirmed.

The deal is valued at more than $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the transaction. Vista is acquiring the stake from fellow buyout shop Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe, which will retain a minority stake in the company as part of the deal.

Quick Base was one of three business units that TurboTax software maker Intuit Inc. sold back in 2016, along with marketing software provider Demandforce and personal finance software unit Quicken. The combined sale of all three units was expected to generate some $500 million in proceeds, The Wall Street Journal "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intuit-sheds-quickbase-as-part-of-plan-to-pare-down-1457464910".

Since then, Quick Base has increased its annual revenue by at least 20% to more than $125 million, a second person with knowledge of the company said. The company allows employees with no coding, development or database experience to build internal software platforms that handle tasks such as customer-relationship management, workflow management and other applications. Its roughly 5,400 customers include Southwest Airlines Co., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Sprint Corp.

Mr. Willett, who became CEO several months after Welsh Carson bought the company, said Quick Base has benefited from a shortage of experienced coders and growing interest among millennials in personalized business-to-business software. He added that the company plans to use Vista's investment to grow its products, enhance workflow automation and to invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning tools.

The investment marks the latest in a string of software companies that Austin, Texas-based Vista's has snapped up in the past year. In late December, the firm agreed to acquire MindBody Inc., a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-firm-mindbody-going-private-in-1-9-billion-cash-deal-11545661143", beauty and wellness markets, for approximately $1.9 billion. In November the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-nears-deal-to-buy-software-firm-apptio-for-1-9-billion-1541988001"Apptio Inc. private for approximately $1.94 billion.

The firm is in the midst of raising its latest flagship buyout fund, Vista Equity Partners Fund VII LP. As of 2018, the firm had collected more than $13 billion for the fund, which has an upper limit of $16 billion, according to the first person familiar with the matter.

Welsh Carson, which is based in New York, invests exclusively in technology and health-care companies. The firm had raised $3.48 billion for its 13th fund and related vehicles as of last fall, according to a November filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Peak financial scandal? History says not

As 2019 gets under way, some officials at Goldman Sachs won't be relishing what the new year might bring. The Malaysian government has claimed that billions of dollars vanished from its 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, sovereign wealth fund after Goldman arranged financing for the group.

Last month, the country's finance minister said it would seek an eyepopping $7.5bn in reparations from Goldman over the affair. Goldman officials vehemently deny any wrongdoing (and thus the need to pay), blaming local Malaysian officials instead. But, as the battle gathers pace, it is worth considering a bigger question: is the number of financial scandals increasing? If you were to ask ordinary investors, many might say "yes". The past decade has delivered a litany of scandals, from last year's revelations of accounting irregularities at British companies such as Carillion and Patisserie Valerie, to the Bernard Madoff investment swindle, Libor manipulation and subprime mortgage scandals before that.

But Steve Toms, an accounting professor at Leeds university, suggests this perception isn't entirely correct. Prof Toms has studied the history of financial scandals from 1800 to 2009. His research, presented to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last month, confirms the frequency of reported financial frauds in the US and UK has escalated since the late 1970s, after a long period of decline. But for the most consistently scandal-plagued period in history, the 19th century beats present-day dramas hands down.

Prof Toms partly reached his conclusion by observing how often words such as "fraud", "corruption" or "scandal" appeared in the local press. That approach has obvious limitations. Language has changed over time: "swindler" was commonly used in the 18th century but is barely used now. Still, the patterns are thoughtprovoking. During the 18th century, the volume of reported scandals fluctuated wildly, surging in the South Sea Bubble drama of 1720. The growth of the joint-stock company helped to damp the trend   but only a touch.

In the middle of the 19th century, a middle-class saving glut prompted investors to dash into new areas such as railway bonds. Shareholders became more diverse and less wellinformed. The scandal index rose again, with crises engulfing railway investment schemes and banks.

This eventually sparked a backlash: the accounting profession sprang to life, charged with conducting regular audits. For eight decades, the scandal index steadily declined in the UK, until it plateaued at a low level between the 1940s and 1970s. (A similar pattern occurred in the US, with a spike around the 1929 crash.) Yet, from the 1970s, "scandals" started to rise again, although to levels below those of the 19th century. Prof Toms suggests this may reflect the financial deregulation of the 1980s.

The swelling size of the finance sector may have played a role, too. A few years ago, Thomas Philippon, a New York-based economist, analysed how profits and pay in finance have fluctuated during the past 130 years. The results produced a chart that looks similar to the scandal index: from the 1970s, the size of finance and financiers' pay packets rocketed.

Prof Toms points to another crucial factor: the growing complexity of big global companies. As money hops opaquely across borders, it is becoming harder to track.

Is there a solution to stop such scandals? Cyber records can potentially offer new levels of transparency, machine-learning tools can hunt for irregularities faster than a human, and blockchain technologies make financial transfers more secure. If you want to be really optimistic, it is possible that just as the 19th-century scandals sparked a backlash   launching the audit industry   the 21st-century scandals might trigger new structural reforms.

Sadly, we are not in this scandal-free world yet. This could be another busy year for the forensic accountants; never mind what does (or does not) bubble on at Goldman Sachs.

CES Day 4   Nvidia disses AMD, AT&T s fake 5G, 6G talk, Google Assistant s friends

FT subscribers can click here to receive #techFT every day by email.

 Wow, underwhelming huh? 

Jen-hsun Huang, the playful chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, had just bounced into a press conference  straight afterLisa Su, head of rival AMD, had used her CES keynote to launch a new graphics card.

 The performance is lousy and it's nothing new,  he said ofAMD's next-generation Radeon VII." No ray tracing, no artificial intelligence 	. 	. 	. 	we'll crush it. 

It was the kind of jokey trash talk that gamers like to trade with one another. But after the winning score she has just racked up on Wall Street, Ms Su would be forgiven for shrugging it off.

AMD has just come off a year in which itwas the best performing stock in the S&P 500, with a gain of nearly 80 per cent.

Nvidia? Not so much. Its shares are off 51 per cent over the past three months. That haswiped nearly $90bn from its stock market value after an incredible tenfold increase in the previous two and a half years.

At least Mr Huang was able to joke about the cryptocurrency collapse that has been one of the main causes for the reversal. That's my wish for this year   I don't want anyone buying cryptocurrencies,  he said.

The slumpin bitcoin's value in 2018 left Nvidia with a huge excess-inventory problem as cryptocurrency mining using its graphics cards became much less profitable. We basically shipped no new GPUs [graphics processing units]into the channel for one quarter  to try to clear the glut, he said.

Graphics chipmakers started out trying to please players with realism and effects in video games, but the powerful rendering engines they created have led toother uses in crypto mining, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and autonomous cars.

While Nvidia's chief has touted its progress with the auto industry at recent CES shows, it has been less of an emphasis this year, with just a partnership with Daimler announced and the promise of a new self-driving system in 2020.

That is in tune with other tech and car companiesthrottling down expectations about the rate of progress on the road to fully autonomous (Level 5) cars. Richard Waters writes about the change in mood here in Vegas.

Jen-hsun Huang is characteristically optimistic about getting to Level 5 and is already looking ahead to the next challenge his processors can solve with artificial intelligence.

 The next generation is where AI comes out of the cloud and into the physical world   therobotics revolution,  he said.

What happens in Vegas

Fake 5G?AT&T chief executive John Donovan wasforced to defendthe 5G E lettering that is coming up on its phones, replacing LTE. 5G Evolution is only a halfway house to a true 5G nationwide service. AT&T also put outa press releasesaying this would be in place by early 2020.

6G is definitely not hereBut that did not stop CES holding a session on "6G and the quantum internet . With no protocols or standards or infrastructure yet, the panellists had little idea what shape it would take. One of them, Cisco's Michael Beesley, gave hispredictions to ZDNet.

The government shutdownis being felt at CES:US transportation secretary Elaine Chao was a no-show for her big keynote speech on self-driving and drones on Wednesday.

Banks Take the Hint From Regulators and Test AI to Spot Criminals; Regulators are nudging lenders toward experimentation, saying they won't necessarily punish them for weaknesses the technology exposes

By Kristin Broughton and Samuel Rubenfeld

Artificial intelligence has transformed some parts the banking industry, but one critical area watching out for financial crimes such as money laundering has been late to the party.

The hold up? Lenders fear AI might be too good. Some worry the technology will reveal suspicious accounts that slipped through legacy systems, unearthing weaknesses in monitoring and exposing them to regulatory scrutiny.

Older technology relied on fixed parameters set by humans. But AI, which already powers customer chatbots and automated stock trades for banks, also can be deployed in monitoring software that can adapt with each fishy account it spots, enabling them to better keep pace with criminals' tactics.

"The banks were saying that  I need a signal I need a sign from regulators that I'm not going to get dinged,'" said Gary Shiffman, chief executive of compliance technology company Giant Oak and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies.

That signal came last month, when financial regulators said banks wouldn't "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-encourages-banks-to-innovate-in-anti-money-laundering-compliance-1543878973" for previously undetected red flags they discover while tinkering with anti-money-laundering compliance technology such as AI.

Lenders such as U.S. Bancorp have come to recognize the benefits of working closely with regulators on AI implementation. As a result of the statement, more financial services companies are following suit, seeking AI guidance from agencies such as the U.S. Treasury Department's anti-money-laundering division.

The Dec. 3 statement laid bare the challenges of adopting new forms of technology in a heavily regulated industry and particularly in banking, as lenders recently have paid heavy penalties for not keeping AML procedures up to snuff.

U.S. Bancorp, one of the nation's biggest regional banks, began using AI in its anti-money-laundering compliance division two years ago to comply with the terms of a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-bancorp-enters-into-consent-order-in-anti-money-laundering-case-1446743491"from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which cited the company for having gaps in oversight.

The Minneapolis-based bank worked with the OCC to develop new ways to spot suspicious transactions using internally developed machine- learning technology. It also added two AI specialists to its compliance division.

The investment has given the bank's compliance officers the tools they need to move beyond a simple, rules-based system for instance, pulling up a list of cash transactions based on size to one that improves with every suspicious payment it uncovers.

The company now has the tools to run more advanced searches, flagging customers who look statistically different than others based on more indicators. Its algorithms also account for suspicious transactions that are referred to the bank by branches and law enforcement agencies.

The OCC "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-lift-consent-order-against-u-s-bancorp-11545437078"against the company in December. U.S. Bancorp's deferred prosecution order from the Justice Department, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-bancorp-charged-over-relationship-with-race-car-driver-scott-tucker-1518710467"and also related to AML deficiencies, remains in effect.

"The joint statement by regulators on AML innovation reaffirmed our efforts in continuing to explore machine learning and artificial intelligence in our transaction monitoring regime," said Dana Ripley, a U.S. Bancorp spokesman.

Although regulators adopted a stance of leniency in their statement, they also reminded banks they have a legal obligation to protect the financial system from abuse by illicit actors, suggesting that lenders have little room for error once the compliance monitoring technology is fully implemented. Regulators recommend that lenders validate their technology before flipping the switch.

Among the biggest promises AI offers to financial compliance departments is the prospect of reducing the amount of time employees spend chasing down false leads cases, for instance, where customer payments are halted because they trip internal alerts, proponents say.

Singapore's United Overseas Bank Ltd., for instance, recently tested machine-learning software developed by a local startup, Tookitaki, yielding promising results: false flags on consumer accounts declined by 60%, and by half for corporate customers.

"Once you improve the number of false alerts, you reduce unnecessary customer interactions because [you] don't have to ask for more information," said Victor Ngo, group head of compliance at UOB.

Other foreign banks, including U.K.-based Standard Chartered PLC and HSBC Holdings PLC, also have announced partnerships with software providers and upstart firms.

Technology providers are looking to capitalize on the green light U.S. regulators have given the industry, and expect spending on compliance technology by banks to increase in the year ahead.

International Business Machines Corp. in 2017 "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-launches-watson-for-financial-regulation-1497412862"product to help banks spot criminals. The product sifts through unstructured data, including the text of wire transfers, and spots suspicious accounts based on patterns of transactions.

IBM has conducted pilot programs for nearly a dozen banks during the past year, said Marc Andrews, vice president for financial crimes and conduct risk. Of those tests, three banks two U.S. banks and the U.S. operations of a foreign-owned bank have moved into production, he said.

The joint statement from regulators could prompt more pilot programs. "We believe that this is going to drive significant growth and investment," he said.

 Mr Methodical  Vijay Advani on building a fund behemoth

Hiking with friends in some of the world s great mountain rangesgave Vijay Advani a guide in his 30-year ascent to his current role.

As chief executive of Nuveen, the $988bn US asset manager, Mr Advani draws readily on his experience of walking trips in the Canadian Rockies, the Dolomites and the Andes.

 You have a goal but no matter how meticulous the planning for the trip, you always have to make changes to deal with events that are not predictable,  says the 58-year old in his first media interview since assuming leadership of the investment arm of TIAA, the New York financial services provider, in 2017.

TIAA bought Nuveen for $6.25bn in 2014 in the asset management industry s biggest deal since the financial crisis, and combined the $231bn multi-boutique with its in-house investment operations. The enlarged business, which comprises 13 affiliates, operates under the Nuveen brand.

Somewhat confusingly, the parent group has kept the TIAA name, which traces its history to the foundation of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America in 1918. 

The TIAA/Nuveen deal was slow to produce the desired benefits, a criticism Mr Advani acknowledges.

 We were not well knitted together as an organisation but polepole [slowly and steadily] we are building a global footprint,  he says, recalling the advice, in Swahili, of the guides that accompanied him while trekking on Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa.

His ambition is to complete Nuveen s change to a  premier  global player that can compete with BlackRock and Vanguard.

 2019 is all about execution [of our plans] for Nuveen. The biggest challenge is deciding which opportunities to prioritise. We have to be methodical and thoughtful in how we allocate our scarce resources.We can t be like kids in a candy shop,  he says.

 Methodical and thoughtful  is an apt description of Mr Advani, who spent his early career at the International Finance Corporation. This period convinced him that more diverse groups make better decisions.

 Nuveen s senior management group is a collage. We enjoy vibrant debate, looking at a shared problem through different eyes. You end up in a better place through free and open conversation,  says the father of three adult daughters.

He then spent more than two decades at Franklin Templeton, where much of his time was devoted to building sales outside the US. Rising to be co-president, he was seen by some observers as a contender for the top job at Franklin before being poached by Nuveen in December 2016.

His priorities for this year include strengthening Nuveen s distribution and the packaging of its capabilities to suit new clients in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

This will include expanding quantitative investment, an area where Nuveen already manages about $43bn, and adding artificial intelligence capabilities. He also wants to develop  deeper, more meaningful relationships  with US institutional clients.

Assessing progress will not be straightforward; TIAA is a private company that does not publish group annual reports.

Nuveen is one of the world's largest real estate investment manager, overseeing property assets worth more than $100bn. It is also one of the world s largest agriculture investors, managing more than 1.9m acres of farmland. It is one of the biggest almond growers and one of the largest US producers of grapes for wine, part of an expanding range of alternative assets that includes energy, infrastructure, private equity and timber.

With the world s population projected to increase from 7.6bn to almost 10bn by 2050, demand for food will riseat the same time as the environment faces an unprecedented threat from climate change.

Many environmental campaigners fear that increased demand for farmland will inevitably result in more deforestation, particularly in countries such as Brazil, where Nuveen owns just under 739,000 acres.

Mr Advani s response is that Nuveen is committed to preserving farmland for the long term, conserving water, minimising the use of chemicals and respecting the rights of local communities.

 Sound stewardship is imperative for us,  he says, pointing to Nuveen s annual publication of data showing how its agricultural activities measure up to the farming guidelines in the UN-backed principles for responsible investment.

Mr Advani is determined that Nuveen should win more recognition for its work in responsible investing. 

Last year, Nuveen helped to create and invested in the world s first  blue bond  issued by the Seychelles government, which raised $15m to finance ocean-based projects, expand protected marine areas and boost the local fisheries industry. 

 Responsible investing is an integral part of Nuveen s history and our future. We are not doing this just because it is a trend that is hot in the market today. We need to better articulate what we have been doing for 50 years,  he says.

Nuveen is the world s largest investor in dollar-denominated green bonds used to finance environmentally sustainable projects, according to Mr Advani. Some issuers of green bonds have been accused of  greenwashing    raising capital for dubious schemes, a problem that he recognises.

 We are still in the early stages of the development of the green bond market. More supply will help investors become more discerning about quality,  he says.

Under his leadership, Nuveen has increased impact investing in projects such as affordable housing,which deliver social benefits and attractive financial returns.

Last month, Nuveen invested about $32m to acquire a one-fifth stake in Aavishkaar-Intellecap, an Indian social impact investment specialist.

Nuveen s private equity unit is in the process of raising $500m for a fund that will have a social impact focus.

In the past, Nuveen has been criticised by As You Sow, a Californian shareholder advocacy group, as a supporter of excessive pay awards to company executives.

Mr Advani, who was paid $6.75m in 2017, rejects this criticism, pointing out that a quarter of the 300 corporate engagements carried out by Nuveen in 2017 related to executive compensation. 

There is little doubt that Mr Advani is pulling his weight.He spent 42 weeks on the road in 2017 and spoke to the Financial Times in London during a round-the-world trip.

 There is no substitute for meeting clients and discussing problems face-to-face. You have to wear out your shoe leather,  he says.

More shoe leather will be worn out during his next planned hike, in Siberia. Once again his endurance will be put to the test  and that should serve him well at Nuveen.

More Companies Flag a New Risk: Artificial Intelligence ; The number of firms reporting AI as a risk factor in their annual reports more than doubled last year

Carlyle Group LP, Overstock.com Inc. and AmTrust Financial Services Inc. are among the growing ranks of companies whose annual shareholder reports now include artificial intelligence as a risk factor.

About 55 companies mentioned AI in the risk-factor section of their annual reports filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018, more than double the approximately two dozen the prior year, according to Nick Mazing, research director at investment research platform Sentieo Inc.

And in 2016, the number of companies mentioning AI as a risk in SEC filings was practically nonexistent, say MyLogIQ and Calcbench Inc., two other providers of public company data.

Risk-factor sections of SEC filings typically outline a wide range of potential problems that could arise for a business, from the impact of climate change to a downgrade in credit ratings. Some risks don't materialize, but the company must consider the risk material to include it in this disclosure.

It isn't enough to simply identify such risks. Companies should begin a formal process to project how they might affect their business, according to one lawyer.

"If companies view artificial intelligence as a risk, they should describe how they see it impacting their business over the short, medium and long term," said David A. Katz, a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in New York.

Companies that have identified AI as a potential risk can take several steps to reduce their exposure, said Mark Beasley, professor of enterprise risk management at the Poole College of Management at North Carolina State University. These include expanding research and development efforts into AI, acquiring the technology through mergers and acquisitions or partnerships, and examining how AI is affecting other industries to study instances of successful implementation.

"A lot of the preparation is about beginning to anticipate where AI could be disruptive," Mr. Beasley said.

When it comes to managing the risks of deploying AI across the business, companies need to have a holistic risk and control framework to safeguard themselves, said Shaheen Dil, senior managing director at management consulting firm Protiviti Inc.'s Advanced Analytics practice.

This means the business side and the data scientists must work together when developing the algorithms, companies must create centralized templates and control processes, and AI output must be continuously monitored.

"You need to have ongoing monitoring so that your chatbots, your machine learning models and your deep learning models are not learning inappropriate behavior," Ms. Dil said. "You need a validation process for your AI models, just as most banks have validation processes for most financial models."

Of the companies now saying AI poses a potential drag on their business, about half are in the technology sector, according to MyLogIQ. The entertainment, media and communication and the financial-services industries had the next most AI risk mentions.

Here are some companies mentioning AI as a potential risk and their reasons for doing so:

Carlyle Group LP

In its most recent annual shareholder report, the investment firm with $212 billion of assets under management said AI could rewrite some of the rules in its already intensely competitive industry.

"Our competitors have instituted, or may institute, low-cost, high-speed financial applications and services based on artificial intelligence, and new competitors may enter the asset management space using investment platforms based on artificial intelligence," the Washington-based company said. It declined to comment further.

AmTrust Financial Services Inc.

The property and casualty insurance underwriter said any inability to keep up with rapid technological advances could hurt results.

Aided by lower costs and faster speeds, "companies offering new applications and insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence are becoming more competitive with more traditional company sales methods," AmTrust said in its recent annual report.

"As technology continues to evolve, more tasks performed by people may be replaced by automation, machine learning and other advances outside of our control," said the New York-based company. It couldn't be reached for comment.

Overstock.com Inc.

The online retailer and blockchain technology company warned starting last year that a failure to keep or attract key employees could hinder its growth and hurt its financial results.

"Competition for such personnel particularly technical personnel including high-end data engineers, experts in rapidly developing fields including artificial intelligence and machine learning, and other technical experts is intense," said the Midvale, Utah, company, which declined to comment further.

Booking Holdings Inc., TripAdvisor Inc.

Booking, an online-travel services provider whose brands include Priceline.com, Kayak and OpenTable, said it is under pressure to keep up with rapid technological changes.

The widespread adoption of new services such as Amazon's Echo and Alexa and Google Home, and developing technologies such as artificial intelligence "could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify our services," Booking said in its past two annual reports. As a result, the Norwalk, Conn., company said, those forces could hurt its business. The company couldn't be reached for comment.

Similarly, TripAdvisor, another online travel site, said in a filing last year that new devices and home assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Home, and developing technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, could hurt its business.

TripAdvisor also said some competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, as well as more expertise in developing online commerce.

"In addition, many competitors, including online search companies, continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage," the Needham, Mass., company said in a 2017 filing. "We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors."

TripAdvisor spokesman Brian Hoyt said public companies are required to list in SEC filings a wide range of potential risks to their business. He said TripAdvisor, like other technology companies, continues to work with AI and machine learning to improve the customer experience.

Korn Ferry, Kelly Services Inc.

In each of their past two annual reports, personnel consulting firm Korn Ferry and employee staffing provider Kelly Services said their success depended on customers' demand for talent, and warned that technological advances could significantly disrupt the labor market and rapidly weaken demand for human employees.

Los Angeles-based Korn and Troy, Mich.-based Kelly said that some tasks now done by people may be handled by automation, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

That trend poses a risk to the personnel consulting industry as a whole, they said, particularly to players dependent on lower-skill jobs.

Korn Ferry and Kelly Services had no additional comment.

Microsoft Corp.

The technology company is increasingly focused on building platforms and services "for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence" across several computing devices, the Redmond, Wash., business said starting in 2017. That presents competitive and execution risks as rivals also are rapidly developing cloud-based services, it said.

In its most recent annual shareholder report, Microsoft also said that, although AI is expected to improve customers' productivity, any flawed algorithms, insufficient data sets or biased information could hurt the technology's effectiveness and expose the company to liability. Microsoft also said some AI could be controversial, potentially harming the company's reputation. Microsoft didn't include that risk factor in a more recent quarterly report. The company couldn't be reached for comment.

Good day. Venture-capital firms in 2018 closed the books on a banner year for fundraising.

Some 549 venture funds in the U.S. raised $54.46 billion in 2018, according to new data from VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones & Co. That represents a 43% increase over the $38.11 billion raised in 2017.

And now on to the news...

Top News

Consumer genomics and health: Millions of people have turned to 23andMe Inc. to learn about their past. Now the company hopes its genetic tests will help people take control of their future. Under a new partnership with Lark Technologies Inc., users of Lark's online tool will be able to get highly specific recommendations about foods and activities that could affect their health depending on certain genetic variants that are linked with weight and activity levels. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

Basically a billion: Greenspring Associates has raised $999 million for a new global venture-capital fund of funds. The firm is one of the limited partners that contributed to a strong year for fundraising by venture funds, having backed managers including Primary Venture Partners last year. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has more.

SEC's  CryptoMom' talks: Cryptocurrency startups and traders fighting stricter regulation think they have found their champion. They call her CryptoMom. Hester Peirce, a Republican member of the Securities and Exchange Commission with libertarian leanings, has made waves with a number of contrarian positions since joining the agency last January. She earned the CryptoMom moniker after casting the lone vote in July in favor of allowing what would have been the first retail investment fund tied to bitcoin. The WSJ's Dave Michaels has the story.

Geron's Take: Crypto Hijacking Exposes Vulnerability of Digital Coins

By Tomio Geron

Ethereum Classic, one of the top 20 largest tokens by market capitalization, has come under an attack from hackers who in effect are seeking to steal tokens from others on the network.

Blockchain-based digital coins like Ethereum Classic are supposed to be tied into a decentralized ledger, or network. But this so-called "51% attack" aims to control more than half of the ledger and grab the power to change ownership of a coin or token.

Coinbase, the operator of digital wallets for cryptocurrencies, says it has documented some $1.1 million in Ethereum Classic transactions that were later altered and moved to unauthorized addresses.

And just like that, your theoretically immutable digital ledger of secure transactions is neither immutable nor secure, which raises troubling questions for crypto startups whose tokens are supposed to have unchangeable transactions.

More in Geron's Take.

Bankers joining fintechs find adrenalin and bruised egos

Former bosses of Barclays and Citigroup describe the ups and downs of financial technology

Bounding into a nondescript Manhattan conference room, former Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit is a powerful advertisement for swapping the banking world for the glamour and promise of financial technology.

His firm Orogen has invested more than $350m in fintech groups, and while Mr Pandit says he is working more  intensely  than he expected when he set up the venture two years ago, he savours being part of the  significant shift in the architecture of finance  that is gripping the sector.

Fintech groups are growing rapidly, challenging established financial institutions by harnessing new technologies   such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition   to offer new services such as online lending and automated investment advice.

Antony Jenkins, who was forced out as Barclays chief in 2015, is similarly full of the joys of his new life even though his fintech 10x Future Technologies recently lost out on a big contract with Virgin Money.

The former Barclays boss says his new job is  essentially brilliant ; he relishes being more hands on with his 200 staff and was  never concerned with all the status and resources that went with  running a bank with 120,000 employees and operations all over the world.

Jonathan Larsen, the former global head of retail banking at Citigroup who now runs the fintech fund at 10x investor Ping An, says Mr Jenkins  involvement brings a  huge amount of credibility  to the venture.

As banks face tougher regulation, fierce competition from start-ups and endless cost cuts, fintech has become a tantalising prospect for those who feel the  old  industry has too many constraints, is losing too much ground or is unable to pay their wages any more.

But while Mr Pandit and Mr Jenkins give a glowing account of their fintech reincarnations, interviews with more than a dozen other former bankers paint a more nuanced picture where the freedom, adrenalin rush and rapid growth of fintech is tinged with unrealistic expectations, mismatched skill sets, bruised egos and sharp wake-up calls.

 It s a complete culture shock,  says Darragh McCarthy, a former senior executive in Morgan Stanley s fixed-income division who set up FinTrU in Belfast five years ago and now has a team of 330 people offering regulatory solutions to investment banks.

Mr McCarthy recalls the sudden realisation that  I needed to do everything myself from building my first website to ordering my internet line to ordering business cards and printing my PowerPoints . Some of these were tasks he had not done in  probably 20 years 	. 	. 	. 	there were a lot of people below me to help, investment banks give you all that .

The practical support of big organisations is far from the only thing bankers miss.  I have seen several senior financial services people move into the start-up world and expect the world to still judge them as a managing director in a tier one bank,  says Arun Krishnakumar, a former Barclays risk expert who now runs a fintech and the healthcare VC fund Green Shores Capital.  They often don't realise that they start from scratch, and have to re-establish credibility. 

Mr Larsen, who made the switch from a big US bank to the fintech sector in 2017, says the move quickly reveals  how much of who you are is the stature that you have in your job, versus that substance of what you can do and what you can create .

That loss of stature  comes with the territory  for career changes, says Mr Pandit.  If those are the kind of things that bother you then you should do a lot of soul searching,  he adds.  Knowledge of who you are and what you like to do, and what you re willing to do in order to do what you like to do, is really critical. 

Sometimes bankers have to learn humility, at least in the early days. Nick Hungerford, a former Barclays wealth manager who founded the UK online wealth manager Nutmeg in 2011, says the biggest wake-up call for him in Nutmeg s early days was realising he had gone from being a  high achiever in a big bank 	. 	. 	. 	to suddenly going to be the guy who is by far the most useless person in the company .

 All the people who were building the product and coding the tech, very quickly I discovered that they were the ones who were critical and my job was making sure that they could do their work. I was the one who was buying lunch and cleaning the bathroom and fixing the office,  he says.

Then there is adjusting to working for something smaller.  I miss the breadth of potential activities you can do,  says Santiago Suarez, a former JPMorgan banker who has just launched online lender Addi in Colombia.  I obviously miss the sense of scale, one of the easiest ways to start recruiting [is to tell people] 	 	. 	. 	. 	you will touch 2tn a day of dollar clearing volume. That s pretty cool. 

Aritra Chakravarty, a former HSBC banker who founded two UK-based fintechs, says:  If you re in an influential position in a bank then you can still make a pretty positive difference for millions of customers. Start-ups take time to get things up and running. 

A key reason so many bankers go into fintech is that they have credibility, contacts and transferable skills that should give them an edge over outsider entrepreneurs.

 FinTrU does not have a single client that isn t somehow people that I worked with or worked for or worked for me,  says Mr McCarthy.  FinTrU s marketing angle is built on the power of my network 	. 	. 	. 	They know my reputation and trust me that when I say I will do something, I will do it. And they understand that I know the pressures they are facing in an investment bank. 

He adds:  People talk about fintech, they talk about the tech and they forget about the fin. 

Mr Suarez says that when he meets Colombian regulators he makes  a point of bringing up those JPMorgan credentials fairly regularly. In San Francisco, it would be  oh my God you worked for a large bank are you a dinosaur?  Here they [finance credentials] help you quite a lot. 

Mr Jenkins says his personal brand is  quite important , since the problem 10x is trying to solve   unleashing the power of digital banking   is a  problem I deeply understand .

 People are willing to listen because obviously I ve been there,  he says, adding,  it [profile] only gets you so far .

Mr Chakravarty says a combination of experience in investment banking and digital execution helped him to raise $5m within five weeks of leaving his job at HSBC. Bankers he saw on the fundraising circuit without execution experience were raising less, he says.

He adds that his experience winning budget for internal projects also stood him in good stead.  In the venture capital space, you just need one guy to say yes,  he says, adding that inside a bank  you just need one guy to say no .

Other senior bankers who have made the switch to fintech include Anshu Jain, the former Deutsche Bank boss who is an adviser to the US online lender SoFi, and Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who ran the blockchain technology specialist Digital Asset before quitting last month.

Mr Jenkins and Mr Pandit are not blind to fintech s challenges for some of their fellow finance alumni. Mr Pandit says having a commercial proposition is crucial, adding that  technology is not a business model .

 It absolutely isn t for everybody,  says Mr Jenkins.  You have to see the world in a different way 	. 	. 	. 	that allows you to both identify problems and identify solutions that other people haven t thought of. 

 When you are doing this type of work it s an adrenalin ride,  he adds.  Things happen very fast, some things work, some things don t. You don t have the security of a large organisation behind you to absorb the ups and downs, and for some people that would be an uncomfortable transition to make. 

Mr Suarez says he advises people that  starting a company should be the last option, not the first option . He adds:  A totally under appreciated path is to join a company that has a proven track record and is growing like crazy. 

People should not swap from banks to fintech so they can retire sooner, he warns.  If that s your trade you should go into private equity or a hedge fund,  he says.  The expected value of those careers is just much higher. Doing a start-up, the odds are it won t work out. 

The dos and don ts of getting into fintech

Do: Think hard first.  Really think about what motivates you, what you re passionate about, and think about have you identified a problem and secondarily do you have a solution which is far superior to any other solution out there and then are you willing to go on the journey that inevitably has ups and downs as an entrepreneur,  says Antony Jenkins.

Do: Show you care.  You just don t hire people that aren t passionate for the area the fintech is working [in],  says Nick Hungerford.  No one survives a start-up if they don t believe in the mission, it s just not worth the emotional and physical and financial stress. 

Do: Temper your expectations.  No one pays you JPMorgan money when you have an 11-person start-up, but it can be quite exhilarating,  says Santiago Suarez.

Don t: Write off the competition.  Never underestimate the power of incumbents, for the profitability they have, the scale they have, the customers they have,  says Vikram Pandit.  There are incumbents that can move fast. 

Don t: Expect an easy ride.  It s very tough to create a new business,  says Jonathan Larsen.  This is a long road and I m sure there are some people who get lucky very soon but they are few and far between. 

Don t: Think it s an escape from regulators.  The notion of regulatory arbitrage as a reason to go and build something new is not a good premise,  says Mr Pandit.  The notion of escaping the intent of regulation is a tough one [to achieve].

WeWork deal is reworked: SoftBank Group Corp. has scrapped a planned $16 billion investment in shared-office space provider WeWork Cos., opting instead for a smaller deal of about $2 billion amid market turbulence and opposition from investment partners, according to people familiar with the matter. The two companies could announce the smaller deal as soon as Tuesday, valuing WeWork at about $36 billion, with half of the money going to buy shares from existing investors, the people said. The WSJ's Eliot Brown has the exclusive.

Funds for the facilities: Office-support marketplace Managed by Q Inc. has raised $25 million in new funding. Existing investors RRE Ventures and GV provided the funding, along with new investors and strategic real-estate firms Oxford Properties and DivCo West, which also invested in WeWork.

Chernova's Take: Market Slump May Spur LPs to Revisit Venture Funds

By Yuliya Chernova

Limited partners, this year, might evaluate their new capital commitments in venture funds against the backdrop of a declining stock market. Here is how they could approach such a scenario.

In a bear market, the total assets under management of an institution generally decreases as stocks tend to be the largest asset class. So the illiquid portion of which venture capital is a part increases in relation to the total portfolio. That can put a crimp on LPs' desire and ability to make new bets.

"I'm always paranoid about fundraising," said Michael Kim, managing director of fund of funds Cendana Capital. "But objectively speaking, the denominator effect can be real, as is a change in LP sentiment (and) the psychological change in thinking about risk."

Since private-equity and venture-capital assets are illiquid, if they rise as a percentage of total assets, LPs may start to worry.

More in Chernova's Take.

Heard on the Street
New Worry on Catastrophe Bonds

By Paul J. Davies

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Two years of U.S. storms, floods and fires have racked up losses for insurers and led investors in catastrophe-risk markets to question their exposure for the first time in years.

Last year's California wildfires, floods in the Carolinas and other disasters are expected to cost insurers about $70 billion. That is less than the $144 billion cost of catastrophes in 2017, according to Swiss Re. However, 2018's hits are causing more concern for catastrophe bonds and other sources of alternative reinsurance, where investors like pension funds put up money to help insurers cover potential losses and earn a yield in line with the cost of insurance premiums.

It often takes months or years to settle large reinsurance claims. While this work is being done, some investor cash remains tied up -- or trapped -- in case it is needed to pay claims. Right now, about $20 billion of alternative capital is trapped, according to David Flandro, global head of analytics at broker JLT Re. That money wasn't available to underwrite new policies at the start of 2019, when about half the world's reinsurance policies are renewed.

There is less trapped capital now than at this time last year, but investors then were willing to plow fresh money into the market because they thought 2017's losses would bring a sharp rise in catastrophe-cover prices. But those price rises disappointed, while claims from 2017 grew during 2018.

"In the second half of last year, investors suffered creeping extra losses from 2017 and then new losses started to arrive," said Luca Albertini, chief executive of catastrophe-fund manager Leadenhall Capital Partners. "Some investors didn't fully understand the risk that losing money wasn't just something that would happen once in 50 years."

Investors' newfound caution has hit capacity for the reinsurance bought by reinsurers in particular, driving prices up by 10% to 20% in January, when other prices were mostly flat. That meant an extra cost for traditional reinsurers, but they continue to chase growth, according to UBS analysts.

The current doubts likely won't alleviate the problem of excess capital that has long weighed on prices -- and profits -- for traditional reinsurers. Despite recent losses, investors see catastrophe risk as a valuable way of diversifying economic risk, so the market is likely to keep growing in the longer term.

And right now, there is still up to $50 billion of excess capital across traditional and alternative reinsurance, according to JLT Re and UBS. That makes it hard for traditional reinsurers to pass on higher claims and cover costs to clients. Even after two years of disasters, reinsurers' pricing power and profitability face further pressure in 2019.

Fund industry prepares for 2019's gales

It's only January 7 but the outlook is already moderate to rough and could become worse. Jennifer Thompson reports

A fter a troublesome 2018, fund management bosses hope the new year will offer some relief. Costly regulatory reforms combined with tumultuous markets, floundering Brexit talks and heavy outflows led to problems for many companies. Will the next 12 months be less turbulent? FTfm takes a peek at asset managers' in-trays.

Regulation From a regulatory point of view 2019 promises an easier ride. "We haven't got a Priips or a Mifid II coming down the line," says Martin Davis, chief executive of Kames Capital and head of asset management in Europe for Aegon, Kames' Dutch parent.

However, the senior managers and certification regime, a system introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK financial regulator, is due to be in place later this year and will hold fund executives to account.

"This is a deeply significant piece of legislation," Mr Davis says. Under the regime, high-ranking individuals will have to sign off public reports that examine whether a fund gives value for money. Executives will be personally on the hook should a product disappoint. One asset management boss, who did not want to be named, says "there is absolutely concern" from staff about the degree of personal liability. He says this is positive: "It is bringing a degree of accountability."

Pay and jobs Strongly performing markets have helped boost pay in recent years. Although 2018 was flat, the bonus pool in spring 2019 should still be healthy, says Tim Wright, a partner at consultancy PwC, but he warns that a higher industry headcount will mean that payouts per person are likely to be less   and that the outlook beyond the first quarter is gloomy.

"We're seeing increased pressure on profitability," he says. "As a result we're going to see increased pressure on pay as well." He says this will be worse for investment professionals in the UK and US as, when compared with their counterparts in mainland Europe, more of their package is set by variables, such as bonuses.

Fund management bosses are reluctant to comment in detail but the general feeling is that the pay environment will be tougher. "I think the base will continue to creep up. The question is how much variables will go up," says Mr Davis, referring to the industry in general.

Although large pay rises may be out, some specialists could be exceptions. "There will always be a war for talent," says Thorsten Michalik, former co-head of the global coverage group at DWS, the German asset manager. He believes competition for employees who are skilled in environmental, social and governance issues, as well as data or AI specialists, will support salary rises.

More ominously, Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive at Hermes Investment Management, warns not of pay cuts but about jobs. "I think you're likely see more people let go," he says.

Brexit "What's keeping me awake is March 29 [the date the UK is set to leave the EU]," says Mr Davis. "In terms of short-term disruption, that is by far the most significant. What are the rules going to be? The market dislocation, markets reacting to uncertainty, that's causing real concern."

Amid the uncertainty, large asset managers with British operations have already fired the starting gun on contingency plans. Many intend to beef up or move parts of their operation to Dublin or Luxembourg.

"We are fortunate to have operations across the EU that will allow us to continue to support our clients," says Chris Willcox, chief executive of asset management at JPMorgan Asset Management. The $1.7tn group has operated in Luxembourg for more than 30 years but Mr Willcox says he is "prudently planning to be prepared to serve clients in any eventuality".

Not all are in this position. "Forty per cent of investment firms have already moved some operations in preparation for Brexit," says Julie Patterson, head of asset management regulatory change at KPMG. She says companies should focus on the types of contract that need amendment as these may require agreement from clients, distributors, counterparties and suppliers.

ESG investing Investing with ESG criteria has moved into the mainstream. "I don't see 2019 as some sort of discontinuous break," says Hugh Lawson, head of ESG and impact investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "Investors are more attuned to asking the question: what businesses are they supporting with their capital, what do [the companies] do and how do they do it?" Ian Simm, chief executive at Impax, a $16bn sustainable investment manager, says his challenge will be managing the growth in new assets, attracting staff and increasing the size of IT and compliance teams. "We've got an unprecedented level of new growth," he says.

A lot of progress was made in 2018 in terms of what is expected of investors, says Jessica Ground, global head of stewardship at Schroders. She cites new European rules that make it clear that institutional investors and asset managers have a duty to consider sustainability when they make investments; there is also renewed pressure on UK pension funds to consider the ESG effect of holdings. Ms Ground says much has still to be done in formulating ESG disclosure frameworks for companies receiving investment. "We haven't got that framework right yet," she says.

Cyber security Cyber risk is at the front of managers' minds, particularly since last year's EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation, which requires companies to report any breach of personal data within 72 hours. "[Cyber security] is a big issue. You can't let up on that," says Anton Sternberg, chief executive for investments at Stonehage Fleming, the wealth manager. Although more asset managers are pushing companies for assurances on how they would deal with a cyber attack, the industry itself is seen as a digital laggard. Asset managers have a limited understanding of cyber risk, according to the FCA. It recently urged the sector to make dealing with potential attacks a priority. "Digital readiness for asset management is at the lower end of all industry sectors," says Mr Willcox. "We talk a lot about digital, big data, AI ... but there has been more talk than action."

Fee pressure Asset managers predict that pressure on fees will continue amid increased regulatory scrutiny and asset owners seeking better value. Fees for active and passive funds are expected to decline, according to a report by PwC, which predicts that a quarter of actively managed funds could disappear by 2025 as product ranges are streamlined. "There will definitely be fee compression, no doubt about that," says Mr Michalik.

The trend is most marked for passive products. In August Fidelity Investments, the $2.5tn Boston group, announced it was cutting the cost of all its index-tracking mutual funds as well as introducing no-fee products. "You hear a lot about the margin compression in active   but it's been nothing short of brutal in passive, where scale is the only game in town," says Mr Willcox. "We don't see the pressure easing."

Return for active? The refrain of active managers is that bumpy global markets, as appear likely for 2019, will allow them a chance to shine. "We'll definitely see more demand for active," says Mr Michalik.

Mr Simm adds: "It definitely is a great market environment for active to be rebuilding."

Although increased volatility may allow stockpickers to shine, the theory is unproven. What does this mean for the attractiveness of passive investing? "There will be a natural saturation point for passives," says MrDavis. "I'mnot calling thatmarket [but] I think we're getting close to whenthatmightbe."

Mr Willcox stresses that "it's not a zero-sumgame", with both activeand passive assets expected to grow in absolutetermsin the long term.

he says., though:"We are entering a cycle where complexity will increase. Investors looking at more opaque markets, like fixed income, emerging markets and alternatives, may be better served by active managers wheredeepinsightaddsvalue."

Potential sell-off The length of the post-financial crisis bull run is fuelling fears that it could end in a panicked sell-off amid evaporating liquidity .

"We are already seeing significant drying up of liquidity in big chunks of the credit market," says Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management.

Hewarns this could, in aworst-case scenario, lead to the controversial practice of gating, in which managers block investors taking money out of funds to prevent their collapse.

GAM, the Swiss fund manager, caused disquiet among investors inAugust when it blocked them withdrawing money from its crisis-hit absolute return bond strategies.

"As valuations rise, so does the likelihood of market volatility or perhaps even a correction," warned Deloitte in its 2019 outlook report.

Investing In Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- In Translation: Two Metrics: Go and II

Big changes are happening at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

It means you'll be hearing more about two economic metrics: gross output and intermediate inputs. The two are related, but for economists, the latter has a meaningful use as an indicator of future economic activity. The BEA has been stepping up the speed at which it releases data on the metrics.

Gross output, or GO, measures an industry's sales to final users of its products, while intermediate inputs, or II, record the size of an industry's sales to other sectors. The former would include sales of dishwashers to consumers; the latter would include wooden planks used in construction.

One way to think about GO, II and gross domestic product is to envision an income statement from a public company.

"GO is top line and GDP is the bottom line," says Mark Skousen, a presidential fellow at Chapman University, in Orange, Calif.

The II data, meanwhile, tell you how the economy will perform in the future.

When the growth rate of II increases, you should expect economic growth to increase about one quarter later, says David Ranson, director of research at financial analytics firm HCWE & Co. It works vice-versa, too, according to an HCWE analysis. That makes II a leading indicator of economic activity.

Although the BEA is releasing II data more quickly, it still isn't fast enough to be useful in forecasting and isn't used in the Conference Board's widely followed Leading Economic Index.

The BEA says it plans an even speedier release of the data in the future, though it hasn't specified a date.

U.S. News: First-Time Home Buyers Tap Families --- More borrowers are getting help from the bank of mom and dad as house prices rise

Rising home prices are sending first-time buyers to their parents for help with mortgage down payments.

More than 26% of mortgage borrowers who used Federal Housing Administration -insured loans got assistance from a relative to make the down payment in the 12 months through September, up from about 22% in 2011, according to data released late last year.

The FHA , an arm of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , insures lenders against losses on the sometimes riskier loans they make. Borrowers taking out FHA loans are predominantly buying homes for the first time and often have weaker credit profiles that make it harder for them to get a conventional loan. It makes sense these borrowers might need to ask for help, but the FHA is keeping an eye on whether the share doing so keeps rising.

While conventional mortgages can require buyers to put down as much as 20% of the purchase price upfront, FHA buyers can pay as little as 3.5%. Such loans make up about a 10th of all U.S. home-loan originations, a share that has declined in recent years.

Though the pace of home-price growth has slowed, prices are still consistently rising year to year, and higher mortgage rates are making buying more expensive.

That has created a difficult situation for first-time buyers, many of whom are struggling to stockpile the cash for down payments. Factors including student debt and lackluster wage growth have made it difficult for many. The homeownership rate among those younger than 35 has fallen 8 percentage points since 2004 to 35% in 2017, according to Freddie Mac .

"It suggests a great deal about the housing market, which is the ongoing affordability obstacles for first time borrowers," said Karen Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics Inc ., a policy-analysis firm based in Washington.

Belen and Frank Medina, both 26, closed last month on a light-brown house on a cul-de-sac in Dallas. They ended up relying on her parents to contribute a $4,000 gift toward the 3.5% down payment for their FHA loan. Ms. Medina's parents indicated from the start that they would be willing to help them get the home they wanted, she said.

"We were trying to get this on our own but we did come up short with money," she said, given that they are also making two car payments.

Homeowners who get help with their down payments have historically been viewed as riskier because they have sunk less money into their property and thus have less to lose by walking away if home prices drop or if they are laid off.

In recent years, the credit quality of FHA borrowers has declined. The average borrower had monthly debt that was equal to 43% of income in 2018, marking the sixth straight annual rise in that measure of creditworthiness, according to the FHA report. The credit score of the average borrower declined to 670, the lowest level since 2008. Credit-reporting firm Experian PLC considers scores under 670 subprime.

In the lead-up to the housing crisis, many home sellers provided down-payment assistance to FHA borrowers to help close deals. They often routed such help through affiliated nonprofit programs that helped exacerbate the pain when the market crashed, some say. Such practices have since been prohibited.

Industry executives say that assistance from a family member doesn't pose the same level of risk as getting help from a property seller. When the housing market falls, the thinking goes, borrowers feel more of an obligation to protect their relatives' equity.

"I think that family assistance has a higher moral bearing on people when things turn tough in the housing market," said Sanjiv Das, CEO of Caliber Home Loans Inc., the fifth-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by loan volume, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.

That bears out in the data the FHA has tracked since 2011. Among FHA loans issued in the 12 months ended in September 2011, 7.6% of those in which a family member helped with the down payment are now delinquent for 90 days or more. That's above the 5.2% rate for FHA homeowners who didn't get assistance, but less than the 9.3% rate for those who got assistance from a party besides a relative or the government.

Verily, the Alphabet Inc. spinout formerly known as Google Life Sciences, has raised $1 billion in new funding as it looks to expand in the health-care industry globally.

Private equity firm Silver Lake led the round, with participation from Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan.

This is the second time Verily has raised outside capital since it was launched by Alphabet in 2015 and brings the company's total capital raised to date to $1.8 billion. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat and Silver Lake's Managing Director Egon Durban have joined Verily's operating board.

The South San Francisco company gave few details on plans for the funding, but said it will broadly go towards expanding existing programs and partnerships as well as forming new ones.

Verily is currently involved in a number of initiatives within diagnostics, precision medicine and health data management and analytics. Recently, Verily announced it was pausing work on a glucose-sensing contact lens, which was the key project from which the company was formed.

The company is currently working with a number of research institutions and medical device, pharmaceutical and electronics companies including Biogen, Dexcom, GSK and Nikon.

Verily also collaborates and invests in small private companies. In late 2017 the company launched the Partner Space, a dedicated lab and office space for startups. Tenants include liquid biopsy startup Freenome Inc.

More First-Time Home Buyers Are Turning to the Bank of Mom and Dad; Among borrowers using FHA loans, which come with low down payments, more than 26% tap relatives for financial help. That's up from 22% in 2011.

Rising home prices are sending first-time buyers to their parents for help with mortgage down payments.

More than 26% of mortgage borrowers who used Federal Housing Administration -insured loans got assistance from a relative to make the down payment in the 12 months through September, up from about 22% in 2011, according to data released late last year as part of the agency's "https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Housing/documents/2018fhaannualreportMMIFund.pdf".

The FHA , an arm of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , insures lenders against losses on the sometimes riskier loans they make. Borrowers taking out FHA loans are predominantly buying homes for the first time and often have weaker credit profiles that make it more difficult for them to get a conventional loan. It makes sense these borrowers might need to ask for financial help, but the FHA is keeping an eye on whether the share doing so keeps rising.

While conventional mortgages can require buyers to put down as much as 20% of the purchase price upfront, FHA buyers can pay as little as 3.5%. Such loans make up about a 10th of all U.S. home-loan originations, a share that has declined in recent years.

Though "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-october-1542812683", prices are still consistently rising year over year, and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-rates-fast-approaching-5-a-fresh-blow-to-housing-market-1539266400". What's more, many who missed the chance to purchase homes at modest prices are waiting for a pullback to jump in.

That has created a difficult situation for first-time buyers, many of whom are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/millennials-want-to-buy-homes-but-arent-saving-for-down-payments-1495731583". Factors including student debt and lackluster wage growth have made it difficult for many to keep up with rising home prices. The homeownership rate among those younger than 35 has fallen 8 percentage points since 2004 to 35% in 2017, according to Freddie Mac .

"It suggests a great deal about the housing market, which is the ongoing affordability obstacles for first time borrowers," said Karen Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics Inc ., a policy-analysis firm based in Washington.

Belen and Frank Medina, both 26, closed last month on a light-brown house on a cul-de-sac in Dallas. They ended up relying on her parents to contribute a $4,000 gift toward the 3.5% down payment for their FHA loan. Ms. Medina's parents indicated from the start that they would be willing to help them get the home they wanted, she said.

"We were trying to get this on our own but we did come up short with money," she said, given that they are also making two car payments.

Homeowners who get help with their down payments have historically been viewed as riskier because they have sunk less money into their property and thus have less to lose by walking away if home prices drop or if they are laid off. Some contend that parents helping children with down payments helps perpetuate a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460" where prices have been rising and buyers perceive a dearth of homes for sale.

In recent years, the credit quality of FHA borrowers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-home-prices-push-borrowers-deeper-into-debt-1523356200". The average borrower had monthly debt that was equal to 43% of income in 2018, marking the sixth straight annual rise in that measure of creditworthiness, according to the FHA report. The credit score of the average borrower declined to 670, the lowest level since 2008. Credit-reporting firm Experian PLC considers scores under 670 subprime.

In the lead-up to the housing crisis, many home sellers provided down-payment assistance to FHA borrowers to help close deals. They often routed such help through affiliated nonprofit programs that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121426681678998589", some say. Such practices have since been prohibited.

Industry executives say that assistance from a family member doesn't pose the same level of risk as getting help from a property seller. When the housing market falls, the thinking goes, borrowers feel more of an obligation to protect their relatives' equity.

"I think that family assistance has a higher moral bearing on people when things turn tough in the housing market," said Sanjiv Das, CEO of Caliber Home Loans Inc., the fifth-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by loan volume, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.

That bears out in the data the FHA has tracked since 2011. Among FHA loans issued in the 12 months ended in September 2011, 7.6% of those in which a family member helped with the down payment are now delinquent for 90 days or more. That's above the 5.2% rate for FHA homeowners who didn't get assistance, but less than the 9.3% rate for those who got assistance from a party besides a relative or the government.

Nearly 39% of FHA borrowers get down-payment assistance, including from family, the government or another entity, a rise the agency says it is watching to see if it turns into a trouble spot. That is up from less than 30% in 2011.

Saving for a down payment can be a challenge even for borrowers with good credit and steady income, and some companies are coming up with creative ways to help. Niche programs are letting buyers use "https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-savings-no-problem-these-companies-are-helping-home-buyers-with-down-payments-1530270002", rent out a room on Airbnb or "https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-explores-a-new-investment-your-home-1518955201" in exchange for down payment help.

Lauren Maxwell, executive vice president at mortgage lender CrossCountry Mortgage Inc. in Naples, Fla., said about half of her clients who take out FHA loans for first-time purchases get help from family.

"Most people can't just come in and have the down payment and the closing costs," she said.

% Bernstein downgraded Diageo and Pernod Ricard to  underperfrorm  with price targets of 24.20 and  116 respectively.  Although we expect strong long-term growth, we note that in general premium spirits are more economically sensitive than beer. These are not guaranteed growth stories,  the broker said.

Pernod and Diageo have climbed to trade at a premium against peers of 18 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, in a drinks sector that has reached a record premium to the market, said Bernstein. Risks lie on the downside as a consumer slowdown in China or the US would erode estimates and valuation multiples, or a soft landing would trigger sector rotation back into sectors more sensitive to economic growth, it said.

US internet stocks derated last year from 19.5 times forward ebitda to 15.6 times on an enterprise value basis, while profit forecasts have been revised only modestly lower, said Goldman. The sector s high returns and growth relative to valuation led it to repeat  buy  ratings on Amazon, Alphabet, Paypal and Grubhub, as well as Facebook, Twitter and Spotify.

Netflix, which was given a $400 target price,  represents one of the best risk/reward propositions in the internet sector , said Goldman.

 We continue to believe Netflix s investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the U.S. and internationally. While we also believe that these investments and the associated cash burn (roughly $3bn in 2019) will require it to return to the high-yield debt market over the next three years, we see a path for Netflix to both double its annual content investment and generate positive cash returns by 2022 Goldman Sachs to both double its annual content investment and generate positive cash returns by 2022 

Online travel companies should be avoided due to pressures on traffic and from the lodging industry, though Experian was an exception because of its superior positioning as rivals cut advertising spend, said Goldman.

Priced at less than 10 times earnings, Intel provides  compelling  exposure to trends including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G communications networks, autonomus vehicles and the internet of things, said Merrill.

% Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Schroders to  outperform  from  neutral  as part of an asset management sector review. Schroders and French peer Amundi were the high-quality stocks to own in 2019 assuming the markets remain benign, it said.

Sophia Genetics raises $77m after Mike Lynch quits board

Fund chaired by Al Gore invests in start-up after ex-Autonomy founder agrees to step down

Swiss genomics start-up Sophia Genetics has raised $77m from investors including Generation Investment Management, a fund chaired by former US vice-president Al Gore, after embattled British entrepreneur Mike Lynch agreed to step down from its board.

Mr Lynch was charged in November with 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud in the US for allegedly overstating the financial performance of Autonomy, the business he founded and sold to HP in 2011 for $11bn.

The charges have raised questions for companies that Mr Lynch has backed through his London-based investment vehicle Invoke Capital, including Sophia Genetics and cyber security start-up Darktrace.

Lilly Wollman, co-head of growth equity strategy at Generation Investment Management, said Mr Lynch agreed to step down from the board of Sophia Genetics before he was indicted.

He had come under growing pressure since his former Autonomy colleague, Sushovan Hussain, was convicted in the US of 16 counts of fraud last April.

 As part of our investment and before the indictment, we agreed with Sophia that Mr Lynch would step down from the board,  she said.  There was obviously noise around Invoke and the Autonomy investigation long ago, and we just thought it could prove a distraction for the company and that it would be in their best interest if he stepped down. 

Invoke Capital is not under investigation, and still has a seat on the board of Sophia Genetics.

 Mike has decided to step away from some of his public-facing roles whilst he focuses on clearing his name,  Invoke Capital said.  This was his decision alone and, whilst it s a shame, it s the right thing to do. 

The $77m investment is understood to value Sophia Genetics at about $450m.

Jurgi Camblong, the start-up s chief executive and founder, said the company would use the money to expand further into the US and add new sources of data to its platform ahead of a planned initial public offering in 2021.

 We believe that there will be a tech giant in our industry, but that will require a lot of capital,  he said.  Going public is the most financially viable way to grow, for transparency reasons and trust. 

Sophia Genetics uses supervised machine learning technology to analyse genetic data, providing doctors with suggested diagnoses. It has benefited from scientific advances in genomics, which have driven down the cost of sequencing human genomes and fuelled a wave of funding into the sector.

Between 2016 and 2017, global investment into genomics start-ups more than doubled to $3.6bn, according to research firm CB Insights. The figure fell to $3bn last year, but the number of investments remained broadly consistent, with 157 investment deals last year compared with 159 the year before.

Mr Camblong said Mr Lynch and Invoke Capital provided useful advice on striking deals with hospitals.

 They are very good at sales,  he said.  It is a sales kind of mindset so they [were] very good at turning us from a more scientific player to a proper tech player. 

The company has deals with 850 hospitals and recently expanded into  radiomics    the analysis of medical images from MRIs, PET-scans and X-rays to predict the evolution of tumours.

James Wise, partner at London-based venture capital firm Balderton Capital, an early investor which participated in the latest funding round, said that in the long term the start-up could begin to analyse wider pools of data for clinical insights.

 Sophia is expanding into new product lines and moving beyond just looking at genetics, radiomics is a good example of that, so is looking at the impact of drugs 	. 	. 	. 	symptoms.  he said.  In the long run you need to take a whole range of data.

AI Helps Auto-Loan Company Handle Industry's Trickiest Turn; Prestige Financial Services wanted to boost growth without lowering lending standard

A few years ago, subprime auto lender Prestige Financial Services Inc. found itself rejecting 25% more borrowers than usual as delinquency rates climbed for borrowers with bad credit.

"It got to the point where we, as an executive team said,  We've got to find a way to increase our volume,'" Steve Warnick, Prestige senior vice president for risk management, said of approval rates that had fallen from a typical 40% to 30%.

Wrestling with how to boost business while maintaining underwriting standards, Prestige last year partnered with ZestFinance Inc., an artificial-intelligence software developer founded by Google's former chief information officer, and started drilling down into some 2,700 borrower characteristics instead of the couple of dozen that the lender typically had on its risk-assessment scorecard.

Prestige, owned by the same family that controls NBA's Utah Jazz, is among a growing number of lenders, including Synchrony Financial and Ford Motor Credit Co., that have looked into the future and believe it could include artificial intelligence as a tool to take increasing amounts of data and find relationships between variables to help determine creditworthiness.

Instead of looking simply at whether a potential borrower has ever filed for bankruptcy, for example, the machine-learning system helped Prestige consider such factors as when the bankruptcy happened, and analyze that data with other variables, including previous car-payment records and time spent living in his or her current residence.

The timing of a bankruptcy is important because individuals are restricted from repeatedly trying to wipe out their debts. So someone fresh out of bankruptcy for the first time might be a better credit risk than someone who filed, say, six years ago, said Douglas Merrill, ZestFinance CEO and founder.

Merrill joined Google in 2003 and spent five years there as CIO and engineering vice president. He lost his hearing as a young child after an auditory-nerve infection but eventually got his hearing back.

"The power of AI is being able to look at more signals," he said. "If you're building an AI model you can have hundreds or thousands," of such signals, including whether people have defaulted on rent payments or cell-phone bills. Additional criteria can include the number of payments that are 90 days past due, the number of months since the most recent delinquency, and how many accounts are current.

Synchrony Financial, the credit-card business that General Electric spun off in 2015, recently said it was deploying new artificial intelligence that would ease access to credit. The company says the types and amounts of data it uses in underwriting have quadrupled in the past 20 years and it expects "to see that number grow in the coming year."

"The way credit has been done for the last 30 years or so is using credit bureaus and credit-bureau data and maybe some other things," Synchrony Chief Executive Margaret Keane said in October at Money20/20, a payments and financial technology event.

"What artificial intelligence and machine learning allow us to do is to get much broader perspective on consumers, and we're going to be able to lend more to people who were invisible" thanks to additional data shedding light on their creditworthiness, she said.

Synchrony long has worked with many small companies, including ZestFinance last year, to test artificial intelligence. The company ultimately decided to develop in-house a new system to make better use of the significant and rising amounts of data available on consumers, including purchasing history, bank data, utility information and social media habits.

Such tools could improve the ability to make credit available instantly, helping shoppers and retailers, said Carol Juel, Synchrony chief information officer.

"All of that creates the ability to better understand the customer," Ms. Juel said. "The key is having the technology and a sophisticated platform that allows users to use that data in underwriting" with speed.

For nearly two decades, Synchrony was the sole issuer of Walmart Inc. credit cards, but, in July, the retailer said it was switching to Capital One Financial Corp. Walmart executives "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-10-billion-tussle-over-walmarts-credit-cards-1540378800" because, among other issues, they wanted Synchrony to approve more applicants. Walmart introduced Synchrony to ZestFinance.

Ford Credit said last year it teamed up with ZestFinance to study alternative data's ability to help forecast defaults, and found that machine learning improved risk prediction and had the potential to broaden approvals, including to those with low credit scores or thin credit files.

Ford Credit spokeswoman Meredith Libbey says her company continues "working on models with machine learning."

Backers of ZestFinance, which was founded in 2009 and has about 100 employees, have included Lightspeed Venture Partners, Upfront Ventures and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.

Prestige Financial is part of the Larry H. Miller Group of Cos., which also owns car dealerships and controls the Jazz.

In September Prestige said its lending volume doubled, to $55 million in August from a low of $25 million during the tightest credit conditions. The new loans perform as well as those made under the old system, said Mr. Warnick.

Mr. Warnick said the deployment was uneventful because potential problems were anticipated. He said Prestige shifted immediately into the new system, and said companies that want to run a new lending model in tandem with an existing process might have challenges that his company didn't experience.

While attributing some growth to expanding into new dealerships, he also credits the use of artificial intelligence. Approval rates peaked at 40.9% in June. The additional qualities that Prestige weighs through artificial intelligence "allow us to be better at predicting the result of the loan," Mr. Warnick said.

Some Tips on How to Incorporate AI

* Have a clear goal to generate results that can be used in the real world.

* Focus on a few meaningful projects so you can get your machine-learning effort out of the lab, and avoid getting sidetracked by science projects.

* Get as much data into the model as possible to maximize return on investment.

* Have an internal champion who can move the project along, and get risk, legal, compliance and business teams engaged in the process.

* For companies involved in lending and credit, make sure the machine-learning models are compliant with banking regulations and can be explained to regulators.

Oliver Ralph reports that Legal & General does not see an insurance solution that will pay for the "cost of end of life care crisis", which is undoubtedly correct if taken in isolation ("Insurance is not the answer for UK social care woes, says insurer", FT.com, December 29). However, the insurance industry will certainly be a part of the longer-term solution which requires prioritised cross-party agreement.

The most fundamental matters to address are likely to be an entirely new strategy in developing "retirement villages", where appropriate accommodation and services can be delivered with far greater economic efficiency, as well as taking the strain off both the National Health Service and local authorities.

The life insurance industry could be the most obvious of investors in such infrastructure projects if the UK government can interpret the Solvency II rules that permit and encourage such investments under Tier 1 and 2 capital guidelines. This would provide the life and pensions investment funds with long-term property investments with an annuity income. This is something L&G is already pioneering   and so playing an important role in achieving some of the solutions required   but the scale needs to be much greater and across the whole life industry.

For the younger generation, longterm savings products to fund their "end of life" costs will be the sort of commercial answer that the insurance industry will need to consider   if the solution turns out to be funding the running costs of the retirement villages strategy.

The insurance industry also has much to offer the government in its knowledge and experience in information technology and now artificial intelligence in addressing practical solutions to delivering care.

In short, the forthcoming green paper on end of life care will require a response that avoids political party positioning and where the insurance industry could play a very important role both in examining possible solutions   there will be many alternatives within the mix   and be aligned in the capital investments needed to deliver a more holistic series of solutions.

"Europe's social contracts have a common backbone they are based on a long-established inclusive growth model characterized by a more egalitarian view of revenue generation and distribution," Jacques Bughin and Christopher Pissarides write in a VoxEU column. "However, in recent years, the economic crisis "https://voxeu.org/article/testing-resilience-europe-s-inclusive-growth-model?mod=article_inline" on this model, especially for the Mediterranean cluster." The authors write that "new McKinsey Global Institute research suggests that the upward pressure on inequality could &intensify as the result of the interaction of six global trends that are coming of age at the same time.

 The six trends are aging demographics; digital technology, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI); increased global competition and migration; climate change and pollution; and shifting geopolitics." The column concludes that "challenging times politically and economically lie ahead. However, history has taught us that nations emerge from uncertain societal transitions by taking rapid action, engaging in fresh thinking, experimenting with new models of social contracts, and using social protection as an insurance against failure."

The U.S. private sector added 271,000 jobs in December, according to a report released Thursday, driven by hirings at medium-size businesses and in the service sector.

The increase in private payrolls in December was up from 157,000 jobs added in November, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. The latest report revised downward the number of private-sector jobs added in November to 157,000 from 178,000.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting the report to show the private sector added 178,000 jobs.

Most of the increase was driven by medium-size businesses, or firms that have anywhere from 50 to 499 employees, which added 129,000 jobs, according to the report. Small businesses, with 49 or fewer employees, added 89,000, while large businesses, those with more than 500 employees, added 54,000.

"Businesses continue to add aggressively to their payrolls despite the stock market slump and the trade war," Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said in prepared remarks. "Favorable December weather also helped lift the job market."

Many of the new private-sector jobs came from the service sector, especially professional and business services as well as health and education, the ADP National Employment Report showed. The service sector added 224,000 in December.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its nonfarm job numbers on Friday. Economists expect 176,000 new nonfarm jobs to be added to the economy and an unemployment rate of 3.6%, according to a WSJ poll.

Investors Betting Fed Will Pause Rate Hikes | PBOC Revises Rules to Encourage Small-Business Lending | Derby's Take: China's Bite Out of Apple Is Worth Fed's Attention; The Wall Street Journal's central banking newsletter for Thursday, January 3, 2019

Good day. Market expectations of what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates this year have shifted dramatically in recent weeks, with federal-funds futures now showing a 91% probability that the central bank's benchmark rate will end 2019 at or below the current level. Two months ago, the market indicated a 90% probability the benchmark would end the year higher than it is now. In China, the central bank tweaked rules to encourage bank loans to more small companies, which have been strapped for cash as growth in the world's second-largest economy slows. And on that topic, Michael S. Derby asks how the Fed will interpret Apple's warning that sales of iPhones in China will disappoint.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Investors Are Betting That the Fed Hits Pause on Rate Hikes

Investors "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-are-betting-that-the-fed-hits-pause-on-rate-hikes-11546449520?mod=hp_lead_pos2" the Fed will hold interest rates steady in 2019, a sign of fading confidence in the global economic expansion at odds with the central bank's recent view of stable U.S. growth this year. Whether investors are right will turn on how much the U.S. economy slows in 2019 and the degree to which recent market volatility curbs business investment and hiring and weighs on consumer spending in the coming months. Fed officials already expect the economy's growth rate to moderate this year as it faces slower growth abroad, waning fiscal stimulus and the lagged effects of the Fed's recent moves to drain reservoirs of monetary stimulus. For investors' bets to prove prescient, growth would need to slow below the 2.3% rate Fed officials expected when they raised rates last month and penciled in two more increases for 2019. Recent market turbulence could make investors' skittishness a self-fulfilling prophecy.

China's Central Bank Revises Rules to Encourage More Small-Business Lending

China's central bank"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-central-bank-revises-rules-to-encourage-more-small-business-lending-11546437872" on bank lending to the country's cash-starved small businesses, the latest move to support the private sector in an economy that faces growing headwinds. The People's Bank of China said Wednesday that enterprises with bank credit lines of less than 10 million yuan ($1.5 million) now are seen as small and micro enterprises, and bank lending to these companies, if reaching a certain amount, can make lenders eligible for lower reserve requirements. Previously, only loans to companies with less than 5 million-yuan credit lines had been seen as small and micro loans.

China's Bite Out of Apple Is Worth the Fed's Attention

It's rare that company earnings news would by itself be of major interest to the Fed, but not every company is technology giant Apple Inc.

The firm startled investors Wednesday when it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revises-guidance-sees-lower-revenue-in-fiscal-1st-quarter-11546465050". And the firm didn't blame American consumers.

"While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we "https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/?mod=article_inline" the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China," Apple leader Tim Cook wrote. "In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100% of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China."

President Trump's trade fight with China played a starring role in Apple's troubles. Mr. Cook wrote that China began to slow last year and has booked some of its slowest forward momentum in a quarter-century. What's more, "we believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States."

That's a flashing yellow light for an American economy that is already expected to book slower growth in 2019 after a solid 2018. So far, the U.S. economy has managed to weather the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs relatively well, with economists and policy makers struggling to find a tangible impact.

Some central bankers have even expressed sympathy for Mr. Trump's hard line on China. Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashkari "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-wsj-interview-with-minneapolis-feds-neel-kashkari-1543868057" he was "broadly sympathetic with the view that 20 years of talking to China hasn't gotten us anywhere, so we need to there needs to be another approach," although he declined to say whether Mr. Trump had found it.

Global growth is nevertheless a concern for the Fed. It said in its December Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement that it was monitoring overseas events. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at the post-FOMC press conference the central bank has seen a modest slowdown in global growth, while adding ""https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chairman-jerome-powells-postmeeting-press-conference-11545256592" of growth in the aggregate around the world."

Apple's announcement suggests China, the U.S.'s largest trading partner, could be more problematic than most now expect.

At the same time, the drag China has placed on Apple stands to have a negative influence on stocks given the company's big role in equity markets. More bad news after a tough December for stocks also could weigh on consumer and business confidence and wealth effects that had flowed from rising equity prices.

The Fed was already facing a difficult year when it comes to monetary policy. Its push for higher rates has been muddied by still low inflation despite a red hot job market. Mr. Trump's repeated attacks on the Fed's rate increases add another challenge. Meanwhile, the bond market is signaling the possibility of a downturn, and a recent survey of corporate financial chiefs "https://www.wsj.com/articles/many-u-s-financial-officers-think-a-recession-will-hit-next-year-11544612460" of a near-term recession.

If the implosion of demand that hit Apple is broader based, that means headwinds from overseas economies may increase. And that's not good news, anyway you look at it.

Former USC Basketball Coach Pleads Guilty in NCAA Corruption Case

By Rebecca Davis O'Brien

A former assistant basketball coach at the University of Southern California "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-usc-basketball-coach-pleads-guilty-in-ncaa-corruption-case-11546463975?mod=hp_lista_pos1" Wednesday to conspiring to take bribes in exchange for steering top players to financial advisers and sports business managers.

Anthony "Tony" Bland was among four college assistant coaches arrested in September 2017 as a result of an investigation into alleged corruption in college basketball. His case was set to go to trial this spring.

Mr. Bland pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery. He faces a prison sentence of up to 12 months.

A lawyer for Mr. Bland, Jeffrey Lichtman, said the guilty plea "acknowledges an aberrant act in an otherwise law-abiding life." Mr. Bland hadn't intended to harm any players, Mr. Lichtman said, adding: "While the NCAA's system of how it treats college basketball players is antiquated and broken, Tony's actions still violated the law and he accepts that responsibility."

Mr. Bland, who played at Syracuse and San Diego State, was fired by USC last year.

He faced four counts, including soliciting bribes for himself from aspiring sports agent Christian Dawkins, arranging payments to the families of two players and conspiring to defraud USC by causing the school to provide scholarships to athletes who were ineligible under NCAA rules because their families had received bribes.

Prosecutors alleged in charging documents that in July 2017, Mr. Bland met in a Las Vegas hotel room with several men, including Mr. Dawkins, a financial adviser and a purported investor (who was in fact an undercover agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation). At the meeting, which was secretly recorded by the FBI, Mr. Dawkins said he would give Mr. Bland $13,000 in cash from the man posing as the investor.

In exchange for the bribe, prosecutors said, Mr. Bland agreed to make sure that two USC players would retain Mr. Dawkins's company. In subsequent phone conversations captured on wiretaps, Mr. Bland helped arrange for players' families to receive $9,000 in additional payments. "I definitely can get the players," Mr. Bland said in a call excerpted in the criminal complaint. "And I can definitely mold the players and put them in the lap of you guys."

The probe by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI yielded charges in 2017 in three separate schemes, one of which has already led to a guilty verdict.

In October, a Manhattan federal jury convicted an Adidas AG executive and two others on charges related to payments they made to the families of top-ranked players.

Two of the defendants in the Adidas case former consultant Merl Code and Mr. Dawkins were also charged in the alleged scheme involving Mr. Bland. They are still set to face trial in that case, along with former University of Arizona assistant coach Emanuel "Book" Richardson and former Oklahoma State University assistant coach Lamont Evans.

One-time NBA star Chuck Person, a former coach for the Auburn men's team, was charged in a separate alleged scheme. He has pleaded not guilty to accepting bribes from a financial adviser and is set to go to trial in February.

The investigation itself was marked by scandal. One of the undercover FBI agents who offered bribes to Mr. Bland and others is under investigation by the Justice Department after he was accused of misappropriating government money and spending it on gambling, food and drinks during the probe.

Banca Carige Shares to Remain Suspended After ECB Intervention

By Nathan Allen and Pietro Lombardi

Banca Carige SpA (CRG.MI) shares will remain suspended from trading following the European Central Bank's appointment of temporary administrators to the lender, Italy's market regulator said late Wednesday.

Regulator Consob said the suspension will remain in force through the ECB's special administration, or until the administrators decide there is sufficient information available regarding securities issued or guaranteed by the bank.

The ECB appointed three special administrators and a three-member surveillance committee on Wednesday to take charge of the bank after a majority of its board members resigned. The administrators are tasked with maintaining Banca Carige's stability and ensuring it becomes compliant with capital requirements.

Trading is halted during the special administration as financial disclosure requirements are less stringent than during normal operations, and investor protection therefore can't be guaranteed.

Shares in the bank have fallen more than 80% over the past 12 months.

Testing the Resilience of Europe's Inclusive Growth Model

Year-End Review & Outlook (A Special Report): Markets & Finance --- Borrowing Rises, Fear Doesn't

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Americans owe more than ever before but so far don't seem to have much trouble managing the debt.

Consumer debt, including credit cards, auto and student loans and personal loans, is on pace to top $4 trillion in 2019.

That comes even as mortgage debt approaches levels last seen during the housing meltdown. Homeowners owed about $10.3 trillion on mortgages at the end of the third quarter, up 2.8% from a year earlier, according to Federal Reserve data. Mortgage debt peaked at $10.7 trillion in early 2008.

Easing the burden are a growing U.S. economy, wage gains, unemployment near a 50-year low and still historically low interest rates.

The result is few signs that consumers are under major strain. Losses on most consumer loans remain low. Consumer spending has increased 2.7% on average in the four quarters through September compared with the year-earlier period, as disposable income rose 2.7% on average, according to Moody's Investors Service.

Meanwhile, personal savings as a percentage of disposable income was 6.3% in the third quarter, above a 20-year average of 5.9%, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data.

"Debt increase is [a] sign of a strong economy," said Dana Peterson, economist at Citigroup Inc.

The pickup in borrowing in recent years reflects that lenders have grown more comfortable extending credit as the scars of the financial crisis faded. Outstanding debt started to dip in 2008 as consumers deleveraged and lenders wrote off unpaid-loan balances and tightened lending standards. That began to shift around 2014, when loan losses subsided and lenders loosenedcredit standards, in particular on credit cards and auto loans.

Consumers on average owed $6,826 on their cards as of September, up 1.9% from a year before and up 11% from 2011, according to credit-reporting firm Experian. Loans originated for new-car purchases between July and Septemberhit $30,977, on average, the highest for any third quarter on record. That was up 2% from a year earlier and up 11% from four years earlier, according to Experian. Monthly payments on new-car loans hit a record high of $530 on average.

Whether the growth in credit remains manageable likely depends on the outlook for the U.S. economy, which has been dogged by fears of a slowdown or even recession. Almost half of U.S. finance chiefs believe the economy will slide into recession by the end of 2019, according to a recent Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook.

Charles and Valerie Cyrus of Knoxville, Tenn., say they believe their student- and auto-loan debt is the highest it has ever been. They owe about $85,000 in student loans, $38,000 in auto loans and $16,000 on their credit cards. In 2017, they financed a new car for their daughter, adding to the two loans the couple have for their own cars.

The couple recently started paying more on their credit-card bills every month, and they are cutting back on how often they use their cards while trying to save more. They plan to pay off their nonmortgage debt in less than five years, Mr. Cyrus said.

"We just got in deeper this time than we did in the past," said Mr. Cyrus, a 42-year-old nurse practitioner.

By some measures, consumers are stretching more to afford their debt payments. Americans are paying 5.6% of their disposable personal income to stay current on nonmortgage debt, according to second-quarter Federal Reserve data. Its most recent low was 4.9% in 2012. It has been mostly rising since.

Take into account mortgage debt and other expenses, though, and Americans appear to be in better financial health.

Households are paying 9.8% of their disposable personal income to stay current on all of their loans, including mortgages -- around the record low reached in 2012, according to the Fed, and significantly below levels over the past 30 years. That is largely the result of millions of homeowners who took advantage of lower rates to refinance their mortgages, rising incomes and a postcrisis slowdown in home buying.

Additionally, total household financial obligations, a measure that includes debt and other expenses such as rent and homeowner's insurance, remains well below its record set in late 2007.

Some consumers who have taken on more debt in recent years have done so to take advantage of low interest rates. Jeremy Reyes, 31, said he owes about $19,000 on his 2016 Honda Pilot and that he recently paid off about $19,000 of credit-card debt. He used the credit card to buy appliances and furniture for the Orlando, Fla., home he and his wife bought in 2017. The card had a 0% promotional interest rate until December, when it switched to a roughly 11% rate. Mr. Reyes, a systems administrator in the IT sector, said he dipped into savings to pay off the balance in November to avoid interest charges.

"I feel pretty comfortable -- me and my wife work, so the income counts a lot," he said.

Economists and lenders see troubling signs in some loan categories. Cris deRitis, head of consumer-credit research at Moody's Analytics, says the "problem area" is with nonmortgage debt, credit cards in particular.

Credit-card loan losses are rising from a year earlier despite the low unemployment rate. The average share of card balances that eight of the largest credit-card issuers wrote off as a loss increased to 3.16% in the third quarter, compared with 3.03%a year ago and 2.59% two years ago, according to Fitch Ratings.

Lenders are pulling back in certain areas, lowering credit limits for subprime consumers and tightening auto-loan underwriting.

Student loans also are a particular concern. There is more than $1.5 trillion of outstanding student-loan debt, and some 92% of it is owed to the federal government, according to MeasureOne. Many federal-loan borrowers are postponing or making smaller payments on their loans than originally required despite the economic rebound.

"If borrowers can't pay down their student-loan debt now, in a time of relative economic prosperity, what will happen during the next economic downturn?" John Anglim, a credit analyst at S&P Global Ratings, wrote in a recent report.

International Property Report: Mexican Commercial-Sales Sector Absorbs One-Two Political Punch

Foreign investors have been wary about buying Mexican commercial real estate since Donald Trump was elected president partly on a threat to shred the North American Free Trade Agreement if that pact with Mexico and Canada couldn't be overhauled.

Now, just as the countries have settled on a new trade deal, another concern has surfaced that is keeping many investors on the sidelines in Mexico: the possible antibusiness policies of its new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist nationalist.

Just before he took office late last year, Mr. Lopez Obrador said he would cancel Mexico City's $13.3 billion airport, which many in the business community said was vital to economic growth. Other steps he has taken, such as the 2019 budget plan he announced in December, have assuaged some concerns.

Commercial-property sales volume, which fell sharply in 2018, is expected to stay low until there is more certainty about the new administration.

Those worries also have helped push borrowing costs higher, according to Alfonso Munk, chief investment officer of the Americas for PGIM Real Estate, Prudential's real-estate investment arm, which manages more than $3 billion worth of real-estate assets in Mexico.

Not all is gloomy in the Mexican commercial-property market. Supply and demand trends have kept rents and occupancies at healthy levels even while politics have put a damper on sales activity.

This has especially been true in the industrial-space sector. Trade between the two countries has been booming, keeping occupancy levels and rents at warehouses and distribution centers high.

Last fall, Mr. Trump reached a deal with Mexico and Canada to update the pact. That deal still needs to be approved by Congress.

But if it is, and the U.S. and Mexican economies remain strong, demand for space in warehouses and distribution centers will likely increase. The country's industrial-property market also might benefit from trade friction between the U.S. and China, analysts predict.

"The American manufacturer that wants to produce components of cars relatively cheaply will increasingly do that in Mexico," said Richard Barkham, chief economist of real-estate-services firm CBRE Group Inc.

Mexico was one of the first Latin American markets to attract many of the world's top foreign investors partly because of government steps to modernize financial markets. The country followed the lead of the U.S. in adopting the real-estate investment trust structure. Currently there are a dozen Mexican REITs, called Fideicomisos de Infraestructura y Bienes Raices, or Fibras, with a total market capitalization of more than $10 billion.

Still, in the past two years, political uncertainty has eroded investor enthusiasm for Mexican property. Sales in the first three quarters of 2018 totaled $600 million, down 40% from the same period in 2017, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

Fibra shares have been pounded. The largest, Fibra Uno, ended the year with shares trading below 22 pesos ($1.12) each. They were trading in the 37-peso range before Mr. Trump was elected.

PGIM, meanwhile, plans to develop residential and retail projects in about 10 locations, Mr. Munk said. "We've been in Mexico for 18 years," he said. "We've seen ups and downs and ultimately Mexico pulls through any kind of concern."

Banks Pull Back on Rewards Cards --- Consumers have figured out how to game the system, making the cards bad for business

Blake DiCioccio and her husband, Jason, flew around the world in business class in 2017, from San Francisco to Taipei, Tokyo to Belgrade, and Frankfurt back home. They didn't pay for it. JPMorgan Chase & Co. did.

The DiCioccios signed up for two Sapphire Reserve cards from the bank several months before their trip, on an offer that scored them hundreds of thousands of points, which they combined with points from their other rewards cards. They use credit cards as much as possible -- even for small purchases -- and strategize when to use Sapphire Reserve versus their other cards based on the points each offers. Mr. DiCioccio recently signed up for an American Express Platinum card, and the couple is now thinking about canceling one of their Sapphire Reserve cards to avoid the $450 annual fee.

"It's a game really -- like poker," said Ms. DiCioccio, 34 years old. "Some people come to the table knowing all the strategy and they have the best chance to win."

The ultra-premium rewards of the kind that JPMorgan has championed have turned into financial albatrosses. Big banks calculated that giant rewards would make consumers spend more, earning the banks more interest and boosting their returns. They calculated wrong.

Consumers have figured out how to game the system, spending just enough to earn generous sign-up bonuses -- then abandoning the cards in a drawer. Others pay their bills in full and avoid interest charges and late fees.

After ratcheting up the perks for several years, banks hit peak rewards frenzy about two years ago. Now banks face increasing costs associated with the cards. Rewards costs grew an average of 15% in the third quarter of 2018 from a year earlier at Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co., according to bank analyst Charles Peabody.

As of the third quarter, JPMorgan's credit-card holders had accrued $5.8 billion in rewards they had not yet redeemed, up 53% from the end of 2016, according to securities filings.

"For a lot of consumers, a credit card is the first step in a bigger financial relationship, and we're already seeing success with Sapphire customers doing more business with Chase," said JPMorgan spokeswoman Mary Jane Rogers.

Compounding the problem for banks: Interchange fees -- paid by merchants to banks whenever customers shop with a credit card -- are under pressure.

The fees are a primary source of funding for rewards programs, but retailers are trying to lower them. Merchants including Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. are pushing through lawsuits for changes that would lead to lower fees, and bank executives worry that such a shake-up could make some of the more generous rewards programs unsustainable. Merchants paid card issuers $43.4 billion in Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. credit card interchange fees in 2017, up 68% from 2012, according to the Nilson Report.

Mercator Advisory Group, a payments consulting firm, predicts that credit cards will deliver a return on assets in 2019 of 3% to 14 large banks highly concentrated in the card business, down from nearly 5% in 2014.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and other large banks, including American Express Co., are discussing how to cut back or rejigger some of their cards' rewards, according to people familiar with the matter. The banks don't plan to end rewards, but want to shift them in ways that encourage more card usage and scale back upfront bonuses, the people said.

Getting the calculation right -- without alienating customers -- is crucial. Credit cards account for an average of about 14% of revenue at Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, according to an analysis by Autonomous Research.

JPMorgan executives debated whether to stop letting cardholders pool together points from multiple cards, according to people familiar with the matter. JPMorgan's Ms. Rogers said the bank has no current plans to stop cardholders from pooling points.

Citigroup plans to cap the number of times each year its Prestige cardholders who stay at hotels four consecutive nights can get the fourth night free. A Citigroup spokeswoman says the bank is focused on fostering long-term relationships with cardholders.

AmEx has been introducing cards with fewer sign-up bonus points. An AmEx spokeswoman said the company is offering other bonus options, such as statement credits based on restaurant charges.

The banks face rewards enthusiasts who take pride in wringing the most benefits from each card.

For example, many cards offer "tiered rewards," where only certain purchases qualify for the most generous cash-back terms. That's no obstacle for customers like Tony Rodriguez, a 34-year-old Ph.D. student in Knoxville, Tenn.

Mr. Rodriguez and his girlfriend, Whitney Forbes, use the AmEx Blue Cash Preferred card for groceries, earning 6% back on up to $6,000 of purchases a year, and for gas, which earns 3%. They use Discover Financial Services' "it" card and a Chase Freedom card for purchases that qualify for 5% cash back. Those items change every quarter, so Mr. Rodriguez keeps a list on a slip of paper in his wallet. Everything else goes on their Citi Double Cash card, which gives 1% back on all purchases and 1% back when they pay off the bill.

Mr. Rodriguez, who is studying industrial engineering, began shopping around for cards about 2 1/2 years ago. "Soon, I realized there's all sorts of free money," he said.

Big banks pushed into credit cards after the financial crisis to offset a slowdown in their trading and mortgage units. JPMorgan and Citigroup poached top executives from AmEx, which made premium rewards -- with a high annual fee -- its calling card for decades, and copied the strategy.

Rewards competition began to heat up in 2013 when Discover launched the it card. A year later Citigroup created the Double Cash card, which also offered hefty rewards at no annual fee. Many banks view the rewards as a way to reach younger consumers and turn them into bigger clients by selling them other products, including wealth management services, as they graduate to bigger jobs and paychecks.

Merchants also typically pay higher swipe fees on the more generous Visa and Mastercard rewards cards -- typically more than 2.1% of a purchase on premium rewards cards, compared with roughly 1.2% to 1.7% on more standard rewards cards.

For the next couple of years, banks competed to come up with increasingly flashy cards. The frenzy reached a peak when JPMorgan introduced Sapphire Reserve in August 2016, offering 100,000 bonus points for consumers who charged $4,000 in the first three months, three points per dollar spent on travel and dining and a $300 credit on travel purchases, among other perks.

JPMorgan's Ms. Rogers said two years in, the bank had seen record retention levels topping 90% for its Sapphire Reserve customers.

At an investor conference, AmEx called it a "full frontal assault" to its longstanding Platinum card. Despite Sapphire Reserve's $450 annual fee, customers flocked to it so quickly that JPMorgan ran out of the metal cards and reached its first-year goal for new accounts in two weeks.

Within a few months, JPMorgan had misgivings about the card's costs. It halved the bonus points to 50,000 and dialed back in-branch promotion of the card.

The Sapphire Reserve card proved great for business for Brian Kelly, who started the rewards website The Points Guy as a hobby in 2010, while working in human resources at Morgan Stanley.

His website helped spawn an ecosystem of rewards fanatics across the internet who swap tips about card deals. The banks covet his favorable reviews of their cards and often turn to the site to promote them. In December, Mr. Kelly hosted a card awards ceremony in New York City, sponsored by JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and others.

JPMorgan had approached Mr. Kelly in spring 2016 to ask how his company would market an upscale card it had in the works. He learned more details about the card, which turned out to be the Sapphire Reserve, a couple of months later while on vacation in Tanzania with his parents. The bank agreed to pay The Points Guy each time readers visiting the website started an application and received the card. The site earned millions of dollars from the card in the months after it was introduced.

Despite misgivings about the rewards programs, banks are still competing for the customers who use them, and chipping away at rewards is risky.

James Fuller of Ellijay, Ga., used to charge about $30,000 a year to his Starwood Hotels & Resorts personal and business credit cards. He and his wife, Allison, used the points to stay for free at hotels in 17 states where they ran half-marathons.

Then Mr. Fuller, a 28-year-old high-school teacher and small-business owner, saw on online forums that the hotel, which was recently acquired by Marriott International Inc., and AmEx might scale back the cards' rewards. Sure enough, Marriott and AmEx made the cards' points significantly less valuable last year when redeemed for hotel stays. Mr. Fuller canceled the business card and slashed his spending on his personal card to about $300 a month, from a typical $2,500.

Mr. Fuller now puts most of his purchases on JPMorgan credit cards.

"We feel confident that the majority of our current SPG AmEx card members will get more value out of the card's new value proposition," said an AmEx spokeswoman. A Marriott spokesman said the card remains popular and is "a tremendous value proposition."

Rob Broadhurst, who lives in West Sacramento, Calif., saw on an online forum that JPMorgan planned to end price protection on Sapphire Reserve. In late March he and his wife, Katie Anderson, hurried to buy a new fridge for $1,599. Weeks later, when they found an online ad for the same model for $1,399, they rushed to submit a claim for the $200 difference, and soon got a check in the mail.

JPMorgan removed the card's price protection feature in August. "It was definitely a bummer," said Mr. Broadhurst, 34. The couple still use Sapphire Reserve, though, because they redeem the points for travel.

Banks have been lowering sign-up bonuses on premium cards since 2017, the year after JPMorgan introduced Sapphire Reserve. The bonuses averaged 66,000 points in 2016, before dropping to 58,000 in 2017 and 44,000 in the first seven months of 2018, according to consulting firm Simon-Kucher & Partners.

That is in large part because of concerns many card issuers have about "gamers," who open cards with rich sign-up bonuses and then stop using them once they have tapped out the early rewards. U.S. credit card attrition rates, a measure of how many cards are closed each year, reached 15% in 2017, up from less than 10% the year before, according to Mercator.

The issue was flagged by AmEx's then-chief Kenneth Chenault in 2017 when he was asked at an investor conference about competition from Sapphire Reserve. Card companies that are "driving the stakes up," he said, are "also getting people who are gamers."

In mid-2017, Krishnaswamy Narayanaswamy, who works in data analytics and is 54 years old, and his wife signed up for J.P. Morgan's Sapphire Preferred, which included a 50,000-point sign-up bonus. Then the couple, based in Vancouver, Wash., wanted to ditch the card to avoid paying an annual fee -- but closing the account, which was in his wife's name, would have hurt her credit score by reducing her so-called available credit.

They also didn't want to open a brand-new account, which could have impacted her credit score in other ways, like lowering her credit limit. So she transferred to another JPMorgan card that has no annual fee, the Chase Freedom, a move that didn't technically require closing or opening an account.

Banks are still grappling with how to wean consumers off the easy perks. Barclays PLC this past spring introduced a credit card without a sign-up bonus and instead offered up to 25,000 bonus miles each year to consumers who charged at least $25,000 on the card. Rachana Bhatt, a managing director at Barclays' U.S. credit card division, said in an interview at the time the bank hoped to appeal to long-term customers with a "sustainable" offer.

The Points Guy website, now owned by Red Ventures, gave the card a lukewarm review.

The card failed to take off. By early October the bank stopped taking applications.

The card "represented a disruptive approach in the industry -- rewarding customers for ongoing loyalty rather than just one up-front bonus," said Ms. Bhatt. "We took a smart risk, learned fast and pivoted."

From Michal Verdonck, Ghent, Belgium

I believe Katie Martin (  Year in a Word: Crypto , December 22) will later find herself in the awkward category of  predictions that people really regret , much like Clifford Stoll, who once confidently claimed that  no online database will replace your daily newspaper .

Ms Martin argues that the value of cryptocurrencies has collapsed and that one bitcoin now only fetches a  measly $3,380  (the equivalent of three shares in Alphabet). Unfortunately, she fails to grasp the potential effect of cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology on the infrastructure of the internet, the architecture of software systems and, eventually, society itself.

Being an information systems researcher myself, I have been investigating the impact of blockchain technology on our existing software and database systems and can sometimes only marvel at the future solutions this technology can offer us (think smart contracts, for example). Cryptocurrencies, and the start-ups behind them, are the first generation of companies exploring the use of blockchain in our everyday life.

Ms Martin concludes that  ultimately it was common sense that killed crypto. An internet search on the subject yields the frequently asked request for someone to  explain cryptocurrency like I m five .  Does that mean she believes that the inherent difficulty of explaining other complex concepts, such as artificial intelligence or the internet protocol, to a five-year-old will eventually bring about their downfall?

She ends by saying that those who do understand cryptocurrencies are surely clever enough to know the game is up. I would dare to say that the game has only begun!

Overall, 2018 was a good year for many private-equity firms. As the industry enters a new year, though, concerns about issues such as trade policy, market volatility and the future of the economy are growing. We asked a handful of senior private-equity and venture-capital professionals to share the New Year's resolutions they would like to see the industry at large adopt this year.

Ambar Bhattacharyya, Managing Director, Maverick Ventures

"To focus more on providing our heroes our founders and executives of our portfolio companies the support they need to be successful through a broader and more diverse set of resources, such as executive coaching and more defined mentorship."

Rodney Cohen, Managing Director, Carlyle Group LP

"2018 has been a year of running very hard. It would be nice to go back to our usual fast jog and be able to digest for a moment."

Bob Kocher, Partner, Venrock

"To spend more time, recruit our best talent and invest more capital tackling our biggest societal problems of access to affordable health care, access to awesome education, access to economic opportunities in rural America and access to a better environment."

Stewart Kohl, Co-Chief Executive, Riverside Co.

"To not misconstrue the meaning of the word  private' in private equity. We need to stop hiding our light under a bushel. PE is overwhelmingly a force for good. It creates jobs, promotes innovation, fosters compliance and generates significant tax revenues. The benefits of PE extend to the entrepreneurs and companies we back, the communities in which we invest, the customers we serve, the vendors we buy from and the investors that reap our superior returns."

Michael Kumin, Managing Partner, Great Hill Partners

"Invest wisely  this time' is rarely different."

Tricia Patrick, Managing Director, Advent International Corp.

"My resolution would be for the industry to continue to bring focus and awareness to diversity and inclusion. Across all levels of our institutions. Across our portfolio companies. These are not short-term issues, and they require our focus today."

Nicole Quinn, Partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners

"Like it or not, we live in an influencer world. Whether you're a large company, smaller brand, consumer or VC, being open to the benefit of working with celebrities and the long tail of influencers will set you apart. For Rihanna's Fenty to do nearly $100 million in their first month shows us what's possible. A New Year's resolution for the VC and influencer worlds to collide will create fireworks."

Jackie Rantanen, Head of Product Management, Hamilton Lane

"That our industry embraces 2019 as the year to finally dig in and really start to commit time and resources toward the use of data and analytics."

Bla Szigethy, Co-Chief Executive, Riverside Co.

"Encouraging PE firms to bring top talent from diverse backgrounds into our ranks first, because the industry is growing and needs great talent and, second, because we need to be able to have a broad array of talents, interests and backgrounds to deliver the best returns to our investors."

Tyler Wolfram, Chief Executive, Oak Hill Capital Partners

"We're privileged to work in an amazing industry. Fortunately, our asset class has proven effective over time. Be grateful. Respect the past, but resist the temptation of complacency, which is a huge risk factor at [private-equity] firms."

Richard Zannino, Managing Director, CCMP Capital Advisors

"That as an industry, we don't chase deal volume at the expense of investment returns. If you look at the velocity of fundraising, it's really ramped up. PE firms are coming to market faster and raising new funds. Management fees we all earn from that can be like a drug. If people are raising all this money and chasing all these deals and driving returns down, that would not bode well for the future of private equity as an asset class or as a business model."

Joseph Zidle, Managing Director, Blackstone Group LP

"Avoid building excess capacity. Late in an economic cycle is when decision makers often start to become overconfident and plan for demand that doesn't materialize. That is the start of excess capacity, and typically marks the beginning of the end of an expansion."

Deal Makers Came Close to Record Year

By Dana Mattioli, Dana Cimilluca and Ben Dummett 
1,029 words
31 December 2018
The Wall Street Journal

The year got off to a fast start for deal making as companies struck mergers including Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.'s $63 billion acquisition of Shire PLC. The pace was so torrid, some thought 2018 would be the biggest year ever for M&A.

But choppy financial markets, trade tensions and fears of an economic slowdown hampered deal makers when they returned from summer vacation. It was still a good year and is set to go down as the third-busiest ever for M&A, trailing only 2007 and 2015, with more than $3.8 trillion in announced deals.

It was also a good year for the bankers and lawyers who helped arrange all those corporate marriages, for which they reap fees that can run into the tens of millions of dollars. The Wall Street Journal spoke to some of those who landed the biggest transactions and asked, among other things, what's in store for 2019.

Roger Altman

Mr. Altman, founder and senior chairman at Evercore, had a seat at the table for a chess match between some of media's most powerful players, advising Comcast Corp. on its $38.7 billion acquisition of Sky PLC. Comcast outbid 21st Century Fox Inc. -- itself involved in a deal with Walt Disney Co. -- ending a monthslong takeover battle.

"The three or four most complicated transactions I ever worked on all occurred in the last two years," says the longtime deal maker.

Mr. Altman remains upbeat, but acknowledges that declines in the stock prices of advisory firms such as Evercore and Lazard suggest investors are less certain. Either way, the proliferation of thorny deals is here to stay, he says.

Frank Aquila

Mr. Aquila, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP who has advised corporate clients in consumer, health-care and other industries, helped arrange one of the year's largest energy deals, working with Andeavor Corp. on its $23 billion sale to Marathon Petroleum Corp., announced in April. "I thought we were going to see more activity than we did in the second half of the year," he says.

But Mr. Aquila says he isn't fretting about 2019, in part because M&A is part of the day-to-day decision-making at big companies now. "I don't think we're going to go through the type of boom and bust we've seen in prior periods," he says.

Scott Barshay

When the powerhouse corporate lawyer left white-shoe firm Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP in 2016 to be the global head of M&A at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, all eyes were on whether members of Cravath's storied stable of clients would follow. In October, when International Business Machines Corp., a decadeslong Cravath client, tapped Mr. Barshay to do its largest deal ever -- the $37 billion purchase of Red Hat Inc. -- he proved that even some of the stickiest Cravath clients remained loyal to him.

He seemed to find a role on one big deal after another in 2018, including the planned marriage of

Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies Inc. On the year, Mr. Barshay advised on more than $300 billion in transactions. "2018 was a year of big deals," he says.

George Boutros

Technology was 2018's busiest sector for deal making.

Mr. Boutros, CEO of Qatalyst Partners, was in the middle of much of the action, including selling CA Technologies to Broadcom Inc. for $19 billion. Qatalyst also sold market-analytics startup Qualtrics International Inc. to SAP SE for $8 billion.

Mr. Boutros is bullish: "The drivers for M&A are there, and I think there will be a lot of activity in software, barring extreme volatility."

Chris Gallea

Mr. Gallea, vice chairman of investment banking atGoldman Sachs Group Inc., hit the ground running when he joined the firm from JPMorgan Chase & Co. in May, helping ink L3's merger with Harris -- the largest-ever defense-industry merger -- just months into his new role. In November, Goldman was named as an adviser on United Technologies Corp.'s giant, three-way breakup. Over the past year, Goldman has hired more than a dozen high-ranking deal makers.

The industrial assignments show the hiring spree is already starting to pay off. Conglomerates are narrowing their focus to one or two fields, a trend that Mr. Gallea predicts will generate more deal activity.

"CEOs are asking themselves 'what are the businesses we should not be in and how do we exit them in a smart way,'" he says.

Gregg Lemkau

Mr. Lemkau, co-head of investment banking at Goldman, put his 26 years of experience at Wall Street's No. 1 merger adviser to use in Dell Technologies Inc.'s $24 billion buyout of shares that track its VMware Inc. cloud operation. Mr. Lemkau played an important role bridging differences between Dell and hedge funds that argued its initial proposal was too stingy. Eventually Dell sweetened the offer, part of a plan to take the PC and data-storage giant public again, and the investors dropped their opposition. (The new Dell shares started trading Friday.)

The year "was phenomenal -- for three quarters," says Mr. Lemkau, who expresses hope that in the new year executives will refocus on strategic priorities and spur a return to increased deal activity. "CEOs feel really good about their fundamental business outlook and growth prospects," he says.

Kurt Simon

Before joining Goldman as a co-chair of global technology, media and telecommunications from JPMorgan in November, Kurt Simon advised Disney on its $71 billion deal to buy a big chunk of 21st Century Fox. The deal, one of the largest in recent years, was contentious and involved a bidding war between Disney and Comcast.

Mr. Simon also advised Sprint Corp. on its sale to T-Mobile

US Inc., which many deal watchers thought would never actually happen. (The deal still requires regulatory approval.)

In 2018, M&A was done "at a feverish pace," Mr. Simon says.

"But if the volatility persists, matching 2018's pace may prove to be a challenge."

INSIDE BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY

he year is ending with huge volatility in tech stocks. The tide of liquidity that has buoyed risky assets across the economy is now ebbing.

TSo why is US venture capital investment on the brink of hitting an all-time high? The disconnect is playing out at the end of a long boom in Silicon Valley. At more than $84bn, the amount of venture money ploughed into tech start-ups this year had already surpassed 2017's total by the end of September, according to Pitchbook and the National Venture Capital Association. Even with some cooling in the final quarter, this year's total is on track to top the record $105bn invested at the peak of the dotcom boom in 2000.

There are obvious differences that weaken the historical comparison. The scale of the opportunity today is far larger than it was two decades ago. Half of all people on the planet are now said to have internet access, compared with only 8 per cent at the turn of the millennium. Tech has broken out of the realm of digital services to bring upheaval to more parts of the "real" economy, from taxis to hotels.

The most successful start-ups have also stayed private for longer than predecessors, so some of the money that would have come from public market investors in previous cycles is being supplied by venture investors, instead. But venture capital is a market that is prone to booms and busts, and there have been some familiar warning signs. "Me-too" investing and "FOMO"   the fear of missing out   are as strong as ever. Artificial intelligence is the latest technology used to justify the argument that a historic opportunity is at hand.

Money has also been pouring in from new investors such as mutual fund groups, sovereign wealth funds and corporate venture capital funds. Spates of such "venture tourism" have been evident at the peaks of past booms. The weight of money has had an inevitable effect. According to Pitchbook, the conditions are ripe for a continuation next year of ever-larger early stage funding rounds and bigger valuation increases for companies raising new funding.

The business models of tech start-ups today look stronger to be sure, the business models of many of today's tech start-ups look much stronger than the dotcoms. But until the tide of money flows out, it is hard to tell how far growth rates have been pumped up by gimmicks such as uneconomic discounts, or the extent to which valuations have risen in anticipation of new markets that will turn out to be smaller or more competitive than promised.

than the dotcoms Venture investing has also long displayed some characteristics that make it a hostile place for newcomers. The returns have been disproportionately skewed to a handful of established firms and the lucky few investors with access to their funds. For venture firms, having a brand name helps: the best entrepreneurs and most promising start-ups are spoilt for choice and tend to pick backers with name recognition, perpetuating the clique.

Long periods of illiquidity can also leave investors starved of returns. The dearth of IPOs may finally be coming to an end, but investors are still waiting to realise most of the promised gains from the unicorn companies valued above $1bn that have risen with the latest boom.

All of these concerns can be   and, in a fevered investment climate, have been   rationalised. According to the optimists, this cycle has seen venture investment finally make the transition from a cottage industry to a more open financing market. The weight of money from nontraditional investors   led by Softbank's vast Vision Fund   has broken open the closed VC network, giving outsiders access to the best deals for the first time. Much bigger venture funds are now the norm, and far more of the cash is flowing into "mega-rounds" to force faster growth in the next generation of supposed industry leaders.

This risks diluting the returns from the asset class as a whole. But for investors who have not had access before, the lower returns may be made up for by the ability to put much larger amounts of money to work.

Investors willing to accept lower returns are also betting on greater liquidity from their investments than has been the case over the past decade, when the most successful start-ups steered clear of the stock market. Half of the ten most valuable US tech unicorns   Uber, Airbnb, Palantir, Lyft and Pinterest   have either filed for an IPO or are reported to be actively considering one this year.

These are all comforting signs for investors who have joined the 2018 venture boom. And there is one more thing to soothe the nerves: given the typical eight-year life of the typical venture fund, it will be a long time before they have to face a reckoning.

How to Stay Creative, and Other Challenges Facing Marketers in 2019; Privacy fights and politics aren't the only potential problems on the agenda

Marketers' year ahead will be shaped by a 12-month countdown to California's version of GDPR and a growing political vortex as the presidential campaign cycle begins again. But those are just two of the issues looming for 2019, industry executives said in email interviews in December.

We Need to Talk About Data

Murmurs that data is hurting creativity are constant these days, but they may grow louder as other trends force the point.

"One of the most pressing issues we are facing as an industry is the death of true creativity," said Andrea Brimmer, chief marketing and public relations officer at Ally Bank. Marketers' scramble to hit key performance indicators means "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-digital-marketing-in-a-data-privacy-world-1529341496", she said, while cost-cutting forces more creative work in-house at brands and out of the hands of agencies.

"We are strangling the very thing that makes marketing great, which is pure creativity," Ms. Brimmer said.

"I worry very much that we are hindering our agency partners and creators and driving them to the wrong outcomes because we fear taking chances anymore, which is what all the best advertising and marketing has ever done push for greatness rather than settle for good," she added. "We need to deeply commit to great agency partners and scheme the business together, remembering that we all want the same outcome, which is amazing work that drives the brand forward."

It is too tempting to fixate on data, agreed Morgan Flatley, chief marketing officer at McDonald's U.S. "Unprecedented channel proliferation and a myriad of ways to sort consumer information are means to an end, but it's sometimes easy to lose sight of that," Ms. Flatley said. "At the heart of our efforts is the aspiration to make consumers feel something, to create a bond between our brand and our guests and that requires what's always been at the heart of all successful marketing programs, creativity and authentic human insight."

Marketers could help themselves by identifying the correct data to follow and figuring out how it can support great creative, said Dino Bernacchi, chief marketing officer for Mazda North American Operations. Using valid performance indicators to uphold accountability won't kill creativity, Mr. Bernacchi said. "But only the right and accurate data can help identify relevancy."

Direct to Disruption

Direct-to-consumer brands such as Casper and Dollar Shave Club famously made their marks on segments such as mattresses and razors, but "https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-company-is-fast-becoming-the-warby-parker-of-scrubs-1539625191". Brands that haven't faced DTC incursions yet almost certainly will.

Responding can be tricky, said David Jones, the former Havas SA chief executive who now leads You & Mr Jones, a tech-centric marketing services holding company. Should an established marketer pre-emptively disrupt its business with a DTC offer before somebody else gets there? The alternative could wind up costing more.

"How do big brands learn from and replicate this, versus buying the successful DTC companies at very high multiples?" Mr. Jones said. CMOs will have to develop talent and technology to match the DTC startups' level of customer service, he said.

That is a lot to ask, suggested Jesse Derris, chief executive at Derris, a brand consultancy with clients such as Warby Parker, Everlane and Harry's. "The most valuable piece of these brands is the direct relationships they build with consumers," Mr. Derris said. "Traditional brands can't replicate those relationships and therefore have a nearly impossible job orienting around consumer need."

"The number of categories that need to evolve is nearly infinite, and many of those categories are dramatically larger than those already feeling the impact," Mr. Derris added. "We are at the beginning of this era, not the end."

Measuring Up

Weakened faith in current digital metrics, scattering TV audiences and relentless demands to justify marketing spending have industry executives hungry for better measurement. Who will deliver it remains unclear. And privacy protections in Europe and soon California are adding new wrinkles.

"Even though most would agree it's important, it often gets left on the back burner or it's done half-assed, making the results unreadable," said Janice Ryan, founder at Sunway Consulting, where she acts as a CMO-at-large for early-stage startups.

"More specifically, it is important to have visibility into the complete funnel of user engagement," Ms. Ryan said. "The days of churning and burning through new users are over, so companies need to find quality users that have a true interest in their product."

Brands should beware metrics that justify what they want to do anyway, said Traci Alford, president and chief executive at Effie Worldwide, whose Effie Awards recognize effective marketing strategies.

"It's becoming easier to find proof points to support our decisions," Ms. Alford said. "But as our data and analytics tools evolve and we introduce more high-tech experiences into our ever more complex consumer journeys, marketers need a more strategic understanding on how to decipher their impact on business growth. This understanding is what will take brands from innovative to innovative and effective."

A selection of writing from FT columnists on the companies and sectors being shaken to their core

In 2018 the pace of innovation has seemed to accelerate, and not just in Silicon Valley s world of big data and technology. Farmers and their distributors are also entering the digital era with agritech. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies and the gig economy are highlighting the need for regulators to adapt to changing markets and practices. And, as our columnists say, even the disrupters cannot afford complacency   they are vulnerable to disruption themselves.

The meaning of Amazon s wage rise  Martin Sandbu

U.S. Holiday Retail Sales Are Strongest in Years, Early Data Show; Sales excluding autos rose 5.1% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 from a year earlier, according to Mastercard

Shoppers delivered the strongest holiday sales increase for U.S. retailers in six years, according to early data.

Total U.S. retail sales, excluding automobiles, rose 5.1% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 from a year earlier, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending with all forms of payment. Overall, U.S. consumers spent over $850 billion this holiday season, according to Mastercard.

The figures suggest a stock-market swoon and partial government shutdown haven't curbed consumer confidence and spending.

"Wall Street is running around like a chicken with its head cut off, while Mr. and Mrs. Main Street are happy with their jobs, enjoying their best wage increases in a decade," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm. A recent drop in gas prices has helped last-minute spending, he said.

Sales have been generally strong throughout the holiday season, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stores-finishing-the-holidays-on-a-high-note-11545566400". Retailers entered the holidays with momentum as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/store-traffic-falls-again-on-black-friday-but-not-all-news-is-bad-1543165988" from a year earlier between the Wednesday before Thanksgiving through Black Friday, one sign of an early buying surge, according to Adobe Analytics.

Buying slowed in early December in part because an unusually early Thanksgiving made it harder for retailers to sustain sales through the entire holiday shopping period, analysts and consultants said. But shoppers picked up the pace ahead of Christmas.

With Christmas Eve falling on a Monday, many retailers geared up to capitalize on a last-minute push from shoppers who were counting on the final weekend to wrap up their gift-buying. Chains including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. extended deadlines to get online orders delivered before Christmas, while Amazon.com Inc. in some cities offered Prime members the option of free same-day delivery on Christmas Eve.

Many retailers also touted the option to buy online and pick up in store through Christmas Eve. Overall, sales in that category increased 47% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 19, according to Adobe.

Mastercard found that sales from online shopping grew 19.1% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 compared with the year-earlier period.

Still, next year presents a challenging environment as buying continues to shift online a trend that is hurting many retailers, including department stores. Sales at department stores fell 1.3% in the period tracked by Mastercard, in part due to store closings. Stores that mainly sell apparel, however, experienced robust sales, growing 7.9% during the same period. Overall, sales from bricks-and-mortar stores rose 3.3%.

"We have seen some things really solidify" amid a strong economy and many retailers making investments to grow online, said Steve Barr, consumer markets leader at consulting firm PwC. But this holiday season shows that "the pace of change to online, especially mobile, is really not easing up," he said.

Some retail clients are cautious about next year, Mr. Barr added.

"While we haven't seen the consumer retreat, I do think there is a heightened risk with volatility in the capital markets and rising interest rates and uncertainty in Washington, D.C.," Mr. Barr said. "Retailers are a bit on edge about what 2019 might be."

The Property Report
Shinola Hotel Sets an Anchor in Detroit --- Entrepreneurs expect $100 million boutique to create a hub in a reinvented city center

Next week, downtown Detroit will get a new boutique hotel -- and more fuel for its economic resurgence.

The $100 million Shinola Hotel will open Jan. 2, featuring dining venues and custom-designed flourishes inspired by the Shinola luxury brand. The 129-room lodging is the latest addition to a resurgent downtown of rapidly filling new and renovated office buildings and apartments.

Detroit has continued to struggle following decades of decline aggravated by the last recession. The city's population is almost 30% below what it was in 2000 and its poverty rate of 37.9% is one of the highest in the country, according to 2017 U.S. Census estimates.

Still, in the years since 2014 when it emerged from its bankruptcy filing, there have been promising signs of economic development.

Major players in the city's rebound include the two entrepreneurs behind the Shinola, Dan Gilbert, chairman of Quicken Loans Inc. and founder of development firm Bedrock, and Tom Kartsotis, founder of luxury watchmaker Shinola.

The Shinola complex, combining historic and new buildings, is expected to create a hub in a reinvented city center, real-estate analysts said.

Messrs. Gilbert and Kartsotis believe there will be strong demand for a boutique hotel with a cool aesthetic.

"You have college interns, athletes, people coming from all over the world to see our city," Mr. Gilbert said. Where these visitors stay "is going to have a subconscious impact on how they view our city."

The two entrepreneurs began to discuss plans for the hotel about four years ago -- about the same time the city exited bankruptcy.

The hotel at 1400 Woodward Ave. sits near two mixed-use projects with soaring towers planned by Bedrock, the same developer for the hotel. Other developments in the surrounding area also are in the works.

"It isn't just that they have cool rooms, but they have brought restaurants and other retail with them," said Spencer Levy, Americas head of research at real-estate services firm CBRE Group Inc.

Detroit's economy has become more diversified and resilient with the growth of other sectors such as technology and finance, analysts said. Since 2012, $9.2 billion worth of office, retail, residential and hotel projects have been completed or announced for greater downtown Detroit, real-estate services firm JLL said.

Quicken Loans and its family of companies now employ over 17,500 in the area. Shinola, the maker of luxury watches, leather goods and now bicycles, started in Detroit with a factory in 2012 and now has 30 stores world-wide and employs 650 people.

Other companies such as LinkedIn Corp. have announced expansions and relocations to the central business district. And this year, Ford Motor Co. began the first phase of a $740 million makeover of Central Michigan Station just outside of the downtown area where it will bring about 2,500 jobs.

The overall office vacancy rate in the Detroit metropolitan area is 20.8%. But the demand for office space has been focused in the new and renovated buildings, said Harrison West, senior research analyst at JLL.

Excluding vacant space at the older Renaissance Center, the vacancy rate for top-tier office space in the central business district was 1.9% in the third quarter, according to JLL.

Bedrock has driven a large portion of new development in Detroit. The firm, which has already invested billions in downtown Detroit, recently unveiled plans for four projects in the area totaling $2.1 billion in investment.

Bedrock's $900 million Hudson's Site project adjacent to the Shinola Hotel is under construction. It will include office, residential and hotel space, much of it in a 912-foot skyscraper, expected to be Detroit's tallest.

Bedrock also has broken ground on its $830 million Monroe Blocks development, whichwill bring a 35-story office tower in addition to apartments and restaurants.

The surge of businesses downtown has helped boost the city's hotel sector. The occupancy rate this year through November is 68.8%, up from 62.5% in 2012 for the same period, with the average daily rate rising 32% to $105.21, according to analytics firm STR.

At the Shinola Hotel, each suite will have a Shinola Runwell turntable and a collection of vinyl records. Custom-designed bathroom fixtures were inspired by the casebacks of Shinola watches. Room rates start at $195 a night.

"It fits the aesthetic of Detroit," Mr. Kartsotis said. "It is Detroit in its roots but it's a contemporary brand talking about what Detroit is today."

Stores Finishing the Holidays on a High Note; Online sales continue to drive the biggest gains and UPS, FedEx keep pace

U.S. retailers wrapped up one of the strongest holiday seasons in years, with shoppers crowding stores for last-minute Christmas gifts and delivery companies so far able to keep up with the surge in online orders.

Stores have met the lofty sales expectations set by analysts and industry groups, according to early data, showing that many chains continue to reap the benefits of a strong U.S. economy and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-confidence-surged-in-october-to-18-year-high-1540909611", as well as company investments to boost their online business and clean up stores.

Total U.S. retail sales, excluding automobiles, rose 5.2% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 19 compared with last year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending with all forms of payment.

As in recent years, online sales continued to grow faster than sales overall, rising 18.3% during that time and accounting for 13% of total sales, the highest percentage ever recorded by Mastercard. In-store sales grew 4.3% during the same period. Another tracking firm, Adobe Analytics, found that a record $110.6 billion was spent online during the same period measured by Mastercard, a 17.8% increase compared with last year.

The delivery backbone of the online economy has held up so far during the holiday season, with United Parcel Service Inc. averting hiccups that plagued it last year as new automated processing facilities increased the number of packages it can handle.

UPS delivered 98.3% of packages on time through the four weeks since Thanksgiving, up from 94.1% last year when the carrier struggled with too many parcels at times, according to ShipMatrix Inc., a software provider that analyzes shipping data.

A UPS spokesman said the extra capacity and technology that can reroute packages around problem spots have resulted in service levels that are similar to those during a nonpeak season.

On-time performance for FedEx Corp. and the U.S. Postal Service came in at 96.9% and 98%, respectively, about the same as last year, according to ShipMatrix.

On Saturday, many shoppers still expected more packages to be delivered, but also headed to stores for last-minute gifts. "My husband, he didn't do his shopping so I'm out shopping for him," said Liz Roberts, a 37-year-old nurse who lives in Chelsea, Mich., shopping at a Best Buy store near her home. "We also have some last online orders coming Christmas Eve," she said. "So far everything has arrived on time."

Although "https://www.wsj.com/articles/store-traffic-falls-again-on-black-friday-but-not-all-news-is-bad-1543165988"fell during the "https://graphics.wsj.com/glider/blackfriday-f3a288ad-6b8a-42c5-ada8-ea893a0e506b", overall retail sales rose, mainly because of a surge in online shopping, which jumped 26% from a year earlier, according to Adobe.

Retailers had the calendar working against them. With Thanksgiving falling especially early, stores had a harder time maintaining momentum beyond the November holiday as buying slowed in the first part of December, analysts and consultants said.

"This year, we clearly saw a dramatic shift this holiday in both cadence and consumer response," as retailers offered big deals over Thanksgiving, then sales fell, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry adviser at the NPD Group.

But spending has picked up, and so far declines in the stock market and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-day-one-of-shutdown-talks-set-to-resume-over-border-wall-funding-11545496150"of the U.S. government largely haven't caused shoppers to pull back, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm. Lower gas prices in recent weeks may help spur spending this week, he said.

"In terms of accounting, it all counts for the fourth quarter," the period when retailers make up a significant percentage of sales, Mr. Johnson said.

Many retailers continued to rely on promotions throughout the season to drive sales, eating into margins, said Steve Barr, leader of the retail and consumer sector at consulting firm PwC. With a strong economy, "I think many hoped to head into the holiday season looking to pull back on promotions," Mr. Barr said. "They didn't."

Some chains have extended deadlines for delivering online orders by Christmas to maximize sales.

Many retailers with stores also touted a buy-online, pick-up-in-store option available through Christmas Eve to fulfill last-minute gift needs. Overall, sales in that category grew 47% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 19, according to Adobe.

At a Walmart store in Saline, Mich., Roderick Tucker bought presents on Saturday for his family, including a Family Feud game and Zoomer Playful Pup, but also planned to pick up online orders later that day at Target and Kohl's.

"I'm a last-minute shopper," said Mr. Tucker, who works as an operations manager at a warehouse. "I wish I would have gone online and purchased everything in time, but every year I wait too long."

Christmas Eve falls on Monday this year, creating one more crucial test for delivery companies that in some cases don't deliver on Sunday.

UPS doesn't deliver most packages on Sunday, but over the weekend was sorting and flying Christmas shipments for Monday delivery. The Postal Service was expanding its Sunday delivery operations in some locations with high package volumes and has said it expected to deliver eight million packages each Sunday this holiday season.

One tool that FedEx and UPS have pushed more this season to ease the burden is diverting deliveries to stores. Doing so reduces costs because drivers can drop off multiple packages during one stop and avoid having to visit individual homes.

Neither carrier is in the clear. Citi Research transportation analyst Christian Wetherbee said FedEx and UPS usually have the weakest performance during the final week before Christmas. "We see no reason for that to change this year, given the expected last-minute rush," he said.

Sharp reversals in trends have hurt performance of some big computer-driven hedge funds

Investors have been piling into computer-driven hedge funds in recent years, betting that advances in areas such as artificial intelligence and big data will help quants beat human traders. For many, 2018 has severely tested their resolve.

A year in which quant funds struggled to exploit any of their favourite patterns in markets saw many chalk up their biggest losses in years, ranking them among the hedge fund industry's worst performers.

"It was certainly a challenging year, there's no hiding from that," said Anthony Lawler, co-head of GAM Systematic, part of the trou

A year in which quant funds struggled to exploit any of their favourite patterns in markets saw many chalk up their biggest losses in years, ranking them among the hedge fund industry's worst performers.

"It was certainly a challenging bled Swiss asset manager GAM. He attributed many of this year's problems to sharp reversals in the market in February and again in the autumn.

There has been no shortage of interest in quant investing in recent years. Investors have put a net $41.8bn into quant funds since the start of 2015, according to data group HFR, even as they pulled a net $27.6bn from hedge funds as a whole.

A quant investing conference held on the top floor of Goldman Sachs' London offices on Fleet Street in September attracted about 450 people and was standing room only.

Investors have been attracted by developments in areas such as machine learning and big data   and the bet that emotionless machines can outperform human traders who have often struggled in markets dominated by central bank stimulus. Big institutional investors such as pension funds that now dominate hedge funds' client lists increasingly like quants that can demonstrate a repeatable process.

But while funds have been rapidly developing their strategies and computing power, at their heart many funds still rely on a few basic market factors working in order to perform.

These include asset prices moving in long-running trends, cheap stocks performing better than expensive ones, stocks with stronger finances outperforming weaker ones, and the ability to borrow cheaply and invest in higheryielding assets. When these do not work, quants can suffer.

This year proved so hard for quants because many of these factors failed to work for a sufficient period of time.

For instance, a strong upward trend in markets in January that many quants enjoyed was followed by February's sharp pullback that caused large losses.

Sectors such as technology with fast earnings growth proved to be a crowded trade and quants struggled to capitalise on rapid changes in investor interest between sectors. Betting on cheap stocks has largely proved an underperforming trade for investors across the board for some time now.

"Honestly, nothing's working," said an executive at one quant hedge fund.

Mr Lawler said betting on rising volatility was "pretty much the only thing that worked this year" but was an expensive strategy to run.

Performance numbers largely make for sorry reading. GAM's Cantab Aristarchus fund is down 25.9 per cent this year, having gained 31 per cent last year as one of the world's best-performing hedge funds, said a person who had seen the numbers.

Aspect Capital's Diversified fund has lost 15.2 per cent. Ken Tropin's Graham Global Investment fund has lost 9.2 per cent in one share class and 13.6 per cent in a higher volatility one, according to numbers sent to investors.

Leda Braga's Systematica Bluetrend fund is down 12.8 per cent and Parisbased CFM's ISDiversified fund has lost 7.8 per cent. Amplitude Capital's Dynamic Strategy has lost 20.1 per cent, although the firm said it runs other portfolios that performed better.

WorldQuant, whose fund tracks the market while trying to beat it, has underperformed the market by nearly 1 per cent after a bad October, said a person who had seen the numbers. Funds have been hit by "choppy markets" driven by risk relating to trade tariffs and other geopolitical events, said Irene Perdomo, co-founder of Devet Capital, which is up 1 per cent this year.

The fund has made money trading calendar spreads   bets on rising and falling prices on the same asset but over different periods   in gas oil.

Robert Duggan, partner at New Yorkbased SkyBridge Capital, which runs $9.4bn and invests in hedge funds, has been largely avoiding computer-driven trend-following hedge funds since shortly after the financial crisis.

Rather than acting as a diversifier, such funds have been "very long equities at a point in the cycle where we didn't feel it was prudent to add directional equity risk to our portfolios". Not everyone has performed badly. One standout was Gresham Investment Management's Quant Acar fund, which is up 28.1 per cent.

Paris-based La Francaise's Vision Premia Opportunities fund is up 3.4 per cent this year. An $800m fund run by Graham Capital has gained 14 per cent.

Osman Ali, portfolio manager in Goldman Sachs Asset Management's quant team, said funds that used socalled alternative data sets   which range from satellite imagery to credit card sales data   performed better than those using financial market data.

Quant investors now face a test of character. Quants can this year hide to some extent behind the wider failings of other hedge funds. But their clients may not be so forgiving if performance does not pick up in 2019.

Does China s bet on big data  for credit scoring work?

Ant Financial  s Sesame Credit system for rating individuals struggles to prove itself

When Ant Financial launched its credit scoring system, Sesame Credit, in January 2015, it said the data-driven product would  make credit more available to millions of consumers across China , giving individuals access to everything from mortgages to mobile phone contracts to car loans.

But nearly four years later, Ant Financial , which is an affiliate of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, has never used Sesame Credit for lending decisions, and critics are increasingly questioning whether the tool can be used to accurately assess individual behaviour.

Sesame, which is an opt-in feature of the Alipay mobile payments app, draws upon the biggest pool of non-traditional ratings data in the world. It synthesises details from hundreds of sources   ranging from purchases on Alibaba s Taobao marketplace to subway fares   into a single trustworthiness number for each user, called a  Sesame score .

But one Ant Financial employee conceded there was a difference between  big data  and  strong data , with big data not always providing the most relevant information for predicting behaviour, and analysts say the best predictor of whether someone will default on a loan in future is often their previous loan repayment history, rather than their likelihood of returning a rental car.

 Banking and transaction data remain fundamental to predictive credit scoring,  said James Lloyd, Asia fintech analyst at Ernst & Young.

Martin Chorzempa , a fellow at the Peterson Institute of Economics think-tank, agreed, saying trustworthiness is  very context specific .

 Someone evading taxes might always pay back loans, someone who breaks traffic rules might not break other rules,  he said.  So I don t think there is a general concept of trustworthiness that is robust. 

How it works 1: Sesame s score and  seeds 

1. Yuan s Sesame score is 692, or  excellent . Scores are graded on a scale of 350 to 950.

2. Yuan has one  Sesame seed    obtained by using an Alipay credit service   and eight tasks to complete before earning a reward.

3. Yuan s transaction history shows that she satisfied contracts with public transportation providers and Ofo, the ride-hailing app, this year.

Critics have also questioned how Sesame crunches thousands of data points into a single score, saying there needs to be a strong correlation between hundreds of different behaviours   from trashing a hotel room to stealing a mobile charger   in order for the metric to be meaningful.

 For one score to resolve everything, this is too big a burden,  said Liu Xinhai, a researcher at Peking University s Centre of Financial Intelligence Research.

 Adjusting our focus 

From 2015 to 2017, Sesame offered credit ratings services for other fintech companies, including Qudian, one of China s biggest online lenders.

But their ambitions were cut short last year when the Chinese government cracked down on high-interest lenders, clearing out many of their clients. Then, earlier this year, China s central bank stopped allowing independent companies to provide credit ratings, and required all credit ratings to be given by a new public body called Baihang   effectively ending Sesame s credit ratings business altogether.

 We re adjusting our focus,  said Zhao Xing, former chief data scientist of Sesame Credit who is now Alipay s senior algorithm expert.

Sesame s business now relies on tie-ups with hundreds of other companies. When a company joins the Sesame platform, it gives Sesame some of its user data, which helps inform Sesame scores. In return, Sesame helps the companies decide how likely different users are to violate their contracts.

The companies often give perks to users with a high Sesame score, such as deposit-free rentals for umbrellas, bicycles or even apartments. Ant Financial will regularly promote the discounts on the Alipay mobile payments app.

But Shazeda Ahmed, a PhD candidate studying the company at the University of California Berkeley , said that in many cases, people were unaware that Sesame scores could not be used to take out loans   raising questions about whether Sesame Credit was  manipulating people into giving up data for a use that not related to scoring .

 When users talk about Sesame on social media it s almost always about how to improve their scores, with loans being one big attraction,  she said.

Perks for customers with high Sesame scores

1. Users with high Sesame scores can rent digital equipment without a deposit from retailers such as zFrontier, which provides e-sports equipment.

2. Users with high Sesame scores can also use travel services without a deposit, including car rentals from Avis and others.

Analysts have compared the platform to a glorified loyalty card, rewarding users for buying Alibaba s and its partners  products, but not predicting behaviour.

 Sesame Credit should not be seen as a credit score,  said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.  It seems to be based on lots of variables that are more importantly indicators of your activity on Alibaba s different platforms, and could be argued are not actually the most important factors in determining creditworthiness. 

But Ant Financial has defended the system, with Mr Xing insisting that by monitoring users, Sesame Credit incentivises people to be more reliable.

 Building a trustworthy society 

Sesame Credit has frequently been linked with the Chinese government s ambitions for a  social credit  system, using big data to evaluate citizens  trustworthiness. But while the two are often conflated   Sesame used to advertise itself as  building a trustworthy society , and is regularly praised by state media for building the foundations of a social credit system   they are formally separate schemes.

Nevertheless, Sesame is one of several tech companies sharing data with the National Development and Reform Commission , the  central planner  responsible for the social credit system, which is currently being tested as a pilot program in dozens of localities.

The local government of Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, has also said that since last year, it has been preparing a points system called  Osmanthus points  with Ant Financial . A source close to Ant has denied any involvement in the scheme.

As with other pilots, the scheme in Suzhou is likely to reward citizens for behaviour deemed  positive . Like Sesame, the scheme will draw on many dimensions of data to create scores. However, unlike Sesame, it will produce four numbers: a basic score, plus one for  abilities , one for  property , and one for  moral character .

But Dai Xin, professor of law at Ocean University of China , warned that such schemes, like Sesame, were not likely to predict individuals  future behaviour.

 As with the Sesame Credit scores, it s difficult to design possible social credit scores that have predictive ability across different contexts,  he said.  Will a plagiarising student also commit fraud? Will a company that fails to pay a debt also renege on a building contract? It all requires empirical testing, and we haven t yet seen this.

Bitcoin miners seek to crack survival code

Financials. Technology Cryptocurrency plunge leaves ventures struggling to boost efficiency and stay in business

Ambitious plans for Britain's biggest bitcoin mine have come to an abrupt halt. Bladetech, a team of entrepreneurs who have worked on specialist IT projects for the likes of Nato and BAE Systems, announced in March that they were building an industrial facility for the creation of the then-pricey digital currency.

But the start-up says the proposals have now been put "on hold" due to "turmoil in crypto markets". They are not alone. Numerous commercial bitcoin mining outfits, as well as thousands of individual "hobby" miners, have shut up shop after falling cryptocurrency prices left them nursing losses.

Some experts estimate the average cost of mining one bitcoin   the "break even point"   at $5,000, including overheads and depreciation costs. But the digital currency is trading at about $3,200, more than 80 per cent lower than this time last year, with predictions that the slide will only continue.

"We're seeing a shake-out," said Aron van Ammers, chief technical officer and founding partner of Outlier Ventures, a crypto-focused venture capital fund. "For many miners, the current bitcoin price is below cost."

Ben Sebley, head of brokerage at NKB Group, a UK investment bank focused on cryptocurrencies, said miners "are struggling so bad. They are hating life."

Miners use computing power to approve transactions in a particular cryptocurrency and add them to a blockchain, a digital ledger of activity.

The computer systems compete to solve complex mathematical problems, testing equations as part of authenticating the newest data in the network. Whoever cracks the code authorises the transaction   and obtains some newly minted cryptocurrency as a reward.

Running these systems requires special hardware and huge amounts of electricity, much like a data centre. Many commercial crypto mining operations have been set up in countries such as China, Iceland, Russia and Kazakhstan, where energy is cheap and low temperatures act as a natural cooling system for rows of whirring equipment.

Once thought to be the domain of fringe start-ups or tech geeks in their bedrooms, the bitcoin mining market exploded late last year as the price of cryptocurrency skyrocketed, and entrepreneurs sought juicy profit margins. The wider infrastructure that supports miners also expanded rapidly. By the middle of this year, three manufacturers of mining hardware based in China   Ebang, Canaan and Bitmain   announced plans to list in Hong Kong, the latter with a multibillion-dollar valuation. Meanwhile, incumbent chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices in the US made initial forays into the sector.

"The profitability was incredible," said Patrick Brogan, a Texas-based crypto enthusiast who spent more than $40,000 on equipment late last year to set up his own home mining system. But the bear market is now taking a toll.

The bitcoin hash rate   a measure of how much power miners are using   has dropped more than 40 per cent since its peak in August. This suggests that about 1.5m bitcoin mining rigs have been switched off since September, according to Fundstrat, a market researcher.

Mr Brogan is among those who closed down within months of getting started. The entire exercise   which involved rewiring his garage with copper, and run-ins with the police who were suspicious about the loud noise and sharp rise in electricity use at his DIY facility   was lossmaking, he said.

"But I learnt a lot," he added. It is not just the smallest players who are hurting. US mining company Gigawatt filed for bankruptcy in November. Ebang, Canaan and Bitmain have all postponed their initial public offerings. Nvidia shut its crypto equipment arm.

"The miners who started early enough that they are well capitalised are [OK]," said Alex Kern, analyst at Fundstrat. "[But those] who started mining more recently might not have the rainy day fund to weather the depression that we have now."

Industry watchers say crypto miners' future survival depends partly on their ability to negotiate favourable electricity deals and acquire the most efficient equipment   though Mr van Ammers warned an advantage in hardware is "always shortlived because of the rapid development".

"You need local connections and political connections to give you security," said Joseph Chin, chief executive of CoinGeek Mining and Hardware, a mini equipment seller that also runs a "mining pool" collective that shares processing power over a network and then splits any profits.

The regulatory risks are significant: the Chinese government cracked down on mining earlier this year following concerns of excessive electricity consumption and financial risk.

Some bigger players are diversifying in search of fresh sources of revenue. Bitfury, which manufactures mining equipment and software, raised $80m last month in a bid to expand its "existing areas of focus" into technologies such as artificial intelligence. The chief executive of Bitmain, Jihan Wu, has also outlined plans to look at AI.

Some observers nevertheless argue there are reasons to be hopeful. Miners not only drive the creation of bitcoin, but they are also among the biggest bitcoin sellers. According to Mr Kern at Fundstrat, this means that if they stop selling when prices fall, the price could be cushioned   suggesting there is a natural price floor. The mining process also has an inbuilt mechanism which means that as competition grows, it becomes more difficult to mine bitcoin. The inverse is also true, meaning those who ride out tough times can then potentially enjoy more profitable periods. "With price declines, the lowest cost producers can maintain [business] due to the difficulty adjustment mechanism," said BitMex, a crypto trading platform and researcher.

"Whether that plays out as designed or not is difficult to say but it has seemed to work during previous price declines."

The market is also maturing. Above all, developers are exploring new ways to mine cryptocurrencies that are more cost efficient and require less energy, as concerns grow over the environmental impact of the current process.

"A lot of implementations of these ideas to date have been flawed, often deeply," said Preston Byrne, a partner at Byrne & Storm. "But I expect someone is going to crack the nut of an effective replacement for [the current process] in due course."

Bit players Trio of makers shelves IPO plans Three crypto mining manufacturers   Canaan, Ebang and Bitmain   have pushed back plans to list on the public markets, as the price of bitcoin plummets and trade tariffs increase the cost of equipment.

Under Hong Kong listing rules, initial public offering filings lapse six months after applications are filed.

Canaan's application lapsed last month, while Ebang, which filed on June 21, is due to see its application expire soon.

Meanwhile, Bitmain, which filed its IPO prospectus in late September, spooked investors with its significant cryptocurrency exposure and apparent discrepancies in published profit numbers.

The profits numbers shared with private investors were far bigger than those that appeared in the public IPO filings, and critics raised questions about the $18bn valuation targeted in pre-listing investor documents.

Bitmain is now due to reveal its third-quarter earnings, which analysts expect to bear all the scars of falling bitcoin prices and rising equipment costs. Louise Lucas in Beijing

Global Investors Scramble for Slices of Food-Delivery Startups in India, Korea; Naspers leads a $1 billion investment in Swiggy as Hillhouse, Sequoia and others prepare to invest in Woowa Brothers at a $2.7 billion valuation

Interest in global food-delivery startups in Asia is heating up, with two significant investments in India and South Korea announced on Thursday.

South Africa technology investor Naspers Ltd. is leading a $1 billion investment in India's biggest food-delivery startup, while investors including Asian private-equity firm Hillhouse Capital Group and U.S. venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital are betting on the biggest such company in South Korea.

Swiggy, based in the Indian city of Bangalore, said Thursday that joining Naspers in the round would be existing investors such as global growth-equity firm DST Global, Beijing-based internet firm Meituan Dianping and hedge-fund firm Coatue Management. Among the new investors in Swiggy are China's Tencent Holdings Ltd., which operates China's dominant WeChat social network. Naspers said it was contributing $660 million.

"Indian online consumers will be a significant driver of online growth in the world," Naspers said.

Swiggy, which was founded four years ago, didn't disclose the valuation at which it raised the funds. The company makes a popular smartphone app that allows users to order food from various restaurants. It operates in more than 50 cities and has partnered with some 50,000 restaurants.

Orders are typically dispatched by a fleet of some 120,000 delivery agents, many of whom use motorbikes to navigate clogged Indian city streets faster than cars. Swiggy will use the new money to hire talent and invest in technology, Naspers said.

Seoul-based Woowa Brothers Corp. raised $320 million from Hillhouse, Sequoia and Singapore sovereign wealth-fund GIC Pte. Ltd. at a valuation of about $2.7 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter Thursday.

Hillhouse had previously invested in Woowa more than two years ago.

Woowa, founded in 2010, operates "Baedal Minjok," which means "delivery nation," and is South Korea's No. 1 food-delivery app. The new capital will fund expansion into new markets like Vietnam and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-lunch-delivery-looks-like-a-giant-roomba-1542985201", according to a person familiar with the matter.

Including the new investment, Woowa has raised more than 500 billion won, or roughly $450 million.

Delivery startups of various stripes have increasingly attracted the attention of marquee investors, even though many have yet to turn a profit.

In November, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/zume-a-food-robotics-and-logistics-startup-cooks-up-2-25-billion-valuation-in-softbank-deal-1541099560", representing a valuation of roughly $2.25 billion. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/doordash-more-than-doubles-valuation-to-4-billion-1534453201", when Coatue Management LLC and DST Global invested $250 million in the San Francisco-based food-delivery startup.

China's Meituan Dianping, backed by social-media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., went public in September in Hong Kong. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/offering-discounts-and-delivery-meituan-wants-to-become-chinas-next-internet-giant-1529578801", has a market value of about $31.5 billion.

South Korea's Woowa, like other similar startups, has broadened its ambitions. It created a service that picks up orders from popular restaurants or cafes that previously didn't have delivery. Woowa has boosted investments in artificial intelligence.

Its Baedal Minjok food-delivery app, which currently operates only in South Korea, has seen orders quadruple from 5 million a month in early 2015 to more than 20 million by July of this year. The number of active monthly users more than doubled during the period from 3 million to 8 million. The company's profit margin is in the mid-teens, according to the person familiar with the matter.

Largest number of investment rounds in Europe were in the UK despite Brexit concerns

European tech start-ups rivalled US counterparts in the total value of initial public offerings and sales to corporate buyers this year after high-profile listings and deals led to record levels of exits.

High-profile listings from Swedish streaming service Spotify, London-based luxury fashion website Farfetch, peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle and Dutch payments company Adyen, along with the acquisition of companies including British property website Zoopla, combined to push European exits   excluding Israel   to $106bn, compared with $136bn in the US, according to data from Dealroom.

The data, which Dealroom founder Yoram Wijngaarde called  remarkable  comes as venture capital investors ploughed money into start-ups.  Investment has also grown four times in the last few years so it s a kind of natural evolution of what s been built in the last few years,  he said.

Exits from UK start-ups more than tripled to $39.9bn in 2018, this compared with $14.2bn from Italy, France and Germany combined. The data excludes biotech start-ups, which typically have higher valuations. Spotify s initial public offering and Paypal s $2.2bn acquisition of rival iZettle boosted the value of exits for Sweden, which came in at $34bn.

The UK also came close to matching last year s record for venture capital investments in start-ups, which attracted $7.9bn. The figure included deals to December 18 and was annualised to the end of the year.

Despite concerns about the impact of Brexit on the tech sector, the UK had the largest number of investment rounds at 769 compared with 563 in France and 520 in Germany.

Jeremy Wright, UK culture secretary, said the tech sector should benefit after Brexit from immigration proposals focused on attracting higher-skilled workers.

The UK government s newly-published immigration white paper proposes an end to the current 20,700 cap on high-skilled  Tier 2  migrants. He said:  Despite Brexit, people are still confident in the UK tech sector,  he said.  I hear a lot about their ability to hire EU workers. 

He added that he  fervently hoped  to  get the deal on the table  so that data could continue to flow between the UK and EU. He said he had begun to talk to businesses about drawing up so-called  standard contractual clauses  to transfer data in and out of the EU in event of a  no deal  Brexit, with the UK data protection watchdog set to publish guidance on the contracts before Christmas.  Data flows must continue. 

Wendy Tan White, a member of the UK s Digital Economy Council and trustee at the Alan Turing Institute, said the UK had a lead in deep tech and artificial intelligence:  The spread on capital invested this year was more evenly distributed than 2017 between different stages. 

However, some venture capital investors cautioned that the exit statistics had been boosted by a coincidence of deals and listings, and that flotations do not always translate into success on public markets.

 The ability of public markets to support tech companies is far better in the [US] than in Europe,  said Richard Anton, partner at Oxx.  I m very optimistic about European tech, we have extraordinary businesses but I think that 2018 was a particularly strong year and probably an outlier. 

 Year-on-year figures can be very heavily skewed by a couple of large funds,  added Suzanne Ashman, a partner at London-based venture capital firm LocalGlobe.  But it really doesn t worry me. Even with some pretty significant exits throughout Europe, the UK has still managed to maintain its lead.

Cyber Daily: Companies Outmatched and Outmanned by Nation-States

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. China, Russia and other nations aggressively target U.S. companies in what amounts to -- but often isn't called -- cyber warfare. Corporate networks are a critical field of battle and chief information security officers and business leaders want help from the federal government.

It's unclear, however, what that help can or should look like, as we report today. U.S. Cyber Command has begun sharing at least samples of active malware threats with security researchers. This gives companies insights into hackers' behavior. But more in-depth information shared faster and on a larger scale would be more useful to more companies, observers say. Neither the government nor the corporate world has that figured out.

Feeling Overmatched, Firms Seek Government Help Fighting Nation-State Cyberattacks

By Adam Janofsky and Catherine Stupp

Chinese hackers increasingly are targeting a wide range of U.S. companies, including military contractors, aviation firms and managed service providers but American corporate cyber defenses are no match against nation-state attacks, experts say.

Some companies are asking for government help, seeking more complete information about emerging cyberattacks and other support. Aggressive moves from China imperil U.S. intellectual property, especially at small firms working on artificial intelligence, quantum computing and other emerging technologies. Large firms are concerned about being caught in sustained hacking campaigns by nation-states.

Top officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security last week warned the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Chinese government is spying on and hacking into American firms to steal trade secrets to develop its own economy, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Bill Priestap, the FBI's top counterintelligence official, called China's campaign "the most severe counterintelligence threat facing our country today."

Targets of such hacking efforts include U.S. Navy contractors that develop advanced military technology and managed service providers that have access to the networks and data of many large firms. Additionally, government officials are increasingly confident that Chinese hackers were responsible for a breach recently disclosed by Marriott International Inc. that may have exposed the personal information of up to 500 million customers, The Wall Street Journal reported.

FedEx Corp. is attempting to form a consortium to appeal for more government support in addressing cyber threats from well-organized groups, regardless of country of origin, according to several industry sources involved in the initiative. Rich Baich, chief information security officer at Wells Fargo & Co., said he was approached about joining the group.

Gene Sun, chief information security officer at FedEx, said at a conference in New York this summer that governments should "play a critical--even a central--function in the cyber defense" against nation-state cyber attackers.

FedEx declined to comment on the initiative. The company paid damages and expenses of $400 million after it was hit by last year's NotPetya attack, the company reported. The U.S., U.K. and other countries later said that Russia was behind the attack.

"Whether it's the FedEx consortium or other ones, the real question is,  What are they going to do different compared to the other groups that are currently doing this?' Because there's quite a few," Mr. Baich said. Wells Fargo belongs to the National Cybersecurity Alliance and Mr. Baich was sworn in last week as a member of President Trump's National Infrastructure Advisory Council.

Wells Fargo likely won't join FedEx's group, Mr. Baich said.

The alleged activity from China comes amid the fraying of a 2015 agreement with the U.S. calling for both countries to refrain from supporting or directing cyberattacks that steal corporate records for economic gain, said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

He warned that small firms are ill equipped to handle such nation-state threat. For startups, he said, "security isn't on top of their list. They need better briefings and more directed intelligence on the U.S. side about what hackers are going after."

Government agencies can help companies defend themselves against Chinese state-sponsored cyber attackers through indictments and threat-intelligence sharing, said Ron Cheng, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers LLP and a Department of Justice legal adviser at the U.S. embassy in Beijing from 2007 to 2009.

Many firms may decide to work with the government to take advantage of tools and resources that private companies typically can't access, he said. For example, if the Department of Justice opens an investigation, it can subpoena witnesses to testify and can compel internet service providers to provide emails and other evidence.

Such information is useful to corporate security executives but only if relayed quickly and completely, said Tom Hegel, director of threat research at cybersecurity firm ProtectWise Inc.

U.S. Cyber Command, the Defense Department agency responsible for conducting cyber operations, began sharing samples of active malware threats with security researchers last month. Companies investigating cyberattacks they have suffered can use those samples to understand hackers' patterns and try to identify suspects.

"It's very small quantities right now but what they're sharing are things nobody has seen before besides them," Mr. Hegel said.

More specific information shared faster would be more useful, Mr. Segal said. Communication with large financial services firms is better than with other sectors. Some industries, such as logistics, aren't designated critical infrastructure and receive less information, he said.

The Department of Defense's "forward defense" strategy allows the U.S. to disrupt burgeoning attacks before they get to the networks of American companies. The policy could be used to justify federal officials helping large U.S. corporations fight cybersecurity aggression from other countries, he said.

Companies, however, might not welcome government officials onto their corporate networks, as it opens up concerns about data privacy, Mr. Segal said.

Huawei Slams Efforts to Block It From 5G Rollout

A top executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co. fired back at efforts to block the company's sale of 5G products and said its equipment is safe, challenging foreign officials to back up claims that it poses a cybersecurity threat.

Risk? What risk? Ken Hu, one of Huawei's four deputy chairmen, told reporters Tuesday that no evidence has been produced to support the claim that the company's products are a security risk, WSJ reports. Countries that try to block Huawei from their markets will only harm themselves and raise the cost for consumers, Mr. Hu said.

$2B cyber effort: The company also said it plans to spend $2 billion in the next five years on cybersecurity staffing and facilities improvements, in part to assuage worries about the safety of its products, Reuters reports. Huawei expects revenue to exceed $100 billion this year, which is up 8.7% from last year.

Good day. A campaign by the venture-capital industry lobby seeks to give firms wider leeway in what they can invest in, from public companies to cryptocurrencies.

In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Venture Capital Association called on regulators to broaden what are allowed as "qualifying investments" by venture firms, which aren't required to be registered investment advisers. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has the story.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Will biotech bulls ride again? After a sizzling year for biotech initial public offerings investors are tempering expectations for 2019 in the wake of the recent stock market slide. Venture capitalists still see good prospects for IPOs because of the success the field has enjoyed recently. But after a giant year for new offerings, investors expect some pullback in 2019, especially with the recent market tumble that has seen the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fall about 15% since early October. Biotech's run of IPOs came in a year in which drug startups raised $11.39 billion in venture capital through Sept. 30, beating the previous full-year peak of $11.14 billion in 2017, according to VentureSource. Investor confidence has grown as drugmakers have won regulatory approvals for novel treatments in areas such as gene therapy and immuno-oncology. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has the scoop.

Rocket booster: Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, is set to raise $500 million at a $30.5 billion valuation, in a bid to help get its internet-service business off the ground, according to people familiar with the fundraising. The Hawthorne, Calif., company is raising the capital from existing shareholders and new investor Baillie Gifford & Co., one of the people said. The Scottish money-management firm is one of the largest investors in another Musk-led company, Tesla Inc., with about a 7.6% stake, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The WSJ's Rolfe Winkler, Andy Pasztor and Rob Copeland have the scoop.

Roof's Take: Have VCs Gone Overboard With the  Partner' Title?

By Katie Roof

Will the real partner please stand up?

Once a title meant to signify ownership in a venture firm, these days being a "partner" can mean a range of things. At some firms, investment professionals can work their way up from associate to principal and then partner. At others, people can start as a "partner."

Equal titles are largely issued to empower up-and-coming investors. Some in the industry see this is as an effective strategy for managing the firm, but others say it can lead to confusion.

"Unless they're all equal partners equity-wise, it just dilutes the meaning of the word," said Vijay Pandurangan, an angel investor who has been both a founder and previously an entrepreneur in residence at Benchmark Capital. "There will be partners and  real' partners."

More in Roof's Take.

In May, Tradeshift raised a $250 million Series E round led Goldman Sachs and PSP Investments. In connection with the deal, Babelway's cloud integration technology will be offered as Tradeshift Link.

Xenon Ventures, which buys tech startups or orphaned products that need an exit and revamps them for sale, completed its acquisition of cloud data integration provider Xplenty Ltd.

Musk's SpaceX Lines Up More Funding for Internet Satellites

By Rolfe Winkler, Andy Pasztor and Rob Copeland

Elon Musk's rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., is set to raise $500 million at a $30.5 billion valuation, in a bid to help get its internet-service business off the ground, according to people familiar with the fundraising.

The Hawthorne, Calif., company, known as SpaceX, is raising the capital from existing shareholders and new investor Baillie Gifford & Co., one of the people said. The Scottish money-management firm is one of the largest investors in another Musk-led company, Tesla Inc., with about a 7.6% stake in the electric-car maker, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

SpaceX and the investors have agreed on the financing terms, but the money hasn't been sent to the company yet, this person said. SpaceX could announce the deal by year-end.

SpaceX was last valued by investors at about $28 billion in a funding round in April. The investors are paying $186 a share for new stock in the latest funding round, this person said. That is up about 10% from the $169 paid during the April fundraising, according to SpaceX data compiled by Lagniappe Labs, a private-company analytics firm.

Including the current round, SpaceX has raised about $2.5 billion of equity funding, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Last month it raised $250 million via its first high-yield loan sale.

SpaceX and Baillie Gifford both declined to comment.

SpaceX plans to invest in the company's nascent satellite internet service, known as Starlink, one of the people said. Initial designs call for it to be powered by a constellation of more than 4,000 satellites orbiting the earth at low altitudes. Starlink is one of two multibillion-dollar projects at the company, the other involving plans to develop the largest rocket system ever built, the Starship and its Super Heavy rocket booster. SpaceX currently makes money by launching commercial and government satellites.

SpaceX is among several companies whose largest shareholder is Mr. Musk. Aside from Tesla, where he is CEO, Mr. Musk is the founder of brain-computer startup Neuralink and Boring Co., a tunnel-digging venture partly owned by SpaceX that was scheduled to reveal a test tunnel late Tuesday.

The SpaceX fundraising winds up a volatile year for Mr. Musk. Tesla experienced production problems earlier this year. Mr. Musk was also accused of securities fraud after tweeting that he was considering taking Tesla private and had secured funding for such a deal, though none materialized. He settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September, and agreed to relinquish his role as Tesla chairman.

Mr. Musk also drew criticism from some investors and analysts for appearing to smoke marijuana in a live online interview in September. But his erratic behavior apparently hasn't shaken the confidence of some private market investors.

SpaceX investors are optimistic about the potential of Starlink, according to a person familiar with their thinking. SpaceX projects the constellation could grow to more than 11,000 satellites. The largest current telecommunications constellation has 65 satellites.

However, as at Tesla, Mr. Musk has a history of missing projections at SpaceX. In early 2016 SpaceX projected that it would launch 44 rockets this year, according to internal documents previously reported on by The Wall Street Journal. On Tuesday, the company was scheduled to launch its 21st rocket but minutes before scheduled liftoff the launch was scrubbed for technical reasons and rescheduled for Wednesday.

Starlink is also behind the schedule laid out by SpaceX in internal documents from fall 2015. Back then, the company projected it would have 400 satellites in orbit by the end of this year. SpaceX has launched two prototype satellites, and company officials have said the first batch of operational satellites could be put in orbit as soon as next year.

In 2015, SpaceX projected the internet business would require $3.5 billion of investment capital to launch the first 800 satellites and hire approximately 1,200 employees, among other costs. It projected the business would generate more than $30 billion in revenue by 2025, dwarfing revenue of about $5 billion from its core rocket business.

SpaceX ultimately could require more than $10 billion in capital to reach its projected 11,000 satellite constellation, according to some industry estimates, while developing its heavy-lift rocket and capsule is anticipated to cost many more billions of dollars.

2018 s wild fintech ride and tamed expectations

From the cryptocurrency crash to GDPR, the highlights of the year in fintech

In an industry as young as fintech, every year is an action-packed watershed one, and 2018 didn't disappoint. Here are #fintechFT's highlights.

Crypto crashes

Spare a thought for anyone who filled an awkward silence at last year s Christmas dinner by recommending friends and relatives pile into bitcoin. The iconic cryptocurrency   the biggest use to date of blockchain technology   wastrading ataround $14,000 on December 25 last year; now it s down to less than $3,500. But investors and speculators who put their money into the cryptocurrency aren t the only ones who bear the scars of a torrid 2018.

Initial coin offerings (effectively IPOs where people are rewarded with crypto tokens instead of ownership), have also fallen off a cliff since the crypto crash, with less than $1.9bn issued between September andDecember (to date) this year, versus the $4.5bn issued in the last four months of 2017.

Another harder-to-measure casualty of the crypto crash has been confidence and belief in blockchain as a technology, despite blockchain proponents' very best efforts to stress that blockchainisn't responsible for the wild gyrations in crypto valuations.

Blockchain comes of age (slowly)

Cryptocurrencies aside, ithas been a decent year for blockchain in finance. Banks have banded together for their largest single blockchain project, with more than 130 signing up to the Interbank Information Network, which uses distributed ledger technology to quickly resolve issues that delay cross-border payments. Spain s BBVA issued the first corporate loan on the blockchain in Apriland followed up by completing the first syndicated loan on blockchain in November. In the insurance world, the US s State Farm has just begun testing a blockchain platform for processing auto claims. Consultancy Ernst & Young, insurers XL Catlin and MS Amlin, and broker Willis Towers Watson have also teamed up for a project that uses blockchain toinsure shipping containersas they make their way through war zones and natural disasters. However, finance executives, including those in the innovation world, stress that there's a long way to go before blockchain becomes a mainstream cog in their industry. One executive posits that even when blockchain technology is ready to deliver on its promises, big banks like his will run shadow systems for years. Still, progress is progress.

Realists replace evangelists in AI

In the summer of 2017, #fintechFT s intrepid agents met with a neuroscientist who claimed that his artificial intelligence tool could perform  virtually every job humans are currently carrying out, with the possible exception of the creative arts. Luckily for the millions working in finance, 2018 was a year when the industry got real about what AI can and can t do in the short term. The upshot is that there will be job losses   as detailed by Citi s investment boss Jamie Forese who bravely told the FT that up to half of his 20,000 tech and operations staff could be cut over the next five years as machines, including those powered by AI, supplant them. But, crucially, banks and other financial services firms accept that there are many limitations to what AI can do, and that it won'tlive up to its early hype, at least not in the short or even medium term.

Data overload

Banks, asset managers and insurershave been drowning in data for years as regulators demand ever-increasing amounts of information about the customers they serve and the processes they use. New technology offers up an ever-increasing amount of ways to leverage that data to tailor make products and services. Still, this year came with its challenges.  2018 was the year for data, from security to regulation to leveraging it to surprise and delight consumers,  says Vanessa Colella, chief innovation officer at Citi and head of Citi Ventures.  Although General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came out of the EU, its implications were global.  Data-focused fintechs, including Citi-backed Immuta, OneTrust and Senzing have seized on opportunities to help firms rise to the new challenges, while data havealso become a big destination for financial services firms  own fintech spending.

Frenemies

It's been coming for a while, but 2018 will go down in history as the year when big banks, insurers and asset managers all welcomed fintechs into their embrace instead of taking them on with all the gusto of Christmas Eve shoppers battling it out for the last of the supermarket's cranberry sauce.  The era of competition between banks and fintechs is dead,  says Sinead Fitzmaurice, co-founder and CFO of payments firm TransferMate.  The era of collaboration is in full swing.  She cites ING s investment in TransferMate this year as a case in point. Spain s BBVA was also prolific,putting in more than 100m in new fintech investments in the space of a couple of weeks.

Further fintech fascination

Checking out at RobinhoodWith a $5.6bnvaluationand a rapidly growing customer base of more than 6m, America s zero-fee stock trading app Robinhood was always going to make a splash when it launched its long-awaited checking account. Unfortunately, the splash was more belly-flop than an Olympic dive. Just two days after launching  checking and savings  last Thursday, Robinhood had tohastily rebrandthe new offering as a  cash management service after the Securities and Investor Protection Corp publicly denied the group's claims that it would protect any deposits lodged in the accounts. Robinhood s founders now say they're  revamping  their marketing materials and working with regulators.

Inside the revolutionAs the year draws to a close, and bonuses are in sight, many bankers might be wondering if now is the time for a new challenge. For anyone thinking that new task might be fintech, thispiecefrom eFinancialCareers offers a helpful whistle-stop tour of the ups and downs of working for rapidly expanding payments firm Revolut, which has just won a European banking licence. From 13-hour days in order to get sh*t done , to a culture of  ownership  and only hiring those who are  super super high calibre , Revolut isn t for everyone. Still, the firm says it has more than 1,000 hopefuls sending CVs in every week.

Not so stable coinThe world's best funded stablecoin   aka cryptocurrency with mechanisms to stabilise its value   is no more. Intangible Labsraised $133m for its basis cryptocurrency earlier this year, attracting support frombig name investors including Google Venturesand Bain Capital. But Intangible Labs CEO Nader Al-Najitold Forbeshe was pulling down the shutters after talks with regulators.Al-Najisaid he  got the impression  from the SEC that stablecoin would be classified as an unregistered security, limiting ownership to accredited investors in the US for the first year and mandating background checks for foreign investors thereafter. All the money raised is being returned.

Fintechviews in theFTbanking podcast

Bits and bobs

Real politiqueWe ve seen plenty of bankers trying their luck at fintech, but politicians are a rarer sight. Enter George Osborne, the UK s former chancellor, who has joined a San Francisco-based venture that invests in  decentralised finance . 9yards Capital is run by Osborne s brother Theo, who said the former politician was  very plugged into the Stanford ecosystem . He s also very well plugged into the global political ecosystem, and 9yards has already been citing those connections in conversations with investors and other prominent Silicon Valley figures, the FT hears.

Happy Christmas at PlaidPlaid, which powers apps forbig financial services firms like Venmo, Amex and Citi, secured a$2.65bn valuationand $250m of investment in its latest funding round, various media reported last week. That s a good result for the five-year-old firm, since a few months back it was reported to bein talksto raise $200m at a valuation of around $2bn. Backers of the latest fundraising include existing investors Goldman Sachs, NEA and Spark Capital, as well as Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz.

Mr. Musk also drew criticism from some investors and analysts for appearing to smoke marijuana in a live online interview in September. But "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-appears-to-smoke-marijuana-on-camera-in-lengthy-interview-1536318688" apparently hasn't shaken the confidence of some private market investors.

SpaceX investors are optimistic about the potential of Starlink, according to a person familiar with their thinking. SpaceX projects the constellation could grow to more than 11,000 satellites. The largest current telecommunications constellation has 65 satellites.

However, as at Tesla, Mr. Musk has a history of missing projections at SpaceX. In early 2016 SpaceX projected that it would launch 44 rockets this year, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/exclusive-peek-at-spacex-data-shows-loss-in-2015-heavy-expectations-for-nascent-internet-service-1484316455" previously reported on by The Wall Street Journal. On Tuesday, the company was scheduled to launch its 21st rocket but minutes before scheduled liftoff the launch was scrubbed for technical reasons and rescheduled for Wednesday.

Starlink is also behind the schedule laid out by SpaceX in internal documents from fall 2015. Back then, the company projected it would have 400 satellites in orbit by the end of this year. SpaceX has launched two prototype satellites, and company officials have said the first batch of operational satellites could be put in orbit as soon as next year.

In 2015, SpaceX projected the internet business would require $3.5 billion of investment capital to launch the first 800 satellites and hire approximately 1,200 employees, among other costs. It projected the business would generate more than $30 billion in revenue by 2025, dwarfing revenue of about $5 billion from its core rocket business.

SpaceX ultimately could require more than $10 billion in capital to reach its projected 11,000 satellite constellation, according to some industry estimates, while developing its heavy-lift rocket and capsule is anticipated to cost many more billions of dollars.

The company's rocket business has been growing steadily. It has executed 38 consecutive successful launches since a launchpad explosion in September 2016. Meantime it became the first company to "https://www.wsj.com/video/spacex-successfully-lands-two-of-three-booster-rockets/0D9F1112-A6A4-44F7-BE61-CDBD7F7D1AA3.html" safely and then routinely re-use them to launch subsequent payloads.

Development of the mammoth rocket and associated hardware remains an open question. Reasons range from changing designs to SpaceX's being shut out earlier this year from a U.S. Air Force competition that awarded more than $2 billion in contracts to three other rocket makers to develop various smaller boosters.

SpaceX's existing business faces headwinds. It expects launches of its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket will decline in 2019 and perhaps 2020. Global demand for launching commercial satellites, its core business, is stagnant, with some satellite manufacturers and customers looking to permanently exit the market segment.

In the U.S. government arena, SpaceX is just beginning to see its Pentagon and NASA business ramp up. But it will likely take several years to gain substantial revenue from the deals.

Technology
RightHand Robotics Raises $23 Million

Warehouse automation startup RightHand Robotics Inc. raised $23 million in a new funding round to add staff and develop more applications for its mechanical picking technology.

The Somerville, Mass., company's system, designed for e-commerce operations, incorporates artificial intelligence and cameras that perceive depth and color with a robotic arm that uses a polymer gripper with a suction cup to pick up objects. Customers include large retailers, pharmaceutical firms and logistics providers, the company said.

Venture-capital firm Menlo Ventures led the Series B round, which RightHand Robotics announced Monday. GV, the venture-capital arm of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, also contributed funding, along with existing investors including Dream Incubator, Matrix Partners and Playground Global. The four-year-old company has raised $34.2 million.

The company is one of several tackling one of the toughest problems robotics companies face as they try to expand use of automation in logistics and industrial operations. Robots have been increasingly used to move boxes, bins and even full racks of goods, but they so far haven't been able to match humans in simply picking up and moving the variety of objects that fill warehouses.

Research is going on as logistics operators say they face difficulty in finding enough workers in a tight labor market, pushing more companies to consider automation in their logistics operations.

The process known as picking is the biggest labor cost at online fulfillment centers, but the variety of items workers process has made automating it a challenge. Robots must learn to identify and grasp everything from cellphone chargers to jars of peanut butter.

The RightHand Robotics picking technology mimics a worker's hand-eye coordination by using machine-learning software to connect the vision system with the gripper. The "fingers" bend and twist around objects, and, like the cameras, send feedback on what works or doesn't work.

The system's accuracy "is comparable or exceeds human work in most cases," said co-founder Leif Jentoft. The robots run between $75,000 to $100,000 apiece for the hardware, plus a recurring fee that covers software licensing and maintenance.

RightHand Robotics was founded in 2014 and has about 40 employees, with plans to double its head count in 2019. The company does business in the U.S., Europe and Japan, and is "doing several million of revenue," Mr. Jentoft said.

Marketers Learn to Work With the Machines; Brands have to give up enough control while still setting limits in turning to AI to reach customers and that's just one challenge

Despite artificial intelligence's promise to help marketers reach consumers in ways that are better, faster and cheaper, executives can wind up wasting time and money when they actually try it, according to industry experts and analysts.

"Every marketer wants to be famous and wants to say,  I'm using AI,'" said Stphane Brub, chief marketing officer for Western Europe at L'Oral SA. But they also think they're experts on the topic just because they've been to a few conferences, he said. "Instead of saying,  What can I do with AI?' they need to say,  Here's what I would like to do with my dialogue or relationship with consumers, and can AI help?'"

The challenges continue from there.

Picking Battles

Marketers think the technology is the hardest aspect of AI, said Mr. Brub. "I think it's the easy part. The tough part is finding the purpose."

L'Oral could have better thought out the chatbot it introduced last year to encourage people to buy products as gifts, Mr. Brub said. It asks both potential gift-givers and the potential recipients a series of questions before suggesting options. "The consumer experience ended up being a bit complex," he said.

L'Oral improved that bot over time, Mr. Brub added, and introduced a "virtual skin expert" this year with stronger traction. It developed both bots with Automat.ai, which builds conversational marketing bots for brands.

L'Oral also has found success with AI in areas such as using image recognition to enable virtual product testing and skin analysis, fueled by its acquisition this year of augmented reality and AI company ModiFace, he said. "How can a consumer be on her phone at home or wherever, in a store, and be able to try a product without necessarily trying it?"

It's tempting to spend time and money on something sexy like a skill for a home voice assistant when unglamorous applications could pay off better, said Sucharita Kodali, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research. "When I'm in the middle of a grocery store, why can't I shout, or talk, and say,  Hey Kroger, where is the light brown sugar?'" she said.

"Voice exists, and there are use cases that I have in the store, but nobody has married that together to provide something that's useful to me," Ms. Kodali added. "Those solutions unfortunately are built by Silicon Valley bros who often don't even understand what customers want and therefore don't build useful solutions."

Retailers are more effectively using machine learning to prevent fraudulent transactions, Ms. Kodali said. "Those are things that are pretty categorically strong investments."

Choosing Partners

Brands are panning for gold in a flood of AI promises from vendors that might not have the expertise necessary to deliver. "Most of them have no idea how the technology truly works and don't have the talent required to put it into practice," said Andy Mauro, co-founder and chief executive of Automat.ai. "And that's where you get into trouble."

A marketer should put two questions to any AI vendor, Mr. Mauro said: How many Ph.D.s are on staff, and does the company focus on the marketer's category? "There's no free lunch in any of this," he said. "In order to do a good job in AI, there does need to be a certain degree of specialization."

Committing

Testing is wise at the start, but too much caution can be counterproductive, executives said.

"We see clients that say,  Oh my God, this is available, let's do a test,'" said Or Shani, founder and CEO of Albert Technologies, which offers an AI marketing platform to brands. "And they give you the worst brand they have in the worst market they have and then they don't understand why it doesn't work."

Commitment also requires marketers to prepare their teams to welcome the machines, Mr. Shani said. "They sign off and we start dealing with their marketing team or media team and they see us as a massive threat," he said. "They need to do some internal education to make sure people understand,  Guys, this is online to make your jobs better.'"

Setting Limits

When the fashion design house Natori Co. deployed AI from Albert Technologies to optimize its advertising in social media, the return on its ad spending soared, according to Ken Natori, president of the company. But there was a problem: "Some people commented that we looked like a discount website because so many sale items were being advertised on Facebook," Mr. Natori said.

Albert was increasing the number of sale ads that Natori ran because they were working a reasonable response for a system instructed to maximize ad performance. But Albert didn't consider whether too many sale ads could hurt a brand's image.

"We said,  Listen guys, love the return here, but the percentage of ads that are promoting sale product is too high and we're not comfortable what it's doing for our brand,'" Mr. Natori said. The company fixed the mix by setting some limits.

Cyber Daily: The Shakeout Has Started

By Kim S. Nash

Good day. Do you want to secure your company against hackers? You might start by evaluating products from established players. But you also must sort through a market with about 3,000 startups and small providers. That's right: Three thousand cybersecurity firms globally vie for our attention and executives can tire of trying to find the good ones.

It's frustrating to manage dozens of contracts with providers of single products. Having that many companies in the supply chain only increases risk.

The market is ripe for consolidation in the coming year, reports WSJ Pro Cybersecurity's Adam Janofsky. Sarah Guo, a general partner at venture capital firm Greylock Partners, noted at our recent conference one of her key investment criteria: A startup looks more enticing when it offers a product that solves more than problem. Perhaps corporate executives responsible for cybersecurity will get some relief as vendors, and their product lines, combine.

**********

Business Leaders Must Prepare for Cybersecurity Market Consolidation

By Adam Janofsky

A glut of cybersecurity startups and increased buying activity from private equity firms likely will make 2019 a year of cybersecurity consolidation, according to M&A specialists and cybersecurity executives.

Corporate cybersecurity leaders must navigate a rapidly growing startup landscape and deal with dozens of small vendors with one-off tools. About 3,000 cybersecurity vendors populate the market globally, with about 400 new ones funded by venture capital firms every year as cybersecurity problems become more prevalent, according to Momentum Cyber, which tracks M&A activity in the sector.

In 2019, some cybersecurity executives will prefer to work with vendors that can offer a suite of related tools instead of a single product, which could point to one way in which consolidation can benefit corporate users, said Rich Baich, chief information security officer at Wells Fargo & Co.

"We will definitely see an increase in mergers and acquisitions in 2019 just based off the pure fact that the number of cybersecurity startups has grown so large," said Mr. Baich.

The number and value of transactions have climbed in the last year, according to Barak Ravid, managing director at Ernst & Young LLC's EY-Parthenon unit.

In one of the biggest recent technology deals, BlackBerry Ltd. said in November it would buy artificial intelligence security firm Cylance Inc. for $1.4 billion in cash.

The transaction helped boost the total value of cybersecurity-related deals this year to a 40% increase over those in 2017, Mr. Ravid said.

"Five years ago, a handful of information security vendors could cover about 80% of a CISO's need," he said. "Today, what you find is CISOs dealing with 30 to 50 separate vendors, and it has created an incredibly complex environment to manage."

The cybersecurity market is attracting investments as corporate and public-sector spending increases. Corporate boards and senior executives are allocating more money for defense.

In the public sector, the U.S. Department of Defense is expected to ramp up spending on cybersecurity technologies over the next five years to help defend against attacks, and cybersecurity firms will consolidate to compete for bids, says research firm Frost & Sullivan. President Donald Trump requested a $15 billion budget for federal cybersecurity-related activities in 2019, a $583 million increase from the previous year.

As a result, global spending on cybersecurity products and services is expected to reach $124 billion in 2019, up 8.7% from 2018 spending, according to Gartner Inc.

Consolidation is expected to pick up as private equity buyers increase their investments, according to Mr. Ravid. Private equity acquisitions account for about one-third of all cybersecurity deals this year, up from one-fifth of all deals in 2017, he said.

Thoma Bravo LLC has spent billions of dollars this year buying cybersecurity firms, including Imperva Inc. for $2.1 billion in October and Barracuda Networks Inc. for $1.6 billion in February. The firm this year also purchased majority stakes in Centrify and LogRhythm for undisclosed sums.

Venture capital investors are on pace this year to set a record for funding U.S.-based cybersecurity startups, according to PitchBook Data Inc.

Technology firms from many sectors also have been acquiring information security startups to help protect their own products and expand their product lines. AT&T Inc. announced in July that it would acquire threat intelligence firm AlienVault to help protect its small and medium-sized business customers. In January, Amazon Web Services acquired Sqrrl, a cybersecurity startup founded by National Security Agency alumni, as AWS made a push to do more business with intelligence agencies, CNBC reported.

Facebook Inc., which announced several privacy and data breach incidents this year, approached several cybersecurity firms about an acquisition, The Information reported in October. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.

"We're in the early innings of consolidation," said Mr. Ravid. "There is way more ahead of us than behind us."

More Cyber News

What now, Facebook? Facebook Inc. announced a software problem Friday that may have exposed unshared photos from up to 6.8 million users, the Journal reports. Up to 1,500 apps may have had access to photos that users uploaded but did not post, or did not post in their Facebook timelines, which is where third-party apps typically access photos, Facebook engineering director Tomer Bar wrote in a blog post. Facebook said it fixed the bug on Sept. 25 and informed Ireland's data protection authority of the incident on Nov. 22. The Irish regulator oversees the company's operations in Europe, where companies are required to disclose data breaches within 72 hours of discovering them.

Owners of T-Mobile, Sprint may curb use of Huawei gear to get merger done. T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. don't use equipment from China's Huawei Technologies Co., but their respective owners, Deutsche Telekom AG and SoftBank Group Ltd., do. "U.S. government officials had been pressuring Deutsche Telekom to stop using Huawei equipment, and the companies believed they had to comply before a U.S. national security panel would let them move forward on their deal" to merge, according to Reuters, citing people familiar with the situation. Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank declined to comment and Huawei didn't respond to a request for comment, Reuters said.

Congress can use leftover campaign funds for cybersecurity. The Federal Election Commission last week voted to let members of Congress use money left from campaigns to purchase cybersecurity products. These include cell phones, computers, home routers, software and other security tools and consulting services, according to FCW.

LSE and TP ICAP name new chairmen

The London Stock Exchange has named Don Robert as its new chairman to replace Donald Brydon, who is stepping down after a dispute with shareholders over its former chief executive.

Mr Robert, currently chairman of Experian, the credit data company, will initially join the LSE as a non-executive director and will become chairman after its annual meeting in May. He will step down from the Court of the Bank of England when he assumes his new role.

Mr Brydon had agreed a year ago to step down in 2019 following criticism over his handling of the departure of former boss Xavier Rolet, the architect of the 216-year old exchange's revival.

Earlier yesterday, the LSE increased its control over LCH, the clearing house at the centre of fears over financial stability if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.

The exchange bought shareholdings in LCH totalling 14.6 per cent from a group of shareholders for  424.5m (382.1m). That took the LSE's holding to 83 per cent. Sellers included Borsa Istanbul, Deutsche Bank, Nasdaq and Nomura.

The derivatives industry and other regulators have urged Brussels to ensure that European banks can access critical UK clearers such as LCH after March, to avoid destabilising the market. The EU is likely to reveal its formal plans to issue temporary licences next week.

In a day of appointments, TP ICAP named Richard Berliand, a longtime trading industry executive, as its new chairman to rebuild the UK interdealer broker's relations with shareholders following a bitter boardroom row. Mr Berliand will take over from Rupert Robson after TP ICAP's annual meeting next May. The company has overhauled its most senior executive and board roles over the past six months, as strains showed in its efforts to combine the 1.3bn purchase of the ICAP global broking business.

At its annual meeting in May more than 11 per cent of shareholders voted against the directors' remuneration report.

A heavy profits warning accompanied the removal of John Phizackerley as chief executive, and the shares dropped 40 per cent.

Mr Phizackerley was replaced by Nicolas Breteau. Other changes at the broker since July include a new finance director, head of remuneration committee and head of human resources.

Mr Berliand, senior independent director at asset manager Man Group, has held senior positions at JPMorgan, including global head of prime services and global head of cash equities. He also is deputy chairman of Deutsche Brse and sits on an advisory board to the main US derivatives markets regulator.

Angela Knight, senior independent director, said his experience would be invaluable as TP ICAP looked to expand in areas such as data and analytics.

The Outlook
Economy
State and Local Investment Gets Lift From Rising Revenues; Now that coffers are brimming again, infrastructure spending is back on the agenda

By Sarah Chaney and Heather Gillers

State and local government investment in roads, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure hasn't returned to its previous peak, but it is now showing signs deep into the expansion of a real recovery.

Since the 2007-09 recession, slow economic growth and rising expenditures on Medicaid and pensions crowded out infrastructure investment. Spending on school buildings, hospitals and public safety languished.

Now, bigger state and local tax collections, propelled in part by an acceleration in sales-tax receipts from consumer spending, is boosting capital projects and driving a municipal borrowing boom.

At a time when other engines of U.S. economic growth show signs of slowing, public spending at the state and local level could help keep the expansion going.

New money is going into projects aimed at making cities and towns more livable and efficient. Spending on transportation infrastructure in October was up 15% from a year earlier, according to Commerce Department data. Spending on amusement and recreation facilities was up 31% from a year ago.

"From an economic perspective, this is about as good an environment as a state or local policy maker is going to see," said Dan White, director at Moody's Analytics. "If they're ever going to do more one-time investment for infrastructure or put more money in their rainy-day fund  & this is exactly the time when you would expect to see that."

In all, state and local construction spending was up 9.7% in October from a year earlier to an annual rate of $288 billion, still shy of the $296 billion pace reached in March 2009.

Borrowing is supporting the pickup. State and local governments issued $228.45 billion in bonds for new projects in the 10 months through October, a 19% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by Citigroup Inc. Some borrowers want to lock in loans now, before interest rates go much higher.

Given the lag between bond issuance and project spending, this year's surge in bond sales bodes well for state and local spending in the coming quarters.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/investment-in-infrastructure-is-booming-despite-lack-of-progress-on-trumps-pledges-1538920801" might also keep the upturn going into 2019. After years of stagnation, state and local government spending has fallen from around 13% of gross domestic product in 2009 to 11% more recently.

In Indiana, many cities and towns were unable to repair roads and bridges for more than a decade, restrained by declining revenues. Now, the state is doling out money to localities from reserve funding and gas taxes to finance repairs of roads, bridges and other infrastructure.

Dennis Maple, a corn and soybean farmer in Greentown, Ind., said large equipment often can't be transported across rural bridges because the bridges are too small. "It's detrimental to farmers to travel four to five miles out of the way," Mr. Maple said. "Any time that we have to do extra road travel, [it] takes longer to harvest or plant our crop in a timely manner."

Mr. Maple said the state's recent investment in bridges is visible, but that "[there are] still a lot of bridges to repair."

The improvement in state and local finances has buoyed even Detroit, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-forgiving-is-the-muni-market-detroit-will-find-out-1543886307", the city's first bond issuance against its own credit since its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323993804578614144173709204".

"We have an upward trajectory on our property tax and on the value of property," John Hill, Detroit's chief financial officer, told reporters.

The bond money will purchase new police cars, firetrucks and other emergency vehicles and fund improvements to parks and recreational facilities in some of the city's more populous neighborhoods.

At the Adams Butzel Recreation Complex on Detroit's east side, the city is planning to replace playground equipment, add parking spaces and improve landscaping, city officials said. The city also plans to add a network of bike paths and replace the roof on the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, part of a $1.8 billion capital improvement plan.

Pittsburgh's airport is planning to spend $75 million next year to revamp a terminal. Separate capital funding will provide upgrades to fire alarms, terminal lighting and airport roads.

"We're finally able to generate enough cash to take care of the backlog of capital projects that we had that we hadn't been able to pay for," said Christina Cassotis, chief executive of Allegheny County Airport Authority.

Nationwide, state tax revenues grew 6.3% in 2018 compared with an average 2.5% growth rate for the previous seven years, according to an analysis of tax-revenue data from Tax Policy Center. Moreover, some local governments are flush with cash this year because of tax-law changes. Residents of high-tax states rushed to prepay their 2018 property taxes at the end of 2017 in order to avoid limitations on deductions created by last year's tax overhaul.

State tax revenues grew 6.3% in the second quarter of 2018 compared with an average second-quarter growth rate of 2.5% for the previous eight years, according to an analysis of inflation-adjusted tax revenue data from Tax Policy Center.

The London Stock Exchange Group has named Don Robert as its new chairman to replace Donald Brydon, who is stepping down after a dispute with shareholders over its former chief executive.

Mr Robert, currently the chairman of Experian, will initially join the LSE as a non-executive director and will become chairman after its annual meeting in May. He will also step down from the Court of the Bank of England when he assumes the chairman role.

Mr Brydon had agreed a year ago to step down in 2019 following criticism by some shareholders over his handling of the departure of former boss Xavier Rolet, the architect of the 216-year old exchange s revival.

Paul Heiden, senior independent director, said the LSE had undertaken a global search to identify a successor.  Don brings a strong track record in the global financial services sector and a deep understanding of technology, data and analytics that will greatly benefit our business as we continue to adapt to regulatory and technological change. 

Earlier on Friday the LSE also confirmed it had increase its control over LCH, the clearing house at the centre of fears over financial stability if Britain crashes out of the European Union without a deal.

The LSE raised its shareholding in LCH by 14.6 per cent to 82.6 per cent after several shareholders sold down their stakes for a total  424.5m (382.1m). Sellers included Borsa Istanbul, CFT & Viel & Cie, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Nasdaq and Nomura.

UK authorities have urged the EU to set out its plans for European banks to access LCH after the UK exits the EU, to avoid potentially destabilising the market. The EU is likely to unveil its formal plans to issue temporary licences next week.

VC Daily:  Pokemon' Rides Again; Crypto Startup Closes Amid SAFT Worries

Good day. We've got headlines on a sharp increase in valuation for the maker of the hit "Pokmon Go" app, and a high-profile crypto shutdown that raises ominous questions for other projects that depended on the controversial SAFT fundraising method.

Have a great weekend.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Pokmon round: Niantic Inc., the publisher of the popular "Pokmon Go" mobile app, is raising a new round of capital that would value the company at $3.9 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The $200 million funding round is expected to be led by venture-capital firm IVP, with participation from strategic investors Samsung Electronics Co. and aXiomatic Gaming LLC. Last year, Niantic raised $200 million at about a $2.7 billion valuation. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the scoop.

Token takedown: Cryptocurrency startup Basis, which raised some $135 million from top venture investors, is shutting down amid concerns that its so-called stablecoin project would run afoul of securities regulators. Parent company Intangible Labs Inc. says it believes regulators would view its tokens as securities, preventing the project from working as originally intended. The shutdown raises questions about the viability of other crypto projects that used the same so-called SAFT fundraising model as Basis. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron and Yuliya Chernova have more.

Synthetic-biology funding: Zymergen Inc. has rounded up more than $400 million from SoftBank Vision Fund and other investors to fuel its search for molecules enabling new products across a range of industries. The company uses robotics, genomics and machine learning to coax microbes into making molecules of interest to industries such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. Synthetic-biology startups have captured investor interest as the falling cost of reading and writing DNA have made it increasingly possible to use biology to generate new materials and other goods. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Gormley's Take: A Second Act for  Population Genomics'

By Brian Gormley

Startups such as Genomics Medicine Ireland, Congenica Ltd. and 10x Genomics Inc. are cashing in on interest in studying the genetics of specific populations to discover new ways to diagnose and treat disease.

In the 1990s deCODE Genetics was an early mover in the field, studying the genetics of people in Iceland to uncover risk factors for conditions like heart disease and cancer. Reykjavik-based deCODE went public in 2000 after raising capital from ARCH Venture Partners, Polaris Partners and others.

After selling genetic-analysis services, deCODE struggled to develop its own drugs and filed for bankruptcy in 2009. It re-emerged as a private company in 2010, with backing from ARCH and Polaris, to focus on diagnostics, personal-genome scans and genomics services. Amgen Inc. acquired deCODE in 2012 for $415 million.

Despite its ups and downs, deCODE helped investors and pharmaceutical companies see the value of population studies and has made the road easier for startups today.

More in Gormley's Take

Exits

Vector Capital agreed to acquire Host Analytics Inc., a provider of cloud-based enterprise performance-management services. StarVest Partners, a growth-equity firm that is currently Host Analytics' largest shareholder, will remain an investor in the company.

VC Funds

London-based early-stage investor Luminous Ventures said it has spun out of growth-capital firm White Cloud Capital with a $30 million fund to invest in early-stage companies focused on developing breakthrough technologies and applied science. The firm's portfolio includes Synthace, Hadean, BioBeats and FaceSoft.

Work-Bench Ventures, a New York-based firm focused on early-stage enterprise technologies, said it closed its second fund at $47 million. A regulatory filing in October showed the firm having closed on $46.2 million toward the fund.

Cybersecurity company Venafi Inc. has launched a $12.5 million fund called the Machine Identity Protection Development Fund to support developers working on ways to safeguard the identities of machines. The fund's first three recipients are Jetstack, OpenCredo and Cygnacom.

New Money

Minted LLC, a marketplace for art and home decor, has closed a $208 million Series E round from private-equity firm Permira and T. Rowe Price. After starting as a direct-to-consumer business for making creative products on-demand, the company has expanded to include wholesale and licensing partnerships of its designs with stores including West Elm and Pottery Barn. Minted said it would use the new funding to expand its partnership business and to open more retail locations. Read more.

A pair of investments has boosted the burgeoning construction tech industry. Procore Technologies Inc. said it closed a $75 million round led by Tiger Global Management at a valuation of $3 billion.

US agritech start-up Indigo Ag has increased its offering for farmers by acquiring a satellite and artificial intelligence group, enhancing data-based decision-making for their clients, who include growers and agricultural buyers.

Indigo, which focused on crop microbials when it was founded five years ago, has expanded its operations, offering a range of products and services including a digital market place for farmers.

TellusLabs, which is being acquired for an undisclosed sum, will aid Indigo s agronomists who help its clients to understand their crop yield potential and unique land characteristics with TellusLabs  spatial insights.

David Perry, Indigo s chief executive, said that its purchase of TellusLabs would  bolster our effort to produce rigorous and useful agronomic recommendations tailored to each acre of a farm. 

Backed by investors including the Investment Corporation of Dubai, Indigo s most recent funding round raised $250m, bringing its total financing to more than $650m. Pitchbook, which provides private company data, estimates Indigo s value at $3.2bn.

Mistras Group Inc. on Thursday said it had acquired 100% of the stock of Onstream Pipeline Inspection Services Inc., for $143 million.

Mistras also updated its full-year 2018 revenue guidance to $740 million, an increase of $10 million over the high end of its most recent outlook and exclusive of the impact from Onstream.

SoftBank-backed Zymergen Adds $400 Million; Company manufactures molecules used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals

Zymergen Inc. said it has rounded up more than $400 million from SoftBank Vision Fund and other investors to fuel its search for molecules enabling new products across a range of industries.

The Emeryville, Calif.-based company uses robotics, genomics and machine learning to coax microbes into making molecules of interest to industries such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. This Series C financing, led by return investor SoftBank, follows a $130 million Series B round in 2016 and a $44 million Series A in 2015.

Zymergen and several other synthetic-biology startups have captured investor interest as the falling cost of reading and writing DNA have made it increasingly possible to use biology to generate new materials and other goods.

Last week Synthorx Inc., which uses its technology for expanding the genetic alphabet to develop biological drugs for cancer and autoimmune diseases, went public after raising capital from Avalon Ventures, Correlation Ventures and others.

Another company, Ginkgo Bioworks Inc., raised $275 million in December 2017 from Viking Global and others to engineer organisms that can churn out molecules of interest to industry.

Zymergen said its new financing will enable it to increase the speed and predictability with which it can program and optimize biology for specific traits. Zymergen, which says its customers include Fortune 1000 companies, also expects to begin commercializing products from its own proprietary portfolio, including ones to improve population health.

New investors Goldman Sachs and Hanwha Asset Management also participated in Zymergen's Series C, as well as return backers Data Collective, True Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Innovation Endeavors.

Everyone knew that Verizon s deals for AOL and Yahoo were dumb. But they still did it

Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT s daily deals briefing

FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.

Have your say: many thanks to those of you who answered a survey on Due Diligenceyesterday. If you haven t already, do please consider sharing your thoughts on DD here. It will be very helpful as we prepare to expand and bring you more next year &

It was just a matter of time before we reached the inevitable verdict: Verizon s acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo has turned out to be a disaster.

On Tuesday the US telecoms giant said it was writing off almost $5bn from Oath   the digital media division that folded AOL and Yahoo   as it indirectly admitted that its plan to create an advertising rival to Google and Facebook was never going to happen.

Our Lex column saw this happening years ago.

When Verizon acquired AOL for $4.1bn in 2015, Lex that the idea AOL would help Verizon attract millennial users was ill-thought, given the internet group was best-known for being used by elderly people, some evenwithdial-up.

A year laterLex was even harsher after Verizon announced that it had acquired Yahoo for $4.8bn, as the column argued that Verizon s dealmaking adventures could prove as ill-fated as Yahoo s (which burnt billions of dollars under the leadership of Marissa Mayer, buying failing internet assets such as Tumblr).

Is there a silver lining for Verizon?

TodayLex says that both deals were modest bets that never endangered Verizon s dividend or credit rating, therefore taking the risk was worth it (even if it cost investors a potential $9bn in buybacks).

The FT s Anna Nicolaou and James Fontanella-Khan arguethat Verizon s failed media deals raise questions about the prospects for AT&T, which has jumped in headfirst with its blockbuster $108bn purchase of Time Warner.

A former Time Warner executive told DD that his old colleagues fear AT&T will suffer huge losses due to the deal as integrating a media business remains incredibly tough.

Farming: agritech start-ups vie todisrupt industry giants

Big Ag s consolidation was always going to have consequences.

Over the past few years we ve seen the Big Six agricultural seed and chemical groups  BASF, Bayer, Dow,DuPont, Monsantoand Syngenta become the Big Four. And now the deals rush is among the reasons there s a demandfor new agritech start-ups,writes Emiko Terazonoin an FT Big Read.

From SoftBank and Google,to Singapore sTemasek and the private offices of internet entrepreneursJeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt, investors from all overhave put theirmoney into new digital start-ups looking at ways to change the way food is produced.

Experts believe that agricultural production is ripe for the kind of innovation that changed finance in the 1980s and communications in the 2000s. The new flows of capital, combined with the falling cost of technology from artificial intelligence to digital storage, is enabling start-ups to try to grow on their ownrather than being sucked into a bigger company.

As US start-ups including Farmers Business Network, a  Google for farmers , and Indigo Ag, an agritech platform based on plant microbials, consider stock market flotations, venture capital backers are hoping thatanIPO of an agritech start-up will gather interest. They may have the power to transform agriculture.

Fridman tries to shopAlfa butbuyers are sparse

Alfa Group chairman Mikhail Fridman is the last of Russia s cowboysnot only amongthe seven original oligarchs said to have bankrolled Boris Yeltsin s re-election (in the FT, no less), but in banking as well.

Yet, with the Russian financial sector increasingly in state hands and sanctions scuppering foreign investment, Fridman is ready to ride off into the sunset and sell Alfa-Bank, Russia s largest privately held lender, the FT s Max Seddon reports from Moscow.

Sources say he sought between $7bn and $8bn for the asset   then gave up after failing to find a buyer.Tentative efforts to sell the bank to UniCredit last year and Kremlin-owned VTB this year went nowhere.

The factors that saw him explore a sale   which Alfa continues to deny   have made a sale less likely: the Kremlin is reluctant to pour more capital into an already heavily subsidised state sector and wants Alfa to remain private.

These daysFridman   a UK tax resident   is better known for his investments in western companies through London-based LetterOne. The fund is merging energy producer Dea with Germany s Wintershall, and it has poured money into everything from Holland & Barrett to Uber and the private equity fund Pamplona Capital Management, run by a former Alfa chief executive.

Most of that money came from his share of the $28bn sale of TNK-BP to Rosneft in 2013 at a sum unthinkable in today s geopolitical environment   and well remembered in Moscow.

 They re never going to let him do it,  an Alfa competitor says.

Corporate Leaders Seek New Ways to Protect Systems as Hacking Intensifies

By Kim S. Nash

"The CISO can't win." That's how Kevin Mandia, CEO of FireEye Inc., sees the thankless job of the chief information security officer. Not only do they frequently lose their jobs when their company is breached, but simply trying to give other senior executives a dashboard of metrics about the state of cybersecurity at the firm is a no-win situation, Mr. Mandia said. "If I see all green [indicators], I don't believe them. If some are red, I think,  Aw, now I have to do something about it,'" he said. "All yellow, and I don't know what to think."

Mr. Mandia's observation captured some of the challenge for security executives and others attending the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum on Tuesday. Protecting and defending a company can be an expensive proposition with no clear roadmap and many variables are beyond your control. Hackers don't act according to the breach-response plan that business leaders practice. Supply-chain partners don't always come clean about the holes in their own security that put your systems at risk. And, as Rob Joyce, the National Security Agency's senior adviser on cybersecurity strategy, told us at the conference, corporate leaders face increasing challenges, including from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, in safeguarding online systems and data. "The trend is going the wrong way."

Take heart: Leading cybersecurity thinkers at the conference shared their insights and practical advice for managing these risks. We'll bring you highlights, starting today with stories on how senior security executives at United Continental Holdings Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. secure their supply chains and insights from a partner at venture capital firm Greylock Partners for sorting through the many security startups vying for attention.

Corporate Security Leaders Track Cyber's Weakest Link: The Compromised Third Party

By Adam Janofsky

NEW YORK -- To protect their internal networks from cyberattacks, corporate cybersecurity leaders must look for threats lurking on third-party systems.

Sometimes that involves getting creative, Edna Conway, chief security officer for global value chain at Cisco Systems Inc., said Tuesday at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum. Ms. Conway said she visits business partners   sometimes in disguise   to assess whether they're taking security seriously.

"I have an alter ego & When I have a red wig on, I'm Trixie," she said.

Third parties that have access to sensitive intellectual property, such as prototypes, might be used by cybercriminals to manipulate, disrupt, and spy on larger firms, Ms. Conway said.

Criminal hackers and nation states have infiltrated a variety of companies through their vendors and business partners in recent years. In perhaps the most notorious case, attackers breached Target Corp. in 2013 through a small refrigeration contractor that was connected to the retailer's systems, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Securing the supply chain is becoming more challenging for businesses, said Emily Heath, chief information security officer at United Continental Holdings Inc. The airline company works with tens of thousands of suppliers and partners, she said.

"Step one is understanding your landscape. It sounds really simple but it's not an easy thing to do," she said. United's cybersecurity team must determine which businesses and individuals have access to sensitive systems, such as procurement and accounts payable.

Ms. Conway said public-private partnerships and cross-industry information sharing programs can help companies stay on top of some of these threats. But it can be difficult for these to work well in practice, said Ms. Heath. This is because by the time governments declassify information about cyber threats, it can be too late for security teams, she said.

"We all want public-private partnerships, but I don't think we're there yet," she said.

VC Shares Criteria for Identifying Promising Cyber Startups

By Yuliya Chernova

Sifting through pitches of cybersecurity technology that sound too good to be true is a challenge facing corporations and venture capitalists alike, said Sarah Guo, general partner at Greylock Partners, at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum in New York on Tuesday.

Ms. Guo said that her team applies several criteria to separate the wheat from the chaff. First is to see whether the startup is riding a wave of change, be it the shift to the cloud, new attacker behavior such as ransomware, or a technology approach such as machine learning.

This can help a customer find a budget for the security startup's technology, she said. For example, if a company is migrating to the cloud, security tools could be part of that, she said.

Ms. Guo's next step is to find entrepreneurs with military or national-security experience dealing with classified technology matters. Several entrepreneurs in the Greylock portfolio come from U.S. or Israeli intelligence forces.

Then it's important to find signs of success, such as whether the technology already has been adopted by respected people and organizations. "It doesn't have to be a lot of data points," but they have to be quality ones, she said.

Another criteria for Greylock is whether the technology could be strategic to its clients. She pointed to Palo Alto Networks Inc. and Okta Inc., which saw customers over time start to build infrastructure around their products.

Ms. Guo says a startup looks more enticing when it offers a product that solves more than one problem. It may allow customers to ship secure products faster, for example.

Greylock looks for network effects, a classic consumer technology attribute, even in security startups, Ms. Guo said. This category could include technology that learns and improves with each new customer.

More Cyber News

Other highlights from Tuesday's conference:

Despite Inactivity During Midterm Elections, Hackers Are Likely To Ramp Up Attacks In 2020

Hackers were less active than security experts anticipated during last month's midterm elections, reports Catherine Stupp. But the federal government still should continue its assistance to state and local election security authorities, according to Judd Choate, director of the division of elections at Colorado's department of state. "Many states need money, they need assistance," Mr. Choate said. There are signs that hackers will use more sophisticated tactics to interfere in 2020. Robby Mook, campaign manager for Mrs. Clinton's 2016 campaign, predicted that attackers will deploy so-called deep fake videos to sow confusion around the next presidential election, using artificial intelligence to create doctored videos and images that appear realistic. Campaigns are vulnerable to cyber attackers because they lack funding and expertise to defend their systems, Mr. Mook said. "We still have a challenge that it's expensive to secure your campaign and campaign people are not cybersecurity experts. They're never going to be and they can't afford to hire someone who is," he added.

NSA Cyber Chief Says Companies Are Losing Ground Against Adversaries

Are we winning the war to protect data? Not according to Rob Joyce, the National Security Agency's senior adviser on cybersecurity strategy, writes Angus Loten. Corporate leaders face increasing challenges in safeguarding their online systems and data, he said. "The trend is going the wrong way," Mr. Joyce said. In the corporate world, he said, protective measures need to start with greater oversight of approved access to secure networks: "You need to think about the people you give the keys to your kingdom." That should be followed by critically evaluating sources of a company's software and apps, hardware and other tools. Russia, China, North Korea and Iran pose the biggest threat among foreign actors, he said. "It really is those four countries that are outside the norm that the rest of us are living with."

Biometrics, the Next Step in Authentication, Eases Into the Workplace

As cyber threats grow and become more sophisticated, companies increasingly are turning to biometric technology to help replace username and password sign-in measures, reports Laura Cooper. But tying authentication to physical information about users--like fingerprints and voices--or other user attributes also carries risks. Ellen Richey, the vice chairman and head of risk and public policy at Visa Inc., said that the company has taken a keen interest in biometrics in the last few years, noting that the practice could mean identifying a user by fingerprint, voice scan, eyescan and even a heartbeat. Although the biometrics options is safer than a username and password, it still can be replicated, according to Maja Pantic, a computing and research director at Samsung AI and a professor of affective and behavioral computing at Imperial College London. To safeguard against fraud, she suggested employing multiple biometrics in tandem.

Cloud Security Not Automatic

For all their hand wringing about cloud security, firms often neglect basic due diligence, says Roland Cloutier, chief security officer at Automatic Data Processing Inc. Many falsely believe, he said, that cloud-service providers will automatically handle all their security needs, Angus Loten reports. The truth is most cloud services offer tools to protect a company's infrastructure and software, but it is up to users themselves to decide which tools they need and want in place, Mr. Cloutier said. Gartner Inc. expects the global public cloud market to grow 21.4% this year to a total of $186.4 billion, with infrastructure as the fastest-growing segment projected to hit $40.8 billion, up 35.9%. In choosing a cloud provider, Mr. Cloutier recommends firms check for certifications that show a level of due diligence and documentation to back up any service claims, as well as service agreements and guarantees. Beyond security features, firms should try to gauge a cloud-service provider's level of resilience, in the form of a proven ability to respond quickly to business outages, disaster recoveries or other emergencies: "Bad things can happen in the cloud," Mr. Cloutier said.

Good day. The fight for talent driving pay raises for private-equity professionals here in North America also is playing out in Europe. But as Will Louch reports this morning, junior professionals in Europe are reaping the benefits more than the senior professionals that manage them.

Will also writes of travails at listed investment trust Electra Private Equity PLC, which said its stakes in the U.K. franchise of restaurant chain TGI Fridays and retailer Hotter Shoes had fallen in value. Finally, a proposal immunizing the private-equity firms that own iHeartMedia Inc. from legal trouble will delay the radio broadcaster's exit from chapter 11 until the new year.

Now on to today's news &

Today's Top Stories

Retail Woes Wipe Millions Off Electra's Remaining Portfolio

Electra Private Equity PLC has written down the value of its two largest remaining portfolio companies, TGI Fridays UK and Hotter Shoes, as the U.K. casual dining and retail sectors continue to struggle with difficult trading conditions, WSJ Pro's William Louch reports. The London-listed investment trust, which canceled plans to sell itself earlier this year, said its investments in the two businesses had fallen in value by more than 68 million ($85.2 million) in the past 12 months.

In Europe, Junior Professionals Land Bigger Pay Bumps Than Bosses

Private equity's most junior professionals are reaping the benefits of an increasingly competitive hiring market in Europe, Will also writes. Average pay for deal makers at the associate level increased at a quicker rate than compensation for their more senior colleagues, according to a survey by executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles International Inc.

Clear Channel Settlement Delays iHeartMedia's Bankruptcy Exit

A proposed pact immunizing Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners, the firms that own iHeartMedia Inc., from legal trouble will delay the radio broadcaster's exit from chapter 11 until next year, Peg Brickley reports for WSJ Pro. The settlement involves iHeart's most prized asset, billboard company Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc.

The Take: Oil-Price Volatility Dampens Appetite for Energy Funds

By Luis Garcia

More limited partners appear to be losing appetite for oil-and-gas funds, although this hasn't yet reversed the flow of capital in such funds. That may change, however, as oil-price volatility intensifies.

A global survey of 90 institutional investors that placement agent Probitas Partners released last week showed that 7% of respondents plan to focus on energy private-equity funds during 2019, down from 13% in a similar survey Probitas conducted a year ago.

Law firms position themselves at the heart of business deals

Lawyers step out of traditional roles to attract clients

Few lawyers learn about organising private equity conferences or setting up merger and acquisition deals in graduate school. Faced with changing demands from clients, however, law firms are looking to offer additional services that are not traditionally associated with law firms and are using technology to deliver their existing services more efficiently.

Nowhere is this clearer than in private equity, where clients care about a steady flow of deal opportunities.

One law firm, McGuireWoods, saw that introducing entrepreneurs to capital providers was something that could help differentiate it in the fast-growing field of independent sponsors, who are usually entrepreneurs or former industry executives looking to buy into companies but who need private equity financing.

Rather than just provide legal advice, McGuireWoods has encouraged its lawyers to be at the centre of new deals by expanding their networks of potential contacts. They visit trade shows, talk to business owners and make introductions as well as organising an annual conference at a Dallas hotel, which this year hosted 600 companies and investors.

 It has forced lawyers to do things that we did not learn in law school 	. 	. 	. 	we have to go and meet owners of companies and see what they are looking for,  says Jon Finger, partner at McGuireWoods.  It s a different approach to that which lawyers have traditionally taken. 

The firm also has a master list of private equity contacts in its network complete with details about their investment criteria and template emails for making introductions so that lawyers can act quickly if they hear of deal opportunities. By setting up introductions to potential capital providers and deepening their links, the hope is that clients will want to hire the firm to do related legal work.

In the past such matchmaker types of service have more often been provided by investment banks.

 We introduce people in person or by email and that s the end of it,  says Mr Finger.  If it leads to a deal, then great. I lose count [of] how many times I m told they have never had a law firm do this for them before 	. 	. 	. 	We trust over time that s going to take hold. 

McGuire introduced Abbey Road Capital, an independent sponsor, to private equity firm Route 2 Capital Partners in order to purchase Convert IT Marketing, which provides pay-per-click marketing, earlier this year.

Professor Gabriel Teninbaum, director of the Institute on Legal Innovation and Technology at Suffolk University law school in Boston, says many law firms now host advice sessions on non-legal issues, such as blockchain, to help clients.

 Law firms are clamouring to host these sorts of events as it s part of the changing model if they can see themselves as part of the ecosystem,  he says.

One motivation for providing additional services is that law firms are facing greater demands from clients for efficiencies as they look for ways to cut legal costs. Many clients want to pay fixed fees rather than law firms billing by the hour and are pushing lawyers to deploy technology to reduce costs.

 The billable hour is not dying but it s not the only way to do business,  Prof Teninbaum says.  Clients are demanding that firms switch to fixed fees or look at innovation to become more efficient. Some of this is trickling down from in-house law departments where clients may already use document automation, for example, and expect that to be used by law firms. 

As a result, he says, law firms are hiring so-called legal solutions architects or knowledge engineers. They are legally qualified but operate more like project managers   they may have some knowledge of Six Sigma process improvement techniques, for instance   and will decide how best to proceed with a big piece of legal work.

They will decide which parts of a sprawling lawsuit or M&A deal need a partner to analyse and which less complex aspects can be delegated to an artificial intelligence program.  A lot of their time is spent thinking about how to do things more efficiently,  Prof Teninbaum says.

Other law firms are using technology as a way to protect clients or offering them much broader solutions to what is essentially a business problem.

In the field of trademarks, the law firm Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein & Fox set up a one-stop shop brand protection practice that helps clients to combat problems such as infringement and counterfeiting across multiple jurisdictions.

It can deploy a multipronged armoury of tools ranging from district court applications against unknown defendants to seizing assets from unknown online sellers and tightening the supply chain so that the client is not playing  whack-a-mole  with the same counterfeiting problems in different countries.

In the case of ecigarette company Juul Labs, Sterne Kessler worked with it on a global enforcement campaign to address counterfeiting and infringement with district court litigation and also co-ordinating with counsel in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

Juul recently filed a complaint in the US International Trade Commission against 24 entities in the US, China, and Uruguay for selling copycat so-called Juul-compatible pods in the US, which violated patents held by the company.

Monica Riva Talley, head of trademark and brand protection practice at Sterne Kessler, says brands need a multi-faceted approach to combat counterfeiters.

The firm takes a holistic overview of many areas, she says, before coming up with a tailored answer to a problem.  We might say you need to address this issue here but also bolster your protection in these other jurisdictions and protect the rights you have got,  says Ms Talley.

UK loses patience with banks  IT glitches

Fidelity weighs robo advisory service launch, Zopa on fundraising trail

UK Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan could hardly have wished for a better target than banks' hapless IT departments when she took aim at them a fortnight ago as she announcedan inquiry into their  astonishing  level of failures.

Despite investing billions of pounds to overhaul their creaking IT systems,high street lenders have suffered a string of outages this year, most notably at TSB, whose chief executive was dethroned by the debacle, but also atBarclays, RBS and HSBC.

Customers were left unable to withdraw cash, access apps or pay their staff. Some even had to abandon shopping in checkout lines when part of the nation s Visa debit card system failed.

Parliamentarians spy easy prey.Two weeks ago Morgan, a Conservative MP, announced an inquiry into the heightened level of IT problems across the financial services industry, criticising the  measly apologies and hollow words  from executives offered in response.

Morgan (pictured above) has form at effecting change; her determined efforts to hold TSB's management to account for its failures contributed to the departure of CEO Paul Pester, who stepped down after a failed IT migration left clients unable to access their accounts or refinance mortgages for months. Pester didn't help himself by making a series of misleading and flippant statements during a Parliamentary grilling.

While IT incidents are a fact of life at any big organisation, a general lack of preparation, training and co-ordination in banks  responses are exacerbating public anger and attracting serious political and regulatory scrutiny. This raises the prospects of more and larger penalties for an industry already reeling from years of fines and bad press.

The increase in incidences is stark. In the year to October, UK firms reported a 138 per cent increase in technology outages to the Financial Conduct Authority, 18 per cent of which werecyber security related. The increase partly reflects the impact of the latest EUpayment services directive, which came into force in January and forcesbanks to flag a wider range of incidents revealing a chronic under-reporting of problems in the past.

Despite repeated scandals and censure, bankers don t seem to be learning from their failures, according to EY s lead cyber partner Steve Holt, who offers to help firms with these shortcomings.

 The first few hours are critical, admitting there is a problem and acting on it, but what we have seen in recent outages is that this still isn't happening fast enough,  Holt said.  So much seems to be done on the fly, responses are disjointed and people   from the board to customer support staff   aren't properly informed, which compounds the anger. 

There is a natural reluctance for banks to admit their systems have crashed or been disrupted by a hack until they have all the facts. This can take days, during which aggrieved customers flood social media with their complaints.

 The worst-case scenario is that the regulators find out about problems on Twitter before you ve told them,  Holt said.  If you look at the reports about the incidents, they all point to frustration with the way banks dealt with it. 

In the line of fire this year have been Barclays and RBS, which were criticised by Parliament for a  litany of failures  after both their IT systems floundered for hours in the same week in September.

 We see no immediate end in sight to the escalation in tech and cyber incidents that are affecting UK financial services,  Megan Butler, a top supervisor at the FCA, said in a November27 speech. However,  the true test of the resilience of UK finance is not the absence of incidents. It s how well incidents are managed. 

Morgan has already publicly questioned whether branch cuts should continue if  banking apps and websites cannot be relied upon .

As scrutiny steps up, the financial services industry is moving to unify and improve its response. Industry lobby group UK Finance is trying to pull together a  Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre  that will link up companies with the UK s National Cyber Security Centre and Government Communications Headquarters.

There s some evidence the message is getting through. Bob Wigley, chairman of UK Finance, says cyber attacks have become  relentless  and represent a  clear and present danger  if they aren t acted on  in a faster, more co-ordinated and effective way .

Further fintech fascination

Blockchain watchAnother mixed week for blockchain. Cryptocurrencies   blockchain's most famous use case   plumbed new depths yet again, and the world's legacy foreign payments system Swiftannounced plansfor an upgrade that could make a blockchain-based payments network irrelevant. But, despite setbacks, enthusiasm for blockchain remains high. Seven southern EU countries last week declared their intention tolead the wayin blockchain for governments, and London-listed Argo Blockchain said demand for crypto mining is soaring despite blockchain's collapse.

Can't beat 'emSeventy-two-year-old investment giant Fidelity is weighing the pros and cons of launching a robo advisory service in the UK, following in the footsteps of new rivals like Nutmeg and MoneyFarm and more established ones like UBS and HSBC. Analysts describe the move as a  natural extension  for Fidelity International, which rolled out a digital only service in Germany in October.

Coming of ageZopa is hitting thefundraising trailagain afterbecomingthe first peer-to-peer lender to score a full banking licence in the UK. The new licenceclearsthe way for the 13-year-old firm to broaden its funding base by offering savings accounts and generally expanding its business. The move is symbolic too.P2P lenders have been criticised for being outside the ambit of regulators;now Zopa is putting itself right in their crosshairs.

Good day. The year 2018 will be remembered for venture capitalists doubling down on their new way of doing things.

In the past the industry would make lots of small bets on early-stage companies. But in recent years VCs have gotten more selective and focused on bigger, but fewer, investments in older companies, with help from deeper-pocketed partners.

Whether they prove to be genius or folly, these five deals are emblematic of the year that was. Check out the list by WSJ Pro's Christopher Zinsli.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Decentralizing the gig economy: Freelancers make up a big part of the programming and design staff at tech projects these days. But the platforms for hiring them charge clients too much, says Adam Jackson, who previously co-founded Doctor on Demand, which has raised about $74 million from venture investors. His new blockchain-based startup, Freelance Labs, plans to take on larger freelance platforms such as Upwork and Gigster by charging no fee. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has the story.

Biotech buyout: Drug discovery startup 10x Genomics Inc. has acquired Spatial Transcriptomics AB, a Swedish startup that has developed technology to analyze how cells function in the context of entire tissue systems. Earlier this year, the company acquired epigenetics startup Epinomics Inc. No financial terms were disclosed for either deal. 10x Genomics has raised roughly $200 million from investors including Venrock, Foresite Capital and SoftBank Capital since it was founded in 2012. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

Chernova's Take: General Catalyst Deal Spurs Incentive Questions

By Yuliya Chernova

General Catalyst Partners' move to sell a stake in its management company to Goldman Sachs for about $200 million may be the first deal of its kind in the venture-capital industry and raises questions over the implications of such transactions.

Would such a deal be fair to the LPs? Was it a money grab in a hot market in which even first-time funds are charging high fees? Was it a recognition that a venture firm can be seen as an institution, a fee-generating asset manager with a significantly valuable brand, rather than a collection of individuals practicing a unique type of craft? Was it an example of how a firm can facilitate a management transition?

These are all questions that will likely gain more relevance. Goldman Sachs's Petershill unit, Neuberger Berman Group's Dyal Capital Partners and Blackstone Group LP are some of the firms that have used their money to invest in private-equity firm stakes, and some likely are eyeing venture capital as well.

Huawei s 5G ambitions threatened by US export ban

Chinese telecoms company less vulnerable than ZTE but would be slowed down

The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the founder of Huawei, in Vancouver this month raises the chance that the telecoms equipment maker could become a new victim in the trade war between the US and China.

This year, China s other big telecoms equipment company, ZTE, took a big hit when the US banned American companies from doing business with it, severely restricting its supply chain.

Huawei would be less vulnerable if it faced a similar restriction, but its continued reliance on US-made components, especially in semiconductor chips, means such an export ban would be a big setback for Huawei s ambitions to be a global leader in the next generation of 5G mobile communication.

 ZTE was much more dependent on US suppliers, particularly chip companies, than Huawei. The latter is in a better position because of its chip design unit, HiSilicon,  said Dan Wang, an analyst at Beijing research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.  Still, Huawei is heavily dependent on US technologies because many chips are irreplaceable and because US firms have a vast array of IP. 

Unlike ZTE, which sourced nearly all of its chips from US companies, Huawei employs more than 10,000 people at its HiSilicon R&D unit, which this year launched the Kirin 980, its first artificial intelligence-enabled mobile chip set.

But HiSilicon outsources the actual chipmaking to manufacturing giant TSMC, meaning a US export ban would put the Taiwanese company under more strain as Taiwanese businesses struggle to remain neutral in the US-China dispute.

Huawei also relies on Micron, a US chip company, to supply memory chips that go into its smartphones. Should a US export ban be imposed, Huawei could switch to source more from South Korean memory chip companies, such as existing supplier SK Hynix.

But other American-designed components are not replaceable in the short term. Intel processors power Huawei s personal computers, while Huawei s mobile handsets depend on radio frequency components from US based chipmakers Skyworks and Qorvo, according to Arete Research and Goldman Sachs.

Most importantly, a US export ban would delay Huawei s plan to roll out commercial standalone 5G service by next April.

 5G is a big technology strategy for China and Huawei is leading the charge, but they have a lot of hardware suppliers that are US-based in 5G that I suspect could derail their plans if any US supply ban is put in place,  said Brett Simpson, co-founder of Arete Research.

Especially crucial to Huawei s 5G ambitions is US chipmaker Broadcom, which provides networking processors that underpin telecoms networks. Huawei s 5G base stations, the signal processing centres that link together a mobile network, incorporate FPGAs, a type of semiconductor device, sourced from US-based Xilinx.

Meanwhile, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices, another American semiconductor firm specialising in signal processing, provide much of the analogue chips in 5G base stations.

Last week, the FT reported that the UK and Germany are growing wary of using Huawei technology in core 5G networks, while Japan, Australia and New Zealand have already joined the US in banning the Chinese company s gear. With Ms Meng s arrest, other 5G stakeholders are now worried there will be increasing bifurcation between 5G technology from Chinese and western companies.

 We will all just have to wait and see how this all plays out. Our world has been built on the success of international standards and it would be very sad to me if all this in any way derailed the future and split the paths of east and west,  said a foreign executive at a company developing 5G technology.

Huawei is a linchpin in Beijing s ambitions to be a global technological innovator by 2025 and Ms Meng's arrest has been largely read in China as a move from the US to further constrain Chinese technology from competing globally.

 Huawei is leading in 5G technology so the US panicked and wanted to suppress Huawei. If you want to condemn somebody, you can always trump up a charge,  said Ding Yifan, a senior researcher at National Strategy Institute, Tsinghua University.  But Huawei will not be as vulnerable as ZTE. They are better prepared. 

One senior international telecoms executive said that a move to ban Huawei from 5G contracts in certain countries would be unwelcome but  not the end of the world  despite delays to 5G launches.

But he said that if Ms Meng s arrest led to a ZTE-style  denial order  where networks cannot order components, upgrade existing software in the network or work with Huawei staff, the telecoms sector would be crippled.  That would be a small nuclear weapon,  he said.

Mifid II leads to global demand for transparency

European rules on the funding of investment research are changing behaviour globally in a shift that has consequences for fund houses, banks, brokers and investors.

Mifid II, introduced in January, requires European asset managers to separate the cost of research from trading commissions and transaction charges paid to banks and brokers, a process known as unbundling.

The reform was designed to improve investor protection by ensuring that asset managers  decisions could not be influenced by receiving research free.

More asset managers are implementing the European rules on research procurement across their worldwide operations in response to demands from investors for transparency.

A survey of 55 asset managers by Liquidnet, a trading venue, found that 53 per cent had already implemented European research unbundling standards as a global policy. A further 20 per cent planned to do so within five years.

 Research unbundling is going global. It is being led by investor demand as well as the practicalities of implementing [European] regulatory policy across different jurisdictions,  said Rebecca Healey, head of Emea market structure and strategy at Liquidnet.

AllianceBernstein, MFS and Baillie Gifford have all implemented research unbundling globally.

Others have tried to limit research unbundling to European operations, waiting to see any changes made by regulators outside Europe and by competitors in the US and Asia.

Even within Europe, however, the rules have not been implemented uniformly. Ms Healey said she expected the European Securities and Markets Authority, the regional regulator, to push for consistent application.

France s financial regulator, the Autorit des Marchs Financiers, called for a review in November due to concern that research coverage of smaller and mid-sized companies would suffer. Almost half of the managers surveyed by Liquidnet said research coverage of small and mid-sized companies had been affected.

Some observers fear that smaller companies could struggle to attract investment if research coverage shrinks.

Some brokers and independent research houses, especially in London, are struggling to adapt to the drop in revenue caused by the new regime. This has forced some to consider a merger or sale to larger rivals.

Concerns about inconsistency in the interpretation and application of Mifid II led the UK s Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, to review the rules on research procurement during the summer.

Price quotes from some big banks for the entirety of their published research output have fallen to between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, from six-figure costs that were mooted in 2017.

The FCA has warned that investment banks cannot offer  unduly favourable terms  for research in an effort to entice asset managers to direct trading orders to them.

Ms Healey said the business models of investment banks had to evolve as asset managers were increasingly looking for new sources of investment ideas from social media and big data to complement traditional fundamental financial analysis.

 Both the production and consumption of investment ideas is set for wholesale change,  she said.

*This article has been amended since publication to reflect the fact that Franklin Templeton's policy of unbundling research payments is limited to Europe following a clarification from the company.

Thematic ETFs Are the Rage Until They Fail; The funds focus on trade disputes, marijuana, AI and more, but many struggle to gain investor interest

These have been heady times for so-called thematic ETFs, as investors have flocked to these funds that give them exposure to niche markets.

But for many of those funds, these have also been difficult times.

Net inflows into thematic equity exchange-traded funds this year in the U.S. are estimated at $3.48 billion through Nov. 30, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. In Europe, net inflows into thematic ETFs for the first 11 months of this year are estimated at $2.41 billion. Last year, a net $7.62 billion flowed into these funds in the U.S. and $2.8 billion in Europe.

Many of these funds are designed for investors to capitalize on themes that were much in the news this year, including trade disputes, marijuana legalization and tech trends such as developments in artificial intelligence, blockchain and robotics.

Still, many thematic funds have starved for lack of investor interest. About 28% of thematic funds launched in the U.S. before 2012 have closed, along with almost 80% of such funds launched in Europe, says Kenneth Lamont, a passive-fund analyst at Morningstar.

"As we step away from time-weathered strategies such as core market-cap offerings, it is unsurprising that mortality rates rise," Mr. Lamont says.

"Thematic ETFs are especially prone to closing," he says. "They tend to offer niche exposures, which even if successful are suitable for only a small sliver of the investment universe." They also generally charge higher fees than more-mainstream ETFs, he adds. "The higher the fees, the greater the justification needed for investment."

More than 100 thematic ETFs have closed this year, across a broad range of themes. They include the ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF, the Republican Policies Fund and the Democratic Policies Fund, and AdvisorShares KIM Korea Equity ETF.

Notable survivors among thematic ETFs include ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ), the only ETF in the U.S. providing exposure to the cannabis industry. It pulled in about a net $760 million in the first 11 months of this year, despite uneven performance. Though it rallied between August and October, the fund ended November down 10% for the year.

Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) was one of the ETF darlings of 2017, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA. This year it remained an investor favorite, drawing net inflows of about $685 million through November, despite incurring a 17% decline in its share price in that period.

BOTZ's inflows are in contrast to a peer with higher fees but somewhat better results this year, Robo Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (ROBO), which declined 11% through November. ROBO had about $185 million of net outflows in the 11 months, Mr. Rosenbluth says.

Elsewhere on the tech front, blockchain ETFs were expected to be a hot item heading into this year, given the surge in bitcoin prices late last year, Mr. Rosenbluth says. "Indeed, four ETFs were launched within the first quarter, each offering a unique take on the new buzzword. However, demand has largely failed to materialize," he says. The leading asset gatherer of the quartet, Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) took in about a net $155 million in assets through November. Combined, the four new blockchain ETFs gathered a net $310 million in the 11 months.

Meanwhile, cybersecurity funds First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR) and ETFMG Prime Cyber Security (HACK) netted more than $600 million in new assets combined through November. CIBR whose fees are lower than its rival's drew more new money, at $338 million. But HACK was the better performer for the 11 months, gaining 16%, compared with CIBR's 10% climb.

Five years after quitting Nasdaq the technology group is to return to the public markets after a fierce fight over valuation

A company once valued at $18bn on the US stock market will come full circle on Tuesday when shareholders in a little-known listed entity called DVMT vote on whether to accept a reverse merger offer from Dell. If they say yes   and most observers expect them to   the computer company born in Michael Dell s dormitory room almost 40 years ago will return to the stock market after a five-year hiatus with a hotly disputed enterprise value of as much as $100bn.

Away from the glare of Wall Street, Mr Dell   who had become frustrated with the mutual funds and retail investors who dismissed his efforts to reinvent the company   celebrated the solitude of the private market, saying the company had  the freedom to invest in a future that lies beyond the next quarter . The deal was secured with the help of Silver Lake Partners, a prominent Silicon Valley-based private equity firm.

The business logic for relisting is clear. What was once a fading PC business has been transformed into a diversified technology group going head-to-head with the likes of IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco.

But Dell s route back to the public market has proved controversial, triggering an M&A brawl that pulled in activist investors including Carl Icahn, raised questions over private company valuations and led to accusations from some shareholders that Mr Dell and Silver Lake were playing hardball in the brutal talks around the DVMT deal to squeeze every cent they could get for themselves.

A spokesman for Mr Dell and Silver Lake said that they would not comment for this story in advance of Tuesday s shareholder vote.

Mr Dell and Silver Lake invested roughly $10bn in Dell, starting in 2013. Their combined stake of about 75 per cent is now worth more than $25bn. But some DVMT shareholders   including Mr Icahn, who has led opposition to the reverse merger, activist hedge fund Elliott Management, and the massive index investor BlackRock   successfully argued for improved terms for all shareholders.  Although they [Mr Dell and Silver Lake] got their pound of flesh,  says Mr Icahn,  if we hadn t been there, it would have been three [pounds]. 

The reverse merger leaves perhaps $10bn of extra value accruing to Mr Dell and Silver Lake from the public shareholders of DVMT. For some, the half-decade saga has confirmed that savvy private equity firms enjoy an advantage over public market investors.

US stock markets have experienced a sharp decline in IPO listings. While over the same period private equity firms such as Silver Lake have raised tens of billions of dollars to target entrepreneurs who have preferred to build shareholder value outside public markets before going to the market to crystallise their gains.

The question has become how public investors can grab a part of that pie.

 Private equity can buy up companies, fix operations and make them more nimble,  says Jill Fisch, a professor of corporate law at the University of Pennsylvania.  But for the public investors on the other side of leveraged buyouts, there is the risk of buyouts being opportunistically timed. 

The seeds for the Dell management buyout were planted in Hawaii. Mr Dell s vacation home is not far from that of Egon Durban, a brash dealmaker who joined Silver Lake at its launch in 1999. The buyout firm had made a name for itself after lucrative bets on companies such as Alibaba and Skype.

Mr Dell, who owned nearly a fifth of the company, spent $14bn on several software acquisitions in the years leading up to 2013 in an effort to turn Dell into a one-stop shop for corporate IT departments. Unfortunately, shareholders were unimpressed, sending Dell s shares down by nearly a third between 2010 and 2012.

By 2013, Mr Dell and Mr Durban struck a deal to take the company private at a price of $13.88 a share, a premium of more than 40 per cent. But shareholders were wary. Management buyouts, where chief executives have insights into the business that ordinary shareholders lack, are unpopular.

 MBOs should be removed from the corporate lexicon,  says Charles Elson, a governance expert at the University of Delaware.  The CEO is both a buyer and a seller in the transaction and is hopelessly conflicted. 

Investor unrest forced up the bid by a couple of per cent. Yet by the beginning of 2014, Dell was a private company and saddled with $18bn of debt   including $2bn borrowed from Microsoft.

In many ways Mr Dell and Silver Lake complemented one another. The founder was a tech fanatic with little interest in the intricacies of finance. With Silver Lake glued to the numbers, he could focus on strategy.

The buyout timing was also propitious. The Nasdaq index appreciated by nearly 20 per cent between the end of 2013 and the end of 2015. And though Dell did not have an official stock price, given its high leverage its private valuation would have been turbocharged.

Once private, it cut costs, tightened operations and offloaded divisions. But in 2015 Dell and Silver Lake had the chance for a game-changing acquisition.

EMC had become the dominant player in data storage. It had also become a hodgepodge of tech assets with units in software security and big data. However, its crown jewel was a subsidiary called VMware whose market value was $35bn. VMware had pioneered  virtualisation , the innovation where software applications do not have to reside on individual machines.

In September 2015, Dell announced it would buy EMC for $67bn, the biggest technology acquisition in history. Suddenly Dell had a complete set of products to sell to IT departments.

To pay for the deal Mr Dell and Silver Lake borrowed nearly $50bn. The pair, along with Temasek, Singapore s sovereign wealth fund, bought around $5bn in fresh equity in Dell*   paying $27.50 a share, twice the 2013 valuation. But to find the outstanding amount Dell had to be creative.

As it was private, the company could not issue stock to EMC s public shareholders. But VMware, EMC s prized asset, was public. So Mr Dell and Silver Lake offered EMC shareholders $24.05 a share in cash and a piece of a so-called  tracking stock  in VMware that was supposed to trade closely with VMware s market price. Evercore, the investment bank, projected that the DVMT tracking stock would be likely to trade within 10 per cent of VMware s valuation   making EMC shareholders happy to take it.

Joe Tucci, EMC chief executive, proclaimed:  This should be the highest quality tracker in the history of trackers 	. 	. 	. 	we would not have done this if we thought it was going to cost [investors] any economic pain whatsoever. 

For Silver Lake and Dell, the DVMT tracker would become both a windfall and an albatross. The discount to the standard VMware share ranged between 30 and 40 per cent rather than the 10 per cent that had been forecast between 2017 and the first half of 2018. The gap meant that of each dollar of value of VMware that EMC shareholders had sold to Dell, only 60 to 70 cents had accrued to them. One hedge fund that had supported the creation of DVMT would later denounce the structure as  highway robbery .

The tracker s investor base was largely comprised of hedge funds. And some wanted an opportunity to even the score with Mr Dell and Silver Lake.

By 2018, the extended bull market, particularly among tech stocks, made it a good time to take Dell public. Silver Lake would also at some stage need to harvest its gains and distribute them to its pension and endowment investors.

Dell had come to the conclusion that its best approach for going public was through a reverse merger where shareholders of the DVMT tracker would swap those shares for newly created stock in Dell that would then trade freely. A traditional IPO was ruled out because it could have taken more time and led to a lower valuation.

The talks with DVMT were handled by two of Dell s independent directors, David Dorman and William Green, former chief executives at AT&T and Accenture respectively. By July, the pair and Dell announced a deal.

But the backlash against it from DVMT shareholders exposed the inherent flaws of the tracker structure. The merger valued DVMT at $109 a share. DVMT started trading at around $45 in 2016 and so long-term investors stood to make a handsome return. However, $109 was still a 25 per cent discount to the VMware share price DVMT was supposed to be tracking.

The larger problem for DVMT shareholders was that the $109 felt illusory, 60 per cent of it was to come in the form of stock in the relisted Dell.

Yet there was no widely accepted valuation of the private Dell. Mr Dorman, Mr Green and the company had settled on a per-share valuation of Dell at $79.77, meaning each DVMT share would be swapped for 1.4 Dell shares. In 2016, at the time of the EMC deal, the private Dell shares had been valued at $27.50 each. By late 2017 and early 2018, Dell shares were being valued at between $33 and $49 each.

After the merger terms were announced, DVMT never approached its $109 value. Dissident shareholders worried that Mr Dell and Silver Lake had priced their company to minimise the portion of Dell they would have to hand to DVMT shareholders.

 That deal was dead on arrival,  says one large DVMT shareholder. But one person familiar with the talks says critics misunderstood the negotiating dynamic.  Dell could have done an IPO and forced a DVMT conversion at a far lower premium,  the person says.  The reverse merger was the least worst option. 

Mr Dorman and Mr Green declined to comment for this story.

Securities filings reveal that Dell initially tried to merge with VMware as a route to go public, but that the talks broke down after its board dismissed Dell s valuation of itself. Dell then moved on to the DVMT negotiation.

DVMT shareholders hated the maths of the July offer. But the steep market sell-off in the autumn created pressure for them to return to the negotiating table in October since a DVMT deal would ensure at least some profits for the year. A shareholder vote on the reverse merger was scheduled for December 11.

Behind the scenes Silver Lake and Mr Dell quietly assembled a group of DVMT shareholders   including Elliott, BlackRock and Dodge & Cox, a San Francisco-based asset manager   to hammer out a compromise. On November 14, Dell announced a revised DVMT reverse merger now worth $120 per DVMT share, up from $109 in July. Four key investors agreed to vote in favour of the recut deal. Several others told the FT this persuaded them to fall in line.

The shortcoming of the July deal became evident in the days after the revised November terms were announced. Based on where DVMT trades today, the implied value of Dell is just $47 a share, a far cry from the $79.77 the company and special committee had agreed to in July. Dell s implied equity valuation   $36bn   based on current trading of DVMT shares suggests that virtually all of Dell s value comes from its VMware stake and virtually none from its core business.

As for how the company is welcomed back to the market, memories of Mr Dell and Silver Lake s bare-knuckle tactics may linger. One hedge fund manager warns:  This reputation for profoundly aggressive behaviour, all for a one-time money grab, will haunt them. 

However, a second investor offers a different interpretation.  The deal will finally align the economic incentives of DVMT shareholders with those of Michael Dell and Silver Lake,  says Josh Wool, an investor at Carlson Capital, which has a large stake in DVMT.  It will be refreshing to finally all be in the same boat, and rise and fall together. 

*The story has been corrected to note that $5bn was paid by the entire buyout group

Negotiations: how the two sides agreed to determine Dell s value

The trickiest negotiation in corporate finance may involve valuing a private company. With no trading price, a buyer and seller may not even know where to start negotiating. One insight from Dell s return to the public markets is that finding such common ground may not be so necessary.

When Dell first proposed a reverse merger with its listed affiliate, DVMT, the PC maker valued its private shares at $79.77 each. At the $109 a share July offer price for DVMT, each share swapped would receive nearly 1.4 shares of the newly listed Dell.

Virtually all DVMT shareholders rejected that $79.77 as too high. The revised deal, on which there is a vote on Tuesday, states that there is no official share price for the soon-to-debut Dell. Instead, the exchange ratio will be determined by how DVMT trades over the 17-day period between November 28 to December 21.

The headline value of this new deal is $120 per share. DVMT shares will be swapped with new Dell ones at an exchange ratio falling between 1.5 and 1.81. If, however, DVMT trades below $120 because of shareholder scepticism of the original $79.77 Dell valuation, shareholders will get closer to 1.81 shares to cover any shortfall.

The precise ratios and decimal points on this  top-up  mechanism were hotly contested over a few frantic days of spreadsheet diplomacy spearheaded by Elliott Management according to multiple people involved. But it proved to be a far more popular solution to the Dell valuation problem than the two sides themselves having to pick a single number.

Exchange-traded funds focused on China have taken a pounding this year amid trade tensions and a cooling of the Chinese economy. Some fund managers, however, see the declines as a short-term blip, saying there are reasons for optimism about the investments.

China-focused ETFs offer U.S. investors exposure to various aspects of the Chinese economy, but almost all have struggled this year. Among the top-10 largest China-focused ETFs by assets under management, declines have ranged from almost 8% to about 37% this year through November.

In fact, only one China-focused ETF is up this year, according to Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, and that is the $3 million Global X China Energy ETF (CHIE), with a gain of 8.59% through November. Mr. Johnson attributes that to the relatively strong performance of the country's energy sector compared with the broader Chinese stock market.

The performance of China-focused ETFs "undeniably reflects what's happening in global trade discussions," says Luke Oliver, head of ETF Capital Markets, Americas, at DWS Group, which runs Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A ETF (ASHR), a $1.14 billion fund that is down about 25% year to date through November. China-focused ETFs initially got a boost when the U.S. and China announced a trade truce at the G-20 summit, Mr. Oliver says, but the funds gave back gains, as did the broader market, amid uncertainties over how the countries could work out several thorny issues within three months.

Trade, however, isn't the only factor affecting China-focused ETFs, according to Mr. Oliver, who points to the selloff in U.S. stocks in October that was felt around the globe, along with domestic factors in China.

Indeed, Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Research at State Street Global Advisors, says deteriorating trade relations with the U.S. have coincided with a slowing of the Chinese economy after years of skyrocketing growth. That, he says, is hurting growth expectations for many Chinese companies. The $971 million SPDR S&P China ETF (GXC) is down almost 13% this year through November.

Long-term opportunity?

Still, both Mr. Oliver and Mr. Bartolini are upbeat about China's prospects particularly if trade tensions ease. So is Chris Dhanraj, head of iShares investment strategy at BlackRock Inc., who says there are "large opportunities for investors in China." BlackRock runs a number of China-focused funds, including the two largest by assets under management: the $5.84 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI), which is down 7.76%, and the $3.79 billion iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI), down 13.21% through November.

Mr. Dhanraj points to Beijing's Made in China 2025 program which aims to make Chinese manufacturers a dominant force in high-end technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence as an example of a potential driver of growth in coming years.

"A huge part of the appeal for China ETFs is ease of access," Mr. Dhanraj says. "Global investors' ability to access China, and the long-term opportunity that it presents, is not changed by trade tensions."

This could be a strategic entry point for investors, says Jonathan Krane, founder and chief executive officer of KraneShares ETFs, a China specialist that operates a range of funds, notably the $1.77 billion KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), down almost 26% this year through November, after surging almost 70% in 2017. The market decline means that many Chinese companies are available at attractive valuations, he says. "The market has come down, but the fundamentals are still there," he says.

Small portion

China's growing technology market has attracted a number of new players, including the first China-specific ETF focused on blockchain technology. The $1.92 million Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy China ETF (BCNA), launched by Blockforce Capital, has fallen around 19.94% since its inception on June 20, according to Morningstar data. But Blockforce Capital CEO Eric Ervin remains bullish on the sector's future Chinese companies are leading the world in filing blockchain-related patents, he says and on China's economy at large.

"The market's reaction to the trade talk has been a little overdone," Mr. Ervin says. While a trade war won't affect many of the businesses in China's blockchain market, there still has been a significant fall in stock valuations, he says. "This is what investors live for an opportunity to take advantage of market inefficiencies."

U.S. investors should note that while China looms large in the global economy, it represents a small portion of the investible opportunity set, representing just over 3% of the value of the MSCI All-Country World Index, says Morningstar's Mr. Johnson. That means Chinese equities have a small place in a balanced portfolio. Still, in an increasingly interconnected world, strained China-U.S. relations are a serious concern, Mr. Johnson says, no matter where a company is based.

Gormley's Take: Biotech Pairing of Venture Fund, Children's Hospital Bears Fruit

By Brian Gormley

Rev1 Ventures and Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio are finding biotechnology success far from the life-science hubs on both coasts.

With policies tailored to less risky consumers, cost for the unhealthy and unfit could rise

This article is from today s FT Opinion email.Sign up to receive a daily digest of the big issues straight to your inbox.

Life insurance used to be a simple business. By pooling the longevity risk of individuals, insurance companies offered their customers peace of mind and financial security. But does that model work in an era in which life expectancy can vary dramatically depending on things like diet and exercise, and in which technology allows policies to be tailored to less risky consumers?

In his column this week, John Gapper argues that there is a difference between traditional forms of life insurance and bespoke personal life policies similar to private medical care or gym membership. Technology ensures that risk is being pooled less blindly than before.

What does this mean for the life insurance industry? One consequence could be that the cost of peace of mind for the unhealthy and unfit will rise steeply.

Janan Ganesh argues that the death of former US president George H W Bush is a reminder that direct experience of warfare was, for a generation of politicians, a pretty reliable inoculation against the temptations of ideology and extremism.

Roula Khalaf finds that defence ministers and policymakers around Europe are worrying about the effect that Brexit will have on UK-EU security co-operation.

Constanze Stelzenmueller suggests that Germany's defence of the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline has created a foreign policy trap of Berlin's own making.

David Zweig, a China specialist based in Hong Kong, writes that the worsening trade war between Washington and Beijing should be seen as a skirmish in a wider battle for global technological hegemony.

What you ve been saying

Parliament has already approved Brexit: letter from D R Myddelton, London, UK

It is sometimes suggested that there appears to be no parliamentary majority (in the House of Commons) for any course of action with respect to Brexit. But surely that is incorrect? Parliament has already voted in favour of the UK leaving the EU on March 29 2019, if necessary without a deal. The government should respect that decision.

In response to "Hype about artificial intelligence brings policy benefits" , obbby says:

People have such short memories  &this is, what, the fourth or fifth AI hype wave in the past half a century? Despite all of the investments, we are not a single step closer to truly intelligent machines. The only thing that has changed is the tricks our "AI" can do have improved.

There has to be a second referendum: letter from Richard Orders, The Peak, Hong Kong

Your editorial   Mrs May s Brexit deal deserves conditional support  pulls no punches in pointing to the mendacity and deceit of the Leave campaign. But surely if you believe the British people were sold Brexit on a false prospectus, your conclusion should be there has to be a second referendum.

London-based asset management consultancy MJ Hudson announced it had bought US data and analytics business Amaces.

The deal gives MJ Hudson, which has clients managing and advising more than $10tn in assets, its first presence in the US, in addition to existing operations in Zurich, Luxembourg and the Channel Islands. It also expands its asset management client base to more than 700 managers, pension funds and other firms. The deal comes as falling fees and the asset management industry's lacklustre performance increase pressure on managers to outsource operations. The terms of the Amaces deal were not disclosed.

Nasdaq jumps on non-traditional data wave with deal for provider Quandl

Nasdaq has bought one of the biggest "alternative data" platforms, highlighting rising investor interest in non-traditional information derived from satellite images, web-scraping and credit card purchases.

Nasdaq plans to combine Quandl with the "analytics hub" inside its global information services division   an example of how exchange groups are expanding their business away from traditional services such as listings and moving into fatter-margin areas such as market data and technology. The details of the deal were not disclosed.

Nasdaq's non-trading businesses now account for about three-quarters of revenues.

Adena Friedman, who took over as chief executive last year, has stepped up the charge and last year bought eVestment, another data provider.

Alternative data provide a new revenue stream at a time when exchanges' use of traditional trading data is under scrutiny. Investment groups, dealers, brokerages and traders are rebelling against the rising cost of trading feeds, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated concern over the rising prices charged by exchanges.

Quandl was founded in Toronto in 2012 and offers a wide variety of nontraditional digital data sets, such as that derived from corporate aircraft leases (used to predict M&A deals), emailed shopping receipts, car insurance or shipping sensors. There has been an explosion of alternative data providers to meet demand from hedge funds and traditional investment managers. The number of vendors tallied by AlternativeData.org, a trade body, has more than trebled over the past decade to 375. Industry insiders have long predicted that the industry would have to consolidate, with many asset managers frustrated at the disparate standards and annoyed at having to deal with lots of smaller companies rather than a few heavyweights. The sense is that Nasdaq's swoop on Quandl could trigger a wave of consolidation involving other big data companies, such as S&P Global, Bloomberg and Refinitiv.

London-based asset management consultancy MJ Hudson announced on Wednesday it had bought data and analytics firm Amaces.

The deal gives MJ Hudson, which has clients managing and advising more than $10tn in assets, its first presence in the US, in addition to existing operations in Zurich, Luxembourg and the Channel Islands.

It also expands the firm s asset management client base to more than 700 managers, pension funds and other firms.

The deal comes as falling fees and the asset management industry s lacklustre performance increase the pressure on managers to outsource operations.

Two years ago MJ Hudson, which had been focused on providing legal services to fund managers, announced a deal to buy investment consultant Allenbridge and fund services firm Tower Gate Capital.

The firms did not disclose the terms of the Amaces deal.

Mack's Take: Is Amazon's Health-Care Software a Threat or Opportunity for Startups? Data startups face hurdles in marketplace but could benefit from tech giant's new health data-mining tools

Amazon.com Inc. often gets blamed for putting lots of other companies out of business.

But one of its newest products may just be the medicine that health data-driven startups need to thrive.

The company now is selling software that can analyze various types of digital health data stored in multiple record-keeping formats. It aims to identify the most relevant points, then structure them into a single, usable form.

That's a big lift to startups that specialize in helping health-care providers with planning and other decision making, said Bessemer Venture Partners' Steve Kraus.

Amazon's technology could play a crucial intermediary role that had been missing until now. Health companies have had to cobble together cumbersome data such as insurance claims, medication information and doctors' notes, and then distill meaning from each before figuring out what to do with it.

"Amazon is taking information and translating it into insight. Startups are taking insight and translating it into action," said Mr. Kraus. "If you are a company providing that last-mile service of better quality care at lower costs, speeding up the time to insight really helps."

Bright Health Management Inc., an insurance startup in Bessemer's portfolio, could sharply cut the time it takes to analyze patient data and claims data when recommending follow-up visits or specialist services, Mr. Kraus said.

Other companies that could benefit include Bessemer-backed Qventus Inc., which organizes hospital workflows based on staffing and patient needs; and GV-backed Science 37 Inc., which makes of software that helps researchers to conduct studies and clinical trials remotely.

Given the complications of collating reams of health-care data and then structuring them into the same format, companies in general have relied on a series of workarounds to obtain usable data. This could mean a lot of manual data entry, or using corporate middleware that may only be able extract a narrow set of data points.

Farzad Mostashari, the chief exectuve of Aledade Inc., a company that helps coordinate care between primary-care physicians, hospitals and insurers, agreed Amazon's new tool is a win.

"Folks spend a lot of time trying to get to structured data as a starting point," said Dr. Mostashari, who previously worked on health-care information-technology issues in the Obama administration. "Having that part out of the way with an [Amazon Web] service, like all other industries have, is a huge relief."

There are plenty of hurdles for innovating with digital health-care data. Electronic health-record vendors like Epic Systems Corp. and Cerner Corp. are large and complex to work with, and typically have multiple software versions running within a single clinic. Some startups such as Health Catalyst and Lexigram Inc. provide data extraction and analysis services, but don't have the reach of Amazon.

Although Amazon could pose a threat to some of these players, Mr. Kraus of Bessemer said some of them hold an advantage in providing specialized services or proprietary data specific to a patient population. Amazon, however, commands unmatched power of natural-language processing and storage capacity.

Technical and regulatory roadblocks also have posed challenges to Amazon's big tech peers Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit both shut down their health-records programs. Meanwhile, Apple Inc. is the closest to making this a reality. In January, Apple launched a health data-sharing platform and is now exploring working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop software that would allow veterans to transfer electronic health records to iPhones. But its offering is limited in that it offers no insights from the data.

That was the very margin of opportunity seized by Amazon and could be the most useful to startups. Of course, how successful startups can be with the new tool depends on what Amazon builds in the future.

"Best-case scenario, it could help a lot of people downstream by getting them the data they need to create new products that help physicians," Dr. Mostashari said. "Unless Amazon wants to take that part too."

Business News: Chinese Sell $1 Billion of U.S. Real Estate

By Esther Fung

Chinese investors unloaded more than $1 billion in U.S. real estate in the third quarter, extending their recent retreat from hotels, office buildings and other foreign property under pressure from Beijing to reduce debt and curb money sent abroad.

Insurers, conglomerates and other big investors from China sold $1.05 billion of U.S. real estate in the third quarter, while purchasing $231 million of property, according to Real Capital Analytics.

That was the second straight quarter in which Chinese were net sellers of U.S. commercial real estate. The second quarter marked the first time these investors sold more U.S. property than they bought during a quarter since 2008.

Chinese investors have spent tens of billions of dollars over the past five years to acquire U.S. real estate or land, favoring major metro areas like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. Chinese buyers sometimes paid record prices to win trophy assets, punctuated by Anbang Insurance Group's $1.95 billion acquisition of New York's Waldorf Astoria in 2015 -- the highest price ever for a U.S. hotel.

While Chinese buyers never represented more than a fraction of the buying power in any U.S. market, these companies often made headlines with the steep prices they were willing to pay, which helped push values higher in certain segments of the market.

But rising corporate debt levels and concern over currency stability led the Chinese government to tighten capital outflows and clamp down on their companies' overseas acquisitions. Chinese investors scaled back their purchases and unloaded foreign assets.

More recently, trade tension between Beijing and Washington, D.C., has sparked additional selling, even though many Chinese are still interested in overseas projects, and the two governments reached a tentative truce this weekend.

"This has to do more with a change in how capital is permitted to behave rather than Chinese investors saying 'I don't like the U.S.'," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics.

Ping An Insurance Group Co. of China and partners in August sold a 13-story Boston office building for $450 million, the largest sale by a Chinese investor during the third quarter, Real Capital Analytics said. Its U.S. partner Tishman Speyer said it was the one that drove the decision to sell the building.

China's retreat showed signs of continuing in the fourth quarter. Dalian Wanda Group sold a development site in Beverly Hills, Calif., last month for more than $420 million. The Chinese conglomerate purchased the eight-acre parcel in 2014 for $420 million and had planned to develop luxury condominiums and a boutique hotel on the site, but feuds with a local union and contractors stalled progress.

Anbang recently engaged Bank of America Corp. to help it sell a portfolio of luxury hotels that it acquired two years ago for $5.5 billion, though the Waldorf isn't part of that sale, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Some analysts suggest Chinese selling may ease in the months ahead. "I do not think it will be a tidal wave of sales," said Jerome Sanzo, managing director and head of U.S. Real Estate Finance for Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. "Some of them are not able to move forward for various reasons and will take gains now while waiting for future changes."

Not all Chinese are staying away. Shopping-center landlord Site Centers Corp. said last week it sold an 80% stake in 10 shopping centers to two unnamed Chinese institutions that valued the property portfolio at around $607 million. Site Centers will retain a 20% stake in these shopping centers, which are located in places like Raleigh, N.C. and Phoenix.

The deal stood in contrast to the expensive trophy properties in big coastal cities that have attracted Chinese money in past years.

Good day. Wall Street is losing its cool.

That's the overwhelming sentiment after the Dow tumbled some 800 points in a performance that once again stokes fear of a descent into bear-market territory and a ripple effect through the economy.

It's far from clear whether a lasting peace will come to the U.S.-China trade tussle, which was the apparent issue grating on investor nerves this week. But ongoing turmoil in the public markets is forcing investors in the private markets to reassess a host of strategies for the year ahead, from fundraising to exits. Fasten your seatbelts.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Banker bounced: Moderna Inc., which is set to have the largest U.S. biotech IPO later this month, has dropped an underwriter from the deal, citing "unauthorized communications" about the offering. Moderna didn't reveal the name of the bank or the nature of the communications in question, but only one of the 11 underwriters listed on Moderna's November S-1 filing was missing from the new filing Tuesday: Bryan Garnier & Co., a European investment bank. Moderna and Bryan Garnier representatives weren't immediately available for comment. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Big baby step: What's the price of a good night's sleep when you have a newborn? About $1,200, according to parents who bought the robotic bassinet called Snoo. Two years after launching the high-tech baby bed, Happiest Baby Inc. has sold some 25,000 units. With $23 million in fresh financing, the company plans to expand sales internationally and extend the rental program directly to all consumers. Greycroft Partners led the Series B round, with participation from GV, Sallfort PrivatBank AG and others. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the scoop.

Geron's Take: Why Lead Seed Rounds When You Can Follow?

By Tomio Geron

More new seed funds are being raised, but many founders will tell you it's still quite hard to raise a seed round.

One reason why: A relatively small number of seed firms actually lead rounds. Until a lead investor steps up to anchor a round, many other seed investors won't sign on to a deal.

According to an analysis by Rob Go, a co-founder and partner at NextView Ventures, out of about 600 seed firms, only about 100 have led at least two seed deals over the past two years. And out of those 100, only about 50 of them have done a deal in more than one metro area. In other words, half are regional investors focusing on their own area. Of the 50 remaining firms that invest outside their own region, 30 were based in the San Francisco area.

More in Geron's Take.

Exits

Nasdaq acquired Quandl Inc., a provider of alternative and core financial data. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Toronto-based Quandl had raised more than $17 million in funding from investors including Nexus Venture Partners and August Capital.

MapAnything Inc., which offers a mapping and real-time location intelligence app to Salesforce users, acquired TerrAlign Group for an undisclosed sum. TerrAlign's sales resource optimization and revenue-based territory design technology will be integrated into MapAnything's platform. Last month, MapAnything, of Charlotte, N.C., closed a $42.5 million Series C round from investors including GM Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Greycroft Partners and Harbert Growth Partners.

CommonBond, a student loan company for millennials, purchased NextGenVest, which provides financial advice to Generation Z. Terms weren't disclosed. New York-based CommonBond has secured roughly $130 million to date from investors including Alumni Ventures Group, Fifth Third Capital Holdings, August Capital, Social Capital and Nyca Partners.

VC Funds

Salesforce Ventures has launched the Japan Trailblazer Fund, a new $100 million fund for investments in Japanese startups working in the Salesforce ecosystem.

Harlem Capital Partners has raised $2 million toward a potential $25 million fund, according to a regulatory filing. The New York-based firm makes early-stage investments in minority- and women-owned startups in the U.S. Harlem's portfolio includes on-demand device support provider Fixt, cruelty-free cosmetics brand Beauty Bakerie and African-American millennial media site Blavity.

Vagaro Raises $63 Million Growth-Equity Round Led by FTV Capital

FTV Capital is delving into the beauty-and-wellness space with its latest investment.

The financial technology-focused firm led a $63 million growth-equity round in Vagaro Inc., which operates a cloud-based platform used by businesses in the salon, spa and fitness industries.

The Dublin, Calif., company helps clients book hair, massage, nail, spa, makeup and tanning appointments through its online marketplace. Vagaro recently added a fitness section to its offerings, said Fred Helou, the company's chief executive.

Some 34,000 businesses in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Australia use Vagaro's online platform, paying a monthly subscription fee to list their services on Vagaro's website and mobile apps. Mr. Helou said.

The investment led by FTV is Vagaro's first institutional capital after being funded by angel investors since the company's inception in 1999, he added.

The latest round of capital has been earmarked to help Vagaro expand its sales team and increase its marketing efforts, especially in the fitness industry. Mr. Helou said the company is focused on adding partners that can facilitate credit-card processing in Canada, Europe and Australia. The company already has payment-processing capabilities in the U.S.

Robert Anderson, a partner at FTV, said the firm has been interested in vertical software within the expanding health-and-wellness market. He added the vendor landscape in the space is "very fragmented."

The investment is FTV's latest from its $850 million fifth fund, FTV V LP, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftv-capital-raises-850-million-for-latest-fund-1474887601?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7".

The firm, with offices in San Francisco and New York, in September provided a $30 million growth investment in Rapid Ratings International Inc., a financial health analytics company. Fellow private-equity firm LLR Partners remains a shareholder in the company.

Exchange group diversifies as price of traditional trading feeds comes under fire

Nasdaq has acquired one of the biggest  alternative data  platforms, highlighting the swelling investor interest in non-traditional information from satellite images, web-scraping and credit card purchases and potentially presaging a burst of consolidation in the fragmented industry.

Nasdaq, whose most famous business is its stock exchange, plans to combine the newly acquired Quandl with the  analytics hub  inside the Nasdaq global information services division   another example of how exchange groups are expanding their business away from traditional services such as listings and moving into fatter-margin, fast-growing areas such as market data and technology.

Nasdaq s non-trading businesses now account for about three-quarters of its revenues. Chief executive Adena Friedman, who took over last year, has stepped up the charge and last year bought eVestment, another data provider.

Alternative data provide a new revenue stream at a time when exchanges  use of traditional trading data is under scrutiny. Investment groups, dealers, brokerages and high-frequency traders are rebelling against the rising cost of trading feeds, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated some concern over the rising prices charged by exchanges.

Quandl was founded in Toronto in 2012, and offers a wide variety of non-traditional digital data sets, such as that derived from corporate aircraft leases   used to predict M&A deals   emailed shopping receipts, auto insurance or shipping sensors.

 Quandl will allow Nasdaq to partner more closely with the investing community as the industry continuously seeks ways to evaluate an endless supply of information to drive new insights, investment ideas and deliver alpha,  Bjorn Sibbern, head of Nasdaq s global information services unit, said in a statement on Tuesday.

There has been an explosion of alternative data providers popping up to meet the rising demand from hedge funds and traditional investment managers. The number of vendors tallied by AlternativeData.org, a trade body, has more than trebled over the past decade to 375.

Industry insiders have long predicted that the embryonic industry will have to consolidate, with many asset managers frustrated at the disparate standards and annoyed at having to deal with lots of smaller players, rather than a few big heavyweights.

The expectation is that big data companies such as Nasdaq, S&P Global, Bloomberg or Refinitiv will play a role in consolidating the Balkanised alternative data industry.

Terms of the Quandl acquisition were not disclosed.

Good day. Stock markets rallied last week when many investors thought Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled a shift in the interest-rate outlook, but the full context of his remarks didn't explicitly reveal such a change, writes The Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos. Still, President Trump was a fan of the Fed chief's speech, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Powell's congressional testimony on the economic outlook scheduled for Wednesday was canceled as ceremonies honoring former President George H.W. Bush will take place that day. Meanwhile, the Fed's Randal Quarles defended the central bank's monetary policy.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Analysis: Powell Didn't Say His View of Neutral Rates Had Changed

Markets soared last week after Jerome Powell signaled fresh flexibility in how the central bank sets interest rates in an economy facing uncertain crosscurrents over the next year. But Mr. Powell "https://www.wsj.com/articles/analysis-powell-did-not-say-his-view-of-neutral-rates-had-changed-1543855683" policy makers' economic outlook had changed, which would justify a downshift in the central bank's policy path.

Powell Testimony Canceled Due to President Bush Ceremonies

Jerome Powell's congressional testimony on the economic outlook "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-chairman-testimony-postponed-due-to-ceremonies-for-late-president-bush-1543853821" after lawmakers were unable to reschedule the hearing due to a conflict with ceremonies honoring the late former President George H.W. Bush. Mr. Powell had been set to testify Wednesday. But that was before President Trump declared Wednesday a national day of mourning for Mr. Bush, who died Friday at the age of 94.

Powell: Not All Have Benefited From Strong Economy

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank has made progress in helping promote economic strength and financial stability, but is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerome-powell-says-fed-has-made-progress-in-promoting-a-strong-economy-but-not-all-have-benefited-1543878075" several remaining challenges. Mr. Powell emphasized that a booming economy including a historically low unemployment rate and robust consumer spending isn't felt by all Americans. The economic data tend to "mask important disparities by income, race, and geography," he said at an event honoring former Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and the Fed's community development staff.

Quarles: Economy Shows Fed Is Doing A Good Job With Monetary Policy

Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-quarles-economy-shows-fed-is-doing-a-good-job-with-monetary-policy-1543849343" of the central bank's monetary policy choices and plans and said key remarks from the Fed's leader last week didn't signal a shift in the interest-rate outlook. "The data show we are doing a pretty good job" of meeting the employment and inflation goals laid out by Congress, Mr. Quarles said as part of an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations.

U.S. Economic Outlook Is Solid, Says Fed's Clarida

The economic outlook for the U.S. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economic-outlook-is-solid-says-feds-clarida-1543841104" and the Fed's main goal right now is to sustain maximum unemployment and low inflation for as long as possible, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said. "Right now I think the U.S. economy is in good shape, and we can talk about risky scenarios, but I think the baseline outlook is very solid," Mr. Clarida said in an interview on Bloomberg's television channel.

Brainard: Fed Close to Finalizing Deal on Treasury Market Data Collection

The Fed is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brainard-fed-close-to-finalizing-deal-on-treasury-market-data-collection-1543851220" an agreement to start collecting Treasury market data from banks, Fed governor Lael Brainard said. She also said the Fed plans to propose a rule to collect data on mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Regulators Look More Closely at CLO Boom

By Ryan Tracy and Lalita Clozel

WASHINGTON A pair of senior U.S. regulators say they "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-clos-boom-fed-doesnt-yet-see-major-risks-quarles-says-1543850641?tesla=y" banks' exposure to risky corporate debt, but stopped short of sounding alarm bells about a lending boom.

Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve's vice chairman for supervision, said Monday the Fed is analyzing banks' exposure to collateralized loan obligations amid record issuance of the securities made up of loans, including leveraged loans to highly indebted companies.

"The best information we have is that they are not evolving in a way that would be a particular problem," Mr. Quarles said of CLOs, though he added that banks' exposure to the market is "something that we are trying to get a handle on and be vigilant about."

Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting separately said that while he had not seen "significant default" in leveraged loans, banks could be indirectly putting themselves at risk by lending to private equity or debt funds that are exposed to the loans.

"We feel comfortable in their underwriting," Mr. Otting said in a phone call with reporters. But "there's an indirect way that banks can enter into that space." Mr. Otting was speaking about his office's twice-annual report on risks facing the banking sector, which was released on Monday.

That report included a new section on leveraged lending, warning about weakening underwriting standards and a potential reversal in market conditions that could make it harder for borrowers to stay afloat. While leveraged lending doesn't currently present a "systemic" risk, banks should be wary of a "contagious impact" on companies they are lending to, said Mr. Otting.

Still, the two Trump-appointed officials appear to be less worried about leveraged-lending risk than their predecessors, who several years ago were wrestling with banks over underwriting standards.

Banks often sell leveraged loans to CLOs, which in turn are owned by investors such as hedge funds and pension funds. Issuance of CLOs has been setting records this year.

Mr. Quarles, speaking at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Fed has noted increased volume of leveraged lending and loosening underwriting standards a worry other Fed officials have raised publicly.

But he said he doesn't see those trends as a direct risk to U.S. banks currently because "they are not keeping those loans on their books" and are instead offloading them to other investors, principally CLOs. As vice chair for supervision, Mr. Quarles is the top Fed official in charge of the oversight of big U.S. banks.

He said the Fed also needs to pay attention to whether the lending boom poses broader risks to financial stability, including outside the banking system where the Fed has less regulatory authority.

CLOs, he said, weren't major contributors to the 2008 crisis and don't appear to pose the same risks as other complex financial products because they have longer-term liabilities, making them less susceptible to a banklike "run."

"We need to continue to focus on whether that continues to be the case," Mr. Quarles said.

Pressed on whether CLOs are increasingly held by mutual funds, which can face large daily investor redemptions, he said he saw such funds holding more but "I don't think that it is yet a dispositive or overly concerning increase."

He also said the Fed is in the middle of analyzing whether banks have a "back door" exposure to the market for instance by being holders of CLOs themselves.

The regulators' measured concern about the market comes as it is generating more scrutiny in Washington.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) flagged rising risk in CLOs and the loans they buy in a letter sent mid-November to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other regulators. Ms. Warren specifically asked Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton in the letter whether credit ratings of CLOs accurately reflect their risk and whether recent deterioration of investor protections, or covenants, in leveraged loans are being adequately incorporated in the ratings.

When Ms. Warren pressed Mr. Quarles on leveraged lending at a Nov. 15 hearing, Mr. Quarles said the Fed is looking at the issue "quite athletically." The Fed issued a financial-stability report last week that flagged increased CLO issuance, though it didn't recommend any specific policy action.

U.S. Encourages Banks to Innovate in Anti-Money-Laundering Compliance

By Samuel Rubenfeld

Banks that find problems with legacy compliance programs when testing new technology "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-encourages-banks-to-innovate-in-anti-money-laundering-compliance-1543878973?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" for prior failures, U.S. regulators said Monday.

The pledge, in a statement from multiple U.S. regulatory agencies, comes as authorities encourage lenders to try out new technology and intelligence-gathering methods as they combat evolving illicit-finance threats.

"Private sector innovation, including new ways of using existing tools or by adopting new technologies, can be an important element in safeguarding the financial system against an evolving array of threats," Sigal Mandelker, the U.S. Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told lawyers and compliance officers Monday during a speech in Oxon Hill, Md., at a financial crimes enforcement conference hosted by the American Bankers Association and the American Bar Association.

The statement from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the National Credit Union Administration nudges banks toward adopting new forms of technology, such as artificial intelligence, while recognizing that some of the new methods may be unsuccessful.

The agencies also acknowledged testing new technology could identify vulnerabilities the banks may not have previously understood. They assured financial institutions that such an incident wouldn't always lead to a penalty, but would depend on the adequacy of the bank's existing compliance program.

"Pilot programs that expose gaps in [an anti-money-laundering] compliance program will not necessarily result in supervisory action with respect to that program," the statement said.

The agencies used the example of a bank testing artificial intelligence-based transaction monitoring systems. If the bank were to identify suspicious activity that would not otherwise have been identified under existing processes, the agencies said they would not automatically assume the banks' existing processes are deficient.

"Agencies will assess the adequacy of banks' existing suspicious activity monitoring processes independent of the results of the pilot program," the statement said.

Moreover, implementing innovative approaches to anti-money-laundering compliance programs may not result in additional regulatory expectations.

"We want to make sure banks are not deterred from testing innovative ideas out of a concern that they will draw regulatory criticism," Ms. Mandelker said.

The agencies created a working group to strengthen and harmonize money-laundering defenses across the U.S. financial system, she said. The agencies issued a statement in October in which they said community banks and credit unions could pool compliance resources.

Regulators will continue to engage with the private sector on innovation, the statement said. Early engagement can promote better understanding by the agencies and it can provide a means to discuss compliance and risk-management expectations, the statement added.

Judge Dismisses Market-Manipulation Case Against Don Wilson Jr., DRW

By Alexander Osipovich and Gabriel T. Rubin

A federal judge "https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-dismisses-market-manipulation-case-against-don-wilson-jr-drw-1543858721?tesla=y"Donald Wilson Jr., founder and chief executive of proprietary trading firm DRW Investments LLC, in a showdown with U.S. regulators over whether Mr. Wilson's firm had engaged in market manipulation.

The verdict by U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan was a blow to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which sued Mr. Wilson and his firm in November 2013.

"It is not illegal to be smarter than your counterparties in a swap transaction," Judge Sullivan wrote in his verdict.

The CFTC said it was reviewing the decision and considering its next steps. The decision calls into question its handling of market-manipulation cases and could embolden more defendants to go to trial rather than settling with the agency.

"Although the industry is interested in the CFTC having the necessary authority to effectively police markets, they are also interested in the boundaries of that authority," said Jim Overdahl, a partner at Delta Strategy Group and former CFTC chief economist. "This case is an important data point in defining those boundaries."

Mr. Wilson, a prominent Chicago trader whose firm employs more than 900 people around the world, had been defiant throughout his standoff with the CFTC. He took the unusual step of filing a pre-emptive lawsuit against the CFTC in September 2013, in an unsuccessful bid to block the regulators from filing their own lawsuit.

"We are gratified by the court's decision, which confirms our long held position that our trading activity was lawful, legitimate and in line with market regulation," DRW said in a written statement.

Lawyers for DRW and the CFTC clashed in court in December 2016, during a four-day trial that delved into the arcane world of derivatives. Judge Sullivan grilled Mr. Wilson over an email in which a DRW trader had called the company on the losing side of a big trade "suckers." He also was scathing toward the CFTC, at one point accusing its lawyers of making a "nonsensical" argument.

Such courtroom battles are rare because most defendants accused by the government of manipulation settle without going to trial. When defendants put up a fight, the CFTC has a mixed record of winning in court.

The CFTC's allegations against Mr. Wilson and his firm stem from a big trade in interest-rate swap futures that DRW carried out in 2010 and 2011. The contracts allow firms to bet on or protect against future swings in interest rates.

DRW bought more than $350 million of the futures, anticipating that the position would grow in value, according to a lawsuit filed by the CFTC in 2013. When the underlying rates for the contracts failed to rise, the firm began placing bids in a 15-minute settlement window used to determine the contract's closing value at the end of the day.

The CFTC alleged that the bidding tactic amounted to "banging the close" an illegal practice in which a trader places buy or sell orders heavily at the end of the day to influence the daily closing price and benefit from an even larger position in a related derivatives market. By using the tactic, DRW and its founder earned nearly $13 million in profits, the CFTC alleged in a court filing.

DRW acknowledged placing bids in the settlement window, but it described them as a lawful strategy that benefited the markets. The firm said its bids helped fix a mispricing in a contract that few other companies were trading.

The court found no evidence that DRW had ever "made a bid it thought could not be accepted by a counterparty" or that their bidding practices had ever scared off other market participants.

China Unifies Law Enforcement in Bond Markets: Regulators

By Grace Zhu

Dow Jones Newswires

BEIJING Chinese regulators said Monday they would unify law enforcement of bond issuers under the securities regulator, the latest effort to streamline regulation of a fragmented domestic bond market.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission will be in charge of enforcing laws and regulations in the country's bond market, said the People's Bank of China on Monday in a statement jointly issued with the securities regulator and the economic planner.

China's debt issuance and bond markets are regulated by three watchdogs. The central bank looks after the interbank bond market, while the CSRC supervises the stock-exchange bond market. The National Development and Reform Commission, the economic planner, approves bonds of state-owned enterprises.

The PBOC and the NDRC will support the CSRC's role in enforcing laws and regulations by offering suggestions, evidence and expertise, while maintaining other regulatory roles in supervising the debt issuance, the statement said.

The latest move comes after China's regulators vowed to address regulatory arbitrage made possible by different standards required for different debt issuance.

REDEMPTIONS The $3.31tn investment sector has been blown off course, with Europe especially badly hit, write Jennifer Thompsonand Laurence Fletcher

Buoyed by growing interest from institutional investors, 2018 was supposed to be the comeback year for hedge funds. It has not worked out that way. Stalling global equity markets, compounded by sharp sell-offs in February and October, have thrown the $3.31tn sector off course.

Investors pulled a net $10.1bn fromhedge funds in the year to October, according to eVestment, the data provider.

European-domiciled groups have been hit particularly badly, with net outflows of $12.8bn over the ten months, down from net inflows of $28.9bn last year. By contrast, the Americas have had net inflows of $3.86bn and Asia net outflows of $650m.

The reasons for this are opaque, says Peter Laurelli, eVestment's head of research, though lower returns have probablyplayeda part.

The average return for Europeandomiciled funds for the ten months was -3.7 per cent compared with -2.6 per cent globally. Continental funds fared worst, returning -4.82 per cent, while theUKwas-3.12 per cent.

October was an especially bad month but there have been redemptions across various strategies for the year as a whole. Despite a surge in interest in quantitative managers, many "commodity trading advisers"   computer-driven trend-following funds havehadabadyear.

There have been bright spots too.

Some macro funds, which bet on the global economy via interest rates, currencies and bonds, have performed well due to volatility in emerging markets and the rising USdollar.

Discretionary funds have also done well, offering succour to more active managers.

"It is interesting thatwe've seen the more discretionary focused managers do better in this environment," MrLaurelli says.

Themonth-to-monthperformance of individual groups has been almost as choppy as the market. With a few weeksleft till theendof theyear there is time to recover. .. or flounder.

FTfm takes a close look at the mixed performance of five of Europe's biggesthedgefundnames.

BrevanHoward AUM$6.8bn Among the world's best-known but most secretive macro hedge funds, Brevan delivered one of the surprises of theyear.

The firm was once considered the gold standard among hedge funds. Itbecameamust-have fund following gains of 20 per cent in its main fund during the 2008 financial crisis and, before 2014, ithada record ofmaking money every year. All this propelled assets to about$40bn.

In recent years, however, its fortunes turned.

A move by traders, including cofounder Alan Howard, toGeneva was seen as a mis-step. It also lost star manager Chris Rokos. The firm chalked up three calendar years of losses between 2014 and 2017. Assets have dropped to just $6.8bn as clients fled. Brevan entered 2018 in bad shape. This meant that its table-topping performance came as a surprise. One driver has been a particularly well-timed bet on Italian bond spreads widening. Mr Howard's style is to place bets on sharpmarket dislocations, which can mean his portfolios do little for a long time before suddenly reaping huge gains. This proved the ideal way to profit from the turmoil inMay, when Italian twoyearbondssuffered their worstdayin decades.

Brevan's main fund is up by a net 12.3 per cent this year, said a person who has seen the numbers, while a punchier fund run personally byMr Howardhasmademuchbigger gains.

A spokesman for Brevan declined tocomment.

LansdownePartners AUM$20bn For one of the world's biggest and most successful equity hedge funds, a poor 2018 caps a disappointing run of performance. The flagship fund at Lansdowne, which runs about $20bn in assets, is its Developed Markets fund, run by Peter Davies bestman at former Chancellor George Osborne's wedding   and Jonathon Regis.

So far this year the fund has lost a net 5.6 per cent, much of which came in October's market sell-off. Only two years ago it suffered a loss of about 15 per cent, losingmoneyonpositions in UK stocks and on bets taken against commodity stocks. It gained almost 10 per cent last year, although fund managers viewed that as a disappointing result, said a person familiar with the matter.

"Returns are clearly disappointing," the managers wrote in a letter to clients last month, reviewed by the Financial Times, referring to a small loss suffered in the first nine months. "There is no doubt our level of frustration is probably as high as we can recall. To some degree this frustration is undoubtedly amplified by the proximity of the period to ourUK-inducedproblemsin2016."

MessrsDaviesandRegis'sapproach is to do fundamental analysis and take large, long-term positions in stocks. That, though, can leave you exposed in the shorter-term. Lloyds Banking Group, for instance, a longterm holding that the managers think will benefit as it increases payouts to shareholders, is downby about 17 per cent thisyear.

The Lansdowne Princay fund, a smaller fund launched as a vehicle for former BlueCrest fund managerSamuel Joab, has fared even worse, falling a net10.4per cent thisyear.

Lansdownedeclined tocomment.

ManGroup AUM $114.1bn The overarching industry narrative of more actively managed strategies making returns while quantitative funds suffer has played out at Man, the world's largest publicly traded hedgefundgroup.

Strategies in AHL andNumeric, its computer-driven trading units that use algorithms to make investment decisions, generally did poorly. The worst performer for the nine months to September was the Numeric Emerging Markets Core strategy which was down 8.7 per cent on a net basis.Thestar was theGLGContinental European Growth Fund, part of the group's discretionary trading unit, which has had a year-to-date return of 7.5per cent net.

Assets at Man, which is led by Luke Ellis, rose to a record $114.1bn in the third quarter but the London-listed company's share price isdownalmost 30 per cent since the start of the year. Analysts are split over the outlook. "Despite a somewhat dull period, we continue to believe that Man. .. operates a superior business model," said PaulMcGinnis atShore Capital.

Yet there are "many short to medium-term uncertainties at Man, including inconsistent performance/performance fees, volatile flows and fee margin pressure", according to DavidMcCann, analyst atNumis.

Mandeclined tocomment.

MarshallWace AUM$39bn 2018 was neither stellar nor catastrophic for MarshallWace,oneof the UK's biggest hedge funds, with the performance of the $39bn group broadlyflat.

The flagship $17bn fund MW Eureka, overseenbychief investment officer Paul Marshall, who cofounded the group alongside Ian Wace, is up 1.7 per cent in the year to date although it was down 3.9 per cent net in October.MWEureka allocates to both Tops, the strategy that uses algorithms to trade on investmentbank recommendations, aswell asfundamentalstrategies.

Its best-performing strategy was the $1.3bn fundamental Japan Market Neutral equity long-short strategy, which was up 8.3 per cent net in the ten months to the end of October, according to a person who has seen the numbers. This strategy is run by Rod Rehnborg, a Hong Kong-based manager who has penned a guide on the basics of investing for Goop, the lifestyle shopping site founded by Gwyneth Paltrow. "There are no easy answers, although a mix of stocks, hedge funds and vegetable gardens seemssensible tome,"hewrote.

The group recently bulked up its operations in Dublin ahead of Brexit and in June established a presence in mainland China by setting up a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, a structure that allows companies to establish operations without having to be the minority partner in a locally controlled venture. Marshall Wace declined tocomment.

WintonCapital AUM$26.9bn Like other computer-driven trendfollowing specialists,Wintonsuffered in February and October. Its main fund, the Winton Fund, was down 0.45 per cent net in the year to October. David Harding, founder and chief executive, said the group had a "couple of painfully bad days" in February when trend-following approaches suffered amid a lurch in the markets. Winton has been reducing the weight of suchapproachesand aims to complete this process early next year. The group is looking to grow in China where it has received approval to register with the Asset Management Association of China as a private securities investment fund manager. Its China strategy was up a net6.3per cent at theendofOctober.

The group is also branching out into the provision of data analytics services to tap growing investor demand for tools to analyse unstructured data.

U.S. Encourages Banks to Innovate in Anti-Money Laundering Compliance; Officials say they won't necessarily punish banks if they identify deficiencies when testing new technology

Banks that find problems with legacy compliance programs when testing new technology won't necessarily be penalized for prior failures, U.S. regulators said Monday.

The pledge, in a statement from multiple U.S. regulatory agencies, comes as authorities encourage lenders to try out new technology and intelligence-gathering methods as they combat evolving illicit-finance threats.

"Private sector innovation, including new ways of using existing tools or by adopting new technologies, can be an important element in safeguarding the financial system against an evolving array of threats," Sigal Mandelker, the U.S. Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told lawyers and compliance officers Monday during a speech in Oxon Hill, Md., at a financial crimes enforcement conference hosted by the American Bankers Association and the American Bar Association.

The statement from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the National Credit Union Administration nudges banks toward adopting new forms of technology, such as artificial intelligence, while recognizing that some of the new methods may be unsuccessful.

The agencies also acknowledged testing new technology could identify vulnerabilities the banks may not have previously understood. They assured financial institutions that such an incident wouldn't always lead to a penalty, but would depend on the adequacy of the bank's existing compliance program.

"Pilot programs that expose gaps in [an anti-money-laundering] compliance program will not necessarily result in supervisory action with respect to that program," the statement said.

The agencies used the example of a bank testing artificial intelligence-based transaction monitoring systems. If the bank were to identify suspicious activity that would not otherwise have been identified under existing processes, the agencies said they would not automatically assume the banks' existing processes are deficient.

"Agencies will assess the adequacy of banks' existing suspicious activity monitoring processes independent of the results of the pilot program," the statement said.

Moreover, implementing innovative approaches to anti-money-laundering compliance programs may not result in additional regulatory expectations.

"We want to make sure banks are not deterred from testing innovative ideas out of a concern that they will draw regulatory criticism," Ms. Mandelker said.

The agencies created a working group to strengthen and harmonize money-laundering defenses across the U.S. financial system, she said. The agencies issued a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-allow-small-banks-to-pool-anti-money-laundering-resources-1538605486" in which they said community banks and credit unions could pool compliance resources.

Regulators will continue to engage with the private sector on innovation, the statement said. Early engagement can promote better understanding by the agencies and it can provide a means to discuss compliance and risk-management expectations, the statement added.

WSJ Management Top 250 (A Special Report) --- What the Hiring Data Tell Us: It isn't just tech companies that need tech workers

The tech-job openings at companies in the Management Top 250 say a lot about how innovative these businesses are -- and about the digital transformation taking place in nearly every nook and cranny of the economy.

Some of the biggest recruiters of people with robotics expertise aren't just tech outfits or manufacturers, for instance, but also banks and real-estate firms. Auto makers and a slew of Silicon Valley firms are hiring autonomous-driving technicians, but so is insurance giant Allstate Corp. And health-care company Johnson & Johnson has been recruiting experts in three-dimensional printing -- touted as the next revolution in manufacturing -- to develop customized orthopedics and surgical tools.

This year's Management Top 250 -- a ranking of the most effectively run companies based on the principles of the late management guru Peter Drucker -- incorporates a new indicator to arrive at its management scorecard: data from labor-analytics firm Burning Glass Technologies on the number of cutting-edge tech jobs posted at major U.S. companies. These include positions in blockchain, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other emerging technologies expected to change the way we live and work.

The Drucker Institute, which compiled the ranking, uses the Burning Glass data along with other inputs to gauge how companies measure up in one of five performance metrics: innovation. On its own, the data lays bare how a broad swath of industries -- not just high-tech firms -- are competing for employees skilled in hot fields, from the so-called Internet of Things to drone technology.

Allstate posted more than a dozen jobs related to autonomous-vehicle technology in the 12 months ended in June, according to Burning Glass. The company has a self-driving-car research project with Stanford University, and is also exploring the technology on its own.

Howard Hayes, senior vice president of product innovation at Allstate, says that as self-driving cars move closer to reality, the insurer has a huge stake in understanding their safety and financial-risk implications -- and in helping to make them safer -- as it builds insurance products around them. To do so, its researchers need computer-vision, engineering and other driverless-car expertise.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. advertised hundreds of job openings tied to robotics over the same 12-month period. The bank applied robotics to an AI platform it rolled out last year to execute trades across its global equities algorithms business, and is using the technology to help automate other processes.

Jones Lang LaSalle, the global real-estate firm, has posted hundreds of jobs for robotics engineers, technicians and mechanics, and people with expertise in the Internet of Things, which enables everyday objects -- from heating and lighting systems to household appliances -- to be connected to computing devices. Robotics are playing an increasing role in JLL's facilities-management business, for instance, helping warehouse operators better utilize floor space and move products to be prepared for shipping, says Doug Sharp, president of corporate solutions. Wireless sensor networks connected to the internet, meanwhile, can enable clients to consume electricity more efficiently, he says.

Hedge fund comeback fails to materialise

Sharp sell-offs throw $3tn sector off course, with Europe especially badly hit

Buoyed by growing interest from institutional investors, 2018 was supposed to be the comeback year for hedge funds.

It has not worked out that way. Stalling global equity markets, compounded by sharp sell-offs in February and October, have thrown the $3.31tn sector off course.

Investors pulled a net $10.1bn from hedge funds in the year to October, according to eVestment, the data provider.

European-domiciled groups have been hit particularly badly, with net outflows of $12.8bn over the 10 months, down from net inflows of $28.9bn last year. By contrast, the Americas have had net inflows of $3.86bn and Asia net outflows of $650m.

The reasons for this are opaque, says Peter Laurelli, eVestment s head of research, though lower returns have probably played a part.

The average return for European-domiciled funds for the ten months was minus 3.7 per cent compared with minus 2.6 per cent globally. Continental funds fared worst, returning minus 4.82 per cent, while the UK was minus 3.12 per cent.

October was an especially bad month but for the year as a whole there have been redemptions across various strategies. Despite a huge surge in interest in quantitative managers, many  commodity trading advisers    computer-driven trend-following funds   have had a bad year.

There have been bright spots too. Some macro funds, which bet on the global economy via interest rates, currencies and bonds, have performed well due to volatility in emerging markets and the rising US dollar.

Discretionary funds have also done well, offering succour to more active managers.  It is interesting that we ve seen the more discretionary focused managers do better in this environment,  Mr Laurelli says.

The month-to-month performance of individual groups has been almost as choppy as the market. With a few weeks left till the end of the year there is time to recover 	. 	. 	. 	or flounder.

FTfm takes a closer look at the mixed performance of five of Europe s biggest hedge fund names.

Brevan Howard

Among the world s best-known but most secretive macro hedge funds, Brevan delivered one of the surprises of the year.

The firm was once considered the gold standard among hedge funds. It became a must-have fund following gains of 20 per cent in its main fund during the 2008 financial crisis and, before 2014, it had a record of making money every year. All this propelled assets to about $40bn.

In recent years, however, its fortunes turned. A move by traders, including co-founder Alan Howard, to Geneva was seen as a mis-step. It also lost star manager Chris Rokos. The firm chalked up three calendar years of losses between 2014 and 2017. Assets have dropped to just $6.8bn as clients fled.

Brevan entered 2018 in bad shape. This meant that its table-topping performance came as a surprise. One driver has been a particularly well-timed bet on Italian bond spreads widening. Mr Howard s style is to place bets on sharp market dislocations, which can mean his portfolios do little for a long time before suddenly reaping huge gains. This proved the ideal way to profit from the turmoil in May, when Italian two-year bonds suffered their worst day in decades.

Brevan s main fund is up by a net 12.3 per cent this year, said a person who has seen the numbers, while a punchier fund run personally by Mr Howard has made much bigger gains.

A spokesman for Brevan declined to comment.

Man Group

The overarching industry narrative of more actively managed strategies making returns while quantitative funds suffer has played out at Man, the world s largest publicly traded hedge fund group known for its computer-driven equity strategies.

Strategies in AHL and Numeric, its computer-driven trading units that use computer algorithms to make investment decisions, generally performed poorly. The worst performer for the nine months to September was the Numeric Emerging Markets Core strategy which was down 8.7 per cent on a net basis. The star was the GLG Continental European Growth Fund, part of the group s discretionary trading unit, which has had a year-to-date return of 7.5 per cent net.

Assets at Man, which is led by Luke Ellis, rose to a record $114.1bn in the third quarter but the London-listed company s share price has declined by almost 30 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Analysts are split over the medium-term outlook.  Despite a somewhat dull period for investment performance, we continue to believe that Man 	. 	. 	. 	operates a superior business model within the active asset management space,  said Paul McGinnis at Shore Capital.

Yet there are  many short to medium-term uncertainties at Man, including inconsistent performance/performance fees, volatile flows and fee margin pressure,  according to David McCann, analyst at Numis.

Man declined to comment.

Lansdowne Partners

For one of the world s biggest and most successful equity hedge funds, a poor 2018 caps a disappointing run of performance. The flagship fund at Lansdowne, which runs about $20bn in assets, is its Developed Markets fund, run by Peter Davies   best man at former chancellor George Osborne s wedding   and Jonathon Regis.

So far this year the fund has lost a net 5.6 per cent, much of which came in October s market sell-off. Only two years ago it suffered a loss of about 15 per cent, losing money on positions in UK stocks and on bets taken against commodity stocks. It gained almost 10 per cent last year, although fund managers viewed that as a disappointing result, a person familiar with the matter said.

 Returns are clearly disappointing,  the managers wrote in a letter to clients last month, reviewed by the Financial Times, referring to a small loss suffered in the first nine months.  There is no doubt our level of frustration is probably as high as we can recall.

 To some degree this frustration is undoubtedly amplified by the proximity of the period to our UK-induced problems in 2016. 

Messrs Davies and Regis s approach is to do fundamental analysis and take large, long-term positions in stocks. That, though, can leave you exposed in the shorter-term. Lloyds Banking Group, for instance, a long-term holding that the managers think will benefit as it increases payouts to shareholders, is down by about 17 per cent this year.

The Lansdowne Princay fund, a smaller fund launched in recent years as a vehicle for former BlueCrest fund manager Samuel Joab, has fared even worse, falling a net 10.4 per cent this year.

Lansdowne declined to comment.

Marshall Wace

This year was neither stellar nor catastrophic for Marshall Wace, one of the UK s biggest hedge funds, with the performance of the $39bn group broadly flat.

The flagship $17bn fund MW Eureka, which is overseen by co-founder and chief investment officer Paul Marshall, is up 1.7 per cent in the year to date although it was down 3.9 per cent net in October. MW Eureka allocates to both Tops, the systematic strategy that uses algorithms to trade on investment bank recommendations, as well as fundamental strategies.

Its best-performing strategy was the $1.3bn fundamental Japan Market Neutral equity long-short strategy, which was up 8.3 per cent net in the ten months to the end of October, according to a person who had seen the numbers.

This strategy is run by Rod Rehnborg, a Hong Kong-based manager who has penned a guide on the basics of investing for Goop, the lifestyle shopping site founded by Gwyneth Paltrow.  There are no easy answers, although a mix of stocks, hedge funds and vegetable gardens seems sensible to me,  he wrote.

Marshall Wace declined to comment.

The group, which employs 260 people, has been investing heavily in data science. It is chaired by Brexit-supporting Mr Marshall although Ian Wace, its co-founder and chief executive, wanted the UK to remain in the EU. It recently bulked up its operations in Dublin ahead of the UK s departure and in June established a presence in mainland China by setting up a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, a structure that allows companies to establish operations there without having to be the minority partner in a locally controlled joint venture.

Winton

Like other computer-driven trend-following specialists, Winton suffered in February and October.

The $26.9bn group is one of the largest quantitative investing firms in the world. Its main fund, the Winton Fund, was down 0.45 per cent net on the year at the end of October.

Founder and chief executive David Harding said the group had a  couple of painfully bad days  in February when trend-following approaches suffered amid a lurch in the markets. Winton has been reducing the weight of trend-following approaches in its funds and is aiming to complete this process by the beginning of 2019.

The group is looking to grow in China where it has received approval to register with the Asset Management Association of China as a private securities investment fund manager. Its China strategy was up a net 6.3 per cent at the end of October.

The group is also branching out into the provision of data analytics services to tap growing investor demand for tools to analyse unstructured data. Earlier this year it spun off Hivemind, its big data analytics unit, which began offering services to external clients in 2017. Winton retains a majority stake in the business.
