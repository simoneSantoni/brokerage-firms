Provo, Utah-based Grow Inc. has raised $11 million for an analytics dashboard aimed at small and medium-sized businesses.

For Toba Capital , which has focused mostly on Silicon Valley, the investment marks the firm's first in Utah.

Grow pulls together data from sources such as Quickbooks or Shopify and lets it be manipulated and visualized so businesses can get faster insight into what's going on.

Business intelligence is a crowded market, but founder and Chief Executive Rob Nelson said products from Domo Inc . or Tableau Software Inc . or Birst Inc . may be too complicated and expensive for small businesses.

"There are not a lot of options for the SMB space, and it's a huge market and severely underserved," Mr. Nelson said.

Toba led "http://www.grow.com"'s Series A round, which was $9 million, including $7 million in equity and $2 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank . Another $2 million came from insiders including the Kickstart Seed Fund, Pelion Venture Partners and Peterson Ventures, he said. Total funding in the company is $12.5 million.

Grow started in January of 2014, but its growth has taken off this year because the company built a "client success team" that helps customers get started with the software.

"They have a hard time with a self-serve solution because analytics is complex," Mr. Nelson said. "We kick them off. Late last year was our big turning point."

Grow aims to reach 10,000 companies by 2020, Mr. Nelson said. As part of the new funding, Toba Capital founder Vinny Smith joins the board.

David Lee and his partners aren't ready to talk about his new venture firm, but they are ready to talk about a new investment, Trace Genomics Inc.

The ex-partner of SV Angel will soon be launching his new firm, Refactor Capital, along with Andreessen Horowitz alums Zal Bilimoria and Rick Barber, a March "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1669924/000166992416000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" showed. For their first fund they plan to raise $50 million, according to the filing.

Though the fund hasn't officially closed, the partners are already putting the money to work, leading the $4 million seed round for "https://www.tracegenomics.com/", an agriculture technology company that hopes to marry genomics and machine learning to help farmers make smarter decisions about what they plant. Other investors in the round included Illumina Inc., Viking Global Investors and Fall Line Capital.

Venture investment in agtech companies hit a new high of $208.8 million last year, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource.

Founded in 2015, Trace announced the availability of its first product on Wednesday, a test for measuring pathogens in soil.

"They're using their proprietary insights into the microbiome and genomics to not only reduce disease in crops, but to predict where a disease may occur," Mr. Bilimoria said. "Ultimately this is about farmers needing to make better decisions based on data."

Trace's founding team are a pair of Stanford PhDs: Diane Wu, an expert in genomics and machine learning, and Poornima Parameswaran, whose speciality is microbiology.

Over the past year, the company has been working with pilot customers to validate its technology and on Wednesday launched its soil pathogen panel tests for diseases affecting two crops: strawberries and lettuce. Later it will roll out tests for soybeans, corn and other crops, Ms. Wu said.

She said Trace's testing technology can identify a wide range of pathogens that could be problematic for a particular crop, which makes it superior to existing tests which look for single pathogens. And later on it will expand its tests to target good bugs that help keep soil healthy, not unlike the human digestive system, which relies on a wide range of microbial flora to process food.

Trace will compete with companies such as Eurofins Scientific, Agdia Inc. and university diagnostic labs, Ms. Wu said. She added that larger companies like DuPont, Monsanto Co. and BASF are also doing microbial testing at far larger scale.

Still, Trace's long-term plan isn't simply to play doctor for sick soil. As it collects more and more samples, and runs them through its advanced machine learning algorithms, Trace hopes to build a database that can be used predictively to help farmers make smarter, faster decisions about what crops to grow and how to manage their soil. In the end, the goal is to boost crop yields, Ms. Wu said.

"The more users use our product, the better our product will become to the users on our platform," she said.

Trace was the first investment by Refactor Capital, but one of the fund's other investments, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/clover-health-targets-as-much-as-200m-in-new-funding-round-1463777217", was announced in May.

Silicon Valley Looks for Lessons in Theranos; Decline of blood-testing firm founded by Elizabeth Holmes underscores importance of oversight, due diligence in the venture-capital business

Silicon Valley's best-known venture investors have emerged largely unscathed from the rapid descent of Theranos Inc., but the decline offers a cautionary tale for a community that bets big on visionary founders touting revolutionary technology.

U.S. health regulators on Friday "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064" to operate a California lab and banning founder Elizabeth Holmes from the blood-testing business for at least two years.

Silicon Valley investors say Palo Alto, Calif.-based Theranos which was valued at $9 billion in a 2014 funding round offers lessons about the importance of oversight and due diligence in the venture-capital business, which bets sometimes on nothing more than an idea.

"For me, the Theranos saga is a wonderful reminder: While you want to invest in people who are visionary and are committed to their businesses, you want to partner with people who are truth-seeking," said health-care investor Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock. "A lot of people [involved with Theranos] fell down on that in this."

A Theranos spokeswoman said, "Theranos is taking concrete steps to back up its commitment to transparency. We are also preparing to introduce and explain our technologies to the scientific community."

Theranos said it is seeking to resolve its issues with the regulator. The most serious sanctions don't go into effect for about two months and an appeal is possible.

Ms. Holmes personified Silicon Valley's archetypal founder: A Stanford dropout who emulated Steve Jobs and had a grand vision to disrupt an entrenched industry. Before Theranos's problems came to light last October, at least some Silicon Valley investors cheered her apparent success. Marc Andreessen, whose firm isn't a backer of Theranos, tweeted that Ms. Holmes would be the first female tech founder on his list of "revolutionary entrepreneurs."

A spokeswoman for Mr. Andreessen's firm, Andreessen Horowitz, declined to comment.

Much of Silicon Valley has since pointed out what was perhaps the company's biggest red flag: its unusual roster of investors and board members. The only big-name venture firm to invest was Draper Fisher Jurvetson, which along with founding partner Tim Draper's own fund, supplied Theranos's first $1 million. Ms. Holmes was a childhood friend of Mr. Draper's daughter and came to him "with extraordinary energy and brilliance," he has said.

Other investors include Don Lucas, an early backer of software company Oracle Corp.; little known ATA Ventures; and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which "http://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreen-terminates-partnership-with-blood-testing-firm-theranos-1465777062" a partnership to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/craving-growth-walgreens-dismissed-its-doubts-about-theranos-1464207285" in some "http://news.walgreens.com/press-releases/general-news/walgreens-terminates-relationship-with-theranos-will-be-closing-operations-at-all-40-theranos-wellness-centers-in-arizona.htm". ATA and Don Lucas didn't respond to a request for comment. A Draper Fisher Jurvetson spokeswoman and a Walgreens spokesman declined to comment.

Several investors with expertise in life-science deals say they either passed on investing because they thought Theranos's technology claims were too good to be true, or didn't get a chance. Theranos's board of directors consisted mostly of political heavyweights rather than medical experts. The company never published its research in peer-reviewed medical journals, as is customary.

"When none of the top VC firms are in a super-hyped company, you have to wonder if there is something not quite right,'" said Jeff Richards, a managing partner at GGV Capital, which doesn't invest in medical companies.

Theranos replaced many of its directors last October and created a new medical-advisory board. The Theranos spokeswoman said, "Theranos has boards composed of individuals of extraordinary experience and talent in many fields. Their contributions have been significant."

Other highflying startups with prominent venture investors have suffered from corporate-governance issues.

Health-benefits broker Zenefits had a single outside board member, Lars Dalgaard of Andreessen Horowitz, until five months ago. He had no experience in the regulated-insurance business and encouraged the company to grow quickly and to secure the highest possible valuation in its last round of financing, say people familiar with the matter.

In February, Zenefits"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/02/08/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-resigns-over-compliance-issues/" as chief executive and added three outside directors. Zenefits has since laid off staff and experienced stalled sales. It is under investigation from regulators in multiple states regarding insurance-license issues. Two weeks ago, it agreed to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/zenefits-investors-cut-valuation-by-half-1467328327" for its last financing round to $2 billion from $4.5 billion.

David Sacks, Zenefits's new CEO, has "https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/733760059268702208" with Theranos are unfair, because his company quickly took steps to rectify its regulatory and governance issues and replaced its founder. A Zenefits spokeswoman referred back to Mr. Sacks's tweets.

Zenefits has shown that "absolute max growth rate isn't necessarily the right thing to optimize for," said Mr. Roberts of Venrock, which was an early investor in the company.

Some companies are moving to bolster oversight. Enlitic Inc., which applies artificial intelligence to medical data, is reconstituting its advisory board with experts who are expected to take a more active role overseeing the company, a move that took on added urgency in the wake of Theranos's revelations, said board member and angel investor Jim Golden.

The Silicon Valley community also has to avoid buying into its own hype machine, said Stephen Kraus, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. Entrepreneurs must sell a vision of the future to attract investors and talented employees, but it can backfire when hype outpaces reality.

Ms. Holmes was adamant about staying in control at Theranos from early on, said Sam Colella, managing director at Versant Ventures, who recalls meeting her when she was first raising venture capital. He said he was impressed, but thought she might need management help along the way.

" Every company needs more gray hair,'" he said he told her. "  What if I came to you later and asked to recruit a partner for you who has experience in building a billion-dollar company?' " Mr. Colella said the reaction was startlingly abrupt. "She closed her notebook and said,  I'm the chairman and CEO and it's going to stay that way,' " before promptly leaving.

"Anyone who knows Elizabeth Holmes can tell you she has never abruptly walked out of a meeting," a Theranos spokeswoman said.

The Property Report: Services Firms Feel a Chill

Even before Britain's vote to exit the European Union battered shares of the world's leading commercial real-estate-services firms, signs were mounting that the party was coming to an end for an industry that had boomed in recent years.

Now, as Brexit's repercussions ripple through the market, Wall Street is bracing itself for what could be a prolonged slump in the sector. Already, tenants and investors, especially in Europe, have become more wary of leasing and buying property as they reassess their real-estate activity.

A deal slowdown would reduce commissions for real-estate-services firms like Los-Angeles-based CBRE Group Inc., Chicago-based JLL, Toronto-based Colliers International Group Inc. and London-based Savills PLC, a prospect that has sent the companies' shares tumbling.

Longer term, the fallout from Brexit will likely redraw the mergers-and-acquisitions map in a business that has been going through an unprecedented wave of consolidation in recent years.

Companies with low debt and untapped credit lines on their balance sheets, like CBRE and JLL, might be able to take advantage of the carnage. Their acquisition targets, especially in countries such as the U.K., might be more receptive in a post-Brexit world.

"Those people have been looking for homes," said Colin Dyer, chief executive of JLL, in an interview last week. "But they'll be looking even harder in the future."

But a decline in commission revenue could mean headaches for more highly leveraged firms, like Cushman & Wakefield Inc., which was acquired last year by an investment group led by private-equity firm TPG and combined with Chicago-based DTZ and Washington-based Cassidy Turley.

For Cushman, keeping up with the competition might mean having to take on more debt or get a capital infusion from ownership. Neither alternative has been particularly appealing to Cushman's management team, which has preferred to finance expansion through cash flow.

What is more, with bears rampaging in the industry, Cushman likely will need to put off its widely expected initial public offering. Analysts had predicted the IPO would come later this year or early next year. That looked possible when other firms were trading at record highs, but not today when some are trading at more than 30% discounts to that level.

"If your peers are trading poorly, your owners are going to say why am I taking this thing public now," said Brandon Dobell, who tracks the industry for William Blair & Co. "Giving away cheap equity tends to not be a great idea to put before the board."

A Cushman spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the Brexit vote has affected the firm's timing on an IPO. But she pointed out in an email that the firm's exposure to Europe is less than some of its biggest rivals.

"We are well-positioned with a very diversified revenue from all major markets around the world," she said.

A consolidation in the commercial-property services industry in recent years has been fueled partly by investors and major corporations looking to the firms to take on more real-estate roles in more countries. At the same time, firms have been trying to insulate themselves against a downturn in transactions by building and acquiring other businesses, such as property management, that get recurring fees and are less dependent on economic cycles.

Until recently, the firms have had the wind at their backs thanks in part to the enormous increase in commercial real-estate sales volume throughout the world. In 2015, a record $1.3 trillion worth of commercial property and development sites traded hands globally, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

These deals boosted commission revenue and the shares of services firms. CBRE, JLL, Savills and Colliers all hit post-crash record highs last year.

But the real-estate rally began losing its bloom last year as deal volume began to fall and concerns grew about the health of China and other drivers of the world economy. The surprise Brexit vote added fuel to the fire.

There is now "lack of clarity" in Europe on tariffs, politics, exchange rates, the regulatory environment, imports and export and the movement of talent and skills, Mr. Dyer said. "What do people do? Slow everything down or wait until clarity emerges," he said.

To reassure post-Brexit markets, CBRE in late June issued a news release pointing out that last year the U.K. accounted for about 10% of the firm's global earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Meanwhile, executives at firms focused more on the U.S. market, like Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, say they could benefit if investors shift more of their attention away from Europe to North America.

"The more money that comes to America, the better for us," said Newmark CEO Barry Gosin.

Newmark is owned by BGC Partners Inc., a spinoff of Cantor Fitzgerald. Shares of BGC, which also owns other financial-services businesses, also fell in the wake of Brexit, but not as much as the broader commercial real-estate-services sector.

Thomson Reuters in $3bn sell-off;  " Intellectual property and science division sold  " Data provider to focus on core areas

Thomson Reuters is narrowing its focus to its core financial business with the $3.55bn sale of a specialist science and intellectual property division to private equity.

Onex, the Canadian buyout group, and Baring Private Equity Asia are acquiring Thomson Reuters' Intellectual Property & Science Business in an all-cash deal, as they seek steady subscription cash flows and more exposure to Asia's knowledge-hungry economies.

The news and data provider's IP&S business provides intellectual property, scientific information and other tools to subscribers. Its portfolio includes brands such as MarkMonitor, Web of Science, Thomson CompuMark and Thomson Innovation. Specialist business publishers and data companies have been the subjects of a series of big transactions in recent years, as private equity groups seek stable revenues and profits in increasingly volatile markets. Analysts said the purchase of IP&S was also part of a wider push into China and Asia, where there has been a big increase in the levels of investment in scientific research.

Jean Eric Salata , Baring Asia chief executive, said: "We believe the outlook for the business is underpinned by an increasing shift towards more knowledge-driven economies and a continued emphasis on research and development."

Thomson Reuters announced last November that it would be splitting off and selling the IP&S division as part of a "sharpening of its strategic focus".

The business accounted for just 8 per cent of its total revenues in 2014 and, under chief executive Jim Smith , the global information company has been looking to prioritise its three principal divisions which provide information and data to the financial and risk, legal and accounting industries.

Thomson Reuters said it expected to use about $1bn of the proceeds to repurchase shares, as part of a previously announced $1.5bn buyback programme. The rest is expected to be used to pay down debt and reinvest in the business.

Shares in the Toronto-listed group rose 1.75 per cent to $54.20 Canadian dollars in early trading.

There have been several transactions involving financial data and media companies in the past few years. In 2013, BC Partners bought scientific publisher Springer Science for  ¬3.3bn, while Verisk Analytics agreed to buy Wood Mackenzie for 1.9bn in March and McGraw Hill Financial proposed to buy SNL Financial for 2.2bn in July.

"These types of businesses are good investments for private equity groups," said Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg. "They have very high margins and have very stable subscription revenues, which means you can borrow a lot more to finance the transaction.

"This sort of deal just wouldn't be possible in a public market, as shareholders wouldn't be comfortable with the debt levels."

SMART MONEY
Short-term relief for hedge funds belies tough search for yield

June was kind to macro hedge funds. They were up more than 3 per cent, in what was their best month since 2010, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, buoyed by long positions on the yen and - for the most fortunate - long on both the yen and the dollar, and short sterling.

Currencies and currency-related trades have been among the few bright spots for hedge funds recently (along with gold , which has risen more than 30 per cent since the end of 2015, according to Credit Suisse). Riding the yen and dollar up and taking on derivative trades, such as shorting Chinese companies that have lots of US dollar debt and dollar costs, have been among the few clear trends to follow.

But generally, these are challenging times for the industry in the short and long term. For most of the year and most hedge fund strategies, 2016 has not been great. "The world has turned into Japan ," says the head of one Hong Kong-based fund. "When rates are this low, returns are low. There is too much money and too few opportunities."

It is only slowly becoming conventional wisdom that rates are not going up soon anywhere. That means the search for yield will become even more intense. The junk bond market in the US has been one beneficiary but many investors are increasing exposure to emerging markets, particularly in Latin America. "As everyone heads closer to negative rates, anywhere with yield is the place to be," says a senior executive at one big investment group. "And that includes emerging markets ."

While developed markets continue to do everything in their power to make their currencies as valueless as those of the banana republics of yesterday, it is the emerging markets (EMs) that have proved to be more responsible stewards of their currencies - or at least they have been slower to erode their value.

Blackstone's asset management group recently did a study of 90 major devaluations over the past 30 years and concluded that the worst is already over for some currencies that have recently gone through major devaluations, including the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real.

"We expect EM to outperform developed markets for a number of reasons," notes Ashmore in a recent piece of research. "EM technicals are good. Positioning is not at all crowded, because investors have broadly favoured developed market assets over EM assets since the Taper Tantrum of 2013 . Absolute valuations in EM are attractive. EM net external balances are improving sharply thanks to competitive real exchange rates. EM countries are generally growing faster, have lower debts, better demographics, room to adjust policy and [are] more isolated from the DM political crisis." Moreover, "EM central banks have more room to act. Indonesia, India, Brazil, Argentina, South Korea, Russia, Taiwan, Singapore and China all have in common that they have room to cut interest rates in the future thanks to previous positive policy actions and low inflation," Ashmore adds.

At the same time, there are strategies that might disappoint in this flat-to-negative-rate world. For example, the attractions of distressed asset investing, one of the strategies that looked particularly auspicious earlier this year, are fading. With rates so low, over-levered companies in the west, (with a few notable exceptions such as energy), can maintain their zombie status indefinitely as they have done for two decades in Japan. There is little growth and the anticipated recovery continues to remain elusive.

Longer term, disappointing performance might not be the biggest threat to the industry, with its 10,000 firms and $2.86tn of assets under management. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, computers will not supplement managers, they will replace them. Automation is happening and as it improves with machine learning, firms such as Blackstone are giving more money to quant funds.

Despite all their claims, some hedge funds are not nearly as diversified as they think they are, as correlations between different geographies and products and strategies increasingly converge. The quant investors can be far more diversified. They also use more leverage, but since it is spread over a greater number of positions, it is probably safer - and given where rates are, cheaper than in the past.

Retirement Plans Pressed Further by Brexit

By Timothy W. Martin, Vipal Monga and Heather Gillers

The retirement savings of tens of millions of people have come under new threat since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union, because of a plunge in global interest rates.

A post-Brexit scramble for the perceived safety of bonds pulled yields lower and upended global markets just as many public pension funds wrapped up their fiscal year on June 30, eating into any annual gains and widening already-large deficits. Many public pensions that were already having a bad year are expected this month to report their worst annual performances since the last financial crisis in 2008-09.

"We could see some pretty ugly 2016 financial statements," said Matt Fabian, a partner at research firm Municipal Market Analytics.

A sustained period of rock-bottom rates in the U.S. and negative rates overseas are contorting financial plans for investors and consumers globally, from insurers that rely on bond income to retirees who have to live with lower returns on their certificates of deposit.

For officials who manage retirements of public and private-sector workers, Brexit exacerbated problems that have been roiling pensions around the world for years. The low-rate environment has pulled down returns, inflated funding gaps, encouraged larger investment risks and prompted plan officials to scale back future investment assumptions.

Now "this problem is snowballing," said Colorado Treasurer Walker Stapleton.

Pensions determine their assets and liabilities through formulas that depend heavily on the fluctuation of interest rates. When those rates fall, investment returns suffer and obligations to future retirees become larger.

While lower rates do boost the value of existing bonds, the negatives outweigh the positives for many funds. Pensions lose money when bonds with bigger payouts purchased years ago mature and are replaced with lower-yielding securities.

The consequences of any losses are real. Large companies must compensate for weak returns and mounting obligations bypumping money into their plans, thereby devoting less to capital expenditures, acquisitions and research.

At public plans, underperformance often means taxpayers or workers are asked to pay significantly more to account for liabilities that are expected to rise as lifespans increase and more Americans retire.

"Brexit should be a wake-up call for pension plans because it means interest rates are going to stay low or go lower and it makes it even less likely [the plans] are going to achieve the 7.5% rate of return that most of them are assuming," said former San Jose, Calif., Mayor Chuck Reed.

New York City reduced its return target to 7% in 2013, but that assumption is likely still unrealistic, said Lawrence Golub, a financier and member of the New York State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances. The assets returned 3.5% in fiscal 2015.

"The 7% is too high for planning purposes," he said. "It's not conservative."

A spokeswoman for the New York City Comptroller's Office said thatthe city calculates its returns over several years, which tempersthe impact of any one bad year.

The Colorado Public Employees' Retirement Association last lowered its estimate to 7.5% from 8% three years ago, but Mr. Stapleton said the number needs to go lower. The state treasurer said the impact of Britain's vote to leave the EU only increased that conviction because it made clear the extent to which pension funds are at the mercy of international forces.

"You can't control global events," said Mr. Stapleton, who is a member of PERA's board. "Clearly there's a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace."

A spokeswoman for PERA said 7.5% is "a long-term objective," not an annual target and that reforms enacted in 2010 have lowered the fund's liabilities by $15 billion.

Ted Eliopoulos, the investment chief for the nation's largest public pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, told his board 10 days before Brexit that performance for the fiscal year ending June 30 was "likely to be flat, which is a nice way of saying zero." The system's consultant also dropped predictions of returns over the next decade to 6.4% annually, compared with a 2013 prediction of 7.1%.

The next three to five years will "test us," Mr. Eliopoulos said on June 13.

Corporate pension plans are also bracing for lower returns and higher deficits even though low rates affect them differently. Corporate pension funds use high-quality bonds to calculate their liabilities; if rates rise, those liabilities can fall. The sustained period of low rates has kept those pension obligations unexpectedly high.

Most corporate plans complete their funding calculations at the end of the calendar year, which gives them aboutsixmonths to recover from the first half's turmoil.

However, there are early signs that upheaval during the first half of the year made things worse. The combined pension deficit for S&P 1500 companies ballooned to $568 billion at the end of June, meaning the value of their assets wasn't enough to cover future benefits for workers, according toMatt McDaniel, U.S. head of the defined-benefits risk consulting businessat Mercer. That is a $164 billion increasein the deficitfrom the end of 2015.

Some companies are expected to pump more money into the plans to close the funding gap, and some have already borrowed money in the bond market at low rates to do so.

But there is no guarantee that approach will solve the long-term funding problem. Companies with large pension funds such as Verizon Communications Inc., Raytheon Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. have been funneling billions into their pension plans in past years, with little to show for it.

Verizon, for example, has contributed $7.7 billion into its plans since 2008. In that time, its pension deficit has more than doubled to $5.9 billion from $2.6 billion. Although Verizon doesn't officially measure its obligations until the end of the year, in its financial disclosures, the telecom firm notes that every 0.50 point drop in the rate it uses to measure its liabilities will increase its pension obligations by $1.3 billion.

The typical rate used by companies fell 0.77 point in June from the end of last year, according to Mercer, meaning Verizon could see an increase of roughly $2 billion in its pension obligations if things remain as they were at the end of June.

A spokesman for Verizon said that the company has strong cash flow and has taken several steps over the past few years to reduce its pension risk. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon declined to comment.

Companies are "running in place," said Michael Moran, a pension strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "If the companies hadn't put that money in, it would have been even worse."

Venture-backed startups are "http://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-bring-artificial-intelligence-to-drug-discovery-1468236602", but their technology is more likely to enhance the roles of biologists and chemists in drug discovery than to replace them.

AI is establishing itself in a growing number of industries, from finance to social media, and has become such a hot field that some venture capitalists say that seemingly every entrepreneur who walks into their offices is talking about the technology. But VCs are more concerned with how startups apply this technology than on the sophistication of their algorithms.

The best AI companies have a deep understanding of the problem they are trying to solve and frame their business around a solution, according to Bain Capital Ventures Managing Director Ajay Agarwal. In these companies "the machine learning is an enabler, it's not the be all and end all of their business," Mr. Agarwal said.

Venture investors are betting that AI will enable startups such as Atomwise Inc. and NuMedii Inc. to speed the introduction of new drugs. Atomwise uses computer simulation to predict the effectiveness of drug molecules, while NuMedii aims to identify new uses for existing treatments.

But while machines can point researchers in the right direction, it still takes human expertise to apply these insights and create medicines that will win over doctors, patients and insurers.

"We're not talking about replacing biologists," NuMedii Chief Executive Gini Deshpande said. "We're talking about [empowering] biologists to have more data to make these judgment calls."

Silicon Valley needs to make dream products function in real world

Imagine a place where driverless cars roam the streets, intelligent electricity grids regulate the power and everything is built from the ground up to the specifications of the ideal "smart" city.

This idealised place has been getting a lot of attention in Silicon Valley of late. Y Combinator, the region's best-known tech incubator, is the latest to dream, announcing a research project aimed at stimulating ideas and designs that it hopes to use in a real-world location.

It is far from alone. From Google co-founder Larry Page to libertarian venture capitalist Peter Thiel , ideas like this have had plenty of currency. Y Combinator says it wants to to speed up the adoption of technologies for ordinary people, not just build "crazy libertarian utopias for techies".

This hankering is prompted by more than a passing bout of California dreaming. It reflects a deeper issue that the tech industry faces as it moves into a new phase - and one that will have real-world implications for investors.

Companies like Google and Facebook - where Mr Thiel was the first outside investor - made their fortunes at a time when the digital and physical worlds were largely separate. But technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence are breaking down that barrier, pushing algorithms deeper into the functioning of the everyday world.

Hence the dream of an idealised place that is both open to - and safe for - experimentation. But it is little help to present-day tech companies, which will have to make their products function in today's world.

Last week's news of a fatal accident involving Tesla Motors' autonomous driving technology is a case in point. The first death of a person at the wheel of a car that was operating under its own control raises difficult ethical and regulatory issues.

From the purely rationalistic position taken by Tesla boss Elon Musk , one death after the 130m miles of autonomous driving his vehicles have clocked up is better than the average fatality rate on US roads. Even before this, "the better-than-human threshold had been crossed", Tesla declared in a defensive blog post on Wednesday.

On the other hand, if it is found that the technology resulted in a death that an attentive driver would readily have avoided, it would be a setback. It also would raise the question of whether the messy human world, where streets were not designed for robots and other drivers make mistakes, can ever be made safe for driverless vehicles.

This puts US regulators in an unenviable position as they consider how to respond. And what goes for cars may one day go for many other everyday situations, as algorithms are embedded in more objects.

With its threat of punitive damages through the court system, the US can be a risky place for product experimentation. Mr Musk said on Wednesday that the crash had not yet led to any product liability suits. But regulators may still be cautious. Driverless-cars development is already threatened by fragmented state-level regulation, and the Tesla crash certainly won't help.

The danger for tech is that it ends up like the pharmaceuticals industry, which has complained for years about a supposedly risk-averse regulatory system that adds huge costs and delays to new drugs that might offer benefits. Yet drug development has not been driven offshore, despite repeated warnings. The US is still the world's richest drugs market, so it makes sense to persevere.

The same might not be true of technologies like driverless cars and drones. China is racing to capitalise on the technology and Baidu - whose expertise in deep learning stems partly from Silicon Valley - has a goal of getting to mass production in five years.

There are at least two things Silicon Valley could do to help itself. One is to pay more attention to designing the new interactions between humans and "intelligent" machines. Tesla warns its drivers to keep their hands on the wheel at all times, but it also brags that its technology is better than a human driver - the kind of mixed message that makes it harder for the humans still in the loop to know exactly when and how they may be called on to override the technology.

The second is to do more to educate users about both the benefits and the risks of robotics and AI. That would help to ensure an appropriate response to the shortcomings of the technology - especially when, inevitably, a human dies due to the acts or omissions of a robot.

Temasek Posts Fall in Portfolio As Lenders Sink

SINGAPORE -- Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. said the value of its portfolio registered an annual drop for the first time since the global financial crisis, largely due to falls in the share prices of its holdings in financial and resources companies.

Temasek said its total assets declined to 242 billion Singapore dollars (US$179 billion) in the year ended March 31, from S$266 billion a year earlier, the first such decline in seven years. Its net profit fell 43% to S$8 billion.

The fund, which holds large stakes in banks such as Standard Chartered PLC and China Construction Bank Corp., as well as major local companies such as Singapore Airlines Ltd., warned that the current financial year, which ends in March 2017, could prove challenging, too.

"Equity markets around the world will remain susceptible to bouts of volatility in the short to medium term," said Michael Buchanan, Temasek's head of strategy. He said the increased uncertainty reflected an "ongoing hangover" from the financial crisis eight years ago and lower returns should be expected in the coming years.

Temasek's results show how state investment funds, which rank among the world's largest investors, are struggling to generate strong returns with interest rates near zero -- and sometimes in negative territory -- in major developed countries, and with economic growth moderating in key emerging markets like China. Around 70% of Temasek's funds are invested in Asia, with the rest spread roughly evenly between North America, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand.

Norway's nearly $900 billion sovereign-wealth fund, the largest of its kind globally, recorded its weakest performance since 2011 last year, which it blamed partly on slowing growth in emerging markets.

Banks, which have been struggling with narrowing interest margins, were among the hardest-hit of Temasek's investments. The value of its 16% stake in Standard Chartered, a lender heavily exposed to emerging markets and commodity companies, plunged 43%, while the value of its holding in Singapore bank DBS Group Holdings Ltd. fell 24%.

The firm also suffered a decline in value on some its holdings in resources companies, particularly those in the oil industry. Its 49% stake in Singapore-based SembCorp Industries Ltd., one of the world's largest rig builders, dropped by 28% in value.

In an attempt to improve returns and find companies with better growth prospects, Temasek has little by little been shifting more into the technology sector, and says it is looking at making investments in newer industries such as artificial intelligence and life sciences.

At the end of March, 25% of its portfolio was in telecommunications, media and technology companies, up from 24% a year earlier, while its weighting toward financial services fell to 23% from 28%.

Among major new investments in 2015, Temasek took an undisclosed stake in Beijing-based ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and Airbnb Inc., a U.S.-based home-sharing website. Big divestments included the sale of its stakes in U.K. bank Lloyds Banking Group PLC and Singapore semiconductor firm STATS ChipPAC Ltd.

The Race for Autonomous Ride-Hailing Vehicles

With fully autonomous vehicles expected to hit the road by 2020, automobile manufacturers and ride-hailing rivals have become unlikely allies.

The common bond is a vision of a driverless ride-hailing future, in which margins rise for ride-hailing companies and automotive companies avoid destruction as consumer sales drop.

"They're being driven together by common risk," said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.

These partnerships are up against well-known technology companies with more in-house artificial-intelligence knowledge and data, but some think the winner will come down to whomever has the biggest consumer brand.

By the year 2030, global car sales are "basically going to fall off a cliff," said Tasha Keeney, an industrial innovation analyst at ARK Investment Management. Meanwhile, Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. are in the midst of class-action lawsuits with drivers who argue they are employees, not independent contractors, which would force the companies to pay for benefits.

That means pairing up could save both money, said Paul Boyd, managing partner of ClearPath Capital Partners. A driverless infrastructure could be of particular interest to Uber as it seeks greater profitability.

"If they can eliminate that, then their margins go way up," Mr. Boyd said

At the center of the autonomous future, Lyft, Volvo, Uber, Alphabet Inc. and Ford Motor Co. are all part of a self-driving coalition, formed in April, and will collectively lobby law makers around autonomous infrastructure.

Outside of that group, individual companies have siphoned off into a complicated web of pairings and investments. Lyft Inc. began the trend in January with a $500 million investment from General Motors, which also invested in ride-hailing companies Sidecar and Cruise, with the stated goal of forming an "autonomous on-demand network."

Uber followed that with a recent partnership with and investment from Toyota to create "in-car apps," but it also counts Microsoft Corp., a partner with Volvo, as an investor.

Ride-hailing companies and manufacturers are "both afraid of the big boys of tech showing up," Mr. Wolff said.

The "big boys" include Alphabet's Google, which Ms. Keeney theorizes has the most advanced system in terms of self-driving capability, given the detailed data it is collecting using Lidar, a technology that measures distance using pulses of light. Data collection is a key component in the development of driverless cars, she said.

With semiautonomous vehicles already on the market, Tesla Motors Inc. is collecting a large data set from its customers and has advanced technology that allows wireless software updates. This makes Tesla, one of the more siloed members of the group, one of the front-runners, Ms. Keeney said.

Tesla's position may be more uncertain after a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/failure-of-teslas-autopilot-is-warning-sign-for-tech-1467891000" in which the owner had autopilot engaged and a resulting federal investigation of its "Autopilot" feature, however.

Apple Inc. lags behind both Google and Tesla in terms of test cars, she said, and will have to develop more artificial intelligence talent. "I think they're pretty behind," Ms. Keeney said.

Still, based on the idea that autonomous-driving infrastructure is made up of three parts the actual cars, the technology and the consumer brand several companies could have the fleets and the technology needed, said Scott Stanford, managing director at Sherpa Ventures. That is when ride-hailing brands like Uber and Lyft, as well as Google, come back into play.

"I think the competitive advantage lies in the consumer brand," Mr. Stanford said.

In a sense, Apple has the Lyft consumer brand as well through its $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing. Didi is part of an international coalition involving Lyft and has invested in the startup.

Apple's link to Lyft through its investment in Didi is just one example of how complicated this web of partnerships has become. It likely will get even more complicated as the age of driverless ride-hailing approaches.

"I think there will be more partnerships coming," Mr. Boyd said.

Berlin makes a play for London's fintechs; German capital positions itself to lure the start-ups considering leaving post-Brexit Britain

From the moment Britain voted to leave the EU, financiers across the continent began disagreeing on what it meant for London's banks. But one German was unequivocal about the consequences for a smaller but growing area of financial services: "London has committed suicide as a leading fintech centre," tweeted Jochen Siegert , chief operating officer of Traxpay, a Frankfurt-based payments platform.

Germany's digital entrepreneurs are not only convinced that London is finished, but also believe they are poised to wrest its crown as Europe's centre of fintech. This confidence is particularly strong in Berlin, the cradle of Germany's tech industry.

Cornelia Yzer, Berlin's economics minister, says her department has received "dozens of emails" in the past week from companies based in London considering a relocation to the German capital.

"Berlin will exploit the opportunity provided by Brexit," she says. "These companies need to be in the heart of Europe and where is better than the capital of Europe's strongest economy?"

For financial technology - or fintech - groups, the motivation is simple: if, in post-Brexit negotiations, the UK loses access to the European single market, London shrinks as a global banking centre and investment in their start-ups will stop.

Among the companies dusting off their Berlin Rough Guides are TransferWise, a London-based money transfer company that has raised $117m from backers that include Virgin's Richard Branson , and Revolut, a global payments app that has attracted $4.8m from venture capitalists.

TransferWise, which has 100 of its 600 staff in London, and Revolut, with 40 staff, are both considering the option of moving to Berlin, according to people familiar with the companies' plans.

Revolut's chief executive, Nikolay Storonsky , openly accepts that the company may need to open and license a subsidiary on the continent if it wants access to the EU.

"The transfer side of our business relies on the single market, specifically directives such as Sepa [the single European payments area]," he acknowledges.

TransferWise cofounder Taavet Hinrikus tweeted on Sunday that "Ireland, Switzerland, others" had been "reaching out and tempting TransferWise to start/move operations there", adding "Competition between states is good."

TransferWise and Revolut are not alone. Berlin Partner - an agency that promotes investment in the city - says the day after the UK referendum it was contacted by five London-based fintech start-ups.

"They said their investors are forcing them to consider relocating," says Stefan Franzke, the agency's head. "Capital must go where the returns are higher."

Berlin has long been in the vanguard of the fintech revolution. It has become home to dozens of small, nimble German companies trying to disrupt the business models of the established banks, through innovations such as peer-to-peer lending, crowd investing and online marketplaces.

Famously described by a former mayor as "poor but sexy", Berlin has proved a big draw for web entrepreneurs the world over, with its cheap rents, vibrant nightlife and cosmopolitan vibe. Even before the Brexit vote, it was positioning itself as a rival to London's Silicon Roundabout.

A recent survey by EY suggests it is succeeding, and names Berlin as Europe's start-up capital: the city's tech companies received  ¬2.15bn in venture capital funding last year, more than the  ¬1.77bn attracted by London.

Overall,  ¬3.1bn in investment flowed into German start-ups in 2015 - nearly double the total for 2014 - and one-fifth of this went into fintech.

But the sector remains relatively small. Of a total of 12,000 fintechs in the world, only 300 are in Germany, according to PwC's management consultancy Strategy &. Only one German fintech financing round topped $50m in 2015 - the  ¬82.5m raised by online lender Kreditech. In the US, 38 managed this.

"Historically, Berlin's main advantage has been cost, but that's not enough," says Brent Hoberman, founder of lastminute.com and head of Founders Factory. "Also, Berlin doesn't have the big corporates that London, Frankfurt and Paris have." In addition, start-ups in the German capital "tend to be less innovative and more risk-averse than those in London", he claims.

Up until now, London has led the way in fintech - thanks to its challenger banks and a vast array of blockchain, machine-learning and data-mining companies.

In 2015, the British fintech sector generated 6.6bn in revenues and attracted 524m in investment, according to EY - figures that Berlin can only dream of.

German fintech revenues were only 1.8bn split between Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich, with 388m invested.

However, one of the main reasons London has thrived is its proximity to the large global banks, which use the UK as a gateway to "passport" their goods and services to Europe's single market of 500m customers. Many now doubt the banks will be able to retain their European passport if Britain leaves the EU.

"Why would you want to stay in the UK when it's so insecure?" says Ramin Niroumand, co-founder of FinLeap, a Berlin-based fintech company builder. "It doesn't have the euro, so there's a currency issue, and now you have this passporting problem."

Revolut's plan for a subsidiary is one way to get round it.

With a post-Brexit Britain likely to seek curbs on immigration, foreign IT staff might also find it easier to work in Berlin than London.

"If you have constraints on attracting international talent, you will lose out against cities like Berlin," notes Marc Bernegger, a Swiss-based fintech investor.

Berlin Partner, for example, prides itself on fixing foreign techies up with work and residence permits within five working days - regardless of where they come from.

Nevertheless, Berlin's digital entrepreneurs are careful not to express any schadenfreude over Britain's shock vote to leave. "Personally, we benefit from Brexit, but is it really good for us?" asks Mr Niroumand. "It just fragments the market."

However, any sense of regret has not stopped Berlin sharpening its sales pitch. Ms Yzer says city envoys will not only target tech start-ups based in Britain, but also international companies with their European headquarters in London.

"We will win them for Berlin," she says, with Teutonic confidence. And the rallying cry, she says, is "You Need To Be In!".

Some think the authorities should go further. Digital lobbying group cnetz has suggested the German government help cover relocating start-ups' moving costs.

Ms Yzer says there are enough incentives already. "We offer reliability and the security companies' need for long-term planning," she says. "We are in the heart of the EU and we will stay there."

Digital defiance

City vows to maintain lead role

While Germany's digital entrepreneurs claim London will lose its reputation as a global centre for financial technology with Britain leaving the EU, many leaders of the UK tech scene insist the capital is not giving up its crown to Berlin anytime soon.

"The London fintech ecosystem is leaps ahead of Berlin," said Gerard Grech, chief executive of Tech City UK, the government-backed body that promotes the country's tech sector.

"With 350,000 people working in financial services and over 320,000 in digital technologies, we have a critical mass of expertise, alongside deep capital and a continued creation of new initiatives to support our entrepreneurs," Mr Grech added.

"From the financial services regulator's sandbox for trailing emergent business models to the Bank of England's recent announcement of a FinTech Accelerator, London is and will continue to be a financial tech powerhouse." In 2015, British fintech made 6.6bn in revenues and attracted roughly 524m in investment, according to EY.

Eileen Burbidge, a partner at London-based venture capital firm Passion Capital, says: "The best founders and entrepreneurs build successful companies no matter the macroeconomic or political climate, and therefore the best of the UK will continue to succeed even in a Brexitconsumed world."

Citadel, the US financial services group, has lured Kevin Turner, a top Microsoft executive, to run its fast-growing market-making operations, underscoring its determination to expand that business.

Other big, established financial institutions including BlackRock, Bridgewater and Schroders have also hired top-level computer scientists to help them build and develop next-generation investment systems that can outperform humans.

Citadel said on Thursday that Mr Turner, who will become a vice-chair at the group, would start in September as head of Citadel Securities after finishing his current role as chief operating officer at Microsoft. He had been with the technology group for 10 years. Before that he spent nearly 20 years at Walmart where he served as chief information officer and later chief executive of Sam s Club.

The appointment of Mr Turner comes as Citadel Securities is building up market positions in equities and fixed income markets once occupied by banks.

Many banks, hit by more stringent regulatory capital rules, have been focusing a narrower set of business lines. In their place, non-bank market makers have emerged, using computers to automatically price trades at lightning speed. Chicago-based Citadel has become the largest of a new breed of share traders.

It now executes trades of more than a billion shares every day in the US, as well as a fifth of the country s options transactions. It is also one of the largest traders of interest rate swaps in the US.

Mr Turner will head a team that includes Jamil Nazarali, head of Citadel Execution Services, and Paul Hamill, global head of fixed, income, currencies and commodities for Citadel Securities.

He is taking over the role held by Peng Zhao, who will become chief scientist at Citadel, overseeing the group s development of quantitative trading and analytics. Mr Zhao will also become a vice-chair.

 Kevin is a world-class business builder with experience managing large and complex organisations. He will be an outstanding leader for Citadel Securities,  said Ken Griffin, Citadel s founder and chief executive .

As part of its expansion plan the company in May bought assets of Automated Trading Desk, a computer-based market making pioneer owned by Citigroup. Earlier this year it purchased the designated market-maker business of KCG Holdings, the high-frequency trader, at the New York Stock Exchange.

WSJ.D Technology: Ride-Share Rivals Fight for Asia Prize --- Startup Grab is holding its own in Southeast Asia, but faces tough competition from Uber

SINGAPORE -- Uber Technologies Inc. is locked in major tussles with local rivals in China and India, but a homegrown upstart is also grabbing an advantage in the race for another Asia prize.

A startup called Grab is winning ride-hailing turf in Southeast Asia -- home to 600 million people, almost double the population of the U.S. The startup serves more cities in the region than Uber and, according to mobile-app analytics firm App Annie, is beating the world's most valuable startup in the race for users here.

The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion last year, according to a recent report on Southeast Asia's internet economy conducted by Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Singapore state-investment firm Temasek Holdings.

Singapore-based GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., as it is formally known, launched in 2012 and offers locally tailored services such as motorcycle taxis -- a popular method for negotiating the region's traffic-clogged cities -- package deliveries and cash payment.

It also has a pilot carpooling service allowing people living in southern Malaysia, where living costs are lower than in neighboring Singapore, to share rides into the city-state.

In four years, the company, valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round last year, has expanded to 1,600 employees. It operates in 30 Southeast Asian cities -- twice as many as Uber -- in six countries.

Even so, Grab faces a tough fight against Uber, a global powerhouse valued at close to $68 billion. It has raised $14 billion in debt and equity, providing it with a massive war chest for global expansion -- and local turf wars.

A spokesman said Uber is "part of everyday life for millions across Southeast Asia," where the company is "led by local teams."

Grab has some significant investors in its corner. In addition to U.S. hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and Tiger Global Management, it has received funding from Uber's biggest competitor in China: Didi Chuxing Technology Co., the country's largest ride-sharing company.

Grab also has joined Didi, ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola in India and San Francisco startup Lyft Inc. in a global alliance of Uber rivals. They work together to allow users of each company's app to hail rides from the other apps' drivers in other countries.

Grab's co-founder, Anthony Tan, a 34-year-old Malaysian who dreamed up the venture with a classmate at Harvard Business School, said he envisions the company as a sprawling, web-based platform, leveraging its location data to offer services beyond rides, such as digital payments.

"We don't think only about transport," said Mr. Tan, also Grab's chief executive, in an interview at the company's Singapore headquarters, a modest space in an office park where new taxi drivers come to sign up. "How do we build a Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent?" he said, referring to China's three leading internet companies, which dominate that country's search, e-commerce and social-media markets.

Florian Hoppe, a consultant at Bain & Company, said "it's hard for [Uber] to tailor to unique local requirements" in the region, while Singapore-based Grab understands what Southeast Asian consumers need. He pointed to Grab's service connecting commuters in Malaysia to Singapore as an example.

Natural Gas Rebounds from One-Week Low; Natural gas rebounded from losses of 7.5% on Tuesday, which had been the biggest one-day decline since October

Natural gas prices inched up Wednesday, rebounding from losses just after prices dipped to a one-week low.

Natural gas for August delivery settled up 2.2 cents, or 0.8%, at $2.786 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rebounded from"http://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-slides-on-production-demand-concerns-1467732140", which had been the biggest one-day decline since October.

That made gas relatively cheap for this time of year, said John Woods, president of JJ Woods Associates and a Nymex trader. Demand often rises in the summer to fuel power plants as people turn up their air conditioners during hot weather. And forecasts for the rest of the summer still show above-normal temperatures.

"We're gonna go right back up again," Mr. Woods said by text. "At these levels I'm a big-time buyer."

Mr. Woods and some analysts do, however, think the rally has limited potential, maybe capped at around $3/mmBtu. Power generators have been burning more coal in recent weeks as gas prices moved higher. They consumed more natural gas, too, but largely because of unexpected declines in output from nuclear, wind and hydropower units, which analysts had warned might be temporary.

Natural-gas demand started July down 7% from the last week of June at 61.6 billion cubic feet a day, according to Platts Analytics, a forecasting and analytics unit of S&P Global Platts. Weather has cooled about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit in that time, hurting demand for gas-fired electric power to run air conditioners, which fell 12% from the last week of June, Platts said.

"The bulls are spooked currently, as the first indications of July demand &were pretty poor," said Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP PLC.

WSJ.D Technology: Grab, Uber Tussle Over Turf --- Ride-hailing service serves 30 cities in Southeast Asia -- twice as many as Uber

SINGAPORE -- Uber Technologies Inc. is locked in major tussles with local rivals in China and India, but a homegrown upstart is also grabbing an advantage in the race for another Asia prize.

A startup called Grab is winning ride-hailing turf in Southeast Asia -- home to 600 million people, almost double the population of the U.S. The startup serves more cities in the region than Uber and, according to mobile-app analytics firm App Annie, is beating the world's most valuable startup in the race for users here.

The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion last year, according to a recent report on Southeast Asia's internet economy conducted by Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Singapore state-investment firm Temasek Holdings.

Singapore-based GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., as it is formally known, launched in 2012 and offers locally tailored services such as motorcycle taxis -- a popular method for negotiating the region's traffic-clogged cities -- package deliveries and cash payment. It also has a pilot carpooling service allowing people living in southern Malaysia, where living costs are lower than in neighboring Singapore, to share rides into the city-state.

In four years, the company, valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round last year, has expanded to 1,600 employees. It operates in 30 Southeast Asian cities -- twice as many as Uber -- in six countries.

Even so, Grab faces a tough fight against Uber, a global powerhouse valued at close to $68 billion. It has raised $14 billion in debt and equity, providing it with a massive war chest for global expansion -- and local turf wars.

A spokesman said Uber is "part of everyday life for millions across Southeast Asia," where the company is "led by local teams."

Grab has some significant investors in its corner. In addition to U.S. hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and Tiger Global Management, it has received funding from Uber's biggest competitor in China: Didi Chuxing Technology Co., the country's largest ride-sharing company.

Grab has also joined Didi, ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola in India and San Francisco startup Lyft Inc. in a global alliance of Uber rivals. They work together to allow users of each company's app to hail rides from the other apps' drivers in other countries.

"We don't think only about transport," said Mr. Tan, also Grab's chief executive, in an interview at the company's Singapore headquarters, a modest space in an office park where new taxi drivers come to sign up. "How do we build a Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent?" he said, referring to China's three leading internet companies, which dominate that country's search, e-commerce and social-media markets.

Grab has banked close to two-thirds of the almost $700 million it has raised from investors and isn't in need of additional funds at the moment, Mr. Tan said. The company is profitable in some cities in which it operates, he said, though he declined to forecast when the company will turn a profit overall.

In a region where few people have credit cards and many lack bank accounts, Grab first offered cash payments for users and drivers alike. It recently added motorbike taxis in cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta so commuters use can weave through traffic gridlock. Uber has since followed.

Grab also offers a package-delivery service designed to assist the region's e-commerce startups, which sometimes struggle to get items to customers in places that lack traditional addresses or where roads are poor.

Uber has a delivery service, but it isn't available outside the U.S.

Grab Fights Uber In Southeast Asia

Grab also offers a package-delivery service designed to assist the region's e-commerce startups, which sometimes struggle to get items to customers in places that lack traditional addresses or where roads are poor.

Uber has a delivery service, but it isn't available outside the U.S.

In Indonesia, Grab has worked to augment third-party maps by adding points of interest for pickups and drop-offs at locations not otherwise covered, like warungs -- roadside stalls where people often congregate to buy goods or socialize.

Uber's innovations include the UberEats on-demand food-delivery service, which gained its first Asian location in May with a launch in Singapore. The company's carpool service, UberPool, was expanded from Jakarta and Manila to Singapore last week.

Uber's huge cash pile means it can afford to hire top engineering talent and develop cutting-edge technologies. It could also allow it to spend money for longer than the less-deep-pocketed Grab, analysts say, potentially wearing it down over the long haul.

Then there is a technological barrier both companies face: While Southeast Asia's population is large, many consumers still lack web access, meaning they can't use the apps.

Neither Grab nor Uber discloses user numbers, but Grab's app topped Uber's in first-quarter downloads for both Android and Apple devices in every market in which Grab operates: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, according to App Annie.

Grab also leads Uber in monthly active users in "a number of Southeast Asian markets" on Android smartphones, which dominate the region, App Annie estimates. The company doesn't give out numbers.

Grab says its app has been downloaded more than 15 million times. An Uber spokesman declined to comment on App Annie's data, or disclose any user or download data for Southeast Asia.

Florian Hoppe, a consultant at Bain & Company, said "it's hard for [Uber] to tailor to unique local requirements" in the region, while Singapore-based Grab understands what Southeast Asian consumers need. He pointed to Grab's service connecting commuters in Malaysia to Singapore as an example.

"That's the gap" Grab has taken advantage of, he said.

British cybersecurity firm Darktrace has raised $65m from investors including private equity firm KKR.

The fundraising values the company, which employs 300 people and counts BT Group, Virgin Trains and William Hill as clients, at more than $400m.

Darktrace, which said it has seen revenue grow 600 per cent in its latest financial year, said it uses  advanced mathematics and machine learning techniques based on the biological principles of the human immune system  to identify threats in real time.

The fundraising led by KKR also includes existing investors Summit Partners, and new investors TenEleven Ventures and SoftBank-affiliated SB ISAT Fund.

Nicole Eagan, chief executive of Darktrace, said:

Securing the backing of another leading global investor like KKR is an important milestone for Darktrace and a strong validation of the technology we have developed.

PE Firms Fill Their Shopping Baskets With Public Tech Companies

By Laura Cooper

Private equity firms are once again shopping in the public markets for deals and many are finding them in the software aisle.

A combination of volatile share-price performance among publicly-traded technology companies, pressure from activist investors and private-equity firms flush with capital has helped drive one of the busiest quarters in recent memory for take-private deals in the technology sector. For some of these companies, private equity can help companies regroup away from the public eye, particularly for those software companies that have seen their growth rates slow.

"When high-growth companies go through deceleration, they're often overpunished by the public markets," said Mark Holman, a partner in the communications, media and technology group at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. "Sometimes it's easier to get refooted in the private market."

According to data provider Dealogic Ltd., financial sponsor-backed acquisitions of public companies in the technology industry hit $11.24 billion across six deals during the second quarter through June 13, the highest quarter by deal numbers since at least 2010 and the highest level by dollar volume since the first quarter of 2013. So far this year in the U.S., financial sponsors have announced eight take-private deals in the technology space, totaling about $12.17 billion, more than 71% of the $17.01 billion in deal value represented by all private equity-backed public-to-private deals so far this year, according to Dealogic's data.

If the pace continues, take-private deals in the tech space could handily match, or even surpass, the $21.57 billion such deals accounted for last year. Demand for public tech companies matches record mergers and acquisitions in the global tech sector overall, with total merger-and-acquisition volume of technology deals hitting $286 billion during the first half of the year through June 22, according to Dealogic, the second highest first half the sector has projected on record.

High purchase-price multiples for tech companies in the private markets has made public companies more attractive, particularly given public stock volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index suffered in the first quarter, dropping to 4,266 on Feb. 11 from more than 5,000 for much of November and December of 2015, although it has since recovered to 4,910 on June 23.

"If you look at the stock market performance year to date, I think it certainly created an opportunity to take advantage of what's going on," said Tim Millikin, a principal at TPG who focuses on the technology, media and telecommunications space. "Software and SaaS performance in the first quarter was quite volatile."

Early in the year, for example, Insight Venture Partners snapped up document-sharing software provider Diligent Corp. for about $624 million or $4.90 a share, a roughly 31% premium to the company's share price just before the deal was announced.

Pressure on tech companies from activist investors also has helped push more of them into play with well-capitalized private-equity firms reaping the benefits. Data analytics software provider Qlik Technologies Inc. had been under pressure to sell from activist investor Elliott Management Corp. before ultimately succumbing earlier this month, resulting in an agreement to sell to Thoma Bravo LLC for nearly $3 billion. Elliott also played a role in driving sales of companies that include Riverbed Technology Inc., which Thoma Bravo acquired in late 2014, and Informatica Corp., which sold to Permira Advisors LLP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board last year.

Private-equity firms are well capitalized to pick up these companies, thanks to several years of strong fundraising. If stock prices continue to strengthen into the latter part of the year, however, firms may have to pay more to win over shareholders and management. At the same time, a May ruling by a Delaware judge that Silver Lake's 2013 buyout of Dell Inc. shortchanged shareholders by more than $6 billion may encourage more public shareholders to push for higher pricing in the midst of a potential sale process, although industry experts don't expect it to have a severe impact on future deal flow.

(Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled Mr. Millikin's last name.)

Rising Star: Tomasz Tunguz Might Be Silicon Valley's  Where's Waldo?'

Regulars of San Francisco's South Park, the neighborhood where many venture-capital firms have set up West Coast outposts, often think they have spotted Redpoint Ventures Partner Tomasz Tunguz working late in the office.

But Mr. Tunguz always aims to be home for dinner with his family at 5:30 p.m. sharp. Passersby have been fooled by a cardboard cutout of him made for a technology conference that his co-workers place around the office to trick people.

It's understandable Mr. Tunguz could be perceived as being in two places at once. His experience as a Dartmouth College-educated engineer and his obsession with machine learning have led to a pace of six potentially promising investments at Redpoint.

Within Silicon Valley, the 34-year-old venture capitalist also has built a following as a writer. He has a popular VC blog and recently released his book, Winning With Data.

Tomasz Tunguz

Education

Mr. Tunguz earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, a bachelor's of engineering in machine learning and a master's in engineering management from Dartmouth College.

Career Path

After college, Mr. Tunguz worked as an engineer at Appian Corp., developing systems for the Department of Homeland Security. He then moved to Google Inc., where he managed the company's AdSense product for social networks. He joined Redpoint Ventures in 2008.

Board Positions

Mr. Tunguz sits on the boards of Axial Networks Inc., Electric Imp Inc., Expensify Inc., Looker Data Sciences Inc. and Dremio Corp. He's also a board observer at Quantifind Inc. and ThredUP Inc.

Every weekday at 5 a.m., Mr. Tunguz writes a data-driven blog post about startups. Many of his posts focus on cloud-based software companies or play off recent news, like Microsoft Corp.'s acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. Popular blog posts include "A Framework for Maximizing Startup Marketing Effectiveness" and a series called "Startup Best Practices."

Mr. Tunguz said the idea to start a blog came from attending board meetings. Entrepreneurs would ask questions about hiring or about what benchmarks they needed to hit before raising another funding round. He felt he needed to make that information available to more startups.

"As investors, we see all that data every day," Mr. Tunguz said. "We just haven't as an industry done a great job of aggregating it, collecting it and presenting it to entrepreneurs."

Mr. Tunguz said the blog has helped him build in-bound interest from entrepreneurs and given him an edge on competitive deals. Redpoint Partner Satish Dharmaraj said Mr. Tunguz has built such a strong reputation among founders that Mr. Dharmaraj often finds entrepreneurs want him on their board, even if Mr. Tunguz didn't bring the deal to Redpoint himself.

Mr. Dharmaraj has been a mentor to Mr. Tunguz and first called his idea for a blog "a yawn." He's been impressed, however, with how Mr. Tunguz has differentiated it from all the other VC blogs.

"He sets his mind to something and delivers with a ridiculous amount of hard work," Mr. Dharmaraj said.

Mr. Tunguz joined Redpoint eight years ago as an associate and rose through the ranks to general partner. He came to the firm after working as a product manager at Google Inc., overseeing AdSense for social networks.

Mr. Tunguz's bets include Looker Data Sciences Inc., Axial Networks Inc., Expensify Inc., Electric Imp Inc., ThredUP Inc. and Dremio Corp. Though they include both enterprise and consumer companies, Mr. Tunguz said the common thread among the companies is data. Looking ahead, he's interested in investing in other applications of artificial intelligence, like language processing.

Though he's proven he can edge out the competition on an investment, it remains to be seen if his unique data-driven approach will generate large returns for Redpoint. None of the companies he's invested in have exited yet.

Despite lacking a record of successful exits, he's proven he can still win competitive deals.

Looker Chief Executive Frank Bien said when his company was raising its Series A in 2013, the market was "hot" for business intelligence companies like his. He said many large venture-capital firms were interested in leading the round, but the company went with Redpoint because as a data company, they wanted to work with an investor who was so data driven.

"Venture capitalists always want to help you, Tom actually can help you," Mr. Bien said. "Tom is a long-view, build-a-business kind of a guy that's who you want around a table with you."

Venture Capitalists Look to Corporate Acquirers, Private-Equity Firms for Exits

Microsoft Corp.'s acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. ramped up venture-capitalist expectations that mergers and acquisitions will provide more exits for technology companies in the face of a lethargic market for initial public offerings.

Although LinkedIn was publicly traded, the $26.2 billion deal, the largest ever by Microsoft, reinforced signals that potential buyers of tech companies are on the hunt. The recent decline in the valuations of venture-backed companies could make them more attractive to corporate acquirers and private-equity firms.

"For the last three or four years, a lot of the public companies just kind of sat back and watched all the drama play out in the Valley," venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said during a recent Bloomberg LP technology conference. "Most of the big tech companies have done very well over the past five years. They've piled up lots of cash, and they have to go shopping."

The pace of venture-backed M&A activity in the second quarter approached that of last year. There were 98 transactions that closed in the quarter as of June 16, and the year-to-date total was 237 deals, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co. There were 527 M&A deals in 2015.

The disclosed value of deals is on track to beat 2015, with $20.9 billion raised through June 16, compared with $30.14 billion for all of last year. This year's pace so far is well shy of 2014, however, when disclosed deals totaled $63.52 billion.

There are plenty of targets for potential buyers. Median time from first venture investment to M&A was 4.6 years in 2015, according to VentureSource. More than 3,500 companies that received their initial venture capital from 2010 to 2012 are private and independent, according to data compiled by VentureSource in May.

Private-company pricing remains a concern for buyers, however. Although valuations have come down from last year's peak, many investors think they will fall farther. "I think it's going to take a year to get all these valuations adjusted, if not two," said Hans Swildens, founder and chief executive of secondary investor Industry Ventures LLC.

LinkedIn went public in 2011 after raising more than $100 million in venture capital. Its stock peaked at $270.76 a share in February 2015 but one year later dropped as low as $100.98 each.

Microsoft agreed to pay $196 a share in a cash deal that was seen as an effort by the software company to bolster its Office products by linking them to a professional social network that claims 433 million members.

Microsoft in March acquired Xamarin Inc., a five-year-old maker of software development tools. The price wasn't disclosed but a person familiar with the deal told The Wall Street Journal that the company went for between $400 million and $500 million. Venture investors included CRV, Floodgate, Ignition Partners and Insight Venture Partners.

Other active corporate acquirers include Cisco Systems Inc., which in March paid $1.4 billion for Jasper Technologies Inc. The company's technology monitors sensors via cellular networks, enabling customers to track assets such as vehicles and industrial equipment, an application of the so-called Internet of Things. Jasper received its first venture capital in 2005 and counted Sequoia Capital among its investors.

Apple Inc. acquired three venture-backed companies so far this year: Emotient Inc., Flyby Media Inc. and LearnSprout Inc. Emotient uses artificial-intelligence technology to analyze facial expressions. It raised $8 million from venture investors including Intel Capital, but the company hadn't been able to secure additional financing at favorable terms, according to someone familiar with the matter.

Private-equity firms also are acquiring venture-backed companies. One notable deal was Vista Equity Partners' purchase of Ping Identity Corp. for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.

The internet-security company, launched in 2002, was preparing to go public in 2017 when Vista showed up, according to Chief Executive Andre Durand. He said Ping had been approached by potential buyers about a half dozen times and accepted Vista's offer because it enabled Ping to remain a standalone company. Its venture backers included Draper Fisher Jurvetson and General Catalyst Partners.

Around the same time as the Ping announcement, Vista agreed to acquire publicly traded Marketo Inc., a marketing technology provider, for about $1.79 billion. Like LinkedIn, Marketo was a former venture-backed company whose stock price had fallen early this year.

Vista also this year bought venture-backed company Telarix Inc. and late last year purchased Fiverun Inc. Prices weren't disclosed.

The firm merged point-of-sale software company Fiverun with two other portfolio companies to form Kibo Software Inc., a provider of online-commerce software. Fiverun had raised a small first round in 2014 from seed investor Bee Partners and accelerator Orange Fab.

Telarix, which makes software used by communications services providers, raised $20 million in growth equity in 2010 from Brown Brothers Harriman Capital Partners and Edison Partners. Edison initially backed the company in 2003.

Vista is reportedly seeking up to $10 billion for its latest buyout fund to invest in technology companies.

Another private-equity firm with deep pockets is Thoma Bravo LLC, which is said to be loading up its latest fund with up to $7.2 billion. In June, Thoma Bravo said it agreed to acquire Qlik Technologies Inc. for about $3 billion. The data-analytics software company went public in 2010. One of the firm's other portfolio companies, Landesk Software Inc., has made seven acquisitions in the past five years. The most recent was AppSense Inc., a former venture-backed company that helped businesses manage desktop software.

Thoma Bravo in September took a majority stake in MedeAnalytics Inc., a provider of software used to analyze health-care financial data, for an undisclosed amount. Venture firms Bain Capital Ventures and Emergence Capital stayed on as minority investors.

Buyouts of venture-backed companies, relatively rare until after the dot-com bubble, have become more frequent. There were 53 in 2014, 50 in 2015 and 31 so far this year, according to VentureSource.

Social media is a gigantic store of information. But can tweets, likes and posts be used to pick stocks?

Although some analysts point to the need for caution, a number of funds have sprung up that seek to use social-media information to generate returns. Perhaps the clearest example of this trend is Sprott Buzz Social Media Insights ETF (ticker symbol BUZ), which was launched in April. BUZ tracks the Buzz Social Media Insights Index, which analyzes data from social-media comments, blog posts and news articles to identify 25 stocks about which the online community is most bullish.

The Buzz index uses an analytics model that deploys artificial intelligence and algorithms intended to understand the tone of a conversation even including sarcasm. The index is reset every month, and a company must have a market cap of at least $5 billion to be included, though the stocks being talked about online tend to belong to the largest companies anyway, says Jamie Wise, the founder of Buzz Indexes.

The group knows best

BUZ's managers won't intervene, even if a stock appears in the index that they don't personally rate.

"That collective group decision-making is better than any one individual's ability to pick a stock, and so we're not going to insert ourselves on top of that process," says Mr. Wise.

The use of social-media data to inform investments is part of a broader trend toward exploiting big data, or very large sets of information that can be used to identify patterns or trends.

BlackRock Inc.'s Scientific Active Equity team uses big-data analysis in a number of its funds, says Jeff Shen, co-head of investments in the SAE Group and the head of emerging markets at the company. For example, individual investors dominate the Chinese stock market, and it can be difficult to figure out what they are thinking about, he says. The SAE group gathers information from the most popular social-media sites in the country in a bid to gain insight into a market that has been historically difficult to gauge.

"When there are a lot of people talking about one particular stock, it will probably give you a sense of the retail attention in that particular name or particular sector," says Mr. Shen.

Vote bullish or bearish

Other funds seek to gather data directly. CrowdInvest Wisdom ETF (WIZE) tracks an index of 35 stocks that are selected every month based on data gathered from an iOS app. It can be thought of as Tinder (a location-based dating app) for investing, says CrowdInvest Chief Executive Annie Wyatt: Users rate stocks as bullish or bearish, and the most-favored stocks are placed into the index.

The app is based on "Wisdom of the Crowd" theory. Ms. Wyatt and her colleagues place no restrictions on who can download the app and vote, meaning a newcomer will be given the same power as an experienced long-term investor. The idea is that the group beats the wisdom of an individual.

"We want to make sure that people from all walks of life are coming into the app and voting and expressing their opinions, and we don't ask for any reason why they're expressing these opinions," she says.

The potential of all that data is one of the attractions for investors when it comes to social-media companies themselves, says Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X, whose Social Media Index ETF (SOCL) tracks the performance of the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index.

"There are a lot of different uses for that data, and it is a big component of revenues for these companies, so it should not be overlooked as an area of growth," he says.

PureFunds ISE Big Data ETF (BIGD) aims to track the companies that are mining and analyzing the data. The fund was launched in July 2015, with the aim of tapping into the growing industry, say PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin.

"I think people are going to become aware of how big this industry is. & If you're watching the financial news, it is tough to go an hour without hearing companies promoting their big-data solutions or analysts talking about the space or companies in the space," he says.

Critics weigh in

Still, the use of social-media data and big data more broadly has its critics. While social media can be an important source of information and can capture trends in the market, it will prompt most serious investors to carry out their own research, rather than relying on it directly for making an investment decision, says Neena Mishra, director of ETF Research at Zacks Investment Research.

"I don't think these can supplant the human analyst, at least not in the near term," she says. "True, machines can process and analyze data much quicker compared with humans, but the challenge lies in deciding the importance of each piece of information in the investment decision."

Kiril Nikolaev, a financial analyst at "http://etfdb.com/", also believes that while big-data analysis is increasingly important, it has potential drawbacks. For example, if everyone starts using the same or similar models to analyze information, the advantage will soon be "crowded out," he says.

Uber Rival Grab Gains Ground in Southeast Asia; Singapore-based GrabTaxi operates in more Southeast Asian cities than Uber, and is winning the race for riders

Uber Technologies Inc. is locked in major tussles with local rivals in China and India, but a homegrown upstart is also grabbing an advantage in the race for another Asia prize.

A startup called Grab is winning ride-hailing turf in Southeast Asia home to 600 million people, almost double the population of the U.S. The startup serves more cities in the region than Uber and, according to mobile-app analytics firm App Annie, is beating the world's most valuable startup in the race for users here.

The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion last year, according to a recent report on Southeast Asia's internet economy conducted by Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Singapore state-investment firm Temasek Holdings.

Singapore-based GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., as it is formally known, launched in 2012 and offers locally tailored services such as motorcycle taxis a popular method for negotiating the region's traffic-clogged cities package deliveries and cash payment. It also has a pilot carpooling service allowing people living in southern Malaysia, where living costs are lower than in neighboring Singapore, to share rides into the city-state.

In four years, the company, valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round last year, has expanded to 1,600 employees. It operates in 30 Southeast Asian cities twice as many as Uber in six countries.

Even so, Grab faces a tough fight against Uber, a global powerhouse valued at close to $68 billion. It has raised $14 billion in debt and equity, providing it with a massive war chest for global expansion and local turf wars.

A spokesman said Uber is "part of everyday life for millions across Southeast Asia," where the company is "led by local teams."

Grab has some significant investors in its corner. In addition to U.S. hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and Tiger Global Management, it has received funding from Uber's biggest competitor in China: Didi Chuxing Technology Co., the country's largest ride-sharing company.

Grab has also joined Didi, ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola in India and San Francisco startup Lyft Inc. in a global alliance of Uber rivals. They work together to allow users of each company's app to hail rides from the other apps' drivers in other countries.

Grab's co-founder, Anthony Tan, a 34-year-old Malaysian who dreamed up the venture with a classmate at Harvard Business School, said he envisions the company as a sprawling, web-based platform, leveraging its location data to offer services beyond rides, such as digital payments.

"We don't think only about transport," said Mr. Tan, also Grab's chief executive, in an interview at the company's Singapore headquarters, a modest space in an office park where new taxi drivers come to sign up. "How do we build a Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent?" he said, referring to China's three leading internet companies, which dominate that country's search, e-commerce and social-media markets.

Grab has banked close to two-thirds of the almost $700 million it has raised from investors and isn't in need of additional funds at the moment, Mr. Tan said. The company is profitable in some cities in which it operates, he said, though he declined to forecast when the company will turn a profit overall.

In a region where few people have credit cards and many lack bank accounts, Grab first offered cash payments for users and drivers alike. It recently added motorbike taxis in cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta so commuters use can weave through traffic gridlock. Uber has since followed.

Grab also offers a package-delivery service designed to assist the region's e-commerce startups, which sometimes struggle to get items to customers in places that lack traditional addresses or where roads are poor. Uber has a delivery service, but it isn't available outside the U.S.

In Indonesia, Grab has worked to augment third-party maps by adding points of interest for pickups and drop-offs at locations not otherwise covered, like warungs roadside stalls where people often congregate to buy goods or socialize.

Uber's innovations include the UberEats on-demand food-delivery service, which gained its first Asian location in May with a launch in Singapore. The company's carpool service, UberPool, was expanded from Jakarta and Manila to Singapore last week.

Uber's huge cash pile means it can afford to hire top engineering talent and develop cutting-edge technologies. It could also allow it to spend money for longer than the less-deep-pocketed Grab, analysts say, potentially wearing it down over the long haul.

Then there is a technological barrier both companies face: While Southeast Asia's population is large, many consumers still lack web access, meaning they can't use the apps.

Neither Grab nor Uber discloses user numbers, but Grab's app topped Uber's in first-quarter downloads for both Android and Apple devices in every market in which Grab operates: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, according to App Annie.

Grab also leads Uber in monthly active users in "a number of Southeast Asian markets" on Android smartphones, which dominate the region, App Annie estimates. The company doesn't give out numbers.

Grab says its app has been downloaded more than 15 million times. An Uber spokesman declined to comment on App Annie's data, or disclose any user or download data for Southeast Asia.

Florian Hoppe, a consultant at Bain & Company, said "it's hard for [Uber] to tailor to unique local requirements" in the region, while Singapore-based Grab understands what Southeast Asian consumers need. He pointed to Grab's service connecting commuters in Malaysia to Singapore as an example.

"That's the gap" Grab has taken advantage of, he said.

China agribusiness tycoon ventures into mobile banking

The co-founder of China s first privately owned bank is turning his attention to a new internet finance venture, saying that the traditional banking sector cannot be relied upon to support entrepreneurial businesses.

 Our banks and financial institutions serve the state-owned sector and the government,  Liu Yonghao, a self-made agribusiness tycoon and co-founder of Minsheng Bank, told the Financial Times.  From the time they were founded, they lacked the objective of providing funding for private enterprises. 

Mr Liu added:  The banking sector isn t fit for the age we live in , noting that privately owned businesses now account for 60 per cent of China s economic output.

Chinese banks have traditionally preferred to lend to large state-owned businesses, but some economists say the problem has become worse in recent years. Non-performing loans have increased over the past five years, making bankers more hesitant to lend to private sector entrepreneurs.

The problem is even more acute in rural areas, according to Mr Liu, who made his initial fortune in the agricultural sector. Mr Liu s New Hope Group was established in Sichuan province in 1982.

Farmers are not allowed to own land but instead lease it from the state, so cannot use it as collateral to secure bank loans.

 A big ship is difficult to turn round,  said Mr Liu,  [China s state] banks want to change but are too big to do so. 

Mr Liu has a "http://www.forbes.com/profile/liu-yonghao/" and is ranked number 28 in China on the Forbes Billionaires List from 2016.

The Chinese government has identified the private sector s funding challenges as a vital policy challenge. Last year it started a pilot programme that has approved the establishment of seven privately owned banks.

Mr Liu s new internet finance venture, Sichuan Hope Bank, received its final regulatory approvals in June. It is a joint venture with Xiaomi, the smartphone manufacturer, and a Sichuan-based supermarket chain, Chengdu Hongqi.

Mr Liu and his partners embraced an online business model to avoid the costs associated with bricks-and-mortar branches. Credit risk will be assessed through automated systems in an effort to hasten lending approvals and level the playing field for small start-ups.

Sichuan Hope Bank is not the first to embrace mobile banking platforms and use  big data  to assess client risks. Tencent s WeBank, for example, reviews loan applicants  comments and posts on its popular WeChat messaging service.

New Hope Group has a record of lending to rural start-ups: eight years ago, it branched out from selling pig feed and equipment to providing trade financing for farmers who wanted to set up small pig-farming factories.

Although the farmers would come to New Hope without business experience, Mr Liu felt he could identify the successful type.  They could understand markets from doing labour in the cities,  he said.

But Mr Liu said he felt confident lending to them, especially former migrant workers who had returned home.

Why Finra Pays Its Executives So Much; Unlike the SEC and other government entities, Wall Street's self-regulator aims to compensate top officials in line with what they would earn at banks and brokers

By Dave Michaels

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which "http://www.wsj.com/articles/top-wall-street-regulators-salary-approaches-3-million-1467389380", doesn't pay to compete with other rule writers it compensates its executives like Wall Street does.

Finra, which oversees stockbrokers and monitors trading on equity and options exchanges, "http://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2015_YIR_AFR.pdf" that eight of its senior executives earned more than $1 million in total compensation last year. It benchmarks its salaries against "a broad section of financial services and capital markets companies, as this is the most likely sector from which Finra will recruit talent," according to its most recent annual report.

At the same time, the Wall Street overseer acknowledges there aren't many substitutes for what it does, meaning a securities lawyer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wouldn't do the same job at Finra. "Defining the relevant employment market for competitive compensation benchmarking purposes is a significant challenge for Finra due to the scarcity of natural comparisons," it said in the annual report.

CEO Richard Ketchum, who has announced he is retiring later this year, earned $1 million in base salary and $1.5 million in incentive compensation. The rest of his pay came from deferred compensation and other benefits, according to the report issued Thursday. Before joining Finra, he was CEO of the regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange. He also worked on Wall Street as general counsel of Citigroup Inc.'s corporate and investment bank from 2003 to 2004.

Chief Financial Officer Todd Diganci, who was paid nearly $1.4 million, has worked at Finra for 21 years, according to his LinkedIn resume. Chief Information Officer Steven Randich, who got nearly $1.3 million, was co-CIO of Citigroup before joining Finra, his LinkedIn biography shows.

The regulator's board of directors awarded those salaries even as Finra posted a net loss of $39.5 million for 2015, driven by what it said were bigger expenses for cloud-based computing investments. Compensation and benefits expenses increased 5.5% in 2015 from 2014.

In a letter issued with Finra's annual report, Mr. Ketchum wrote that his organization's responsibilities and technology prowess has grown significantly since he took over in 2009. That year, the market regulator monitored on average 2.3 billion quotes, orders and trade each day. It now processes as many as 75 billion pieces of market data every day.

"This dramatic growth in Finra's ability to process and monitor massive amounts of data is reflective of the tremendous steps we have taken over the past seven years to improve our regulatory oversight of the complex and interconnected U.S. securities markets," Mr. Ketchum wrote.

Finra occupies a unique position in the realm of market regulation. While it is not a government agency, it can penalize brokers for regulatory violations. Rules that it passes, which affect how brokers interact with their customers, must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose chairman, Mary Jo White, earns $165,300.

At first glance, Finra's decision to compare its salaries to Wall Street's looks reasonable, said Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant for financial-services companies. But a private regulatory organization doesn't face the same checks on pay that businesses and law firms do, such as angry shareholders or clients that push back on big legal bills, he said.

"I don't think it's thought of as well as the SEC, and the SEC does not pay comparable with industry," said Mr. Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates. "For the money they're paying, are they getting the results and accountability that some would expect? I think within the industry that is certainly an open question."

Earlier in his career, Mr. Ketchum was a top brokerage and exchange regulator at the SEC. Other former SEC officials, including Finra's Chief Risk Officer Carlo di Florio and Erozan Kurtas, hired as Finra's head of advanced data analytics, have left the government and moved directly to Finra, where salaries are much higher.

Some U.S. lawmakers have in recent months questioned Finra's duties and the SEC's ability to oversee it. In a letter issued June 6, Sen. John Boozman (R., Ark.) and Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R., Fla.) demanded Ms. White explain how the SEC oversees Finra's budget and its enforcement function.

Mr. Ketchum will be succeeded by Robert Cook, a former SEC official who is a partner at law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. Mr. Cook is scheduled to become Finra's CEO in late August or early September. Finra has declined to disclose Mr. Cook's pay until next year, when it issues its next annual report.

Next World Capital Names Tom Rikert General Partner

Next World Capital has added a fourth general partner, promoting Tom Rikert to that position. Mr. Rikert "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120141124eaboahlts" as a partner in 2014 after spending two years as a partner at Andreessen Horowitz.

He led "http://nextworldcap.com/" investments in drone startup Airware, marketing analytics startup Origami Logic Inc. and energy analytics startup FirstFuel Software Inc., and focuses on the tech areas of internet of things, artificial intelligence and software delivered as a service to vertical markets.

The promotion won't change Mr. Rikert's day-to-day responsibilities because he is already leading deals and taking board seats, according to Next World co-founder and General Partner Craig Hanson, but it demonstrates "our show of faith and support in him," Mr. Hanson said. "It's not hard to find good VCs, but it's more rare to find people who are good investors and want to be great builders of firms."

Next World is based in San Francisco and invests in enterprise tech startups that are hitting what the firm calls "early revenue stage," meaning they are generally raising Series B and C rounds.

The venture firm spun out of global investment firm Next World Group in 2009 and also has offices in London and Paris. It specializes in helping its portfolio companies expand in Europe. Top executives from large European companies serve as Next World advisors, Mr. Hanson said, and Next World holds events for these advisers and its portfolio companies and also has an innovation center in San Francisco that brings European executives to the Bay Area to learn about the latest technology.

Given the investment climate in the Bay Area this year, with falling valuations and a glut of seed-backed startups that are running out of money, Next World's deal flow is up dramatically since January, Mr. Hanson said.

If the firm was tracking five startups in an area, it is now tracking about 15, he said, "and our biggest work right now is handling the opportunities we're looking at and still looking for that rare fantastic company" to back.

Next World is raising a new fund, according to a May regulatory filing, which said the firm has "http://www.wsj.com/articles/next-world-capital-gathers-122-8m-for-enterprise-technology-fund-1462914850" toward a second fund that the firm hoped could reach $125 million. Mr. Hanson declined to comment on fundraising.

Next World's other two general partners are Ben Fu and founder Sebastien Lepinard.

The Rise of Stress-Test Inc.

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON -- After Citigroup Inc. unexpectedly failed the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests in March 2014, the bank opened its checkbook and called in the consultants.

The firm had to address several of the regulator's concerns in a short time frame, and no single consulting firm could do the job, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank hired multiple firms and said it spent about $180 million on stress tests during the second half of 2014. The next year, it passed.

The stress tests -- designed to determine whether banks can withstand severe economic shocks -- have made U.S. banks stronger. Also more robust is the multibillion-dollar industry that has developed around the annual exercise. Last week, the Fed said the 33 largest U.S. banks cleared the first round of stress tests. On Wednesday, the firms will find out which ones can boost dividends or buy back shares.

Globally, banks spent about $29 billion on consultants last year, much of that for stress tests in the U.S. and elsewhere, according to analysis firm ALM Intelligence. That compares with $16.35 billion in 2007. The total has increased every year since 2009, a period when banks have been relentlessly cutting expenses and employees in areas such as trading and branches.

The Big Four accounting firms and Big Three consulting firms all have built practices offering manpower and advice to pass regulatory muster. Big financial advisers are also in on the act. Last year, BlackRock Inc. sold forecasting help to about two-thirds of the banks taking the tests.

There are even consultants offering advice on the most economical use of other stress-test consultants.

"Kick out the consultants," risk analysis firm Novantas advertised recently, telling banks it can help them cut back.

The industry has sprung up because failing the stress tests, which the Fed made mandatory in their current form in 2011, can have grave consequences. Banks that don't pass the test can be limited in their ability to raise dividends or buy back shares.

The early versions of the tests helped stem the global financial crisis in 2009 by showing big banks weren't about to collapse. Since then, both regulators and bankers said the exams have made banks such as Citigroup better able to weather shocks like the British vote to leave the European Union.

One executive said this year's scenario -- which included negative interest rates, along with a 10% unemployment rate and a roughly 50% drop in the stock market -- helped catch flaws in systems that weren't ready to compute rates below zero.

But many question whether the Fed is going overboard. Rob Nichols, president of industry group the American Bankers Association, last week called the tests "unrealistically severe" and "unnecessarily opaque." The Fed has made the tests harder to pass each year and surprised banks such as Citigroup by flunking them for risk-management practices. Hence, the need for heavy spending each round to adapt to the new versions of the tests.

Banks are expected to quantify precisely how much money they would lose under the scenarios, a herculean task for firms with global footprints, taking hundreds of mathematical models to predict the behavior of millions of assets. Each loan or investment has unique characteristics a bank must gather, track, check and recheck.

Banks generally underinvested in those skills before 2008, one reason they were hit so hard by the downturn.

The test submissions include a "narrative" document the size of a thick paperback, describing what the firm has done, accompanied by thousands of pages of documentation. Some banks employ professional writers to pen the narratives' chapters, so the Fed will have fewer questions when it examines the firms.

In all, building a stress-test program can cost banks $150 million to $250 million apiece at the start.

Financial firms globally will spend $4 billion on stress-test information technology this year, estimates Chartist Research. That is up from $3 billion in 2014 and is expected to increase 15% in 2017.

Forecasting models generally range in cost from about $100,000 to more than $1 million, depending on their complexity.

"We offer customized and off-the-shelf models to help you calculate the stressed probability of defaults," reads a "Stress Testing Suites" brochure from Moody's Analytics Inc., a unit of Moody's Corp.

The banks taking the Fed exams treat stress-test preparation like its own business line, often paying the executives who lead the effort seven-figure salaries.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, last year had about 550 people working solely on the Fed stress tests, with more than 2,000 employees contributing indirectly, according to a person familiar with the matter.

"It's like a whole new department at the bank," said Joe Sullivan, president of International Market Recruiters, which helps banks fill stress-testing jobs.

Stress has become a problem among stress-test employees, who often race to finish the exams before the Fed's deadline. The night before submissions are due, bank employees have had to stay up loading documents onto the Fed's slow-moving website, one of many late nights.

The test due date for years was January, notoriously ruining bankers' year-end holidays. In sympathy, the Fed this year changed the tests' due date to April, though one banker pointed out that conflicted with spring breaks instead.

Ultimately, the goal is for banks to scale back this mammoth exercise, for executives to have a kind of "push-button" ability to quickly assess their risk, said Michael Alix, who was a senior executive at Bear Stearns during its near-collapse in 2008 and a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York official who now advises banks on the tests as financial services consulting risk leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Banks continue to build up their teams.

The posting for a Citigroup job in Mumbai analyzing the bank's risks there and reporting up to the U.S. parent asks for: "Strong attention to detail, willingness to 'roll up sleeves' and produce a polished, high quality, accurate product; tireless work ethic with ability to work well under pressure."

LSE-Deutsche Brse merger dead in the water after Brexit vote

Anyone who believes that the merger between Germany's Deutsche Brse and the London Stock Exchange is going ahead must have their head buried in the sand. Just like the people who designed the deal.

It was meant to bring together London, Europe's leading financial hub, with Frankfurt, the home of the European Central Bank, to create a behemoth able to trade in equities and futures, and supply benchmarks, index and data analytics. When it was first announced in February, both sides were publicly dismissive of the impact of a British vote to leave the EU - and it appears the deal terms were designed with similar insouciance. These terms cannot now be changed - making the likelihood of the deal closing vanishingly small, despite reassuring utterances by both companies to the contrary.

It is not unusual for the architects of a deal to become so fixated on getting it done that they fail to focus on what might derail it. Mergers and acquisitions history is littered with the corpses of overconfident companies that were unable to get their deals from the drawing board to the board room. Nor are Deutsche Brse and the LSE the only members of the business community to have underestimated and underprepared for a Brexit. A lack of contingency planning as well as a fastidious refusal to dirty their hands in the political debate have left many other businesses scrambling to react to the vote. A survey of corporate clients by one big advisory group on Friday found that a staggering four-fifths had neither a Brexit response committee set up, nor a specific plan for what to do if the outcome was for Leave.

This complacency is shocking. But more so at Deutsche Brse and the LSE. When the deal was unveiled, advisers to both were keen to suggest that their timing was cunning. This bid, they said, had been deliberately launched amid the political uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum to "steal a march on US rivals". They said the risk of Brexit "provided the camouflage" under which the deal terms were finalised. Quite how clever that was is now moot.

Since Friday, both companies have put a reassuring gloss on the referendum news. They were committed, according to statements on Friday and again yesterday, to the deal's agreed and binding terms, irrespective of the vote, and the outcome did not affect its "compelling strategic rationale". Behind the scenes, though, it was a different story, with senior managers at the LSE privately acknowledging that the deal would be the first corporate casualty of the vote.

There was good reason for their gloom: those "agreed and binding terms". Because they cannot be tinkered with, and because they state that the combined companies' headquarters will be in London, they make the deal highly unlikely to close. German regulators - not to mention politicians - were already queasy at the prospect of a London HQ, and are even more likely to put their foot down now given that, after a Brexit, London's financial activities will not be overseen by Europe. Putting the HQ of the merged company in a city no longer able to trade freely with the bloc also reduces the financial logic of the deal - as does the sharp fall in sterling since Friday.

A particular spanner in the works is likely to be the European Central Bank's demand that the future clearing of euro-denominated derivatives transactions takes place inside the EU. That would entail routing trades through a city such as Paris or Frankfurt, rather than London.

All these consequences to a Brexit vote were foreseeable at the time the deal was announced and its terms were designed. But this was a pet project of Xavier Rolet , the chief executive of the LSE and it provided a dramatic start to Carsten Kengeter 's new job as chief executive of Deutsche Brse. Such considerations, it appears, trumped any proper evaluation of the risks.

Millions of pounds will already have been spent on lawyers, PR executives and other advisers to this deal, as well as thousands of management hours. Messrs Kengeter and Rolet are unlikely to take personal responsibility for the deal falling through, rather as the UK's political leaders have brushed off their share of the blame for last week's referendum outcome. A six-person referendum committee drawn from the boards of both companies and led by Joachim Faber, Deutsche Brse's supervisory board chairman, will now meet to "work through the challenges" the Brexit vote has posed.

This will be a further waste of time and shareholders' money for a deal that no longer makes sense.

Finra Fines Deutsche Bank $6 Million Over Trading Data; Regulator says German bank didn't offer timely and accurate  blue sheet' data as required

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Wednesday it "http://www.finra.org/newsroom/2016/finra-fines-deutsche-bank-securities-inc-6-million-submitting-inaccurate-and-late-blue" AG's securities arm $6 million for failing to provide timely and accurate trade data, the largest penalty from Wall Street's self-regulator for issues related to so-called blue sheets.

Finra said it and the Securities and Exchange Commission regularly request certain trade data, also known as blue sheets, to assist in the investigation of market manipulation and insider trading, and the bank didn't offer in a timely manner its data in an automated format as required.

"There's increasing pressure on regulators to provide more real-time surveillance, and any delay in data compromises our ability to do that," said Finra Executive Vice President Cameron Funkhouser. "Consistent failure to produce accurate data is just unacceptable."

A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment. The firm didn't admit or deny the charges, but consented to the entry of the findings, according to Finra. The bank also has agreed to employ an independent consultant to help improve its procedures related to blue-sheet submissions, said Finra.

Data analytics have become a driving force in regulation, with proponents arguing that access to timely and accurate data can allow regulators to act more swiftly to stop activity that could hurt investors.

As such, regulators have been looking closely at data production from brokerages and brought a number of enforcement cases against firms in recent years.

Late last year, Finra fined a unit of Macquarie Group Ltd. $2.95 million for inaccurate blue-sheet data, while the U.S. arm of Credit Suisse Group AG"http://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-in-sec-pact-over-blue-sheet-submissions-1443469915" in a settlement with the SEC in September.

For Deutsche Bank, Finra said it found the firm had multiple failures in the system it uses to put together and submit its blue-sheet data between 2008 and 2015, affecting thousands of submissions and more than 1 million trades.

The regulator also found that between January 2014 and August 2015 about 40% of the global investment bank's blue-sheet submissions missed the required 10-business-day deadline for responding to requests. That portion was 90% between July and August 2015.

LSE-Deutsche Brse dealmakers were wrong to ignore Brexit risk

Anyone who believes that the merger between Germany s Deutsche Brse and the London Stock Exchange is going ahead must have their head buried in the sand. Just like the people who designed the deal.

It was meant to bring together London, Europe s leading financial hub, with Frankfurt, the home of the European Central Bank, to create a behemoth able to trade in equities and futures, and supply benchmarks, index and data analytics. When it was first announced in February, both sides were publicly dismissive of the impact of a British vote to "http://www.ft.com/thirdpartywrapper/webappliveeurope"   and it appears the deal terms were designed with similar insouciance. These terms cannot now be changed   making the likelihood of the deal closing vanishingly small, despite reassuring utterances by both companies to the contrary.

It is not unusual for the architects of a deal to become so fixated on getting it done that they fail to focus on what might derail it. Mergers and acquisitions history is littered with the corpses of overconfident companies that were unable to get their deals from the drawing board to the board room. Nor are Deutsche Brse and the LSE the only members of the business community to have underestimated and underprepared for a Brexit. A lack of contingency planning as well as a fastidious refusal to dirty their hands in the political debate have left many other businesses scrambling to react to the vote. A survey of corporate clients by one big advisory group on Friday found that a staggering four-fifths had neither a Brexit response committee set up, nor a specific plan for what to do if the outcome was for Leave.

This complacency is shocking. But more so at Deutsche Brse and the LSE. When the deal was unveiled, advisers to both were keen to suggest that their timing was cunning. This bid, they said, had been deliberately launched amid the political uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum to  steal a march on US rivals . They said the risk of Brexit  provided the camouflage  under which the deal terms were finalised. Quite how clever that was is now moot.

Since Friday, both companies have put a reassuring gloss on the news of the referendum s result. They were committed, according to joint statements on Friday and again on Wednesday, to the deal s agreed and binding terms, irrespective of the vote, and the outcome did not affect its  compelling strategic rationale .

Behind the scenes, though, it was a different story, with senior managers at the LSE privately acknowledging that the deal would be the first corporate casualty of the vote.

There was good reason for their gloom: those  agreed and binding terms . Because they cannot be tinkered with, and because they state that the combined companies  headquarters will be in London, they make the deal highly unlikely to close. German regulators   not to mention politicians   were already queasy at the prospect of a London HQ, and are even more likely to put their foot down now given that, after a Brexit, London s financial activities will not be overseen by Europe.

Putting the HQ of the merged company in a city no longer able to trade freely with the bloc also reduces the financial logic of the deal   as does the sharp fall in sterling since Friday.

A particular spanner in the works is likely to be the European Central Bank s demand that the future clearing of euro-denominated derivatives transactions takes place inside the EU. That would entail routing trades through a city such as Paris or Frankfurt, rather than London.

A Brexit Boost: Mortgages --- Treasury yields fall, pulling down rates, with many expecting refinancings to pick up

Britain's decision to leave the European Union could benefit a group thousands of miles away: U.S. homeowners.

Several lenders posted rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages of about 3.5% on Monday, nearing a 3.5-year low, and analysts expect coming reports to show that average U.S. mortgage rates have decreased since the Brexit vote Thursday.

The main reason: Investors have flocked to the safety of U.S. Treasurys, pushing interest rates lower as riskier assets such as stocks tumbled. Mortgage rates tend to move up and down with 10-year Treasury rates, though the relationship isn't perfect.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 1.460% on Tuesday, down from 1.579% before the result of Thursday's vote was announced and 2.273% at the end of 2015, according to Tradeweb.

Last Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.76%. Housing-market analysts will be watching closely on Wednesday when the MBA releases its next weekly report.

If mortgage rates decline, that could be a boon both to prospective home buyers and to homeowners who qualify for refinancing. Refinancing could make sense for many people locked into rates of 4% or higher, according to mortgage experts.

Lenders are expecting a miniwave of refinancing in coming weeks. In all, 40% of borrowers have loans with a rate of 4.5% or higher, according to CoreLogic Inc., a real-estate analytics firm, meaning they could save about $90 a month on average by refinancing at 3.5%.

Lenders across the country said refinancing applications since Thursday are up between 10% to 40% compared with typical volume this time of year.

"Unless we see interest rates tick back up, I think we will see a boomlet" in refinancing activity, said Bob Walters, chief economist at Detroit-based Quicken Loans Inc., the country's third-largest mortgage lender. Mr. Walters said Quicken is seeing refinancing applications up 30% to 40% compared with typical volume.

Because mortgage rates have been near multidecade lows for the past six years, most borrowers who could refinance already have done so. Those who held back largely did so because their home was still underwater or their credit was poor.

But strong home-price growth in the past several months has helped increase the pool of borrowers with equity in their homes who are eligible to refinance. About 13% of homeowners owe more than their home is worth, down from a high of 31% in 2012, according to Zillow, a real-estate research firm.

The Brexit vote is expected to usher in a period of economic uncertainty across Europe as companies and investors pause to weigh the impact and seek out safe investments such as government bonds. Economic turbulence could prompt the Federal Reserve to hold off on raising interest rates until next year, which would likely help keep mortgage rates low, economists said.

Economists said major global economic shocks tend to boost refinancing activity because homeowners have learned over the years to expect the possibility that rates will fall. Some economists and executives said they expect the impact will be longer lasting than that of other recent shocks, such as the Greek debt crisis several years ago or the Chinese stock-market tumble last August and this January.

"I think this will have some legs on it," said Mr. Walters of Quicken Loans.

Stress Test Inc.: The Brisk Business of Bank Consulting

By Ryan Tracy 
1,061 words
29 June 2016

WASHINGTON -- After Citigroup Inc. unexpectedly failed the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests in March 2014, the bank opened its checkbook and called in the consultants.

The firm had to address several of the regulator's concerns in a short time frame, and no single consulting firm could do the job, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank hired multiple firms and said it spent about $180 million on stress tests during the second half of 2014. The next year, it passed.

The stress tests -- designed to determine whether banks can withstand severe economic shocks -- have made U.S. banks stronger. Also more robust is the multibillion-dollar industry that has developed around the annual exercise. Last week, the Fed said the 33 largest U.S. banks cleared the first round of stress tests. On Wednesday, the firms will find out which ones can boost dividends or buy back shares.

Globally, banks spent about $29 billion on consultants last year, much of that for stress tests in the U.S. and elsewhere, according to analysis firm ALM Intelligence. That compares with $16.35 billion in 2007. The total has increased every year since 2009, a period when banks have been relentlessly cutting expenses and employees in areas such as trading and branches.

The Big Four accounting firms and Big Three consulting firms all have built practices offering manpower and advice to pass regulatory muster. Big financial advisers are also in on the act. Last year, BlackRock Inc. sold forecasting help to about two-thirds of the banks taking the tests.

There are even consultants offering advice on the most economical use of other stress-test consultants.

"Kick out the consultants," risk analysis firm Novantas advertised recently, telling banks it can help them cut back.

The industry has sprung up because failing the stress tests, which the Fed made mandatory in their current form in 2011, can have grave consequences. Banks that don't pass the test can be limited in their ability to raise dividends or buy back shares.

The early versions of the tests helped stem the global financial crisis in 2009 by showing big banks weren't about to collapse. Since then, both regulators and bankers said the exams have made banks such as Citigroup better able to weather shocks like the British vote to leave the European Union.

One executive said this year's scenario -- which included negative interest rates, along with a 10% unemployment rate and a roughly 50% drop in the stock market -- helped catch flaws in systems that weren't ready to compute rates below zero.

But many question whether the Fed is going overboard. Rob Nichols, president of industry group the American Bankers Association, last week called the tests "unrealistically severe" and "unnecessarily opaque." The Fed has made the tests harder to pass each year and surprised banks such as Citigroup by flunking them for risk-management practices. Hence, the need for heavy spending each round to adapt to the new versions of the tests.

Banks are expected to quantify precisely how much money they would lose under the scenarios, a herculean task for firms with global footprints, taking hundreds of mathematical models to predict the behavior of millions of assets. Each loan or investment has unique characteristics a bank must gather, track, check and recheck.

Banks generally underinvested in those skills before 2008, one reason they were hit so hard by the downturn.

The test submissions include a "narrative" document the size of a thick paperback, describing what the firm has done, accompanied by thousands of pages of documentation. Some banks employ professional writers to pen the narratives' chapters, so the Fed will have fewer questions when it examines the firms.

In all, building a stress-test program can cost banks $150 million to $250 million apiece at the start.

Financial firms globally will spend $4 billion on stress-test information technology this year, estimates Chartist Research. That is up from $3 billion in 2014 and is expected to increase 15% in 2017.

Forecasting models generally range in cost from about $100,000 to more than $1 million, depending on their complexity.

"We offer customized and off-the-shelf models to help you calculate the stressed probability of defaults," reads a "Stress Testing Suites" brochure from Moody's Analytics Inc., a unit of Moody's Corp.

The banks taking the Fed exams treat stress-test preparation like its own business line, often paying the executives who lead the effort seven-figure salaries.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, last year had about 550 people working solely on the Fed stress tests, with more than 2,000 employees contributing indirectly, according to a person familiar with the matter.

"It's like a whole new department at the bank," said Joe Sullivan, president of International Market Recruiters, which helps banks fill stress-testing jobs.

Stress has become a problem among stress-test employees, who often race to finish the exams before the Fed's deadline. The night before submissions are due, bank employees have had to stay up loading documents onto the Fed's slow-moving website, one of many late nights.

The test due date for years was January, notoriously ruining bankers' year-end holidays. In sympathy, the Fed this year changed the tests' due date to April, though one banker pointed out that conflicted with spring breaks instead.

Ultimately, the goal is for banks to scale back this mammoth exercise, for executives to have a kind of "push-button" ability to quickly assess their risk, said Michael Alix, who was a senior executive at Bear Stearns during its near-collapse in 2008 and a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York official who now advises banks on the tests as financial services consulting risk leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Banks continue to build up their teams.

The posting for a Citigroup job in Mumbai analyzing the bank's risks there and reporting up to the U.S. parent asks for: "Strong attention to detail, willingness to 'roll up sleeves' and produce a polished, high quality, accurate product; tireless work ethic with ability to work well under pressure."

Pamlico Gets FTC Approval to Back Digital Rewards Company

Pamlico Capital Management, which traces it roots to the private-equity arm of Wachovia Corp., received regulatory clearance to back PrizeLogic LLC, according to an early antitrust filing with the Federal Trade Commission.

The FTC issues early antitrust notifications when the agency and the U.S. Department of Justice don't think a proposed deal, if completed, would violate U.S. antitrust laws. Early antitrust clearance doesn't necessarily indicate a deal has closed or will close.

Pamlico secured clearance to purchase the stake in PrizeLogic from shareholder Kenneth Barnett, who is the global chief executive of Mars Agency and an advisory board member of early-stage venture firm Mars Ventures. Mr. Barnett also has owned or continues to own other digital marketing companies, including social marketing company Collective Bias Inc. and Triad Retail Media, which was sold to an investment banking team in 2009, according to his biography on Mars Ventures' website.

According to the filing, Pamlico would invest in PrizeLogic from Pamlico Capital III LP, a $650 million fund the firm raised in 2013. The Charlotte, N.C., firm typically invests $20 million to $100 million of equity per deal in companies with annual revenue of $15 million to $200 million.

Founded in 2008, PrizeLogic offers digital-rewards programs and promotion-management services to a range of corporate clients, including PepsiCo., MillerCoors, Subway Group and Walt Disney Co. In addition to its corporate locations in Southfield, Mich., and Scottsdale, Ariz., the company has offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.

In the past year, the company has been beefing up its senior management team. Last year, it hired Jeff Blackman as its first chief financial officer. Mr. Blackman previously spent seven years as CFO at Foresee Results Inc., a customer experience analytics company that was sold to Answers Corp. in 2013. Foresee was backed by Updata Partners and Investor Growth Capital before its sale to Answers.

Pamlico, which began investing in private equity in 1988, spun out of its former corporate parent, Wachovia, in 2010.

 Big-Data  Software Company Talend Files for IPO

Big-data software company Talend SA disclosed plans for an initial public offering of American Depositary Shares.

The maker of the Talend Data Fabric platform expects to benefit as heavy use of social media and the adoption of internet-of-things technology help produce "massive quantities of new data."

In a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/garlands-take-few-easy-exits-this-year-1467027005", no U.S. tech firms went public in the first quarter. One factor is the performance of 2015 IPOs, as some startups fell short of their private valuations. But Twilio Inc.'s recent strong debut was a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/twilio-shares-surge-in-trading-debut-1466693449".

"http://wsj.com/pro/venturecapital/graphics/ipo-index", which measures the stock performance of VC-backed companies that have gone public, has been struggling to recover from a significant drop since February.

Talend, based in Suresnes, France, has its main U.S. operations in Redwood City, Calif.

Talend said its technology "separates the design of integration jobs from the actual code, which enables our platform to work with new technologies as they emerge, such as Hadoop and Spark."

The company's largest shareholders include Silver Lake Sumeru, Balderton Capital and Idinvest Partners. In 2013, when Talend closed a $40 million funding round, Chief Executive Mike Tuchen said it was "building towards" a potential IPO.

Last year, Talend's revenue was $76 million, up from $62.6 million in 2014. Net loss was $22 million, compared with a $22.5 million loss in 2014.

Talend filed confidential IPO paperwork in March. On Tuesday, it filed to offer up to $86.3 million of ADSs, but that is a placeholder amount likely to change. It plans to list its ADSs on Nasdaq under the symbol TLND.

Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Barclays and Citigroup are joint book-running managers.

U.S. Homeowners Could Gain From Brexit Vote; Analysts expect that average U.S. mortgage rates have declined since the U.K. vote to leave the European Union

"I think this will have some legs on it," said Mr. Walters of Quicken Loans.

Scott Eggen, director of capital markets at Dallas-based PrimeLending, said the number of clients trying to lock in their rates at current levels is up 10% in June from May. He said that if rates remain low, he would expect an even bigger jump in activity.

"It will go crazier than it is now, which is very busy," he said.

Anki, a San Francisco start-up whose toys are powered by artificial intelligence, has raised $52.5m in its latest funding round, as it unveils its latest robot, Cozmo.

JPMorgan led the round, alongside Silicon Valley venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures, bringing the six-year-old company's total investment to $182.5m.

Even as tech funding has waned in some once-hot areas such as ondemand delivery apps, venture capital has flooded into AI start-ups over the past 18 months.

The ability to process large amounts of data more quickly and cheaply, thanks to ever-increasing processing power used in smartphones and high-resolution graphics in video games, has spawned hundreds of AI start-ups focused on areas ranging from virtual assistants to self-driving cars.

Anki's staff includes AI experts from research labs such as Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute as well as former animators from Walt Disney's Pixar animation studio. With its first product, Drive, Anki created "smart" robot car racing, combining elements of video games into a physical set of cars and track, all controlled by a mobile device. Cozmo, which will go on sale later this year, takes inspiration from Hollywood robots such as Star Wars ' R2-D2 and Pixar animated film Wall-E .

The diminutive robot, little bigger than a Matchbox car, is able to recognise faces, compete in tabletop games against human players and learn new tricks via a connected smartphone. It also has an "emotion engine" which Anki says will give it an unpredictable personality, depending on how customers play with it.

"When you look at robots in movies - whether that's R2-D2 or Johnny 5 from Short Circuit or Wall-E - they all have a very well-defined personality," says Hanns Tappeiner , Anki's co-founder and president. "The idea for Cozmo is to create a real-life robotic character the way you would normally only see in movies."

Anki will start taking orders for the $179 toy this week before it is released in October.

Stress Test Inc.: Billions of Dollars, Bank Consultants to Manage Other Consultants; Multibillion-dollar industry has developed around the annual exercise created to make U.S. banks stronger

WASHINGTON After Citigroup Inc. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-america-citigroupand-shareholdersbrace-for-stress-test-results-1466454641" the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests in March 2014, the bank opened its checkbook and called in the consultants.

The firm had to address several of the regulator's concerns in a short time frame, and no single consulting firm could do the job, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank hired multiple firms and said it spent about $180 million on stress tests during the second half of 2014. The next year, it passed.

The stress tests "http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2016/06/23/what-are-the-feds-stress-tests-the-short-answer/" can withstand severe economic shocks have made U.S. banks stronger. Also more robust is the multibillion-dollar industry that has developed around the annual exercise. Last week, the Fed said the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-stress-tests-all-big-banks-clear-bar-for-capital-requirements-1466713830" cleared the first round of stress tests. On Wednesday, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/on-fed-stress-tests-big-banks-try-a-more-humble-tack-1467139589" which ones can boost dividends or buy back shares.

Globally, banks spent about $29 billion on consultants last year, much of that for stress tests in the U.S. and elsewhere, according to analysis firm ALM Intelligence. That compares with $16.35 billion in 2007. The total has increased every year since 2009, a period when "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-america-morgan-stanley-ready-to-cut-costs-1453239624" and employees in areas such as trading and branches.

The Big Four accounting firms and Big Three consulting firms all have built practices offering manpower and advice to pass regulatory muster. Big financial advisers are also in on the act. Last year, BlackRock Inc. sold forecasting help to about two-thirds of the banks taking the tests.

There are even consultants offering advice on the most economical use of other stress-test consultants.

"Kick out the consultants," risk analysis firm Novantas advertised recently, telling banks it can help them cut back.

The industry has sprung up because failing the stress tests, which the Fed made mandatory in their current form in 2011, can have grave consequences. Banks that don't pass the test can be limited in their ability to raise dividends or buy back shares.

The early versions of the tests helped stem the global financial crisis in 2009 by showing big banks weren't about to collapse. Since then, both regulators and bankers said the exams have made banks such as Citigroup better able to weather shocks like the British vote to leave the European Union.

One executive said this year's scenario which included negative interest rates, along with a 10% unemployment rate and a roughly 50% drop in the stock market helped catch flaws in systems that weren't ready to compute rates below zero.

But many question whether the Fed is going overboard. Rob Nichols, president of industry group the American Bankers Association, last week called the tests "unrealistically severe" and "unnecessarily opaque." The Fed has made the tests harder to pass each year and surprised banks such as Citigroup by flunking them for risk-management practices. Hence, the need for heavy spending each round to adapt to the new versions of the tests.

Banks are expected to quantify precisely how much money they would lose under the scenarios, a herculean task for firms with global footprints, taking hundreds of mathematical models to predict the behavior of millions of assets. Each loan or investment has unique characteristics a bank must gather, track, check and recheck.

Banks generally underinvested in those skills before 2008, one reason they were hit so hard by the downturn.

The test submissions include a "narrative" document the size of a thick paperback, describing what the firm has done, accompanied by thousands of pages of documentation. Some banks employ professional writers to pen the narratives' chapters, so the Fed will have fewer questions when it examines the firms.

In all, building a stress-test program can cost banks $150 million to $250 million apiece at the start.

Financial firms globally will spend $4 billion on stress-test information technology this year, estimates Chartist Research. That is up from $3 billion in 2014 and is expected to increase 15% in 2017.

Forecasting models generally range in cost from about $100,000 to more than $1 million, depending on their complexity.

"We offer customized and off-the-shelf models to help you calculate the stressed probability of defaults," reads a "Stress Testing Suites" brochure from Moody's Analytics Inc., a unit of Moody's Corp.

The banks taking the Fed exams treat stress-test preparation like its own business line, often paying the executives who lead the effort seven-figure salaries.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, last year had about 550 people working solely on the Fed stress tests, with more than 2,000 employees contributing indirectly, according to a person familiar with the matter.

"It's like a whole new department at the bank," said Joe Sullivan, president of International Market Recruiters, which helps banks fill stress-testing jobs.

Stress has become a problem among stress-test employees, who often race to finish the exams before the Fed's deadline. The night before submissions are due, bank employees have had to stay up loading documents onto the Fed's slow-moving website, one of many late nights.

The test due date for years was January, notoriously ruining bankers' year-end holidays. In sympathy, the Fed this year changed the tests' due date to April, though one banker pointed out that conflicted with spring breaks instead.

Ultimately, the goal is for banks to scale back this mammoth exercise, for executives to have a kind of "push-button" ability to quickly assess their risk, said Michael Alix, who was a senior executive at Bear Stearns during its near-collapse in 2008 and a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York official who now advises banks on the tests as financial services consulting risk leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

After the tests are submitted, the Fed comes to question banks about them. Consultants aren't allowed in the room.

Banks continue to build up their teams.

The "http://jobs.citi.com/in/mumbai/risk-management/jobid10227050-capital-comprehensive-analysis-review-(ccar)-risk-weighted-assets-(rwa)-forecasting-assistant-vice-president-jobs" in Mumbai analyzing the bank's risks there and reporting up to the U.S. parent asks for: "Strong attention to detail, willingness to  roll up sleeves' and produce a polished, high quality, accurate product; tireless work ethic with ability to work well under pressure."

Anki Scoops Up $52.5M for Robot With Personality; The palm-size toy robot, due in October, will recognize faces, play games and express a range of emotions

If you grew up watching movies like "Star Wars," "Short Circuit" or "WALL-E," you've probably daydreamed of what it'd be like to have a robot sidekick, a machine that genuinely reacts to you, recognizes you and talks back.

The team at Anki, a San Francisco startup known for "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/25/anki-overdrive-review-the-future-of-fun/", had the same dream. Their new product isn't a car, it is a friendly robot named Cozmo.

Anki announced Monday the addition of $52.5 million in Series D funding to bring the robot to consumers. J.P. Morgan led the round, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures. The company has now raised a total of $182.5 million.

"The reason we love the robots we see in movies so much is because they don't just respond with the same canned responses, they surprise you," says Hanns Tappeiner, Anki's president and co-founder. "It's taken years but our technology is finally to a point where we can build a robot with personality and bring some of the things you see in the movies to real life."

Cozmo is cute and palm-sized, and looks a bit like a dump truck with an old tube TV for a head. It moves around on tank-style tracks, and has built-in speakers which play a soundtrack of music that changes based on Cozmo's "emotions" at the time. Anki designed its endearingly goofy moves using the "http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview-dts?s_tnt=69290:1:0", only now the action plays out in real life.

Cozmo's smarts and gameplay are reminiscent of "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/25/anki-overdrive-review-the-future-of-fun/", which let users unlock new characters and attributes as they race. Like Overdrive cars, Cozmo has onboard sensors, but its brains are in the smartphone or tablet used for gameplay. The software in the app includes Cozmo's "emotion engine," some artificial intelligence to handle decision making and computer vision that lets Cozmo know where it is in relation to other objects.

Those emotions are key to Cozmo's appeal. When it recognizes a new person, Cozmo is social and curious. When ignored, it gets sad or plays on its own. It is frustrated when it loses games, and celebrates when it wins.

"Cozmo never gives you the same reaction twice," Mr. Tappeiner said. "The head movement, the arm movement, the ways his eyes animate on his face, or the inflection of his voice the combinations change to create personality."

Mr. Tappeiner says Anki will add more games and even more emotional reaction by the time Cozmo goes on sale for $180 in October. (You can preorder it on anki.com starting Monday.) Down the road, Anki intends to develop story-based games and even give Cozmo a few friends.

Although comparison to WALL-E is obvious, it is hard not to compare Cozmo to another recent favorite, BB-8, star of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." Sphero "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bb-8-awakens-is-spheros-new-droid-the-most-awesome-star-wars-toy-ever-1441285524", but while its motions and quirky mannerisms were spot on with the film character, Sphero's toy doesn't have sensors, and can't do much to interact with its surroundings, aside from "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/04/05/the-droid-awakens-spheros-bb-8-toy-reacts-while-watching-latest-star-wars-film".

Cozmo needs more content so the novelty doesn't wear off. And while Cozmo can't say much more than my name, other toys are starting to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/talking-toys-are-getting-smarter-should-we-be-worried-1450378215". But already Anki is taking toy robots to a new level, where they act, and even think, much more like their Hollywood counterparts.

Treasury's Jacob Lew: Brexit Not Developing into a Financial Crisis

Banks Get Reprieve From Brexit Hammering

SEC Drafting Rule Requiring Firms Reveal Board Diversity

Brexit and Financial-Stability Risks

It's hard to feel too relaxed with "http://www.wsj.com/articles/european-markets-remain-pressured-by-brexit-1467013530" losing a record $3 trillion over the past two trading days. But "http://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-jacob-lew-brexit-not-developing-into-a-financial-crisis-1467034882" on Monday offered what passes for consensus reassurance in the wake of the Brexit bombshell, telling CNBC there's "no sense of a financial crisis developing" and "it's been an orderly impact so far."

"So far" is the operative phrase. There has been much exhaling since Friday about how the U.K. vote to leave the European Union hasn't become a "Lehman moment." And that is true in the literal sense that markets have functioned much more smoothly since June 24 than after Sept. 15, 2008.

But what if this is a Bear Stearns moment? (The March 2008 collapse seemed to pass without broader repercussions but actually presaged the bigger meltdown of Lehman Brothers later in the year.) Or the Thai baht moment? (The July 1997 devaluation triggered the Asia crisis-turned-emerging market crisis.) Or the Long-Term Capital Management moment? (The 1998 hedge-fund blow-up stoked fears of a destructive chain reaction across Wall Street).

Maybe the postcrisis regulatory regime has inoculated the system against such contagions, as the optimists argue. Or maybe it's just too soon to know. Here are some signs of strains, echoing earlier crises, to monitor in coming days.

Hedge Funds: No major funds have yet reported big losses, and many boasted after the fact that they had learned their lessons from other recent shocks "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-funds-limited-risk-ahead-of-brexit-vote-1467045278". Perhaps. Or it could just be too soon to know how badly they were hit. Goldman Sachs issued a note Friday "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/06/27/hedge-funds-bought-european-shares-in-run-up-to-brexit/" by the firm's hedge-fund clients ahead of the referendum. Bank of America reported its hedge-fund clients were holding bullish stakes in emerging markets, which have been hit particularly hard post-Brexit, warning of a "long squeeze."

European Banks: "Just a few years ago, Europe's banks managed to stagger out of crisis brought on by the Continent's debt woes," "http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-risks-for-european-lenders-1466973158". Brexit "could push them back in" due to factors from lingering bad debts to renewed fears of a eurozone breakup. Italy's government is worried enough to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/rome-mulls-capital-injection-to-support-italian-banks-after-brexit-shock-1467021718" into its banking system.

Emerging Markets: The "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-effect-ripples-through-emerging-markets-1467033481" from South Africa to Poland to Mexico, as investors fretted, among other things, that the stronger dollar would increase debt burdens as dollar-denominated debt becomes more expensive to service and pay back. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-upends-chinas-plans-for-turmoil-free-summer-1466950552" if the gap between the dollar and the yuan expands, raising risks for a destabilizing acceleration of capital outflows. The last big global market shocks, pre-Brexit, came from similar sharp gyrations in China.

Policy Impotence: Policy makers have been able to cushion the blow from recent shocks including the Lehman moment with aggressive monetary stimulus and big bailouts. But the political and economic hangover from those rescues will make it harder to respond if the next crisis hits soon. One particularly worrisome constraint: The negative interest rates central banks have been forced to adopt actually weaken the banking sector, by pinching margins for lenders.

As Claudio Borio, chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-for-international-settlements-warns-of-risks-to-global-growth-1466937001": "The room for maneuver has narrowed."

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Treasury's Jacob Lew: Brexit Not Developing into a Financial Crisis

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-jacob-lew-brexit-not-developing-into-a-financial-crisis-1467034882" on Monday said following the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union, there doesn't appear to be a financial crisis in the making and that the world's economic systems are working.

Mr. Lew, in an interview on CNBC, said there is "no sense of a financial crisis developing'' in the aftermath of last week's "Brexit'' vote, and that while there has been market volatility, "it's been an orderly impact so far."

Banks Get Reprieve From Brexit Hammering

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-get-reprieve-from-brexit-hammering-1467106689" Tuesday as the pound gained ground and markets took a pause after two days of heavy selling.

Barclays PLC and Lloyds Banking Group PLC were both up around 6% despite two credit-rating downgrades Monday night for the United Kingdom. The two banks's fortunes are closely tethered to the U.K. economy and spending and investment. Italian banks also gained after reports Monday the Italian government might inject  ¬40 billion ($44.11 billion) into its banks.

Italy Mulls Capital Injection to Support Italian Banks After Brexit Shock

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/rome-mulls-capital-injection-to-support-italian-banks-after-brexit-shock-1467021718?tesla=y" a capital injection for the country's banking system, people familiar with the matter said, after Italian lenders were hit by a sharp selloff in banking stocks Friday, triggered by Britain's vote to leave the European Union.

One of the people said the intervention could add up to  ¬40 billion ($44.39 billion) in capital to the banking sector, which is struggling under the weight of  ¬360 billion in bad loans, chronically poor profitability amid record-low interest rates, thin capital buffers and high costs.

SEC Requires Energy Companies to Disclose Payments to Governments

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-requires-energy-companies-to-disclose-payments-to-governments-1467070526" to governments for extracting oil, gas and minerals under rules the Securities and Exchange Commission completed Monday, three years after a federal judge tossed out an earlier version of the measure.

The revised rules written to enforce a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law aim to address the "resource curse," in which oil and mineral wealth in resource-rich countries flows to government officials and the upper classes, rather than to low-income people. U.S. companies will be required to start complying with the rules in late 2018, the SEC said. As many as 755 companies could be affected by the requirements, it said.

SEC Drafting Rule Requiring Firms Reveal Board Diversity

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-drafting-rule-requiring-firms-reveal-board-diversity-1467078153" about how many minorities and women serve on corporate boards, and regulators must intervene to require fuller disclosure, the country's top securities regulator said Monday.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White said her agency would propose a rule to elicit more information about the diversity of board members. Ms. White, speaking to a conference in San Francisco, said the SEC's current rules have failed to draw out meaningful information, while the share of minority directors for the largest public companies has "stagnated" at 15% for the past several years.

Supreme Court Turns Away Debt Buyer Appeal on Loans Sold by National Banks

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-turns-away-debt-buyer-appeal-on-loans-sold-by-national-banks-1467035137" a banking industry appeal involving New York's interest-rate cap on sold debt has left some lenders and debt buyers with two options: lower their rates or stop lending to riskier borrowers in certain states with usury caps.

"For now, this causes a great deal of havoc for all kinds of credit, especially consumer credit," said Robert Jackson, a professor at Columbia Law School who recently co-wrote a study on how state usury caps affect borrowers with low credit scores in light of the case.

Hillary Clinton Lauds CFPB in Appearance With Elizabeth Warren

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-lauds-cfpb-in-appearance-with-elizabeth-warren-1467072813", during an appearance with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, lavished praise on the federal consumer protection agency that has been targeted by Republicans since its inception.

Mrs. Clinton lauded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its director Richard Cordray, a former attorney general of Ohio, at a campaign stop in Cincinnati. She called the CFPB one of the "many great ideas" of Ms. Warren, one of the agency's earliest champions.

Kroger Sues Visa Over PIN Debit Transactions

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/kroger-sues-visa-over-pin-debit-transactions-1467047798", saying the payment network has levied fines against it and threatened to raise fees and cut off its acceptance of debit cards if the grocery chain doesn't allow customers to verify purchases with a signature instead of a personal identification number.

The lawsuit represented the latest step in a burst of legal activity between merchants and the card industry, which have been fighting over fees and other issues for decades. It comes after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sued Visa in May over similar debit-card issues.

Why Some Big Insurers Lack Brexit Cover

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-some-big-insurers-lack-brexit-cover-1467038365" Brexit threatens to deliver a one-two punch to the finance industry.

Banks and financial markets take the first blow; the second lands on insurers and fund managers as owners of stocks and bonds. Both have suffered big stock price falls in the past two days as investors anticipated this.

Wednesday, June 29

9:00 a.m.

The Treasury Department will host a forum with a focus on financial education and investment advice, as well as the intersection of financial education and legal aid with Secretary Jack Lew, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray.

4:30 p.m.

The Federal Reserve will disclose whether it has approved or rejected the capital plans of the largest banks, including whether they will be able to increase dividends and share buybacks.

Friday, July 1

2:00 p.m.

Federal Reserve releases its quarterly Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, which provides information about the availability and terms of credit in securities financing and over-the counter derivatives markets

Distance Can Compound Regulatory Uncertainty

While the physical distance between financial firms and the regulators who oversee them is typically seen as a chance for firms to evade enforcement, that distance can actually hinder the efficiency of firms' compliance efforts when firms are uncertain about regulatory standards, "http://www.aei.org/publication/information-frictions-in-uncertain-regulatory-environments-evidence-from-us-commercial-banks/". They find that U.S. commercial banks located farther from their regulatory field offices face "significantly higher administrative costs," at a rate of 20% of administrative costs per hour of travel time. Those costs can be mitigated if firms are located in an area with other firms facing the same regulatory regime. Banks that operate in an area with numerous other similar firms benefit from that proximity, which the authors attribute to "information spillovers between firms" that can "limit uncertainty about regulatory expectations."

The federal government has begun to actively engage with fintech firms, but more venues for such engagement are needed, "http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/three-steps-to-stronger-fintech-government-ties-1081664-1.html". Mr. Samet co-founder of TrueAccord, a debt-recovery startup that uses messages targeted to different demographics, among other things, to get debtors to pay up recommends a "more formal model" for regulator-firm engagement. He refers to creating something along the lines of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's "Project Catalyst," which allows firms to schedule appointments to discuss innovation with CFPB officials and runs pilot programs for possible new ideas. These venues for discussion, Mr. Samet writes, should involve regulators seeking feedback on possible regulations or explaining the tangible effects of new rules for particular companies. Established relationships between regulators and the fintech industry will allow companies more leeway to innovate, so they can "run their craziest ideas by agencies to get a sense if these are products that regulators can accept," the author says.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-to-say-au-revoir-tschuss-to-english-language-1467036600" will erode the status of the English language in EU institutions to the benefit of French and German, with the bloc's executive arm already moving to ditch English from some of its official communications.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Make way for the robot stock pickers; THE BIG PICTURE

Artificial intelligence and automation are expected to revolutionise the investment industry, finds Attracta Mooney

Robots are predicted to steal the jobs of millions of workers across the world over the next few years, as technology replaces human shop assistants, teachers, accountants and potentially even taxi drivers.

Artificial intelligence and automation are also expected to revolutionise the investment industry, especially in the area of robo-advice . This is where algorithms are used to suggest funds to investors, replacing some human financial advisers in the process.

Less spoken about is the impact robotics and artificial intelligence could have on the role of the portfolio manager. But commentators believe many fund managers' jobs could come under threat as developments are made in technology.

"Artificial intelligence can replace stock pickers in many funds," says Alexey Utkin, who leads the UK financial services practice at DataArt, the technology consultancy. "Why employ hundreds of asset managers, each selecting stocks and implementing investment strategies, when a few programs can do it for you?"

Sudhir Nanda , head of the quantitative management arm at T Rowe Price, the US asset manager, told the FT earlier this year: "Humans aren't going to be completely replaced [in fund management], but they will be mostly replaced."

In the UK, the Investment Association, the trade body, estimates there are 6,700 individuals employed in asset allocation and stock selection. If robots replaced just 15 per cent of these, there would be 1,000 fewer staff in fund management roles.

Any shift towards robot stock pickers, which lack the human emotions that can drive portfolio managers to make rash investment decisions, would be a huge change for an industry that sells itself as a "people business".

Analysts believe it would mean lower costs for investors and larger profits for asset managers, because it would end one of the industry's biggest expenses: salaries.

This shift away from human fund managers is not some far-flung dream that will happen decades into the future, adds Mr Utkin. "Within the next two years I expect to see more and more examples of AI-led investing. Within the next five years this could very well become the standard," he says.

Matt Thomas, a partner at KPMG, the professional services firm, agrees: "We could see, in five years' time, a relatively automatic process [when it comes to fund management], bringing together data analytics, stock picking, quantitative investment decisions and automatic trading."

Increased competition from robots could not come at a worse time for the active fund industry, which is already facing criticism for poor performance. According to research by S&P Dow Jones, the index provider, almost every actively managed equity fund in Europe that invests in global, emerging and US markets has failed to beat its benchmark over the past decade.

Concerns about performance have prompted some investors to shun active funds in favour of cheaper passive products, where funds track an index, or smart-beta funds , a halfway house between active and passive management.

The rise of the passive market has meant investors are increasingly used to investing in funds without a high-profile portfolio manager, making the shift to investing in funds run by computers less daunting.

Active managers are now grappling with how to respond to this change. Michelle Seitz, head of William Blair Investment Management, the $64bn US fund house, says robots could "partially" replace portfolio managers.

"I don't think we should be afraid of [artificial intelligence]. The answer is we should embrace change. If artificial intelligence is part of delivering great value to a client over time, then the answer is we will figure out a higher and better use for what it is we do," she says.

Parts of the fund industry have a history of embracing technology. In a quantitative, or quant, fund, investment houses build computer-based models to determine whether an investment is attractive or not.

In some cases, the computer also makes the final decision on buying or selling a stock, in the belief that if technology can beat world champion chess players, it should also be able to beat the market.

In recent months, this thesis has been proved in some quant hedge funds, which have outperformed their highly paid human counterparts during volatile markets.

Fund managers have also started to incorporate big-data analytics, the analysis of vast amounts of data by computers, into their investment processes. The hope is this will allow them to discover information about potential investment opportunities.

It seems likely that humans will face much tougher competition from machines, which can both source investment ideas from big data and decide when to make investment decisions without emotional interference.

The shift towards artificial intelligence is expected to have a mixed impact on asset managers. Dean Ungar, senior analyst at Moody's, the rating agency, says: "Getting rid of staff would be a plus for profit margins, but offset by fee compression."

Ben Phillips, a partner at Casey Quirk, the consultancy, adds that while humans will still be necessary to monitor and program automated technology, far fewer individuals will be needed to oversee each fund.

Instead of having two portfolio managers on a single fund, for instance, one individual could oversee 10 funds. "The scalability is much higher. These portfolio managers [that are backed by artificial intelligence] can run a lot more money," he says.

But building strong artificial intelligence technology is expensive. Mr Utkin says: "With the relatively high cost of running and advancing AI, we may see certain players losing the competition and disappearing."

Active managers are now weighing up how they can use the technology to their advantage. Kai Sotorp, chief executive of Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $325bn, says the Canadian company is looking "very carefully" at how it can use technology, especially big data analytics, within its investment funds.

But he believes humans will continue to play an important role in active fund management. "It doesn't matter what is out there. Judgment, skill and expertise is always going to be necessary and I don't think you can put all that into an artificial intelligence solution," he says.

"You can definitely gain tremendous benefit from artificial intelligence and its development. That will be complementary with active managers. I don't think one necessary replaces the other."

Mr Ungar agrees: "Humans add experience. Artificial intelligence clearly is going to be incorporated more and more into [fund managers'] decision processes. But at the same time, humans still have experience, judgment and creativity that may not exist within the AI world."

The fund managers who closely follow their benchmarks are most at risk of losing out to robots, according to Mr Philips.

"People who say robots will wipe out human stock pickers are wrong. What they will wipe out is bad stock pickers," he says.

Joe Sullivan, chief executive of Legg Mason, the US fund house, agrees: "There is not a simple answer to whether technology will replace human capabilities. If individuals perform, they will get good flows [from investors]. If they don't, they will lose."

Warning from literature

Rely on machines - and things go wrong

When investment funds rely on machines, things go wrong. Or at least that is the premise behind Robert Harris's novel, The Fear Index.

In the 2011 book, a hedge fund creates a system called VIXAL-4, which uses artificial intelligence to trade on fear. It anticipates flights from stocks before human traders retreat.

But then the machine appears to move beyond the control of its human creators, wreaking havoc in the process.

The risks of artificial intelligence within finance might not be as great as that espoused by The Fear Index, but that does not mean there are not concerns about the increasing use of machines in investment management.

Alexey Utkin, financial services practice lead for the UK at DataArt, the technology consultancy, says the growth of artificial intelligence in investment products brings both rewards and risks for investors.

"It may change the market structure, bringing more centralisation and other systemic risks, leading to greater volatility," says Mr Utkin.

He gives the example of currency trading, where rather than hundreds of foreign exchange traders selecting which currencies to trade and at what price, a few algorithms could dominate the market in future.

"This kind of centralisation within markets often leads to greater risk and higher volatility," he says.

The former chief executive of Man Group, the world s largest listed hedge fund company, has joined the board of RWC as part of the London-based investment manager s efforts to boost its assets under management.

Peter Clarke, who ran Man Group for six years before being replaced by Manny Roman in 2013, will join RWC s board as its first non-executive director in July.

Mr Clarke already sits on the boards of Lombard Odier Investment Management, the Swiss fund house, and Axa UK, the insurer. He was also appointed chairman of Lancashire Holdings, the reinsurer, in February, and is a member of the treasury committee of King's College London.

Dan Mannix, chief executive of RWC, which experienced a 40 per cent rise in its assets last year, to $11.5bn, said the board appointment reflected the company s ambition to win business from large institutional clients in the US, Asia, Australia and Europe.

He said:  We are in growth mode. We wanted to ensure we have experienced people around who are very well regarded by clients, are known to various regulators, and can help us in our strategic decision making. 

Mr Clarke, who stepped down from Man Group in 2013 after it suffered a significant fall in its share price and assets under management, added that his knowledge of the fintech industry would prove valuable to RWC.

Last year, Mr Clarke joined the board of Essentia Analytics, a fintech business that uses psychology software to help traders at fund companies   including Man Group and Artemis   analyse the link between their sleeping patterns and investment performance.

Mr Clarke said:  [RWC] wants to show it is going places and is solid, sustainable and of institutional quality. They are conscious they need to build out the board to reflect that ambition. 

RWC also wants underline its independence from Schroders, the UK s largest listed fund company, which has a 43 per cent stake in RWC, by adding an independent director to the board for the first time, according to Mr Clarke.

The remaining board members are Gemma Bainbridge (chairman), finance director at RWC; Paul Larche, chief operating officer; John Innes, the first fund manager at RWC; Nicky Richards, head of equities at Schroders; Roger Goodchild, head of corporate development at Schroders; and Mr Mannix.

The chief executive said Mr Clarke s long history in the industry will be particularly useful at a time when asset management is struggling with volatile markets and heavy outflows.

 For all of us 2016 has been a difficult start to the year, and we have had some outflows. UK fund flows were at their lowest level in the first quarter of 2015 in 15 years, and that is reflected across Europe s fund industry,  he said.

U.K. Vote Sends Chills Through Venture Investors; London's cachet as Europe's startup hub may be lost to other cities

Britain's vote to exit the European Union has left venture capitalists downcast about the future of entrepreneurship and funding startups in Europe's second-biggest economy.

"There's no positive in this," said Harry Nelis, a London-based partner with Accel Partners. "The question is how negative is the news."

Although many observers tried to play down some of the gloom-and-doom predictions that have rippled around the world, venture capitalists widely frowned on the historic referendum as bad for business and bad for the future of startup opportunities, especially in Britain.

Anxiety about Thursday's "Brexit" vote centers on the countless questions and uncertainty surrounding what to expect in watching a nation break away from the EU, an event without precedent.

How Britain negotiates terms of its exit, a process that could take at least two years, could have far-reaching consequences since the U.K. accounts for about one-third of Europe's venture capital fundings.

For decades, London has benefited from its dual role as the de facto banking capital and primary hub for entrepreneurship in Europe, identities that flourished under the EU's charter of free movement of goods, capital and migration. Several startup watchers and investors said much of that could be lost by leaving the 28-member union.

Britain's departure represents "a devastating blow" to the momentum the nation's startup scene has enjoyed in recent years, said Kristian Segerstrale, a co-founder of the social-game company Playfish who is now an investor with Initial Capital in London and Silicon Valley.

"Talent may be barred from entering in the future, but already now the writing is on the wall," Mr. Segerstrale said via email. "Should you as a top-of-your-field [artificial-intelligence] researcher from Italy move to Berlin, Helsinki, Silicon Valley or London to pursue your startup? London will seem a lot less interesting now."

On the day after the vote, President Barack Obama coincidentally addressed an entrepreneurship conference of venture capitalists and startup founders at Stanford University. Speaking to the group, he pointed to the referendum as a reminder of the challenge facing innovators in a world ever changing from globalization.

"The world has shrunk, it's interconnected, and all of you represent these interconnections," Mr. Obama said. "Many of you are catalyzing and accelerating it. It promises to bring extraordinary benefits, but also challenges, concerns and fears."

Mr. Nelis of Accel Partners, which just closed a $500 million fund in April to target investments in Europe and Israel, is looking to invest in startups that have very strong reasons to exist, and even though the vote a step back, "it won't kill any of those companies."

Dan Ciporin, general partner at Canaan Partners, who invests in fintech companies, said the vote will "definitely impact European startups, and fintechs specifically. London has been the center of fintech innovation in Europe, and that is now clearly threatened by the Brexit vote."

One of the big losers in the aftermath, Mr. Ciporin said, will be London's long renown as a beachhead for foreign companies making inroads into continental Europe.

"I think the impact on U.S. startups...is less clear, although certainly it will mean that any decision to put in place a European HQ will be driven much more towards the continent rather than London," he said. "For fintech, this will probably be a boon to Stockholm in particular, which was probably second to London as a fintech innovation center."

Tim Wilson, a partner with Artiman Ventures who specializes in early-stage investing, said the vote makes investors more likely to stay away from U.K. opportunities because of the shadow of uncertainty hanging over the issue.

"When I'm comfortable, and I feel like I know the future, then I make different decisions than if I feel like I'm uncertain, and I'm not sure where this goes."

One of the companies he invested in, Prysm, is based in San Jose, Calif., but has an office in London, where it sells a video technology priced in dollars. With the British pound tumbling on foreign exchanges, Prysm's sales staff faces a fresh hurdle because their product just got much more expensive for buyers in the U.K., Mr. Wilson said.

Mavra Bari, a British national from Pakistan who was attending the Stanford summit, said she was born in the U.K. because her parents were refugees and were granted asylum.

"I owe a lot to the U.K.," she said. But she called the Brexit vote "a historically idiotic move."

Bank Shares Plummet Around the World, but Europe Fares Worst; Barclays , Deutsche Bank and others hit hardest in global selloff

Banks on both sides of the Atlantic were pummeled by the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union , hit by concern about the potential for big trading losses, slowing economic growth and the prospect of even lower interest rates for longer.

Even so, the severity of share-price falls highlighted the widening divide between how markets perceive the strength of U.S. banks and their overseas peers as the damage was far worse in Europe. The U.K. decision came just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve in the first round of its annual bank  stress tests" said the biggest U.S. banks were strong enough to withstand a hypothetical recession and sharp market falls.

In the U.K., shares of Barclays PLC fell around 30% at one point Friday, although they later recovered somewhat. It and Royal Bank of Scotland Group closed the day down around 18%.

Among continental European bank stocks: Deutsche Bank AG fell around 14%, France's BNP Paribas SA tumbled more than 17%, Spain's Banco Santander SA dropped nearly 20% and Italy's UniCredit plunged 23%.

 Europe is weak already in terms of economic growth, and [Brexit] isn't going to help matters," said Laith Khalaf , an analyst for U.K. investment manager Hargreaves Lansdown.  That's the risk you are seeing priced in today."

Losses in the U.S. weren't as severe, but were dramatic. Morgan Stanley , the smallest of the big U.S. banks by assets, fell about 10%; Citigroup Inc ., seen as the most global of the U.S. banks, dropped around 9%. Even regional, U.S. focused banks, such as U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc., were hit due to fears that even lower interest rates could pressure profits further.

The drubbing followed what had been a tense night for many bankers. At J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, some of the firm's top executives had a call at 5 a.m. New York time, said Daniel Pinto , chief executive of its corporate and investment bank and head of Europe, Middle East and Africa. He added that he had been in touch with Chief Executive James Dimon several times through the night.

At Citigroup , Chief Executive Michael Corbat stayed up until about 11:30 p.m. Thursday watching the results come in, according to a person familiar with the matter. He slept for an hour and a half before getting on the phone at 1 a.m. with other executives. He slept again for an hour at 4 a.m., before arriving at the office at 6 a.m. Friday.

Underscoring the situation's severity, the Fed's point person on regulation, Governor Daniel Tarullo called the heads of several large U.S. financial institutions Friday to gauge how those firms and markets were faring, according to people familiar with the matter.

Like other financial firms, J.P. Morgan is still assessing what the Brexit vote means. The bank employs around 16,000 people in the U.K. At Morgan Stanley , top executives wrote a memorandum to employees Friday to quell rumors that it would move employees from its U.K. offices.

In terms of the big U.S. banks' direct exposures to Europe, Goldman Sachs Group Inc . got around 26% of its 2015 revenue from the continent, more than any of its peers, according to analysts at Wells Fargo & Co . In terms of balance-sheet risk, J.P. Morgan had around $144 billion in loans, securities and other exposure to countries in the EU at the end of the first quarter, with around 35% of that in the U.K., according to a securities filing.

For European banks, the potential outcomes are bleakest.  I'm afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe," Deutsche Bank Chief Executive John Cryan said in a statement.  At this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there's no doubt that they will be negative on all sides."

Europe's banks were already retrenching before the vote and markets remain fearful many don't have thick enough capital buffers. Even before the vote, shares were valued at levels that signaled distress; Deutsche Bank trades at just 30% of its book value, or net worth.

Contributing to the woes of European banks is an anemic economic backdrop despite extraordinary stimulus measures from the European Central Bank that have included buying bonds and the introduction of negative rates for some deposits banks keep with the central bank.

One big question for U.S. banks is how any further economic and market disruption in Europe will affect already subpar U.S. growth. Worrying, even if it doesn't ding the economy too much, market and political turmoil could keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates further.

That means banks could continue to labor under superlow rates, which weigh on profits. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, for example, fell to 1.57% Friday from 1.74% before the U.K. decision Thursday.

But while bank stocks were battered, credit markets weren't panicking. The cost of insuring big, U.S. banks against default jumped Friday, but remained low compared with the cost during market turmoil a few years ago. Bank executives in London said there was no pressure on interbank funding, which is crucial to keep financial markets functioning.

What's more, there weren't visible signs Friday of bank distress. That is a difference between today and 2008, according to Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of research firm Federal Financial Analytics .

 The reason is market confidence in the resilience of the largest U.S. and U.K. banks this time, counterparties know they can count on these banks for the funding that is their lifeblood," she wrote in a note Friday.  What's going on now is ugly, but not cataclysmic."

Banks Clear 'Stress Tests' --- In first round of Fed's stress tests, all 33 firms pass bar; second round is next week

WASHINGTON -- The largest U.S. banks have significantly bolstered their defenses against an economic downturn, and could continue lending even during a deep recession, the Federal Reserve said.

That signals that many of those institutions will win regulators' approval next week to boost dividends to investors.

In the first part of the Fed's annual "stress tests" released Thursday, some of the country's biggest banks, such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., fared particularly well, with their capital ratios -- a key measure of financial strength -- increasing briskly from levels seen during last year's drill and comfortably exceeding the level that the regulator views as a minimum.

A senior Fed official, in a conference call with reporters, noted the broad improvement banks had made in recent years, saying they entered this year's exam with more capital and higher-quality loans. They also benefited as the heavy legal costs from their role in the financial crisis recede.

Next week, the Fed will release the second part of the tests, which include regulators' decisions on whether to allow or block banks' plans to return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks.

Thursday's results don't necessarily predict the Fed's verdict next week, since in the second round the Fed judges banks not just by their balance sheets, but by how officials assess banks' risk-management practices.

Overall, the Fed calculated that 33 of the largest U.S. banks would have loan losses of $385 billion under a hypothetical scenario that envisions the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubling to 10%, the stock market losing half its value and financial markets becoming so topsy-turvy that short-term U.S. Treasury rates turn negative as investors pay the U.S. government to hold their money. Even with those big losses, they would still have enough capital to satisfy regulators, the Fed said.

This year's exams were "arguably the most stressful stress tests yet," said Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi in a statement.

Big bank shares added to their gains of the day in after-hours trading after the results were released, with shares of the biggest six U.S. banks -- J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- rising between 0.3% and 2.2%.

The stress tests were created during the financial crisis and helped in 2009 to convince panicky investors that big banks weren't on the brink of collapse. Congress in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law made annual stress tests mandatory, and the Fed has adopted its own rules tying shareholder dividends to the tests.

The goal is to force banks to manage their finances in a way that they would be able to keep lending during the worst economic conditions and to diminish the risk of big bank failures.

The stress tests are just one of several new drills that regulators have been running with banks to prevent a new crisis.

They also have to file annual "living wills" which show how -- if all of those other defenses collapse and the banks find themselves on the brink of bankruptcy -- they could be unwound without an infusion of taxpayer funds or without traumatizing the broader financial system.

Despite Thursday's results, Fed officials say they are going to force the very largest banks to maintain even more capital, in part because stress tests won't necessarily anticipate the source of the next crisis.

Critics say the Fed programs are overkill, going to extremes to prevent a crisis while hampering the economy's ability to recover from the last one.

"I think the Fed is trying to make these entities fail-proof; I think it's kind of spilling over the entire financial community," Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R., Texas) told Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen during a congressional hearing Wednesday. "We've got economists trying to run banks," he added, blaming that for "anemic growth."

The stress tests "will make you very safe," Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan told a Wall Street Journal conference last week. "The question is whether it restricts lending."

Fed defenders say the tests have made banks stronger, and stronger banks make more loans than weaker ones.

This is the second year in a row in which all the banks taking the tests maintained capital levels above what the Fed views as a minimum allowance. The Fed said the banks collectively maintained at least 8.4% high-quality capital as a share of assets, staying well above the Fed's 4.5% minimum even after being pounded by a severe economic downturn. That was also better than the 7.6% in high-quality capital they maintained in last year's test. The banks collectively started this round of tests with 12.3% capital at the end of 2015.

The Fed says banks have more than doubled their capital since 2009, boosting common equity by more than $700 billion.

The Fed changes the details of its recession scenarios from year to year, so the specifics can hit one type of bank harder than another. Relative to last year, this year's negative-rate scenario took a tougher toll on traditional banking businesses that rely on deposits as a source of funding, the senior Fed official said. That was a contrast from last year, when large trading banks were harder hit than in the past because the Fed in that scenario assumed significant corporate defaults. The low-rates scenario also helped to boost trading revenue for the biggest banks by limiting stock-price declines and market volatility, the Fed official said.

This led all six of the biggest U.S. banks to show higher predicted net revenue before credit losses in the test. J.P. Morgan's predicted revenue more than doubled compared with last year's exam, and that of Goldman Sachs quintupled. That, along with a higher starting point for their capital bases, helped all six post minimum capital levels in the test that were higher than those registered in last year's exams.

In addition to running the stress tests on their current balance sheets, the banks have also submitted to the Fed their desired plans to return capital to investors, making the case that they could pass the test even after making those payouts.

If the firms determine, based on Thursday's results, that their capital plans would push them below the Fed's minimum required threshold, they have until Saturday to take a one-time shot at a "mulligan" -- cutting their request for dividends or buybacks to stay above the Fed's minimum requirement.

Thoma Bravo LLC has bought Bomgar Corp., a maker of remote support and access management applications, from TA Associates Inc., according to a news release.

TA Associates bought a majority stake in the company in 2014 along with other investors, including Golub Capital.

Golub Capital in a separate new release said it financed Thoma Bravo's buyout of Bomgar and that it would continue to support the company under its new owners. Additional financial terms of the deal, including the amount Thoma Bravo is investing and its percentage of ownership, weren't disclosed.

Bomgar, founded in 2003 and based in Jackson, Miss., offers remote support software that allows IT service desks and support centers to provide remote assistance securely through firewalls to any remote desktop, server, point-of-service system or mobile device; an access management application to secure and control insider and vendor access; and software to help companies manage passwords. Its products are used by more than 10,000 organizations globally, the release said.

Thoma Bravo, with offices in Chicago and San Francisco, generally makes equity investments of $100 million to more than $1 billion, including co-investments, in software companies, particularly in enterprise, infrastructure and security. It generally looks for companies with more than $20 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, its website says.

Earlier this month, it closed a take-private deal for Qlik Technologies Inc., which makes data-analytics software, for about $3 billion.

TA Associates makes equity investments of $50 million to $500 million in companies valued between $100 million and $3 billion, its website says. This month, the Boston firm made a growth-equity investment in Maintenance Connection Inc., which makes software to manage maintenance systems.

William Blair & Co. advised Bomgar on the sale, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP was its legal adviser. Ropes & Gray LLP advised Thoma Bravo.

Executives Ask Agency for More Rules on Fintech; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency hosting Thursday forum to review industry comments, many of which call for more regulation

WASHINGTON An event Thursday aimed at exploring how policy makers should oversee financial technology is set to be the scene of a rarity: financial-services firms asking for more regulation.

The national bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is hosting the daylong public forum at its Washington headquarters to review comments it received the past few months in response to a report on overseeing fintech.

Many of the 60 comment letters submitted were paradoxical to the banking industry, which has long argued it is overburdened with regulation. Many of the commenters including executives at banks such as Citigroup Inc. and online lenders like LendingClub Corp. were "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fintech-startup-craves-more-regulation-1465517775" in the hope that it would provide clarity on how they can develop new technology or form partnerships between banks and fintech firms.

 Focus on making regulatory expectations very clear, and coordinated with other regulatory agencies," wrote Richard Neiman, head of regulatory and government affairs at LendingClub, the largest online lender.

LendingClub has partnerships with dozens of large and small banks but Mr. Neiman said many of those banks perceive  regulators have not been clear in their expectations" of such partnerships.  This perception of unclear regulatory expectations prevents many banks from moving forward with platform arrangements, and forgoing the benefits they offer," he said.

Heather Cox, the chief of Citi's fintech operation, said it would be  invaluable" to have further guidance on how banks should oversee their third-party partners that are new or not a part of the bank's core function, such as new data analytics of borrowers.

 As we seek to provide relevant offers and new services to consumers, we perform exhaustive reviews of new data sources and models to insure that we treat consumers fairly and do not disadvantage any of our diverse communities," Ms. Cox wrote.  Improved guidance on the level of due diligence and required documentation would assist in testing and implementing new programs."

Consumer advocates also supported "http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-see-risks-in-online-lending-technology-behind-digital-currencies-1466549690" but took a more hard-line stance by cautioning the OCC that some fintech firms can team up with a national bank, which exempts them from certain state laws, for instance those including interest-rate caps for consumer loans. Many consumer groups also oppose an OCC idea to create a federal charter for fintech firms. A federal charter would help such firms avoid having to go state-by-state for licensing, but it could also give them pre-emption from certain state laws.

 Partnerships should not be used to evade state consumer protection laws, and we oppose a federal charter for fintech companies," wrote Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, slated to be a panelist at the OCC forum.  Fintech companies also need to be supervised directly, in addition to the indirect supervision they may receive through bank regulators."

Not every commenter agreed with further regulation. In an interesting twist, Meredith Fuchs who recently left a post as acting deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to join Capital One Financial said the OCC's existing guidance on third-party oversight and risk management was enough.

 Given the significant risk management progress made by the banking industry, we do not believe that any additional OCC regulations or formal guidelines are necessary to further define or enhance the concept of  responsible innovation,' " said Ms. Fuchs, senior vice president and chief counsel on regulatory issues at Capital One.

Instead, Ms. Fuchs said the OCC should take a  principles-based" approach on fintech supervision rather than using  one-size-fits-all regulations."

Millions Rise Out of Ranks Of Subprime Borrowers

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Copyright  2016, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

The percentage of Americans with subprime credit scores has fallen to the lowest level in more than a decade, a development that could give bank lending and the overall economy a boost.

The share of U.S. adults with credit scores that are considered "subprime" fell to 20.7% in April, the sixth consecutive year-over-year decline and the lowest level since at least 2005, when Fair Isaac Corp., or FICO, started tracking the data. The ranks of subprime borrowers swelled during the financial crisis, peaking at 25.5% in 2010, as mortgage payments, credit-card bills and other debts went unpaid.

The improving trend could bring relief to big banks, which tightened credit standards in the wake of the crisis. An increase in more-creditworthy borrowers could allow them to increase lending without lowering standards. Banks are desperate for revenue growth since the same superlow rates helping borrowers are also squeezing their own profits.

"It will have a positive impact on loan volume, loan growth and revenue," Morgan Whitacre, a consumer client underwriting executive at Bank of America Corp., said. Credit-card and auto lending would be the first areas to benefit.

This, in turn, could bolster consumer spending and the U.S. economy. As more people gain access to credit, consumer spending in the short term should rise, said Rob Martin, U.S. economist at Barclays PLC. "It frees people from having to spend only the cash they have on hand," he said.

"It's good for the economy in the sense that there's a lot less risk in the credit that's extended," he added.

In some ways, the improvement is natural as the housing downturn and financial crisis fade further into the past. After a set number of years, foreclosures or missed debt payments drop off consumers' credit reports, helping increase their scores and expanding their access to financing. This is particularly true for subprime borrowers, or those whose FICO credit scores range from 300 to 599 on a scale that tops out at 850.

There are other factors at work: The economy has recovered since the financial crisis and the unemployment rate, at 4.7%, is less than half of its late-2009 peak. Wage growth of around 2% isn't as high as the Federal Reserve would like, but it is still providing consumers with more firepower.

Superlow interest rates have played a big role. Monthly debt-service payments accounted for 10.07% of households' disposable personal income at the end of last year, down from a peak of 13.21% at the end of 2007, according to Fed data. Low interest rates, which have lessened required monthly payments for many borrowers, have helped bring this figure down.

Many borrowers have also been paying down credit-card debt, a move that can help increase their credit scores. Martha Souder, an administrative assistant in Silver Spring, Md., says she currently has a credit score of about 712. That is up sharply from around545 in 2012, when she had roughly $50,000 in debt spread between 25 to 30 credit cards, many of which were maxed out.

"I have suffered a really long time, and it was a crushing burden," she said. Her goal is to buy a house in coming years.

Meanwhile, as credit scores are rising, defaults are near record lows. Some 0.81% of consumer-loan dollars -- including mortgages, auto loans and general-purpose credit cards -- were in default as of May, the lowest level in records going back to 2004, according to the S&P/Experian Consumer Credit Default Composite Index. This is down from 0.88% a year ago and a peak of 5.51% in May 2009. Much of that improvement is due to plummeting mortgage defaults in recent years.

"People are putting those delinquencies further and further in the rearview mirror," said Ethan Dornhelm, senior director of scores and analytics at FICO.

Borrowers also are managing their debt more responsibly, with fewer incidences of defaults and collections. Some 11.8% of borrowers were 90 days or more past due on at least one debt obligation during the 12 months through April, down from 13.3% during the 12 months through October 2013, according to FICO.

Already, consumers are starting to borrow more again. Auto-loan balances surpassed $1 trillion for the first time ever this year, according to credit-reporting firm Experian. Credit-card debt is on pace to hit $1 trillion this year. Student-loan debt continues to swell.

That does raise some concerns. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief James Dimon earlier this month called the auto-lending market "a little stretched." And Synchrony Financial, the largest U.S. retail-store card issuer by purchase volume and balances, recently increased its forecast for credit losses forthe next 12 months. Separately, May marked the fifth consecutive month of higher defaults for general-purpose credit cards.

Still, consumer-loan default levels remain at historically low levels. In addition, household balance sheets have gone through years of postcrisis repair. U.S. household debt was equal to 102% of disposable income at the end of the first quarter, Fed data show, down markedly from a peak of about 130% in late 2007.

Mobile Ad Firm Verve Acquires Beacon Company Roximity

The mobile ad company Verve, which helps marketers target people with ads using location data, is acquiring Roximity Inc., a Denver-based startup that manages a network of beacons in stores across the U.S.

Verve recently raised $30 million in debt financing through its partnership with Silicon Valley Bank . Some of that new funding will be used to pay for Roximity, said Verve Chief Executive Nada Stirratt .

Roximity's investors included Fenox Venture Capital , Fraser McCombs Capital and Ludlow Ventures .

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

The 11-year-old Verve provides software and analytics to 25,000 mobile apps and websites, such as apps like WeatherBug and a range of local news and information websites owned by media companies including Meredith Corp . and Gannett's Co.'s USA Today . Verve sells ads for 40,000 mobile publishers overall.

The company is able to collect first-party location data on 30 million devices from these relationships, which it then uses to deliver targeted mobile ads.

Now, the plan is to take that location data and connect it with Roximity's beacon data culled from 35,000 store locations (such as Starbucks ) to start helping marketers gauge whether mobile ads spur visits to stores.

More retailers are placing beacons small pieces of hardware in their stores in the U.S. These retailers, in partnership with beacon providers, can track when people enter stores and, in some cases, even when they visit specific aisles. Companies like Apple have been investing in this area.

Beacons like Roximity's product emit a unique Bluetooth signal. In this case, as long as a person has installed an app on their phone that Verve's software is connected to and they've opted in to allow that app to use their location, a beacon can ping their phone. Roximity can use that beacon signal to determine where a person's phone is near a store's entrance or in a particular aisle. The beacon devices only work when a person is nearby, and they don't know exactly who the individual is.

Tom Kenney , Verve's chief innovation officer and co-founder, said the combination of the two companies' technologies should prove more powerful than typical data pulled from just mobile devices.

 GPS is good," he said.  But it is sometimes not great. The best and most accurate data comes from beacons." As a result of the deal and Roximity's partnerships with retailers, Verve should have access to direct, first-party data from over 50 million mobile devices, he said.

In an interview with CMO Today at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Ms. Stirratt said that for too long, when it comes to mobile location data, the ad industry has focused on the idea of beaming someone a coupon when they walk past a Starbucks . That sort of tactic is a smaller part of Verve's business.

The bigger opportunity is using a person's anonymously collected location history to serve that person an ad at a later time, Ms. Stirratt said. And with Roximity's data, Verve should be able to better prove that location-based advertising drives results, she said.  Brands want to see this is working, and attribution is a big deal," she said.

For instance, Roximity has beacons installed in National CineMedia movie theaters. Instead of delivering an ad to a moviegoer when they are already headed to the latest blockbuster and have probably made up their mind about what they want to see, Verve can use Roximity's data to put together a collection of anonymous mobile phone users who have visited certain theaters multiple times over a given period and send those people ads at a later date for the next big summer movie on the calendar.

According to Ms. Stirratt, Verve is profitable and has grown revenue by 50% over the past four years.

In addition to pushing into beacon technology, Ms. Stirratt said that Verve is starting a new initiative aimed at creating better, more mobile-appropriate ad units, including an ad that people will be able to save on their phones and respond to later so as not to interrupt their mobile content experiences.

Deutsche Brse set to launch fintech VC fund; Capital markets

Deutsche Brse, Europe's largest exchanges operator, is to shake up its disparate investments with the creation of a venture capital fund targeting fintech in capital markets.

The DB1 Ventures fund will make new investments in the emerging technology and offload some of its existing minority shareholdings in start-up companies.

The exchange is seeking to boost its single-digit growth rates by turning to fintech , or financial technology, one of the software industry's fastest-growing subsections. Profits at banks are under pressure from spiralling regulatory costs and low interest rates, while faster and cheaper computing power is allowing outsiders to handle vast quantities of data far more easily.

Venture capital-backed fintech companies raised $14.4bn of financing last year - almost double the previous year - according to a report from KPMG International and CB Insights.

"The future exchange and market infrastructure organisation will have a larger responsibility in fostering growth and innovation throughout financial markets," said Carsten Kengeter , Deutsche Brse's chief executive. "Technology is at the core of our business, so partnering with innovative fintech firms that are relevant for our clients is an absolute priority for us."

Rivals have also encouraged innovation in financial markets, following a path taken two years ago by CME Group. ICAP, the interdealer broker, will also make venture capital investments a significant part of its growth when it becomes NEX Group .

The fund will focus on areas such as market operator infrastructure, digitisation of post-trade services and big data and analytics. The move will be "formalising and institutionalising investing within Deutsche Brse", said Ankur Kamalia, head of venture portfolio management at the exchange, and responsible for DB1 Ventures. "It's not a fintech fund that will invest randomly. It will invest only in areas that are strategic to Deutsche Brse," he added.

Deutsche Brse's investments include minority stakes in fixed-income platforms Digital Vega and GMEX , and a venture to trade capacity for cloud computing, as well as a trade repository it runs with Spain's Bolsas y Mercados Espaoles (BME).

However, since Mr Kengeter's arrival, it has started to rejig its portfolio, selling off a 50 per cent stake in Infobolsa, a data provider, to BME for  ¬8.2m.

AppZen Inc. wants to use artificial intelligence to automate the back-office tasks that legacy software providers have dominated for decades.

The Sunnyvale, Calif., startup raised $2.9 million in seed funding led by Resolute Ventures. Bloomberg Beta, Silicon Valley Bank, Mastercard and FundersClub also participated in the round.

AppZen has used its machine-learning algorithms to help companies identify fraudulent expenses. Chief Executive Anant Kale said the software has discovered employees charging their companies for Netflix subscriptions, spa trips and even jewelry store purchases.

Many software tools exist for employees to manage and submit their expenses, such as SAP-owned Concur and privately held Expensify. But Mr. Kale said few others are paying attention to the auditing work companies have to do behind the scenes, which can gobble up staff time.

 It's letting you automate those functions of the back office," Mr. Kale said.

AppZen plans to create products to address other back-office tasks.

Its customers include Hitachi Ltd., Sunrun Inc. and Cantor Fitzgerald L.P.

 A lot of large enterprises are reluctant to do a deal with an early-stage startup," said Resolute Ventures Partner Raanan Bar-Cohen.  When you go through the list of AppZen's customers, there's some really large companies. That's a really positive signal."

Oi s Bankruptcy Filing Drags Down Banco do Brasil s Shares; Banks is owed more than $1.5 billion by distressed phone company, which sees its own shares fall 18%

SO PAULO Shares of Brazil's largest bank took a hit Tuesday, a day after telephone company Oi SA"http://www.wsj.com/articles/telecom-oi-files-largest-bankruptcy-request-in-brazils-history-1466463734" and raised the likelihood of steep losses for creditors owed nearly $19 billion by the troubled carrier.

State-controlled Banco do Brasil SA, the country's biggest bank by assets, finished down 4.5%. Oi's shares fell 18%.

Private-sector lenders Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA opened lower, then recovered over the course of the day. Itau ended at 29.39 reais, from 29.40 on Monday, after falling as much as 2.6% during the day, and Banco Bradesco SA fell as much as 1.8% before turning positive before the close of trading.

Oi's debt to Banco do Brasil is estimated at more than 5 billion Brazilian reais, while Itau and Bradesco are said to be owed some 1.5 billion reais each by the telecommunications company, according to Joo Pedro Brugger, an analyst at investment company Leme Investimentos. The three banks declined to comment.

At the end of March, about one-quarter of the roughly 50 billion reais ($14.75 billion) Oi owed to lenders was in the hands of commercial banks. Oi owes billions more to Brazil's tax agency, the country's telecoms regulator and others. Monday's filing by Oi and six subsidiaries lists 65.4 billion reais ($19.26 billion) in total debt.

A brutal recession has sent bankruptcy filings soaring in Brazil, forcing banks to boost their reserves. Ois bankruptcy protection request will further weigh on the financial sector, said Luis Miguel Santacreu, an analyst with credit-ratings firm Austin Rating.

 This happens at a difficult time [for Brazil] and requests for bankruptcy protection will probably continue to increase," he said.

Oi's shares were suspended several times on Tuesday as the price of its preferred shares plunged as much as 30% soon after they started trading. The shares fell as much as 31% during the day and closed down 18.2%, while the benchmark Ibovespa index finished up 1%.

Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service all said Tuesday they downgraded their ratings for Oi. Fitch, which had downgraded Oi just last Friday as well, cited the phone company's  debt-laden precarious capital structure" and negative free cash flow generation.

Oi, Brazil's fourth-largest telecom firm, blamed its financial collapse on a series of factors, including heavy borrowing to complete mergers and acquisitions that have not helped the firm close the technology gap with its main competitors.

Telecoms clients now favor mobile telephones and broadband internet access, and Oi has had less success than its competitors in penetrating those two markets. Oi's two mergers, with Brasil Telecom SA and Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, failed to have the desired effect of improving its balance sheet.

 Oi has financial and operations problems, competition is hard, the market is very regulated and technology becomes obsolete fast," said Alexandre Furtado Montes, a telecommunications analyst at Rio de Janeiro-based consulting firm Lopes Filho.

The company posted a net loss of 1.64 billion reais (about $476 million) in the first quarter, compared with a loss of 447 million reais in the prior-year period. Net revenue dropped 4% over the same period.

Oi, which has a 34.4% share of Brazil's fixed-line market and about 70 million clients, asked a Rio de Janeiro court late Monday for protection from creditors, the equivalent to a chapter 11 filing in the U.S., after debt restructuring talks with creditors recently.

Earlier this month, Chief Executive Officer Bayard Gontijo resigned while the talks were still open. The company gave no specific reason for his departure, but people close to him said he backed a proposal to convert debt into equity and give bondholders a controlling stake in the restructured company.

The plan, however, was opposed by the firms main shareholder, Bratel BV, which was created by former shareholders of Portugal Telecom using the official name Pharol SGPS. Pharol controls 27.2% of Oi shares directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.

 The main reason for Ois bankruptcy protection request is Pharol," Mr. Montes said, noting Oi has a market capitalization of only about 1 billion reais, and owes more than 30 times its value to international creditors. Shareholders  lost the company a long time ago, it's no longer theirs," he added.

Pharol supported Oi's bankruptcy filing plan, and rejected the deal favored by Mr. Gontijo, because it didn't want to dilute its stake so sharply, according to people familiar with the situation. Pharol on Tuesday said it reaffirms its  determination to continue to defend the value of its main asset."

Shareholders including Pharol had been negotiating with creditors represented by investment bank Moelis & Co, which will continue working with international investors such as Pacific Investment Management and Co., Citadel LLC and Wellington Management Co, according to a person close to the negotiations.

The indebted company could also be sold or merge with a local or international telecommunications player, some analysts said.

Oi could also sell only a specific business or one of its subsidiaries, said Arthur Almeida, a So Paulo-based legal analyst at DebtwireAnalytics. Its large base of fixed-line clients could be helpful to a competitor wanting to expand its businesses in other segments as well, Mr. Almeida noted.

 It's possible one of the larger telecommunications companies operating in Brazil may show interest in Oi. It's also viable that an international candidate could come up, as Brazil is cheap for outsiders,   said Leme's Mr. Brugger.

Oi has been roiled by management instability and failed attempts to find new sources of capital. Marco Schroeder, who replaced Mr. Gontijo earlier in this month, is the company's sixth chief executive since 2011. A potential deal with Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman to help Oi finance a merger with Telecom Italia SpA's Brazilian unit fell through in February.

Local news media have reported that Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris, owner of Global Telecom, is considering purchasing part of Oi.

Euronext on the alert for merger fallout; Interview: Stphane Boujnah on the alert for merger fallout; Interview:

Combination of region's big two promises potential targets for the pan-European group

Stphane Boujnah , the chief executive of pan-European exchange Euronext, refuses to be left out of the consolidation that is shaking up his industry.

In the middle of a proposed $30bn mega-merger between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Brse to create an European exchange group to rival those in the US and Asia, he has his own card to play.

With Euronext's strong cash generation and low debt, "we will be able to move very quickly for very significant targets if opportunities come up", he says in his office in La Dfense, the Paris business district.

"There are independent exchanges in the eurozone that may want to reconsider their future," says the 52-year-old former Santander banker who took the helm at Euronext in November. "They may want to be part of a pan-European exchange group where they can still keep their identity but grow at the same time."

Euronext, which was spun out of Intercontinental Exchange of the US in an initial public offering in 2014, runs bourses in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The remaining independents in the region include Madrid, Luxembourg and Vienna.

Others potential targets include any exchanges that have to be sold to win regulatory approval for the LSE-Deutsche Brse deal, which is expected to close at the start of next year.

"Some assets might be sold [as part of the deal], and some of those assets might be interesting to look at," he says.

Analysts point to the LSE's 57 per cent stake in LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for derivative and bond trades, and Deutsche Brse's ownership of Clear-stream, one of the region's biggest settlement houses.

Large deals are not the core of Euro-next's three-year strategy, however. Its official plan, outlined in May, is to grow "quasi-organically", investing  ¬100m to  ¬150m by 2019 to diversify away from its core equity strength. The group wants to grow in areas such as data analytics, exchange traded funds, open-source indices and commodities.

Euronext plans to increase revenue about 5 per cent a year and increase group operating margins from 57 per cent - one of the highest in Europe - to between 61 and 63 per cent by 2019.

Mr Boujnah says the group cannot just be "more efficient", however. "When you are small, you can be agile, and you must be agile . . . The conditions are there for us to be able to use our balance sheet to react very quickly."

An interest in larger deals comes in part because Euronext, with a market value of about  ¬2.4bn, is four times smaller than LSE and Deutsche Brse. The expected merger would make Euronext a minnow in Europe.

Mr Boujnah stresses that the LSE-Deutsche Brse combination is far from done. "All I can say is that the last 20 years show that these transformational deals always take a lot longer than expected and never turn out as initially anticipated."

He highlights some of the potential hurdles. "The Deutsche Brse shareholders, the LSE shareholders, the European Commission, the prudential supervisors and various other regulators in Germany all need to sign off on this. Anything can happen."

Careful not to criticise the deal itself, he says there could be competition issues creating a trading group some 10 times the size of Euronext, its next largest competitor in Europe.

The planned combination of LCH and Eurex Clearing "is essentially combining two banks", Mr Boujnah says, and so could raise "too big to fail issues".

There is also the risk that the value of the two companies will change, particularly after this week's referendum on whether or not the UK will remain in the EU, he says.

"It is always difficult to deliver any paper deal a year from closing, let alone with Brexit in the middle."

His carefully chosen words belie the intense lobbying that is going on in France against the British-German deal.

Last month Michel Sapin, French finance minister, said he wanted to "express the concern of the French government on this tie-up . . . We have doubts about the consequences this could have for the financing of the real economy in France and Europe".

If a deal goes ahead, says Mr Boujnah, it will not change his core strategy. "They [LSE and Deutsche Brse] will focus on being a global player in indices, derivatives and post-trade," he says.

Euronext's focus in on profitability, strengthening the core business, and to "focus on financing the real economy in Europe", he says.

Business
Mobile Ad Firm Verve Acquires Beacon Company Roximity; Verve plans to help brands track whether mobile ads drive people to stores

The mobile ad company Verve, which helps marketers target people with ads using location data, is acquiring Roximity, a Denver-based startup that manages a network of beacons in stores across the U.S.

Verve recently raised $30 million in debt financing through its partnership with Silicon Valley Bank. Some of that new funding will be used to pay for Roximity, said Verve Chief Executive Nada Stirratt.

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

The 11-year old Verve provides software and analytics to 25,000 mobile apps and websites, such as apps like WeatherBug and a range of local news and information websites owned by media companies including Meredith Corp. and Gannett's Co.'s USA Today. Verve sells ads for 40,000 mobile publishers overall.

The company is able to collect first-party location data on 30 million devices from these relationships, which it then uses to deliver targeted mobile ads.

Now, the plan is to take that location data and connect it with Roximity's beacon data culled from 35,000 store locations (such as Starbucks) to start helping marketers gauge whether mobile ads spur visits to stores.

More retailers are placing beacons small pieces of hardware in their stores in the U.S. These retailers, in partnership with beacon providers, can track when people enter stores and, in some cases, even when they visit specific aisles. Companies like "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-latest-offering-explores-the-great-indoors-1401655436".

Beacons like Roximity's product emit a unique Bluetooth signal. In this case, as long as a person has installed an app on their phone that Verve's software is connected to and they've opted in to allow that app to use their location, a beacon can ping their phone. Roximity can use that beacon signal to determine where a person's phone is near a store's entrance or in a particular aisle. The beacon devices only work when a person is nearby, and they don't know exactly who the individual is.

Tom Kenney, Verve's chief innovation officer and co-founder, said the combination of the two companies' technologies should prove more powerful than typical data pulled from just mobile devices.

 GPS is good," he said.  But it is sometimes not great. The best and most accurate data comes from beacons." As a result of the deal and Roximity's partnerships with retailers, Verve should have access to direct, first-party data from over 50 million mobile devices, he said.

In an interview with CMO Today at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Ms. Stirratt said that for too long, when it comes to mobile location data, the ad industry has focused on the idea of beaming someone a coupon when they walk past a Starbucks. That sort of tactic is a smaller part of Verve's business.

The bigger opportunity is using a person's anonymously collected location history to serve that person an ad at a later time, Ms. Stirratt said. And with Roximity's data, Verve should be able to better prove that location-based advertising drives results, she said.  Brands want to see this is working, and attribution is a big deal," she said.

For instance, Roximity has beacons installed in National CineMedia movie theaters. Instead of delivering an ad to a moviegoer when they are already headed to the latest blockbuster and have probably made up their mind about what they want to see, Verve can use Roximity's data to put together a collection of anonymous mobile phone users who have visited certain theaters multiple times over a given period of time and send those people ads at a later date for the next big summer movie on the calendar.

According to Ms. Stirratt, Verve is profitable and has grown revenue by 50% over the past four years.

In addition to pushing into beacon technology, Ms. Stirratt said that Verve is starting a new initiative aimed at creating better, more mobile-appropriate ad units, including an ad that people will be able to save on their phones and respond to later so as not to interrupt their mobile content experiences.

Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen testified before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, June 21, 2016. Here is a transcript of the hearing, provided by Federal News Service.

SHELBY: The committee will come to order.

Today, we received testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen regarding the Fed's semi-annual report on monetary policy. While Humphrey Hawkins' testimony is a key part of Congress' oversight ofour nation's central bank, it is not sufficient to provide Congress and the American public with a full picture of Fed policy making.

I have often remarked during these hearings about the importance of striking the right balance between transparency and independence. One of the Fed's stated reasons for maintaining its independence is to avoid politicizing its decisions.

I agree that politics have no place at the Federal Reserve, and while the line between politics and policy can be quite fine, it should, nonetheless, be clear and unambiguous. The Fed should act, I believe, in a manner consistent with its statutory mandate in the interest of the stability of the U.S. economy, whether or not such policies are aligned with the goals of Congress or the administration.

Our central bank is independent and should remain so. The desire to preserve the Fed's independence should not preclude consideration of additional measures to increase the transparency of the board's actions. In fact, some have argued that better disclosure of monetary policy strategy could actually bolster independence.

Earlier this year, a prominent group of economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, agreed in a statement that, and I'll quote,  Publicly reporting a strategy helps prevent policymakers from bending under pressure and sacrificing independence." The Fed continues to resist calls by Congress to disclose monetary rules, even though it claims it uses such rules regularly.

It is public communication the Fed has veered further away from data-driven analysis towards the exercise of even more discretion.

For example, rather than adhering precisely to its stated goals for inflation and employment, the Federal Open Market Committee appears to base certain decisions on factors such as, quote, "Financial and international developments that cannot be derived from quantitative analysis."

Similarly, the Fed's regulatory conduct is becoming increasingly opaque and complicated. This is demonstrated by the inherent complexity and overlap in its capital and liquidity rules, stress testing and resolution and recovery planning. Two weeks ago, a panel of experts testified before this committee that complex regulations might actually increase, rather than decrease risk in the banking system. They also criticized the lack of analysis and transparency in the rulemaking process.

This is especially true of the Basel Rules established by the international committee and imposed by domestic regulators on our institutions without adequate tailoring. The Fed did not even do its own quantitative study for Basel III as it did, Madam Chair, for Basel I and II. It instead relied on the Basel Committee's analysis, which included data from only 13 -- only 13 U.S. banks out of the 249 banks that were studied. Such an approach is concerning.

The Fed should perform, I believe, rigorous analysis, not only for each rule, but also on a cumulative impact of capital and liquidity regulations. If our banking regulation -- regulators are unable or unwilling to conduct such analysis then we should consider mandating it.

Even the European -- European Commission analyzes these factors in its regulatory framework. In a recent call for evidence, it solicited feedback from the public, quote, "to evaluate the interaction between financial regulations and asses their cumulative impact." We should expect no less from our regulators.

Chairman -- lady -- Yellen, I look forward to your testimony today and your thoughts on these important issues and I think it's a very important hearing.

Senator Brown.

BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam chair, welcome back to the committee. We're so glad you're here.

Since your last appearance, the economy has made only modest gains. Inflation remains low. Job creation seems to have slowed. Economies of our trading partners are struggling. Uncertainty, most notably with the possibility of Britain's exit from the European Union, uncertainty remains high.

The face of these headwinds, you would think that politicians here at home would do everything we could to promote our economy. Instead, many of them seem intent on doing just the opposite. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are failing to invest in infrastructure, in public works, in research and development, in education and training. The very building blocks of our economic success.

If that were not enough, they are trying their level best to undermine the safeguards that dampen the economic crisis and were erected to prevent the next one. They would like to repeal Dodd-Frank and return our country to the casino capitalism that caused so much ruin for families and communities across our country. And they are trying to politicize and undermine the Federal Reserve despite that key actions that it has taken to help the recovery. Congress rated its reserves and reduced dividend payments in order to pay for a transportation bill.

Many of my colleagues are trying to insert Congress into monetary policy decisions. This committee has yet to even hold a hearing on the two nominees to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve. Bad legislative ideas continue to multiply.

The presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is a factory of bad ideas. Moody's Analytics recently released a report that states that if adopted, his economic proposals would leave our economy, quote, "significantly weaker," unquote.

He suggested he replace the current Fed chair based on imagined partisan political considerations. That is a bad idea. You might argue that someone is failing to pursue the right course in monetary regulatory policy, but partisan labels should never be part of that discourse.

The presumptive nominee has suggested he would simply renegotiate or renege on our debt, comfortable in the belief that the United States can never default, quote, "because you print the money." In his opinion, he understands debt better than probably anybody. His words. He also thinks along with the runner-up for the Republican nomination that this country should return to the gold standard.

When Ron Paul was promoting this idea a few years ago, The Wall Street Journal reported on a poll of a panel of economists on whether a return to the gold standard would improve price stability and unemployment. The response was split between those who disagreed and those who strongly disagreed. Not one person thought it would help. So we don't know if it's just a bad idea or a really, really bad idea.

But as one University of Chicago professor put it, love of the gold standard implies macroeconomic illiteracy. If your own very good brain is your top consultant, I suppose unanimous opinion of a diverse group of economists does not count for much.

But for those of us in the evidence-based world, the prospect of this nominee trading imagined for real authority gives added significance to what we do in the banking committee and Congress. That's true in general. It's particularly true with maintaining the independence of the Federal Reserve and the other regulators of the financial services industry.

Madam Chair, I think you have shown your commitment to an independent data-driven Federal Reserve. I commend you for that, we are grateful for that, I hope we can work together to maintain it.

SHELBY: Madam Chair, your written testimony in its entirety will be made part of the hearing record. We welcome you here today again, you're no stranger to this committee and you proceed as you wish.

YELLEN: Thank you, Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the committee. I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semi-annual monetary policy report to the Congress. In my remarks today, I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy. Since my last appearance before this committee in February, the economy has made further progress toward the Federal Reserve's subjective of maximum employment. And while inflation has continued to run below our two percent objective, the Federal Open Market Committee expects inflation to rise to that level over the medium term.

However, the pace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed more recently, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate. In the labor market, the cumulative increase in jobs since its trough in early 2010, has now topped 14 million, while the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak. In addition, as we detail in the monetary policy report, jobless rates have declined for all major demographic groups including for African Americans and Hispanics.

Despite these declines however, it's troubling that unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall and that the annual income of the median African American household is still well below the median income of other U.S. households. During the first quarter of this year, job gains average 200,000 per month. Just a bit slower than last year's pace. And while the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent over this period, the labor force participation rate moved up noticeably.

In April and May however, the average pace of job gains slowed to only 80,000 per month, or about 100,000 per month after adjustment for the effects of the strike. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, but that decline mainly occurred because fewer people reported that hey were actively

seeking work. A broader measure of labor market slack it includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work, was unchanged in May and remains above its level prior to the recession. Of course it's important not to overreact to one or two reports. In several other timely indicators of timely labor market conditions still look favorable. One notable development is that there is some tentative signs that wage growth may finally be picking up.

That said, we will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the recent slowing in employment growth is transitory as we believe it is. Economic growth has been uneven over recent quarters. U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is currently estimated to have increased in an annual rate of only three quarters percent in the first quarter of this year.

Subdued far in growth and the appreciation of the dollar weighed on exports. While the energy sector was hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014. In addition, business investment outside of the energy sector was surprisingly weak. However, the available indicators point to a noticeable step up in GDP growth in the second quarter. In particular, consumer spending has picked up smartly in recent months. Supported by solid growth in real disposable income and the ongoing affects of the increases in household wealth. And housing has continued to recover gradually, aided by income gains and the very low levels of mortgage rates.

The recent pickup in household spending together with underlying conditions that are favorable for growth, lead me to be optimistic that we will see further improvements in the labor market and the economy more broadly over the next few years. Monetary policy remains accommodative. Low oil prices and ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes, and therefore consumer spending. Fiscal policy is now a small positive for growth and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. As a result, the FOMC expects that with gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen further.

Turning to inflation, overall consumer prices is measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased just one percent over the twelve months ending in April, up noticeable from its pace through much of last year, but still well short of the committee's two percent objective.

Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices and lower prices for imports. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to one and a half percent.

As the transitory influences holding down inflation fade, and the labor market strengthens further, the committee expects inflation to rise to two percent of the median term.

Nonetheless, in considering future policy decision, we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal. Of course, considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains. The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I'm optimistic about the longer run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue into the future.

Vulnerabilities in the global economy also remain. Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation and all ready very accommodative monetary policy, in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of an appetite for risk can change abruptly.

One development that could shift investors' sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. For all of these reasons, the committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and their implications for domestic economic activity, labor markets and inflation. I will turn next to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to promote maximum employment and price stability as mandated by Congress. Given the economic situation I just described, monetary policy has remained accommodative over the first half of this year. To support further improvements in the labor market and a return of inflation to our two percent objective.

Specifically, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at one quarter to one half percent and has kept the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer terms securities at an elevated level.

The committee's actions reflect a careful assessment of the appropriate setting for monetary policy taking into account continuing below target inflation and the mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth seen this year. Proceeding cautiously in raising the federal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary policy -- the monetary support to economic growth in place while we asses where the growth is returning to a moderate pace, whether the labor market will strengthen further and whether inflation will continue to make progress toward our two percent objective.

Another factor that supports taking a cautious approach in raising the federal funds rate, is that the federal funds rate is still near its effective lower band. If inflation were to remain persistently low or the labor market were to weaken the Committee would have only limited room to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. However if the economy were to overheat, and inflation seemed likely to move significantly or persistently above two percent, the FOMC could readily increase the target range to the federal funds rate.

The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further, and that the economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds, which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation and meager productivity growth mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards.

If these headwinds slowly fade over time, as the Committee expects, then gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be needed. In line with that view, most FOMC participants based on their projections prepared for the June meeting anticipate the values for the federal funds rate of less than one percent at the end of this year and less than two percent at the end of next year will be consistent with their assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Of course the economic outlook is uncertain, so monetary policy is by no means on a preset course and FOMC participants projections for the federal funds rate are not a predetermined plan for future policy.

The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and associate risks. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly. Conversely if the economy were to disappoint a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with their attainment over time.

The Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principle payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the statement released after the June FOMC meeting, we anticipate continuing this policy until normalization of the level of federal funds rate is well under way. Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to the effective lower band in the event of a future, large, adverse shock.

Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.

SHELBY: Madam Chair, in recent years the Fed has increasingly used forward guidance to shape market expectations. Our defense (ph) frequently incorrect predictions of interest rate increases have caused it to lose some credibility among some quarters. How would you rate the utility of your forward guidance over the past several months?

YELLEN: In the past several months we have used forward guidance less than we did in the aftermath of the financial crisis when we named calendar dates or gave explicit economic conditions that we would need to see prevailing in the economy before considering an increase in the federal funds rate. We used that forward guidance in the aftermath of the crisis in order to help market participants understand how serious the crisis was and how long we thought we would need to maintain the federal funds rate at a ...

SHELBY: Are you saying you're not using forward guidance now or you're not relying on it as much?

YELLEN: We're not relying very much on forward guidance. We do publish every three months participants' projections for the paths of the federal funds rate that they believe will be appropriate in light of their expectations about the performance of the economy and sometimes those paths which participants discuss in their remarks are thought to constitute forward guidance about policy.

I do believe those projections are helpful to the public in understanding the path of the economy that participants think is likely and how if those conditions prevail they would see monetary policy as evolving, but as I always emphasize on every occasion including in my prepared remarks those paths, while I think they're helpful, are not a preset plan and not in any way a commitment. We are constantly trying to evaluate in light of incoming information the outlook in risks and you see those paths change over time as we update our evaluation of the economic outlook and I think that's a critical part of monetary policy.

SHELBY: Has the slowing of the economy in certain areas caused you to kind of hold back a little bit at times the information that you see there?

YELLEN: For quite some time now we've seen mixed developments in the economy. Some sectors slowing because of the decline in energy prices, strong dollar foreign growth, others providing an offset.

Throughout, until the last couple of months, progress in the labor market has held up extremely well.

Now for the last few months as I mentioned job gains averaged 100,000 on a strike (ph) adjusted basis, which is a substantial slowdown from the first quarter and from last year.

And it is important for us to see ongoing progress in the labor market so that's something we want to carefully evaluate and use a focus of our attention, but economic growth has picked up from a weak pace and if that slowdown is a reflection of weak growth earlier in the year I'm hopeful that we will see stronger job gains going forward and while it is an important report I would also emphasize that it's important never to over-blow the significance of a single report or a short -- a small amount of data.

Other information about the labor market suggests it continues to perform well.

SHELBY: Do you see a clear path ahead as far as either trajectory going forward on the economy picking up, or are you not sure yet?

YELLEN: It's our expectation that is what you see in all of the projections that we're provided in connection last week with our June FOMC meeting, but of course there is uncertainty about that and given that inflation remains low we have the ability to watch economic developments and try to make sure the economy is on a favorable path before raising rates.

SHELBY: Madam Chair, the FOMC's target for the fed funds rate has been at one-half percent or lower since December, 2008. A report last year from the Bank of International Settlements found that the prolonged period of low interest rates may be damaging the U.S. economy resulting in, and I'll quote, "Too much debt and too little growth." In addition the report states, "The low rates may in part have contributed to costly financial booms and busts." Do you agree that persistently low interest rates can have negative long-term effects on the U.S. economy and could you explain?

YELLEN: Well, I believe that persistent low interest rates we've had have been essential to achieving the progress, but of course low rates can induce households or banks or firms to reach for yield and can stoke financial instability and we are very attentive to that possibility and I would not at this time say that the threats from low rates to moderate to financial stability are elevated. I do not think they're elevated at this time, but it is of course something that we need to watch because it can have that impact. You mention debt, I don't think we're seeing an (inaudible) build up of debt throughout theeconomy.

Leverage remains at moderate levels well below where it was prior to the crisis. We are looking at credit growth, which has picked up but is not at worrisome levels so we are monitoring for potential impacts of low rates on financial stability which I think is appropriate.

SHELBY: Madam Chair, in an interview earlier this month, Governor Tarullo stated that the Fed is reviewing the application stress test to regional banks and he used the word probably will exempt regional banks from the qualitative portion of CCAR. Last December, the Fed announced it was tailoring CCAR, but the tailoring turned out to be just a restatement of existing policy. What assurances can you give that this current review is a meaningful effort to tailor CCAR in a way that recognizes the different risk profiles of banks and if so, what do you expect -- when do you expect to publish such changes for comment?

YELLEN: So we are engaging in a five year very serious review that's been informed by consultation with both financial sector participants and outside economists, and I do think that you'll see meaningful changes the suggestion that Governor Tarullo made that banks between $50 and $250 billion that are subject to the stress test and CCAR might be left out of the qualitative portions of CCAR still the stress test would be applied but the full qualitative part of CCAR that relates to capital planning that they might be exempted form that. I think that's very likely, we will look at other changes as well that as you said, are designed to appropriately tailor it so that its impact is most significant for the largest and most systemic firms. It will be a very meaningful review and I believe we will be proceeding on it shortly.

SHELBY: My last observation has to do with you alluded to the fact that come Thursday there's a big referendum in the United Kingdom on to whether to stay in the European Union or start leaving -- what's the real implication or can you tell at this point, if the British were to leave the common market, on us? Could be implications for the common market and for Britain.

YELLEN: Well, it is a very important relationship. It would be significant for the United Kingdom and for Europe as a whole. I think it would usher in a period of uncertainty and it is very hard to predict, but there could a period of financial market volatility that would negatively affect financial conditions and the U.S. economic outlook that's by no means certain, but it is something that we will be carefully monitoring.

SHELBY: Thank you, Senator Brown.

BROWN: Thank you Mr. Chairman.

Madam Chair I first thank you for your work on the recent insurance rerolls (ph), I'm pleased that the Fed has put out an advanced notice for proposed rule making to implement capital standards for the two large insurance companies the two (inaudible) and the 12 insurance companies that are savings and loan holding companies.

I appreciate how quickly you've moved on this and your constructive dialogue with stakeholders. I think that your response to our efforts here made a huge difference in doing this right. This week, the banking committee will have a hearing -- second hearing on capital liquidity (ph) rules. Please discuss for us the Fed's approach to capital and liquidity (ph) rules for the nation's largest banks. Specifically, how these new rules made our financial system stronger.

YELLEN: So I do believe that the enhancements that we've put in place to capital and liquidity requirements that are tailored by firm size and systemic importance have made an enormous difference to the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial system. The quantity of capital at the largest banking work organizations is essentially double from before the crisis and the quality of that capital is very much higher. In addition to imposing higher static risk based capital and leverage requirements, our stress testing and capital planning exercises are very detailed forward looking exercises that are working to ensure that the largest firms in extremely stressful conditions would be able to go on supporting the credit needs of the U.S. economy of households and businesses and I think this has been a very significant exercise and has resulted in far superior understanding by the firms themselves of the risks they face and improve management of those risks. Capital isn't sufficient to assure financial stability, often liquidity is what disappears in a financial crisis, and we've put in place, especially for the largest banking organizations, enhancements to liquidity through the liquidity coverage ratio and our proposed (inaudible) funding ratio. And so I think this also works to enhance financial stability, so I think we have a much safer and sounder list (ph) crisis prone system because of the enhancements that we've put in place.

BROWN: Thank you. We've talked in the past about how the current labor market data did not reflect what's happened to minorities whose rates of unemployment are still much higher than average. Your testimony today, for the first time and thank you for that, you talked about minority unemployment rates and have included a new section in the semi-annual monetary policy report with this data in a discussion of whether the gains of the economic expansion have been widely enough shared. Discuss why the Fed made this addition to the report.

YELLEN: Well, the Federal Reserve's job is to try to achieve maximum employment and broad gains in the labor market that are as widely distributed as possible. And I believe it's very important for us to monitor how different groups in the labor market are doing to see if what we perceive is broad-based labor market improvement is being widely shared and there are very significant differences in success in the labor market across demographic groups. And I think it's important for us to be aware of those differences and to focus on them as we think about monetary policy and the forward work (ph) that the Federal Reserve does in the area of community development in trying to make sure that financial services are widely available to those that need it including low and moderate income...

BROWN: Well, that brings to my -- the meeting I had just a few minutes ago with three people from my hometown of Cleveland. Three community leaders about the lack of diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity and race and the lack of diversity in terms of ideas that are the class C (ph) directors in many of your Federal Reserves, your 12 Federal Reserves around the country, including in Cleveland. I'd like to see a more -- and I think many of us on this panel, would like to see a more diverse Federal Reserve system including the governors, the bank presidents, and the 12 regions, the board of directors, the advisory committees and employees. Discuss what you've done as chair of the Fed, what more you can do to better address the financial needs of all Americans as you reach into the community better.

And I know you've had a goal of doing that. You said that at the first hearing, certainly at one of our first meetings. Particularly serving those unserved and underserved by the financial system.

YELLEN: I am personally committing, the Federal Reserve as an organization is committed to, achieving diversity within our workforce and within our leadership at absolutely all levels. I believe we have made progress. I am committed to seeing us make further progress and in order to make sure that we're taking all of the steps that we possible can to promote diversity in economic inclusion. I've launched an interdisciplinary effort within the Federal Reserve to focus on all of our diversity initiatives, both in terms of our own hiring, hiring throughout the Federal Reserve system, our working community development to promote access to credit, our work in the payments system, to foster better and faster payments that can promote financial inclusion.

I do believe we're making some progress but I want us to make greater progress. If the Board minorities currently represent 18 percent and women represent 37 percent of senior leadership, that's relatively common that's throughout the Federal Reserve system you would see similar numbers, and we've worked very hard to increase diversity among the Reserve Bank Directors and Directors on the branch boards and made quite a lot of progress. At this point minority representation stands at about 24 percent of Reserve Bank and branch board directors, about 30 percent are women.

It's a matter that the Board focuses on annually in its oversight of the Reserve Banks. We regularly track our progress in increasing diversity in the boards of directors and it's something we will continue to focus on. Diversity is an extremely important goal and I will do everything I can to further it. Thank you.

BROWN: My last question. I want you to share with us the continual way the progress you're making there especially in the Class C directors that today more represent the community than -- it's not just diversity of look and background but diversity of ideas and all that. Last question -- there are currently a record number of job openings, 6 million, but the May data show that workers are not being hired for these jobs. What do we do to get Americans who want to work into these available jobs? What do we need to do better?

YELLEN: There are an enormous number of job openings and there is a certain degree of mismatch of workers who are looking for work with the job openings that are available. And within the Federal Reserve, and I personally have been looking at workforce development programs, job training programs, some of which I think are doing a very good job of trying to build the skills that are needed to fill available jobs and work to match workers with jobs.

I was recently in Philadelphia and visited a very impressive program that's placing workers who've had trouble in the job market into real jobs that can lead to upward mobility in a career in some of the Philadelphia hospitals. I've seen such programs around the country that I think have been effective but obviously our job at the Fed is to make sure we have a strong job market that there are enough jobs that are being created but helping that matching process, looking at training programs and educational opportunities. I think that's a piece of the puzzle as well.

BROWN: As you have from time to time mentioned -- exhorted is maybe too strong a word -- that Congress needs to do a better job in terms of investment in public works and infrastructure. Also you have made comments from time to time about job training. Can you give us more instruction -- in my last minute or so -- can you give us more instruction on what we should do here?

YELLEN: I'm not going to give you detailed instruction and I think this is up to Congress to decide, but when one looks at either inclusion or inequality or more broadly the fact that we're suffering as a country from very low productivity growth, disappointingly low productivity growth, and we think about what the factors are that over time influence productivity growth, the things that have long been identified as important are investments, both private and public and we have had private investment really since the financial crisis has been very weak, but private and public investments, education and workforce development and the pace of technological progress which is influenced by the environment that contributes to innovation, the startup of new firms and research and development and other basic supports.

So I think that all of those areas should be on Congress' list to focus on.

BROWN: Thank you.

SHELBY: Senator Corker?

CORKER: Madame Chairman, we thank you for being here and thank you for your service. I had numbers of conversations in this setting and others with your predecessor about QE2 and QE3. And I know the Fed announced in 2014 the normalization process and both your predecessor and the normalization process was announced in 2014 stated that the securities that we had built up on the balance sheet would be held to maturity. And then they would run off the balance sheet.

You basically announced today that we're embarking on QE4. By reinvesting the proceeds have you not -- in new securities, which is a major policy change, is it not? From where the Fed has been and allowing these securities to run off and allowing -- maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying but I thought I heard you say that the Fed is now, when we reach maturity on these securities, going to reinvest them,which is a pretty big policy change, is it not?

YELLEN: It is not a policy change. That's long been our policy. Ever since QE3 ended we made clear that we would continue to reinvest maturing proceeds. We've been doing that ever since. We did say that as the economy recovers and the fed funds rate rises to a somewhat higher level than it is at present that a day would come when based on economic and financial conditions the Committee would begin the process you just described of gradually allowing securities to run off our balance sheet so that we would reduce our holdings to a more normal level.

And we fully intend to do that, but I can't give you a precise timetable for when that policy will begin. It's going to depend on how the economy evolves. But a long time ago we put out a set of normalization principles where we made clear that that was how we would proceed, namely continue reinvestment until after we had begun the process of raising the federal funds rate and achieve sufficient progress there. That remains our intention.

CORKER: Well, thank you for clearing that up. I appreciate that. I know last time you were here we alluded to negative rates and I know that's what's happened in Japan and the E.U. And you were looking into the legality, or your staff was looking into, you felt the legal basis to pursue negative rates. Have you come to a conclusion relative to that?

YELLEN: I believe we do have the legal basis to pursue negative rates but I want to emphasize it is not something that we are considering. This is not a matter that we are actively looking at, considering.

When we've looked at it, or looked at that in the past, we have identified significant shortcomings of that type of approach. I don't think we're gonna have to provide accommodation and if we do that's not something that's on our list. But I do think we have the legal authority.

CORKER: Very good and I really appreciate your clearing that up. Obviously, Japan and the E.U. have not had good benefit from that, or at least it's not benefit that we can see that has been good for them. So I appreciate you clearing that up, that's very good.

We look at the Taylor Rule (ph) from time to time and I know the Fed has not adopted the Taylor Rule.

But if you look at it, Bloomberg has a chart that tracks it and basically, Fed rates and the Taylor Rule have been within a -- within a range.

Recently, there's this (ph) biggest dichotomy that we've seen in years and years between Fed funds rate and what they would be if the Taylor rule was being employed. Today, it's at 25 to 50 basis points, under the Taylor rule; we would be at 3.7 percent.

That would be our (ph) target fed rate today. Big, big range difference and is that is that because of the headwinds that you've been alluding to and just what you're generally seeing in the market?

YELLEN: Yes, I believe it is because of the headwinds. One of the numbers in the Taylor Rule reflects Professor Taylor's estimate of what we sometimes refer to as the neutral level of the fed funds rate.

It's a level of the fed funds rate that is consistent with the economy operating at full employment. And that's something that, by our estimate, has been very depressed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Discussions about secular stagnation are very much about what is the level of interest rates that is consistent with the economy operating at full employment.

I'm hopeful that rate will rise over time, although I'm uncertain. But at the moment, most of the divergence between our settings and what would be the higher levels that would be called for merely reflect the headwinds facing the economy since the financial crisis...

(CROSSTALK)

CORKER: The labor, the labor -- I've only got a little bit of time -- the labor, the employment rate really, is misleading, is it not? Relative to where we are in the labor market today? Meaning that there's still a lot of excess capacity.

And I know Ranking Member Brown was alluding to that and you. So that equation is a little bit off just because you're not really feeling the employment levels, even though the rates that we show her there, the involvement by the labor market it's not what we'd like for it to be.

Let me just ask one last thing gratefully, living wills. I know under Section 165 of Dodd-Frank, the larger institutions are supposed to present living wills. And you all are supposed to ensure that they can be resolved in bankruptcy and I know we're going through hopefully the final iteration in the next several months.

But I was confused in that Governor Powell recently mentioned that if the fed just keeps raising capital levels, these institutions will own their own downsides or become less complex. And I'm just confused by that.

Is the Federal Reserve, if these institutions cannot be resolved in bankruptcy, going to do what Section 165 of Dodd-Frank gives them -- tells them to do or are you going to rely on raising capital to cause the banks to do it themselves?

YELLEN: Well, we are insisting that the firms address in some cases deficiencies and in other shortcomings that are -- that we've found and numerated it in the living wills and the last submission.

There's a timetable for doing that.

If the firms fail to address the deficiencies or if later on, by the summer of 2017, they fail to address the shortcomings, we've identified and we find (ph) them deficient. Dodd-Frank does say what (ph) the FDIC and the Fed can impose higher capital requirements, liquidity requirements or ultimately structural changes. Don't expect to have to go there.

But we are insisting that the firms address the deficiencies in shortcomings that we've carefully identified.

CORKER: Thank you, Madam Chairman.

And Mr. Chairman.

SHELBY: Senator Reed?

REED: Well, thank you very much Mr. Chairman.

And thank you, Madam Chair. It strikes me that over the last several years you've had a very difficult challenge, we all have had. But we've been operating in some respects with one hand tied behind our back. Which is you've been pursing a very expansionary policy to stimulate the economy, cutting rates and reluctant to raise rates.

While we have not had a complementary fiscal policy that invests in infrastructure and other things and it allows you the room to raise rates, if necessary, or to complement your activity with what we're doing.

And the point you just made in response to Senator Brown is that this productivity gap, which is very troubling, some of that is just related to decrepit infrastructure. If it takes two hours to get someplace, that's two lost hours for (inaudible) someone delivering a package. If it takes 10 minutes in a superhighway (ph), that's productivity increased. So you're in a position I think that you're doing all you can but it's not enough and we have to step up. Is that something you would tend to sympathize with?

YELLEN: Well, I think in the United States and many other advanced nations where interest rates are at very low levels, it's common to say that monetary policy, central banks, who've been carrying the load in many parts of the world, fiscal policy has -- because of concern about large standard, not played a supportive role.

I think we have achieved a lot in the United States. We have created over 14 million jobs. The unemployment rate has come down to 4.7 percent. Inflation is still under two percent but I believe moving up.

So I think we are making good progress but if there were to be a negative shock to the economy and I mentioned this in my testimony, starting with very low levels of interest rates, we don't have a lot of room using our traditional tried and true method to respond.

If fiscal policy were more expansionary this neutral level of interest rates, one of the factors that affects what level of interest rates is neutral for the economy keeps it on an even keel. The level would be higher with a different stance of fiscal policy.

REED: We had made progress, all right, great. But I think the sense is not only could we have made more progress but we're at a point now where you've exhausted most of your leverage in a nonfinancial sense.

But your leverage and if there was a shock, you have very little to respond with.

YELLEN: Well, we have the same tools that we used earlier, mainly. Asset purchases, forward guidance, maturity distribution, duration of our portfolios and those are the tools we would rely on.

REED: And just very quickly, the other part of this dilemma is the sense in some places is that because interest rates have been so low, there is a possibility of creating a bubble.

Fro example, driving people into equities because there's no return and the price is driven up, not because of the underlying quality of the equity but simply that's -- that's where they can get some money fast. Are you concerned about that?

YELLEN: Well, that is -- yes, I mean -- as I said earlier, I don't see signs of extreme threats to financial stability at this time. This is something we monitor very closely. But it is something that can happen in a low-interest rate environment.

So I don't think that I see any broad-based evidence of those financial stability concerns but it is -- it is something that's possible.

REED: And I have less than a minute but let me just -- with respect to cyber security, we had a discussion last time you were here. It is an increasing problem, in fact, the Federal Reserve and public reports that you have been breached, in some respect.

But just getting to the point, do you have the authority to require you're regulated to companies to put people on their boards that have cyber security expertise? And also to publicly disclose what their cyber security general for evidence are or something to Indicate to the public that they're taking this seriously?

YELLEN: Well, it is a focus of our supervision. We do have standards that we expect financial institutions to meet. And just what's expected depends on the complexity and importance of the firm. So this is -- we do regard this as a very significant threat.

On your question about boards of directors, I don't know that we have -- that we have looked at that. I'd need to get back to you on that. But we are certainly supervising financial institution ability to address cyber threats.

REED: Thank you, Madam Chair.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SHELBY: Senator Vitter?

VITTER: Thank you, Madam Chair, for being here and for your service.

YELLEN: Thank you.

VITTER: Madam Chair, in April the Fed finally released the results of the 2015 resolution plans of eight systemically important domestic banking institutions and five of the nation's largest banks failed that exercise, including JP MorganChase Bank of America. I have three questions related to that.

First, the New York Times in April described this Fed release as stating "that suggests that if there were another crisis today, the government would need to prop up the largest banks if it wanted to avoid financial chaos." So question one is do you agree with that, question two is what do these five banks need to do first to fully remediate their deficiencies, and question three is if they don't by October 1, will the Fed take more systemic action like raising capital levels?

YELLEN: So those banks who've over the span of the last several years and in which they have been preparing living wills greatly increased their ability to be resolved in the event of trouble by bankruptcy or alternatively, title II (ph) is available. I couldn't guarantee at this point, you know it depends just what the circumstances are in which a bank fails that bankruptcy would work at this point as a means to resolve one of these firms we have identified for five of the firms deficiencies. We've been extremely careful in spelling out in detail what those deficiencies are that we want to see remedied by October 1.

And in addition we have listed jointly with the FDIC a large number of specific shortcomings that the firms have until the summer of 2017 to remedy.

And we will be monitoring very carefully and evaluating whether that's done and as I said if the deficiencies are not remedied, or later if the shortcomings are not remedied, they could turn into deficiencies that would provoke us -- lead us to impose higher capital standards or other, you know other remedies on these firms if that isn't done. But I think we have learned a lot in the course of the years we have been evaluating these living wills about what it takes to actually resolve a firm in bankruptcy, the firms who've learned in this process and I do think we have made substantial advances in terms of being able to do that...

VITTER: Let me go back to my question -- three questions. First in terms of the New York Times quote needing to prop up the largest banks, you would not categorically refute that possibility.

YELLEN: Well, I would not say at this point that all of the mare prepared for resolution under bankruptcy.

VITTER: And again, if they don't get there for October 1, would you very soon thereafter consider something more systemic like higher capital requirements or not?

YELLEN: Yes.

VITTER: OK, and Madam Chair, my second to last question is about the Puerto Rican crisis. You have said you don't think the Fed should be involved and I appreciate that and agree with that. However, my concern is the Fed has authority to be involved, do you think the Fed has authority to issue as a last resort, emergency loans to Puerto Rican institutions or not?

YELLEN: I think our authority is extremely limited and it wouldn't be appropriate for us to give loans to Puerto Rico. We have very limited authority to buying municipal debt and the authority we have, if we were buy eligible debt, I don't think it would be helpful to Puerto Rico, and beyond that we have no ability to make emergency loans. We could not use 13.3 (ph) or emergency powers of that type to extend the loan to Puerto Rico and I don't think it would be this is inherently a matter for Congress and is not something that's appropriate for the Federal Reserve.

VITTER: Thank you Madam Chair.

SHELBY: Senator Menendez.

MENENDEZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you Madam Chair for your service and your insight, I always appreciate it. Recently in the national public discourse, there are those who propose reducing the national debt by persuading creditors to take a haircut on their investments. And in my opinion policies like that would drive our economy off a cliff and endanger working families in our country. And I really don't know of anyone more qualified to answer this question than you, in your opinion what would be the consequences if the president of the United States were to propose that holders of U.S. treasury bonds accept less than the face value of their investments?

YELLEN: So this is a topic that I've spoken on many times when Congresses were faced debt ceiling type situations. I feel the consequences for the United States and the global economy of defaulting on treasury debt would be very severe. U.S. treasury securities are the safest and most liquid benchmark security in the global financial system. They play a critical role in financial markets and the consequences of such a default while they're uncertain, I think there could be no doubt that it would be long-run harmful to the U.S. interests and at a minimum result in much higher borrowing costs for American households and businesses.

MENENDEZ: And saying that you should take a haircut, is it actually means a default because you're not paying the full amount that you're obligated to on the security. And just for clarification purposes, am I right, my understanding that U.S. citizens and American entities such as state and local governments, pension funds, mutual funds, and the Federal Reserve, own the vast majority of U.S. debt estimated at approximately 67.5 percent.

YELLEN: U.S. entities and foreign entities.

MENENDEZ: OK U.S. entities and foreign entities?

YELLEN: Yes.

MENENDEZ: OK my understanding is and, I'd like to get for the record -- my understanding is that just U.S. citizens and American entities, state local governments, pension funds, mutual funds, 401(k)s, Federal Reserve, own the majority of U.S. debt, and that would be about 67.5 percent, but for the record if you could submit that I'd appreciate it.

YELLEN: Certainly.

MENENDEZ: Which means the overwhelming majority who would be taking a haircut as proposed by Mr. Trump would ultimately mean U.S. citizens, state and local governments, so that's pretty outrageous. Let me ask you this, in the nearly eight years since the start of the financial crisis, our economy has indeed shown signs of growth and progress, yet many data points indicate that we are far from a full recovery in the labor market.

In the past you have advocated for the Federal Reserve's use of a metric called the Labor Market's Condition Index. That index, which pulls data from 19 different labor market sources including labor force participation, workers that are classified as part time for economic reasons, hires, quits and so forth, has fallen nearly 15 points over the last five months. In fact the index has fallen to its lowest level since 2010. My understand is that every other time the index has turned negative for five months or longer over the last 25 years, the Fed has moved to ease monetary policy, not tighten it.

So I'm concerned that given the path the Fed has laid out for potential rate increases later this year and next, the Fed will neither have the ability nor the will to temper the impacts of this slowdown in the labor market. Shouldn't the Fed wait to consider additional rate hikes until we see indications of growth in the labor market?

YELLEN: So the numbers that are released on the Labor Market Conditions Index don't refer to the level of the index, but rather the change, and the move that you have mentioned in that index suggests not that the labor market is not operating -- the labor market is operating at a good level according to the level of that index, which we do not publish. There is loss of momentum, that is what the negative numbers show, and we have seen the same thing in the recent job reports that I referred to in my testimony.

So, without a doubt, for the last several months, a number of different metrics suggest a loss of momentum, not a deterioration in the labor market, but a loss of momentum in terms of the pace of improvement. And that is an important consideration, as I mentioned. We believe that will turn around, expect it to turn around, but we are taking a cautious approach and watching very carefully to make sure that expectation is borne out before we proceed to raise interest rates further.

MENENDEZ: Ms. Chair, one final point, not even a question. I want to echo what Senator Brown has said, and in the letter that I, Senator Warren and Murphy, and 124 members of Congress sent to you with reference to improving the representation at regional banks, 83 percent of Federal Reserve members are white, 92 percent of regional bank presidents are white.

There is not a single president who is either African-American or someone like me, Latino. That is fundamentally wrong, and I would hope that you would share some diversity effort, because leadership on this issue always comes from the top, regardless of the institution. And with your own experiences as a woman, and in that regard, we seem to be doing a lot better in the system, but we are not doing that much better with people of color. And I hope that you will seriously consider such an effort.

YELLEN: I agree with you that it is extremely important, and I will do everything I can to see that our performance improves in that dimension.

SHELBY: Senator Toomey.

TOOMEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chair Yellen.

Chair Yellen, your predecessor, Chairman Bernanke, both before this committee and in columns that he has discussed some of the limits of monetary policy, what monetary policy is capable of, and what it is not capable of. And one of the things that he said -- I'm paraphrasing, but I think he said this on numerous occasion -- is that accommodative monetary policy has the limit of being only stimulative in the sense that it brings economic activity forward in time. It does not create new wealth, goods or services, but it shifts the timing of economic activity.

Do you agree with Chairman Bernanke in that respect?

YELLEN: Well, it -- it sometimes does shift the timing of economic activity, brings forward a decision that might have made -- been made later.

But I think the stance of policy also has repercussions that have a more longer-lasting impact on the state of demand. It is not only a matter of shifting purchases early by having more accommodative financial conditions. There are repercussions that can be longer- lasting than that.

TOOMEY: Well, my -- you may disagree, but my sense of the academic consensus is the main effect of accommodative monetary policy is to induce economic activity that was going to occur later, at an earlier time, and that that is the principal activity, or the principle -- but you are acknowledging there is some of that phenomenon.

YELLEN: There is some of that phenomenon; it is not the only thing.

TOOMEY: So, to what extent is this unprecedented accommodative monetary policy for these many years now part of the reason that we've had relatively anemic growth today?

Isn't it very likely the case that some of the economic activity that would be occurring today was dragged forward in years gone by, and it has already occurred in the past?

YELLEN: So, I -- it is very hard to know how large that effect is, but I continue to thank our accommodative stance of policy, for example, low mortgage rates, is continuing to boost activity in the housing sector. It has not only pulled activity forward to suppress it now.

I believe it has...

TOOMEY: The housing sector has still not recovered its previous highs, I mean...

YELLEN: Well, it has undergone very substantial shocks.

TOOMEY: Have you attempted to quantify how much of the economic growth that would be occurring in 2017, and 2018, and 2019, is happening now because this ongoing activity of having these extremely low, unnaturally low interest rates?

YELLEN: We have not tried to determine that. We have, in the past, looked at whether or not low rates have had less impact on spurring economic activity than in the past, namely whether or not there might be some attenuation in the impact of policy.

But in the past, our analysis suggested that it is not only a matter of shifting the timing of economic activity, but also stimulating investment and spending decisions...

TOOMEY: Even if that is so, I mean, my guess is that the principle effect is shifting the timing, and you may disagree with that. I -- I got the from your predecessor impression is that his view was that the principle effect was shifting the timing.

It's certainly an effect, and I would think it is something that the Fed ought to be looking at, because to the extent that that is a significant effect, what you're doing today is damaging economic growth going forward to some extent.

Let me -- let me touch on another concern. It seems from the many -- from what you and others have said, there has been a great focus on the demand side of the effect on the -- of monetary policy, and not so much on the supply side.

One of the concerns that I have is the danger that -- first of all, you have been missing the estimates on the supply side, as well as economic growth overall, right? I mean, we are now, I think, 12 consecutive years in which the Fed has systematically overestimated economic growth, it has been overly optimistic about the supply side phenomenon such as workers returning to the workforce, improving productivity level -- that have not been happening to the extent that the Fed has hoped.

And one of my concerns is that the inducement to expand capacity, the unnatural excess capacity that comes from unnaturally low interest rates could get the Fed into a kind of vicious cycle, where all of that capacity creates excess commodities, downward pressure on prices. Makes it that much harder to hit your 2 percent inflation goal. And creates this dilemma that is hard to get out of.

Is there a danger that -- that the ultra-low interest rates are contributing to that?

YELLEN: Well, I -- well, I think investment has been running at a very slow pace. We have really not had the creation of a lot of excess capacity.

TOOMEY: Globally, we have (ph).

YELLEN: One of the reasons that productivity growth has been so slow and it has been disappointingly slow is that we have had very weak investment in the aftermath of the crisis, and more recently in recent months, it has turned negative and is extremely low, even outside of energy, where we have a substantial cutback in drilling activity.

So, I don't think an impact of low interest rates has been to stimulate an investment boom or a boom in capacity.

TOOMEY: No, it's -- I think there's -- that is largely true in the United States, but globally, where this experiment has been going on, since everybody is in this business of ultra-low interest rates, it seems there -- certainly, if you talk to people in the steel industry, they would suggest that there is a massive overcapacity, and not just steel, but in other commodities as well.

And I do worry that we have encouraged companies to take on massive amounts of debt to create this overcapacity, and it is just one of many distortions.

But I thank you for your time. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

SHELBY: Senator Tester.

TESTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Yellen, thank you for being here. I have got a couple of questions that I have asked before, and I frankly will do it again. Senator Crapo and myself sent a letter in the (inaudible) process and how that is moving forward.

I'm continually concerned about community banks and the level of regulation that match the risk that they pose to the economy and to their depositors and borrowers.

We are seeing consolidation in Montana, we're probably consolidation across the country with small banks. And that is not good for capitalism; I don't think it's good for rural America as we see small banks combining with bigger banks, combining with bigger banks.

So, my question is, do you -- do you see a problem with the process right now of regulation on our small banks? And if so, what are we doing about it?

YELLEN: We are heavily focused on trying to find ways to relieve community banks of undue burden. And our tailoring of our regulatory system and supervision system to suit the risks that an entity entails is a core principle for us of proper supervision.

So have done, I think -- made very meaningful efforts to reduce the burdens of our examinations on community banks, to reduce the complexity of capital requirements that they face. The (inaudible) process we are taking very seriously and I believe will come out with meaningful proposals for relief and we are looking at something that might be a significant simplification of the capital regime for those community banks.

TESTER: OK. I think simplification is important. Are you happy where the Fed is right now as it regards to the community banks?

YELLEN: I think we've made progress, but we'll continue to focus on it.

TESTER: OK. Do you -- do you believe that consolidation in the banking industry in particular as it applies to -- well, across the board, doesn't matter -- is not a good thing? And do you think that the regulatory issues have contributed to the consolidation?

YELLEN: I think there have been a number of factors that have contributed to it. This is a challenging environment for banks, a low interest rate environment and profitability has also been important.

TESTER: Right. In -- and in some cases some of these small banks are putting out literally (ph) millions, and these are small banks, millions of dollars to meet the regulatory issues that are brought up in front -- I just -- I just want to get your commitment you're going to continue to work...

YELLEN: Absolutely.

TESTER: The consolidation piece is something that really bothers me big time, especially as it applies tostates like Montana because that forces us to the big guys and I don't necessarily think that is good for the consumer coming down the line. I think it should be their choice if they want to go that direction.

International insurance rules, the Fed has proposed rules for two nonbank SIFIs, AIG and Prudential and I'm pleased that the Fed's moving forward with the international insurance rules. Could you give me an idea of when you think these might be complete?

YELLEN: Well, I think there are some ways to go in terms of the international work that's ongoing. We put out a few weeks ago an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for the framework that we intend to take here in the United States. You know, we are in discussions internationally in advancing these ideas, but I think we are ahead of that process here in the United States.

TESTER: So I'll take one more run at it, because I may not have worded it correctly. Do you have any idea when they will be done?

YELLEN: No.

TESTER: Will it be done in this administration?

YELLEN: I -- I'll have to get back to you. I don't know what the timetable is.

TESTER: OK...

YELLEN: You're talking about the international efforts...

TESTER: Yes. Right. And, you know, how those are going to impact, for instance, GE, for example, who is a nonbank SIFI. Just curious to figure out how that's going to come down the pipe.

YELLEN: Well so GE, we already published a...

TESTER: It's a SIFI.

YELLEN: ...a rule.

TESTER: Right.

YELLEN: It's not insurance.

TESTER: It's not an insurance company. What happens to those guys? Does this insurance rule have no impact on them? What happens to those guys moving forward?

YELLEN: They are not an insurance company.

TESTER: I know. But they are a SIFI and they have divested their financial -- their banking part of their business. So what happens to them moving forward?

YELLEN: There will be something that the FSOC...

TESTER: Will take up.

YELLEN: ...will take up.

TESTER: All right. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.

SHELBY: Senator Kirk.

KIRK: Madam Chair, I want to take you to the -- what -- you were just talking about the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for the insurance industry. I am speaking on behalf of large Illinois employers like (ph) State Department (ph) All State would say that Senator Collins and I have been working very hard to make sure the Fed recognizes the great difference between the business of banking and insurance and I would say the ANPR (ph), the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, heads in the right direction there.

And I would (ph) ask you that as we look forward to this, as I look at the essence of the ANPR, it seemed like the key stress test was a 90-day window of liquidity that, if I look at the details I would say, 90-day, if you look at someone like State Farm that affects 80 million families, you would say the stress would be -- given the 2008 drop in various sales of various products, do you have enough money to -- over 90 days -- to sustain the enterprise?

I wanted to explore this with you, a common-sense way of letting people know because this is a -- this is a route (ph), the way we should go. I would urge you to follow in the direction of Senator Collins and I, making sure the normal Fed culture of bank regulation does not impinge on the uncertainty (ph) in the insurance industry.

YELLEN: Well, we have tried to do that very much in developing this proposal. We, you know, have put forward some conceptual frameworks and are going to be looking very carefully at comments before we proceed with more detailed rules and the Collins fix (ph) was very helpful to us in having the flexibility to design something that is appropriate for insurance and not bank centric.

KIRK: Thank you. I would -- because I think we got 60 days to comment and I will comment off that (ph)...

YELLEN: Yes.

KIRK: And I will be -- approaching members of this committee to also provide their comments and (inaudible) want to make sure we have a robust and strong insurance sector.

YELLEN: Yes. And we will look at those very carefully. We are trying to proceed in a very thoughtful and careful way based on a great deal of consultation with other regulators, state regulators, the NAIC, the industry, we have taken a lot of comment and look forward to more.

KIRK: From what we have heard, the ANPR has been pretty well- received, reflecting the Collins fix nicely.

YELLEN: Great.

KIRK: Thank you. Mr. Chairman.

SHELBY: Senator Warner.

WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Chair Yellen, it's great to see you. I'm going to try to get three questions in and respect the five-minute rule -- (inaudible) respect this morning to make sure that all our colleagues continue to ask questions. I want to go back to Senator Reed's point about cyber. I think Senator Garner (ph) (inaudible) cyber caucus. I think this is increasingly going to be a challenge for every institution.

Senator Reed raised the question about whether under prudential regulations we can make sure that bank (inaudible) -- bank boards and others have cyber expertise. I would hope you would move forward with that.

I want to move slightly on your question to the issue around what happened at the New York Fed with the Bangladeshi incursion that was through the SWIFT system. Obviously, the SWIFT system is -- by evidence by this cyber attack, it has some challenges, enormously important to the international baking regimes.

Does the New York Fed or the overall Fed, do you feel like you have enough ability to -- work with SWIFT to increase their cyber protections?

YELLEN: We are part of an oversight group for SWIFT. It's left -- it's led by the National Bank of Belgium.

And many supervisors from different countries participate in that group and we also participated in that group. SWIFT and the New York Fed are working with the Bank of Bangladesh to try to understand what happened...

WARNER: I would just urge you that this is going to be an area that's going to exponentially grow in importance and both in terms of the Fed's internal expertise and ensuring that we are working more closely with the overall banking industry to up their game, I think, is critically important.

(CROSSTALK)

WARNER: ... try to get to the others. A number of us have talked about how we can generate additional job growth. One of the concerns that I have is that -- particularly with -- inside the public markets, that we have seen an enormous rush over the last decade plus starting in the '90s, but really over the last decade and the last few years, even more particular toward short-term (ph) in terms of views versus long-term value creation and that many ways this is undermining basic tenets of American capitalism as more and more people -- choose and more and more -- more and more institutions, financial institutions, choose to invest in financial instruments, rather they're investing in lending to business institutions.

Matter of fact, I have seen some data that says as low as 15 percent of financial institutions -- activities are actually geared toward business -- supporting businesses, making investments in communities. We have clearly seen amongst public companies a shift from 80 percent in the 1980s where 50 percent of profits were reinvested back into plant and equipment and (ph) employees and (ph) R&D.

Now we are seeing 95 percent of corporate profits used for stock buybacks and dividends. We have seen

some of America's largest iconic tech firms with huge balance sheets still go into the markets, borrow

billions of dollars to use, not for R&D, but to use share buybacks.WARNER: I think there's an increasing consensus amongst CEOs and I think even some more sophisticated investors that this is long-term, destructive to real value creation in business and consequently to job growth.

Has the Fed and do you individually have any views on this challenge about short-termism (ph)? Is it a challenge in some of this movement, particularly amongst public companies, away from investing back in their businesses, back toward stock buyback and dividends? Prognosis here?

YELLEN: Well, we have looked very closely at investment spending and tried to understand why it has been so very depressed in the aftermath of the crisis. You know, I think one reason for it is simply that the economy's been growing slowly. Sales growth has been slow and many firms have found they actually don't need to invest very much in order to satisfy the demand growth that they're seeing.

The workforce has been expanding less quickly than it had been. When you have a rapidly expanding workforce firms need, they're hiring those people and they need to invest to equip new entrance with the tools to be productive that others already in the workforce has. Slowing in the workforce has also played a role, but beyond that, I mean, would agree with you that there's been...

WARNER: I would -- I would simply add there has been some level of activist investors who come in to say first thing you shutdown are your worker training programs, your investment in infrastructure, and I believe that is a negative long-term. I'll...

YELLEN: I -- I would agree with you...

WARNER: I'll adhere to my five minute request, although I would ask for the public record that you come back. I am concerned on Section 165 on the living wills. We've got to move this process along. I am concerned about the level of disagreement between the Fed and the FDIC. So -- but I'll take that for the record so that other members can get their questions in.

SHELBY: Thank you, Senator Warner.

Senator Heller?

HELLER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. And Madam Chair, I want to thank you for being here today and thanks for taking time. I always find these to be very informative.

I want to go back to Brexit for just a minute. The chairman brought Brexit up and you also mentioned it in your opening comments. You said that the U.K. vote to exit the European Union would have significant economic repercussions. Can you go more into detail of what that means and perhaps what the plan of attack by the Feds are if, in fact, that were to pass two days from now?

YELLEN: So I said it could. I don't know that it would, but I think it could have significant economic consequences by launching a period of uncertainly, both for the United Kingdom and possibly the future of European economic integration. Most analyses suggest it would have negative economic consequences for the U.K. and spillover to Europe.

More broadly speaking, I think the financial market reaction to the uncertainties that would be unleashed by that decision could result in a kind of risk -- risk-off (ph) sentiment that we would see impacts on financial markets, that we might see flight to safety flows that could push up the dollar or other so-called safe haven currencies.

And I don't want to overblow the likely impacts, but we're aware of them. We will watch them and consider those impacts as we make future decisions on monetary policy.

HELLER: Is there any reason to believe that if Brexit were to pass, it -- that it would have an effect on the U.S. economy to the point that we'd go back into a recession?

YELLEN: I don't think that's the most likely case, but we just don't really know what will happen and we'll have to watch very carefully.

HELLER: What's the chance of the U.S. economy being in recession by the end of the year?

YELLEN: I think it's quite low. I think the U.S. economy is doing well. And although I've indicated that we're watching this recent slowdown in the job market carefully, my expectation is that the U.S.

economy will continue to grow. We have seen a pickup -- a strong pickup in consumer spending and growth in the economy. If the weakness in the labor market for the last couple of months was a reaction to earlier slowdown in growth, that looks to be reversing.

I remain optimistic in the kinds of conditions that have been associated in the past with U.S. recessions.

Often, that occurs when inflation is -- the economy is overheated, inflation has been quite high, the Fed has had to tighten monetary policy. We don't have any such conditions in play now. Households are in much improved shape.

And while there are negative influences in the economy, particularly on manufacturing stemming from slow growth abroad, the strong dollar, lower commodity prices, very seriously depressing hiring, causing

job loss in the energy sector and slowing investment in drilling and mining, still overall, the U.S. economy has been progressing even with those negatives. And I think the odds of a recession (inaudible)

certainly not what I expect.

HELLER: Chairman, thanks for your answer.

A week ago, Friday, I think the 10-year yield on Japanese bonds and also German bonds were negative.

What impact does that have on our Treasury yields with these investors obviously looking for any kind return coming in to (ph) buying up our Treasury bonds? What kind of impact is that going to have on our yields?

YELLEN: So it does tend to induce capital inflows into the United States, which push down our Treasury yields, so ours are considerably higher. But in absolute terms, they're really quite low.

And differentials in the stance of monetary policy also put impacts on the value of the dollar. The dollar has gone up around 20 percent against a broad basket of currencies since mid 2014, and that's had a negative effect on our trade with the rest of the world and put downward pressure on corporate profits and hiring and manufacturing.

HELLER: Are you concerned that it Feds raise rates, that -- that bond traders will ignore that, in fact reversing exactly what you're trying to achieve by raising rates?

YELLEN: Well, I think one of the factors that does influence bond pricing, if this is what you're referring to, is the anticipated path of rates. And there is some further increase built into market expectations, and often, the response of bond markets to what we do depends on how our -- how our actual actions compare with those expectations.

HELLER: Chairwoman, thank you. Thank you.

WARNER: Senator Warren?

WARREN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

It's good to see you again, Chair Yellen. I want to follow up on questions raised by Senator Corker and Senator Vitter. As you know, Dodd-Frank requires giant financial institutions to submit living wills, documents that describes how these giants could be liquidated in an orderly and rapid way in (ph) bankruptcy without either bringing down the economy or requiring a taxpayer bailout.

Now, a few months ago, the Fed and the FDIC jointly determined that the living will submitted by five of the biggest banks in the country were not credible and those banks must resolve the problems identified in their living wills by October 1st; that's 14 weeks from now. If the banks fail to do that, the Fed and the FDIC have the power to reduce the risks posed by these giant banks by, for example, raising higher capital standards or stricter leverage ratios.

These changes are critically important to avoiding another 2008 crisis, but the banks are unlikely to make them unless they believe that the Fed and the FDIC are serious about enforcing Dodd-Frank. Now, I know by law you must consider increasing capital and higher leverage ratios.

What I want today is to ask, can you commit that if any of these giant banks fail to resolve the problems in their living wills by October 1st that the Fed will use the tools that Congress gave you to reduce the risks posed by these too big to fail banks?

YELLEN: We've been very serious in this review of living wills and we have clearly stated a set of well- identified changes that we want to see...

WARREN: I appreciate that.

YELLEN: ... by October 1st.

Now, the decision about what we do if those deadlines are not met, those are decisions that my colleagues and I will need to look at very carefully, what is the appropriate sanction for doing that. But clearly, we are very serious about wanting to see these deficiencies remedied and well aware that wehave at our disposal the tools that you listed. So I cannot pre-commit today to tell you precisely what our response will be, and we will work closely with the FDIC as we have all along. But we are extremely serious about wanting to see progress and certainly will consider using those tools.

WARREN: Well, as I said, you are required by law to consider them.

What I am asking for is a commitment here. I have to say, I don't fully understand why you would not make that commitment. The banks have known this was coming since Dodd-Frank was passed in 2010.

That is six years ago and they have been submitting living wills since 2013. There is no provision for all of the extensions that you have given them so far.

If any of the banks fail the credibility test on their fifth try, they need to face some real consequences.

Otherwise, why would they ever make changes if there were no consequences?

YELLEN: Well, there will be consequences.

WARREN: Well, I very much hope so.

You know, when you find that these five banks were submitting living wills that were not credible, you had said quite explicitly that, " that each of these remains too big to fail and if that anyone of them crashed, they would risk taking down the whole economy unless they got a government bailout." The entire goal of the living wills' process is to push the banks to fix this fundamental problem. I'm glad that the FED finally finally determined that some of these living wills were not credible. It will not mean anything if you're not willing to use the tools that Congress gave you to force these banks to reduce the risk that their pushing off onto the taxpayer.

A second issue I want to cover if I can briefly. And then I want to follow up on Senator Brown and Senator Menendez's questions about diversity. I think diversity is very important. There is a growing body of research showing for example, that gender diversity and leadership makes for stronger institutions. Perhaps it is not a coincident that there is a stunning lack of diversity at our biggest financial institutions, not a single one is led by a woman.

And while the Fed's leadership is somewhat more diverse, it's a not a whole lot better. Of the 12 Regional Fed President's, ten are men. Now as you know, Congressman Conyers and I, along with 120 of our colleagues sent a letter a few weeks ago about the lack of diversity among the Fed's leadership. And I appreciate the response that you sent us last week in which you acknowledged that greater diversity can help improve the Fed's decision making and that there is still work to be done to improve diversity among the Fed's leadership.

So let me just start by asking, does the lack of diversity among the Regional Fed Presidents concern you?

YELLEN: Yes, I believe it's important to have a diversified group of policymakers who can bring different perspectives to bare.

I think as you know it's the responsibility of the regional banks Class B and C directors to conduct a search, and to identify candidates. The board reviews those candidates and we insist that the search be national, and that every attempt be made to identify a diverse pool of candidate. We monitor those searches while they're ongoing to make sure that's been done...

WARREN: Let me just ask you then about the outcome here because, just as you say, under the law when a new regional Fed President is selected by the Regional Fed Board, that person must be approved by you and the others on the Board of Governors before taking office.

The Fed Board recently re-appointed each and every one of these Presidents without any public debate or any public discussion about it. So the question I have is, if you're concerned about this, why didn't you use either of these opportunities to say, "enough is enough, let's go back and see if we can find qualified regional presidents who also contribute to the overall diversity of the Fed's leadership?

YELLEN: Well, we did undertake a thorough review of the reappointments of the performance of the presidents.

The Board of Governors has oversight of the reserve banks. There are annual meetings between the Board's Bank Affairs Committee and the leadership of those banks to review the performance of the presidents, there were thorough reviews...

WARREN: You're telling me diversity is important and yet you just signed off on all these folks without any public discussion about it. I appreciate your commitment to diversity and I have no doubt about it. I don't question it.

It just shows me that the selection process for Regional Fed Presidents is broken because the current process has not allowed you and the rest of the board to address the persistent lack of diversity among the Regional Fed Presidents. I think that Congress should take a hard look at reforming the regional Fed selection process so that we can all benefit from a Fed leadership that reflects a broader array of both backgrounds and interests.

YELLEN: Thank you, Madam Chair.

SHELBY: Senator Scott.

SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chair Yellen, thank you for being here today. I thank you for your hard work on behalf of all of America.

Frankly, you have a difficult task and one that will not get any easier before the year is out from my perspective.

I did find it quite interesting the opening comments of my good friend the Ranking Member, Senator Brown from Ohio as he seemed to suggest that the failure of the economy is somehow rests on the shoulder of my party. I thought to myself that, the American people aren't really looking to assign blame for why the economy is so anemic, and the so called recovery hasn't fully reached into those folks living paycheck to paycheck.

But it would be easier for them to remember that at the beginning of this recovery, that the Democrats, my good friends to left, controlled the White House, the Senate, and the House until early January 2011.

And what did they do with that trifecta? Actually, they created the most onerous regulatory state in the history of our country, and it continued until even last year when the administration proposed 80,000 plus pages of new regulations according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute for the economic impact. The cost of the economy of $1.85 trillion -- said differently that this anemic recovery -- perhaps it's anemic because of the regulatory burden created during those first couple of years.

I would suggest to you that people in my home state of South Carolina who are working paycheck to paycheck do not believe that we are actually have a strong recovery, and the numbers seem to bear that out. First time home-buyers down for the third consecutive year, and that disproportionately impacts African Americans who have home ownership around 45 percent. So the challenge seems to continue. Our economy grew the first quarter by 1.1 percent. We saw real income since 2007 decline by 6.5 percent. Americans eligible for food stamps is up 40 percent. Americans using food stamps are up 20 percent. Last month, we saw 38,000 jobs created and our labor force participation rate in 2007, 66.4 percent, 2010, bless you, 64.8 percent.

I've got to stop and say bless to the woman for sneezing. Is that OK with you sir? Thank you.

And in 2014 -- we're having fun up here because this is not a fun topic. In 2014, it was 62.9 percent, May of this year, 62.6 percent. I would suggest that the numbers themselves bear out the fact perhaps the anemic recovery is not a recovery for those folks working paycheck to paycheck. I don't know who is to blame but I can tell you that the American people want solutions more than blame.

My question is to is, as you look to the rest of this year, do you anticipate more months where the job creation number is 38,000 -- and the same month where we see job creation at 38,000, we celebrate a 4.7 percent unemployment rate only because 450,000 people stop looking for work? So when you take a real unemployment number based on the 2007 labor force participation rate, we would be at 9 percent.

YELLEN: So we do expect a thorough improvement in the coming year.

The unemployment rate fell substantially over the last year and there were jobs created in 2015 of about 225,000 or 300,000 a month. Perhaps we won't see job creation now that the economy is getting closer to estimates of normal longer run rate of unemployment. We may not see job creation at quite that pace but I expect continued improvement bringing down broader measures of unemployment which as you noted are much higher. Some include involuntary part-time employment. I expect further improvement unless (ph) the labor market continues to strengthen.

Now the last jobs report and the last couple of months of labor market performance were quite disappointing. My hope and expectations is that that's something that's temporary and we will that turn around in the coming months. Clearly it's something we will be watching very carefully. My expectation is that we will see improvement but we will watch it very carefully.

SCOTT: My last question, as my time is running out, has to do with full employment and how to reach that wonderful goal of full employment. When I look at the numbers that are coming out of the need for skilled workers as well as STEM workers it appears that by 2020 we could have a shortfall of 3 million or 4 million folks in the skilled labor force, and about 5 million in the STEM labor force. My solution has a lot to do with the German model of apprenticeship programs. I'd love to hear if you have any solutions that you're going to be recommending as we look at the labor force participation rate, the number of skilled jobs that will be available and the need to get our workforce trained in that direction.

YELLEN: Going back probably to the mid-'80s we have seen a persistent shift in employment patterns from unskilled and people with middle skills but doing jobs that can be off-shored, outsourced, to skilled -- to demand for skilled labor.

SCOTT: Yes, ma'am.

YELLEN: The consequence of that has been rising inequality, a high return to education and downward pressure on the wages of those who are less skilled and middle income. I completely agree with you that education and training, perhaps apprenticeships of the type that are used in some European and other countries -- these are ideas that really have to be considered if we're going to address what comes out of that, which is that even when you have enough jobs you have downward pressure on the wages and incomes of people in the middle and the bottom of the skilled distribution.

SCOTT: Thank you, Chair Yellen. Mr. Chairman I would just suggest that at some point we are going to have to have a national conversation about the quality of education in our country and the necessity of a dual track. Back in my days we had shop which was an important part of our education apparatus and perhaps we need to have that conversation again. Thank you , Chair Yellen.

YELLEN: I agree with you.

SHELBY: Senator Donnelly?

DONNELLY: Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Chair Yellen. When you were here in February we talked about corporate offshoring and the devastating impact it's had on families in my home state of Indiana and in manufacturing towns across the country. The frustration remains. The decline in manufacturing employment is one of the factors that's led to a shrinking middle class.

We've two economies in this country. The overall economy might be doing well enough and the wealthy richer than ever, but middle and working class families aren't feeling the recovery. Wages have been stagnant for years. A recent Pew report said since 1971 each decade has ended with a smaller share of adults living in middle income households than at the beginning of the decade. What's the state of the economy for working families?

YELLEN: I would agree with you for decades now, as we were just discussing, there has been downward pressure on the incomes of less skilled individuals. And the kinds of jobs that once upon a time were pretty readily available, say for a high-school educated man in manufacturing, have gradually diminished. There's been a long term trend. Part of it is due to just the technological change that's consistently raised the demands for skilled workers and reduced the demands for less-skilled workers.

And I think globalization has also played some role.

More recently, slow growth in foreign economies, the strength of the dollar, which really is reflective of the U.S. doing better on balance than other countries, and...

DONNELLY: I understand all these reasons, but these are real people, as you well know. There was an article not too long ago in the paper here about a fellow, he was making about $17 an hour at the plant.

He got fired because they shifted his job to Mexico for $3 an hour. But the ongoing ripple of that was that his daughter who had applied to Indiana University, I.U., got accepted. Found out that her dad was going to lose his job, she said, "I don't think the family can afford for me to go to college like that."

That's devastating. That's the future of America. That's what the real impact of all of this stuff is. It's just in the past few months. And these aren't because the companies aren't doing well. They're doing really well. But you know in a town next to my own town, Elkhart, 200 jobs shift overseas. That's 700 jobs, Huntington, Indiana, not the biggest county in the state. Shift to Mexico for $3 an hour wages. Fourteen hundred out of Indianapolis. Very profitable companies, and these folks are making $13, $14, $17 an hour.

As long as we have the mousetrap like this, how do we ever try to get the middle class up if even $13 an hour is too much in these companies' minds?

YELLEN: These are very sad situations for...

DONNELLY: They're wrong situations, is what they are.

YELLEN: The kind of thing you're describing imposes terrible burdens on all too many American families.

DONNELLY: SO how do we make America work for them?

YELLEN: Part of it is trying to make jobs which we can't stop all shifts occurring across sectors of the economy. I think we have to...

(CROSSTALK)

DONNELLY: Do you consider that a shift when a company is doing really well and somebody's making $13 an hour, not much above minimum wage, but lose their job because our laws allow them to ship them to Mexico for $3 an hour -- is that a shift? That's not really a shift in technology or anything, that's just a cold-blooded decision that Americans don't count as much as their profits.

YELLEN: Those forces have been in play for quite some time and for our part, at the Fed, we're trying to create a job market where there are enough vacancies and opportunities that people who lose jobs in one sector are able to find them in the sectors of our economy that are expanding. And sometimes to make that transition is difficult and may require retraining or other forms of help to connect with available job opportunities and sometimes we know that kind of job loss does cause long-lasting...

(CROSSTALK)

DONNELLY: I'll just leave it like this. Gaming the system to want to make your product somewhere else in the hope that you can sell it back to here, to the United States, because you're hoping that other people will be happy to pay the $13 an hour, $14 an hour wages, so you'll have enough customers, you're just gonna game that so that you can pay the three bucks, and get your products back in here and it's like you get it on one end and you get it on the other end. And that just seems incredibly

irresponsible to me.

Thank you, Madam Chair.

SHELBY: Senator Rounds.

ROUNDS: Thank you Mr. Chairman.

Madam Chair, welcome. As I listen to your monetary policy report it strikes me that, as the Ranking Member had indicated earlier, we talk about productivity growth and the need for both public and private investment. That requires that the dollars come from someplace. And I'd like your thoughts on this, just in terms of -- on the basis what the joint economic committee had reported earlier this year and they laid it out in some pretty stark terms.

They indicated that 99 -- well let me put it this way. Ten years from now in the year 2026, which by the way is the 250th birthday of our country, we can look forward to, under current conditions, 99 percent of all the revenue coming into the federal government. Highway taxes, corporate taxes, personal taxes, personal income taxes, 99 percent of its going to go back out in two categories. Interest on the federal debt and mandatory payments on entitlements. That doesn't leave a lot for public investment and clearly does not drive private investment.

You're working on short-term activity right now and you're monitoring very closely, you're actually on a day-to- day basis following the economy right now, which as you suggested is doing very well and yet I think a lot of us would disagree. Three quarters of one percent growth on quarter hardly seems appropriate and I know that you're optimistic about the second being better, but even if it's double or even triple, we're not going to grow our way out of this crisis which is coming upon us.

I'd like your thoughts, because right now we're looking at areas in which, if we want those jobs to come back and if we want individuals or wages to rise, we're going to have to be in a position to where we actually grow this economy once again.

Tax policy, regulatory reform, actually managing our entitlements, all of which seem critical and yet today we haven't talked about that at all. We don't really seem to have a place where we can. Can you, as an impartial individual in this process who watches our economy grow or falter on a daily basis, can you talk to us about the need to do something now to avoid the crisis in 10 years?

YELLEN: Well, I think we all know, and have known for a long time that with an aging population and with healthcare costs that have by and large risen more rapidly than inflation, that we face the situation where we would have an unsustainable debt path and that this would require reforms as you say, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, those three programs will...

ROUNDS: So you're talking -- just to begin with, the Affordable Care Act needs to be reformed. That's part one.

YELLEN: Well I didn't say anything about the Affordable Care Act, I am saying that the entitlement

programs need to be considered, how to put those on a sustainable basis.

ROUNDS: Would it be fair to say they need to be managed?

YELLEN: Well they need to have Congress look at both revenues and the structure of expenditures to

ensure that those programs remains sustainable and the overall federal budget and debt associated

with that remain on a sustainable course because as you go out further with an aging population, as you

said, the debt to GDP ratio is rising simply unsustainably and that does require changes.

ROUNDS: Fair to say that, right now if, over the long term basis, every time the interest rate that we

have to pay at the federal level goes up by a quarter point, it's estimated that approximately a $50

billion a year additional increase in our costs being paid out. Looks to me like simply addressing and

beginning the process of slowing down the increasing federal debt and recognizing that we can't just

simply say over a one day period of time or a two day period of time that we've got all the answers.

Almost certainly, we're going to have to grow our way out of this as well as reducing some of the

ongoing expenditures. Fair to say?

YELLEN: It certainly would be desirable if the U.S. economy were growing at a faster rate. You cited a very depressed number for first quarter growth. Over the last four quarters the average growth has been about two and a half -- two percent. In over eight quarters its been about two and a half percent, so sort of smoothing through the ups and downs we've been experiencing growth of two or two and a half percent...

ROUNDS: And that's -- we're not going to grow our way out based upon that number are we?

YELLEN: We would certainly have to do better than that and that's a matter of productivity growth essentially being quite depressed relative to -- for example to the levels that we enjoyed in the second half of the 90's. So it's not certain what's responsible for that, but you know many factors come into play. We've had depressed levels of investment, we you know seem to have a depressed rate of business formation, the sort of technological change as it shows up in output gains seems to have fallen relative to those better times. And there are a range of policies we could consider to...

ROUNDS: Madam Chair, my time is up but it looks to me like what you're giving us is a wake up call about a crisis that isn't 10 years now, it's right now.

YELLEN: Well it is a very serious matter that productivity growth is so slow yes, I want to highlight that. ROUNDS: Thank you Madam Chair, thank you Mr. Chairman.

SHELBY: Senator (ph) Merkley.

MERKLEY: Chair Yellen, thank you. Senator Donnelly was raising concern about manufacturing jobs in America and indeed our trade policy has given full access to our market to goods manufactured by companies in countries that do not have to abide by the same labor laws, the same wage rules, the same environmental rules or the same enforcement. This is a very unlevel playing field for American manufacturers that's having a devastating impact. The loss is extensive and is that really fair to the American worker to have American companies having to compete against companies that are allowed a completely different set of standards that lower their costs dramatically?

YELLEN: Well I guess I would just say that in the view of most economists, more open trade creates net benefits, but that doesn't mean benefits for everyone and there are gainers but there are also losers and that's certainly...

MERKLEY: The losers are the manufacturing workers. Again is that fair to the manufacturing workers?

YELLEN: Well it's important to have policies that address the losses.

MERKLEY: Since mid-70's -- 1975 through now -- we've had four decades, in which virtually 100 percent of the new income has gone to the top 10 percent of Americans leaving basically nine out of 10 Americans in our economy out in the cold. This is substantially a reflection of the shift of manufacturing overseas. We've had a series of geostrategic decisions. We wanted to nurture the recovery of Japan, we wanted to pull China out of the Sino-Soviet bloc, now we want to pull the rest of Asia away from China.

Is there an understanding within the Fed how the cost of these geostrategic decisions upon the welfare of American families and through living wage jobs, the loss of living wage jobs?

YELLEN: We have certainly looked at this question of wage- inequality, income-inequality, we collect data our survey of consumer finances is one of the key data sets that gives us insight into what's happening. Academic work on this topic, while it has focused to some extent on trade more broadly also looks at the importance of a phenomenon called skill-biased technical change that the nature of technological change in recent decades has continually shifted demand away from less skilled workers towards more skilled...

MERKLEY: So let's take that as an additional factor -- technological change has occurred. However a lot of the shift overseas has been due to lower wages, not to technological change, in fact they've been rooting up our factory machines and shipping them overseas. So it's the same factories producing the same goods in a place that pays less. That is not technological change that is an issue of trade policy.

Technological change does have an impact so in a situation where as you point out, there's more higher skill demand -- demand for higher skilled jobs, education becomes very important.

But as compared to other developed economies, higher education be it higher skill training or college, is far more expensive. It is the single factor, more than healthcare that has gone up faster than inflation in our economy.MERKLEY: And such that not only is it daunting to our students, who in blue-collar communities like the one I live in, are getting the message that there is not an affordable path to fulfill their goals in life and statistically we see our students who do pursue that education burdened with debt that is having a profound impact both on delaying marriage and on delaying home ownership, which is the major -- has been a major engine of wealth for the middle class.

So we see this high cost of college and that seems to me like the type of structural concern in our economy that the Fed should be using its economic expertise to highlight the long-term devastating impacts of failing to provide the opportunity for the skills needed for the economy of the future. But I don't hear the Fed talking about that.

YELLEN: Well, we are looking at trends in student debt and believe we will be hosting a conference this fall on student debt and looking particularly at what it means for low and moderate income households.

MERKLEY: You know, I can't -- over these last few years, I've asked so many questions in which the response is always that's something we're looking at. It'd be nice to have a muscular (ph) representation of the big challenges to our economy because the Fed has the expertise to put its hands around that and be able to project that into the policy debate.

I'll just close, since my time is expiring, by saying one of those issues that I've raised multiple times is the Fed's power of the conflict of interest in commodities, the ability of large financial institutions to own pipelines, to own ships full of oil, to own energy generation stations, to own warehouses of aluminum.

And each time I hear we're looking at that, are we still looking at that? Are we actually going to do something about that?

YELLEN: We're -- we -- we'll come out with a proposal on that. But some of it reflects decisions that Congress made and not Fed policy.

MERKLEY: That's true. There is -- there are some restrictions, but there's still considerable power resting with the Fed. Thank you.

WARNER: Senator Moran?

MORAN: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

Madam Chairwoman, thank you for joining us this morning. I would tell you that in my conversations with Kansans, very few -- I don't know if I've had a conversation with a Kansan who sees their economic future brighter. They see it -- they're more disillusioned. No one feels more secure in their job. No one feels like their children are going to have a brighter future.

Parents are concerned about their children's opportunities when they graduate from school, ability to pay back student loan -- loans. Worried about saving for their own retirement. People are worried about having enough income and savings to pay for healthcare emergencies. So the sense of an economic recovery is far from being felt universally with Kansans that I visit with across our state.

I wanted to just raise two questions. One, in part, that circumstance is related to significantly lower agriculture commodity prices, significantly lower prices in oil production, natural gas production, and part of that is a consequence of, I assume, the value of our dollar in comparison to other currencies and our ability to promote exports both of those -- certainly of agricultural commodities, although the law now allows for the export of oil as well.

Where are we in the value of our dollar? What's the intermediate expectations for us to be able to jump-start the sale of wheat, cattle, corn and other products, airplanes that are manufactured in our state that seemingly are not able to access those markets in part because the value of our currency?

YELLEN: So the value of the dollar has increased significantly since, say mid-2014. Partly, that reflects the fact that the U.S. has enjoyed a stronger recovery than many other advanced nations, and that's created an expectation that U.S. -- in the U.S., interest rates will rise at a more rapid pace than in other parts of the world, and that's induced inflows into our assets that have pushed up the dollar.

But more broadly, the trends you've seen in commodity prices I think reflect the larger set of global forces. In some cases, we've seen increases -- significant increases in the supply of commodities.

In the case of oil, the rapid growth of U.S. ability to supply oil markets has been a factor. And then there's been a slowdown in global growth and -- particularly in China, which has been an important consumer of so many commodities.

China's on a path and it's understood to be this will continue, a path of slowing growth and the plummet -- you've seen commodity prices plummet for many commodity prices just because of basic supply and demand considerations. The dollar makes some difference to that as well.

MORAN: And we often talk about -- when we talk about exports, trade agreements. Has the Fed weighed in, or have you expressed an opinion previously about other countries and their ability to manipulate currencies to our disadvantage of exports?

YELLEN: The responsibility for currency policy rests with the secretary of the treasury.

MORAN: The Treasury Department.

YELLEN: And we don't weigh in on that.

MORAN: Madam Chairwoman, let me ask you about something in your testimony. You indicate that business investment outside the energy sector was surprisingly weak.

Would you indicate to me, elaborate on the factors that lead you to that statement? And when you exclude the energy sector, is that just because of definition or is something happening in the energy sector that indicates investment?

YELLEN: Well, drilling activity has been very important, and it has counted as part of investment activities. So, with the huge plunge in oil prices, even though there has been some recovery, we have seen a number of rigs in operation just plummet, and that's part of why aggregate investment spending has been so weak.

And we understand that and expect it, because it reflects the decline in oil prices. But even when we go outside the energy sector, or other energy sectors that are directly related to energy and supplying inputs to it, investment spending recently -- and this is just a report on the data, it's -- I don't have a story to offer you on why this has happened.

It has been surprisingly weak over the last several months. It hasn't been very strong -- investment spending -- generally. We talked about this earlier during the recovery, but it has been -- and we think we understand some reasons why it has generally been weak, namely, slow growth and less rapid increase in the labor force. But it has been surprisingly weak in recent months, and it's something we're watching. And I don't -- I can't tell you just what that's due to.

MORAN: I wouldn't expect you to say this, but in my view, in part that lack of investment or that reduction in investment is related to a wide -- an array of circumstances. One of them would be the debt and deficit, the uncertainty of our economy. Lack of economic growth.

Generally, the economic indicators are downtrending, not uptrending a sufficient number of times to instill a sense of confidence. The next regulation that may come their way, as a business person, just decisions to make investments, people are deciding it's more risky to invest than to not.

YELLEN: Well, those issues are certainly mentioned by business people. In recent quarters, corporate earnings have also been under downward pressure for a variety of reasons.

MORAN: Well, I -- I would conclude my remarks by indicating that one of the places we ought to focus attention is on innovation, startups business and entrepreneurs. And the uncertainty they face is even more of a dramatic -- has a dramatic consequence than a larger business that can better internalize and handle that uncertainty.

Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Thank you, Chairwoman.

SHELBY: Senator Cotton.

COTTON: Thank you. And thank you, Chair, for being forced again. I know these are always two highlights of every year for you.

I want to return to some of the earlier discussion of the so- called Brexit, the referendum that will occur in the United Kingdom on Thursday on whether Great Britain should remain or leave the E.U.

Your testimony on page four says, quote, "One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions."

"Could," which you stressed to Senator Heller in his comments. That sounds to me like the usual prudence and caution you use in all of your public statements.

You also stated to Senator Heller, quote, "I don't want to overblow the likely impacts," end quote. That reminds me of Yogi Berra's old sage advice that predictions are hard, especially about the future.

YELLEN: That's absolutely true. I couldn't agree with that more.

COTTON: Yet in the last few minutes, here's how the Guardian of London reports your testimony to the committee. Quote, "Yellen warns on Brexit."

Not exactly what you said, is it?

YELLEN: I said that we're monitoring it and it could have consequences with the (inaudible).

COTTON: But you couldn't -- you wouldn't characterize your testimony as a warning on the Brexit?

YELLEN: I have in this -- if that means I am warning U.K. residents -- I am not attempting to take a stand, they're going to go to the polls. They have had an active debate on the issues and I am not providing advice in that sense.

COTTON: Good. Thank you.

I sympathize when headlines don't exactly capture the exact meaning of what one says -- and to be fair to the Guardian, they're not the only outlet that's reported your testimony along those lines, the BBC, Reuters, CNBC and Fortune have as well. So to be crystal clear, you take no position on whether U.K. citizens should vote to remain or leave the E.U.? And the Federal Reserve doesn't take no position?

YELLEN: That's correct. That's for them to decide. I'm simply saying the decision could have economic consequences that would be relevant to the U.S. Economic Outlook that we need to monitor carefully.

COTTON: Thank you for that because I certainly think we all in America, and particularly in positions of leadership in our government, should respect the British people's sovereign right to govern their own affairs.

One point you made in your earlier comments about Brexit, about the potential source of these economic repercussions is, quote, "a period of uncertainty." That's something I hear frequently in commentary about the Brexit. Is there any time when the global economy or U.S. economy doesn't operate in a condition of uncertainty?

YELLEN: Well, there is uncertainty but this is a unique event that has no close parallel. It's hard to know what the consequences would be, of course, there is always uncertainty domestically and globally. We operate in an uncertain environment.

COTTON: Many of your counterparts in the continent, many of my elected counterparts in the continent have not treated the matter so evenhandedly. They've opined on what the British citizens should do.

They have also been responsible for other things that have caused uncertainties in recent years like Greek Debt Crisis, or other debt crises in Europe, or the suspension of the Schengen Zone privileges because of the flow of migrants into Europe -- and terrorists now infiltrating that flow and launching attacks in Paris just a few blocks away from the heart of the European union. Those have also potentially caused periods of uncertainty in the European and global economy, wouldn't they?

YELLEN: Absolutely.

COTTON: Is there a risk that some of the dire predictions about Brexit could become or the reaction to the Brexit could be a self- fulfilling prophecy in the economy?

Some British politicians have promised, or perhaps I should say threatened immediate tax increases or budget cuts if the U.K. citizens vote to leave. Some continental leaders have threatened punitive or retaliatory reaction if U.K votes to leave. Our own president has said that the United Kingdom would have to, quote, "go to the back of the queue," end quote for any new trade agreement. Do these statements have the potential for creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that would lead to increased uncertainty whatever the outcome on Thursday?

YELLEN: I don't want to comment what various participants in this debate have said or the advice they've given the British people. There is an active debate. It's not appropriate with a decision of this sort for many parties to weigh in about the consequences.

As I said, I'm not trying to offer advice myself to the U.K. residents about to go to the polls.

COTTON: Thank you, nor am I.

One final point, your counterpart at the ECB has said that the ECB is quote, "ready for all contingencies following the U.K.'s E.U. Referendum," end quote. Can you say the same thing about the Federal Reserve -- you're ready for all contingencies following the vote Thursday?

YELLEN: Well, in the sense that we will closely monitor what the economic consequences -- would be and are prepared to act in light of that assessment.

COTTON: And should the U.K. vote to leave the E.U., the United States as a whole and the Federal Reserve will handle that contingency in the spirit of magnanimity, generosity, and friendship among nations?

YELLEN: Well, it would certainly be my inclination to do so.

COTTON: Thank you for that.

SHELBY: Thank you.

Madam chairwoman, I want to shift the conversation a little bit to custody banks, which are very important. I think that would be banks like State Street, New York Mellon and I'm sure others. It's been reported that custody banks have turned away deposits or are charging fees on deposits because of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio.

You've received public comments stating that the rule could limit the ability of custody banks to accept deposits, particularly during periods of stress.

Is the Fed currently examining how this rule is impacting custody banks' ability to accept deposits? One.

Two, could this rule increase systemic risk during times of stress?

And three, just for the audience, they probably know, what is a custody bank as opposed to ordinary retail bank?

YELLEN: So a custody bank is one that handles transactions for other customers...

SHELBY: Very important.

YELLEN: ...asset managers.

SHELBY: A custody bank's important to the banking system, is it not?

YELLEN: Yes, they are.

SHELBY: Okay.

YELLEN: And I -- we certainly are aware that they're concerned about the supplementary leverage ratio impacting their profitability. Leverage ratios are normally intended to be a backup form of capital regulation. They're not oriented toward the risk of particular assets on the balance sheet, but impose a minimum amount of capital that applies to the entire balance sheet. All assets.

And so for safe assets in banks that hold particularly safe, large quantities of safe assets, it can be a burden. And it's something that we will monitor. But this is the way leverage ratios have always been imposed against all of the assets of the overall size of the organization.

SHELBY: Thank you. Senator Brown, do you have anything else (ph)?

BROWN: No, that's it (ph). Thank you.

SHELBY: Madam Chair, thank you for your participation. I know it's been long, but I thank you for you appearing before the committee again. The committee is adjourned.

Dell Inc. is selling its software group as the computer maker continues to shed assets and change strategy to focus on its acquisition of storage vendor EMC Corp.

Private-equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. said Monday that they would buy Dell Software Group for an undisclosed price.

The software group provides services to corporations such as analytics, database management, data protection, access control and performance monitoring.

Dell has been working to finance its $67 billion acquisition of EMC, including by selling its information-technology-services division for $3.05 billion and selling $20 billion in bonds.

In recent years, Dell has tried to expand from its traditional hardware businesses and into software. Now, Dell is focusing on the data-storage hardware and data-center software from VMware Inc., which are being brought in from the EMC deal, and getting out of some previous bets.

In 2012, Dell bought tech-security company SonicWall Inc. for $1.2 billion and business-software maker Quest Software Inc. for $2.36 billion. Both are included in the deal.

Michael Dell took his namesake company private in 2013.

METCASH

Dividends to Restart

As Firm Posts Profit

Retailer Metcash Ltd. said it hopes to restart dividend payments this financial year after swinging to an annual profit on the back of reduced financing costs.

Metcash reported net profit of 216.5 million Australian dollars (US$160.1 million) for the year through April 30 from a A$384.2 million loss a year earlier.

The group recently sold its automotive business, allowing it to reduce debt. The lower interest costs offset weakness in its grocery business amid increasing competition from international groups.

Group earnings before interest and tax declined 7.4% to A$275.4 million as is invested heavily in cutting prices in its supermarkets business IGA, and the performance of its convenience stores business also deteriorated.

Bitcoin hype leads more to ask: what is blockchain?

It is a technology so new that many people in finance cannot explain what it is or what it might be able to do   yet they know they might have to worry about it.

Demand from professionals for learning about blockchain, the technology that powers the virtual currency "http://www.ft.com/intl/indepth/bitcoin", is so great that Cambridge university plans to offer courses to executives about its disruptive potential this year.

Blockchain has been the subject of a significant amount of hype over the past year as institutions ranging from banks, exchanges, insurers and governments have rushed to work out how blockchain could be used, by them or rivals. The technology deployed is known as a distributed database, which runs from many computers and needs no central authority.

Cambridge s Centre for Alternative Finance, based at its Judge Business School, will be the first in the UK to teach the subject, with demand coming mainly from employees of global banks.

 Nobody wants to be Kodak,  says Robert Wardrop, executive director of the school s centre for alternative finance, comparing the film-maker s failure to adapt to the digitisation of photography to the change in the banking sector.

 They [bankers] all know their industry is being digitalised, how you develop a competitive response 	. 	. 	. 	that is the challenge,  Mr Wardrop says.  Do you do nothing, collaborate or compete? 

Advocates believe that though blockchain is at an early stage in its development, it has the potential to disrupt many sectors. This is because it is transparent, indelible and tamper-proof and is jointly run by several parties. It could be used to keep records such as on a person s complete health or insurance history, for example. Or it could be used for cross-border clearing and settlement.

Cambridge s teaching about blockchain and digital currencies will be a core part of its educational programme on fintech, which is being developed by the Centre for Alternative Finance. Professors will also cover peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, alternative investments and new forms of credit analytics. The material will be included in the university s master of finance programme this summer.

The introduction of the Cambridge course comes after several US universities that had added bitcoin to their syllabuses in 2014 shifted their attention to blockchain.

David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University s Stern School of Business, says there is great interest in the quandaries posed by emerging technology to regulators.  There are huge challenges for most governments around the world because they assume the current law will deal with a lot of blockchain issues,  he says.  But it is a totally different animal. 

Professor Yermack predicts that a technological evolution will shrink the size of the industry s workforce overall, but in doing so it will create many specialist tech jobs.

Stern School will teach its MBA students about digital currencies, blockchains and their growing place in the financial services industry from next spring. It also plans a course for executives. At Duke University s Fuqua School of Business, emphasis has also shifted away from bitcoin. Duke says its innovation and cryptoventures course, which is part of the MBA, has been heavily oversubscribed and is aimed at students who want to create their own blockchain start-ups. Campbell Harvey, finance professor at Fuqua, says:  Now it s the general technology called blockchain. There are apps that go with it, bitcoin is one of them. 

Universities are mostly teaching the basics of blockchain: the context of how the technology came about, its mechanics and how people are trying to commercialise and innovate with it.

Garrick Hileman, who teaches blockchain and virtual currencies at Cambridge, says that for more than two years he has seen  tremendous  interest from companies. He has been called in to teach executives informally about bitcoin and other virtual currencies such as ether, and more recently, blockchain.  Many people are still trying to understand the basics,  he says.

Blockchain s reputation has suffered from its association with bitcoin, which has been tarnished by the collapse of Mt Gox   a prominent exchange, with the disappearance of $500m worth of customers  bitcoins   and the closure by US authorities of the Silk Road website, which facilitated the sale of illegal drugs.

But part of what attracted executives to the potential of distributed databases was seeing how well bitcoin performed as it attracted users around the world. Launched in 2008, bitcoin s market value now stands at more than $10bn, according to Coindesk, which tracks bitcoin data.

While the new Cambridge course will teach key concepts   such as what blockchain is and how it is being experimented with   it will not go in depth into the complex cryptographic processes that would be more suited to a computer science course.

Manfred Alfonso Dasenbrock, an executive at Brazilian co-operative Sicredi, who attended a fintech course at Cambridge in September, says:  The way we do banking business will not be the same in a few years.

US banks chafe at new loan loss rules

The biggest banking lobby group in the US is raising concerns about a radical shake-up of accounting rules that would force banks to recognise losses on loans   starting on the day they are originated.

Under the current regime, banks can hold off adding to reserves until the point at which losses on the loan become probable. But under the new rule, finalised last week, banks will be made to log all expected losses over the life of the loan on day one, based on a combination of experience, their own forecasts and the current state of the economy.

The US standard-setter, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, describes the overhaul as the most significant for the banks in more than 40 years. According to FASB, the new standard   which can be adopted in 2019, before it becomes mandatory in 2020   could help to rein in the kind of behaviour seen in the years leading up to the financial crisis, when the banks pumped out new loans even as they ran down their allowances for losses. That presented a flattering picture of the banks  books, according to FASB, and magnified the trouble that was to come as many of the loans turned bad.

But bank lobbyists are "http://bankingjournal.aba.com/2016/06/fasb-issues-final-loan-loss-accounting-standard/#_ga=1.170466786.359529094.1466106677" the rule change, warning that the upfront assessment of likely losses could act as a deterrent to lending by forcing banks to weigh the potential risks more closely than before. In addition, said Michael Gullette, vice-president of accounting and financial management at the American Bankers Association, the longer-term nature of the forecast could introduce more volatility to profits and capital levels, as banks tweak their estimates from year to year.

 Changes in "https://www.aba.com/Issues/Index/Documents/CECL-implementation-challenges-discussion-paper.pdf" can mean the difference between paying a dividend or not, so you re going to need pretty good support for these things,  he said.

Although the new standard is "http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20160617b1.pdf", the ABA hopes to shape the way it is implemented between now and 2019. The Washington DC-based group describes itself as the voice of the nation s banking industry, representing lenders that together keep $12tn in deposits and extend more than $8tn in loans.

Hal Schroeder, a board member at FASB, said the new rule   known as the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL   is simpler and cleaner, because it  aligns the accounting with the economics of underwriting, and the informational needs of investors .

He noted that in the four years leading up to the crisis, loans held by banks in the US increased 45 per cent, while reserves set aside for losses fell 10 per cent. That meant that loan-loss reserves as a percentage of gross loans   an important measure of the banks  resilience   were near a multi-decade low on the eve of the Lehman collapse.

The existing regime did not work as intended, agreed Chris Henkel, a consultant at Moody s Analytics in New York.  It did little to show the true extent of the credit risk inherent in a bank s loan portfolio,  he said.

So, are we on the cusp of central banks producing their own cryptocurrencies   or in Canada s case cryptoloonies? This would be ironic, as many admirers of blockchain systems like bitcoin see "http://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/Yet_5KPPAxauS2BfPcoRIQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRZSop0P0EIAKunpgKJTRQXWAQAAAAASBg1NzY3YzhjYjU3NTk3ODAzMDA0NWMyYzZCCgACzAVoV53NlYxSFGNocmlzLm51dHRhbGxAZnQuY29tCVEEAAAAAER-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" as a way of breaking free from interference by any central authority.

Here s a basic diagram of how the blockchain technology behind bitcoin works:

One of the most enthusiastic supporters of a digital central bank currency is Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the BoE. He "http://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/SZXk4-4l2Yak4BXIWMNurA~~/AAAAAQA~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~~" that it would address the  zero lower bound  problem of being unable to impose negative interest rates on cash   something particularly relevant in today s economic environment.

Mr Carney, however, is hedging his bets. He is enthusiastic about the technology s potential to widen access to the central bank s real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system, which processes 500bn of transactions each day. He also thinks blockchain technology could make RTGS more resilient after it suffered an "http://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/r3OSSvMSoK-3ED8q-SSJeA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRZSop0P0EIAKunpgKJTRQXWAQAAAAASBg1NzY3YzhjYjU3NTk3ODAzMDA0NWMyYzZCCgACzAVoV53NlYxSFGNocmlzLm51dHRhbGxAZnQuY29tCVEEAAAAAER-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdC5jb20vaW50bC9jbXMvcy8wL2YzZTY5YjY0LTU4NGItMTFlNC1hMzFiLTAwMTQ0ZmVhYjdkZS5odG1sP2Z0Y2FtcD1jcm0vZW1haWwvL25iZS9maW50ZWNoRlQvcHJvZHVjdCNheHp6NEMzbW1aTjAwhwsBeyJzb3VyY2UiOiJzaW1wbGUtZW1haWwtc2VydmljZSIsInJlcXVlc3RlZFNlbmRUaW1lIjoiMTQ2NjQzNDkxOCIsImxpc3RJZCI6IjU2NzAzYjIwY2I1NmU2MTdlYjJjNDA4NCIsInRlbXBsYXRlSWQiOiI1NzU5ODhjOTBiODYwZDAzMDBhMmJjZWEiLCJ1c2VyVXVpZCI6IjU3ZjA3ZDMwLTgyMTYtNDA1MS1hMThiLTllYjUxZmNlZWVmOCIsImVtYWlsSWQiOiI1NzY3YzhjYjU3NTk3ODAzMDA0NWMyYzYiLCJiaW5kaW5nIjoiZWRpdG9yaWFsIiwicHJvZHVjdCI6IkVtRSJ9" two years ago.

Yet he is sceptical about the prospects of a full central bank digital currency   saying this is  still some way off  in the UK. Experts say the technology still needs to prove it can be scaled up to handle hundreds of billions of pounds of transactions every day while remaining secure against cyber attackers.

DELL

Computer Maker Sells Software Group

Dell Inc. is selling its software group as the computer maker continues to sell assets and change strategy to focus on its acquisition of storage vendor EMC Corp.

Private-equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. said Monday that they would buy Dell Software Group for an undisclosed price. The group provides services to corporations such as analytics, database management, data protection, access control and performance monitoring.

Dell has been working to finance its $67 billion acquisition of EMC, including by selling its information-technology-services division for $3.05 billion and selling $20 billion in bonds.

In recent years, Dell has tried to expand from its traditional hardware businesses and into software. Now, Dell is focusing on the data-storage hardware and data-center software from VMware Inc., which are being brought in from the EMC deal, and exiting some previous bets.

In 2012, Dell bought tech-security company SonicWall Inc. for $1.2 billion and business-software maker Quest Software Inc. for $2.36 billion. Both are included in the deal.

METCASH

Dividends to Restart As Firm Posts Profit

Retailer Metcash Ltd. said it hopes to restart dividend payments this financial year after swinging to an annual profit on the back of reduced financing costs.

Metcash reported net profit of 216.5 million Australian dollars (US$160.1 million) for the year through April 30 from a A$384.2 million loss a year earlier.

The group recently sold its automotive business, allowing it to reduce debt. The lower interest costs offset weakness in its grocery business amid increasing competition from international groups.

Group earnings before interest and tax declined 7.4% to A$275.4 million as is invested heavily in cutting prices in its supermarkets business IGA, and the performance of its convenience stores business also deteriorated.

Twitter to Buy Machine-Learning  Company Magic Pony

By Austen Hufford

Twitter Inc. said Monday that it bought Magic Pony Technology, a London-based machine-learning company, in a move to help bolster its live and streaming video content.

Magic Pony's technology allows for better-quality video compression, essentially allowing for better-looking videos that use less data and are less choppy.

Founded in December 2014, Magic Pony was backed by venture-capital investors Octopus Ventures Ltd. in July 2015 and then again in May 2016.

Social media sites like Twitter and rivals Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube have been investing and promoting live-streaming video, especially on smartphones. Live video took off in early 2015 around the time a pair of apps Meerkat and Twitter's Periscope allowed people toting smartphones to stream live at any point.

Freezing videos due to unreliable networks are a concern for online streaming as frequently both the uploader and the viewer rely on sometimes choppy cellphone and Wi-Fi networks.

London-based Magic Pony will join Twitter's growing London office and serve as the European base for Twitter's cortex group a team of engineers, data scientists and researchers using machine learning to improve Twitter's products.

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Across the technology world, researchers are increasingly using one branch of artificial intelligence, called machine learning, to enable computers to  teach" themselves new skills by reviewing huge data sets. In March, Alphabet's Google used a neural network, a type of Machine learning, to beat a human champion at the complex and ancient game Go.

Twitter, like much of the web, has expanded from its text-only roots and has increasingly promoted still pictures, animated GIFs and video content.

In recent years, the social-media company has struggled to increase its user base or revenue as fast as Wall Street expects and amid concerns that the platform remains too niche for the everyman.

Monday's machine-learning acquisition comes after buying fellow machine-learning companies Madbits, which focused on image search, in July 2014 and Whetlab, which makes machine-learning systems easier to develop, in June 2015.

Shares of Twitter rose 1.6% to $16.35 in morning trading.

Gavin Teo, a principal with Comcast Corp.'s venture arm, is leaving Comcast to join B Capital, a firm launched by Facebook Inc. co-founder Eduardo Saverin.

Teo has been tapped to run B Capital's San Francisco office, focusing on investments in digital health care and emerging consumer technologies. At Comcast Ventures, Mr. Teo helped push the firm into virtual reality, and he sourced deals related to connected-homes technology and health care.

 With the new fund, one of the things that attracted me was the global stage and presence," Mr. Teo said.  I think that's an interesting platform to do deals and make big bets."

B Capital Group also has offices in Singapore, Manhattan Beach, Calif., and Singapore. The Wall Street Journal "http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-co-founders-venture-capital-firm-raises-143-6-million-1463666733" in May that firm raised more than $143.6 million for its first fund. Mr. Saverin runs the firm's Singapore office, and Raj Ganguly, formerly of Bain Co., runs the outpost in Manhattan Beach.

The firm s investments to date include Ninja Logistics Pte. Ltd., a Singapore company focused on last-mile logistics that does business as Ninja Van, and Evidation Health Inc., a San Mateo, Calif., health-analytics company.

 I am excited to welcome Gavin to the B Capital Group team," Mr. Saverin said via email.  Gavin's expertise and network will help us establish our presence in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

During his time at Comcast, Mr. Teo sourced and led investments in Altspace VR Inc., August Home Inc., Automatic Labs Inc., Baobab Studios Inc., NextVR Inc., SPACES Inc. and Felix & Paul Studios. He also actively managed Comcast's investments in several other companies.

PIMCO

Jobs Are Cut, Some

Assets Farmed Out

Pacific Investment Management Co. is eliminating 68 jobs and handing over management of some of its equity assets to another firm as part of cost cutting, according to an internal memo sent Thursday.

The majority of the staff affected are in operations, technology and client-facing roles, a person familiar with the matter said. The firm, according to the memo, will trim some of its equity funds and team up with Research Affiliates LLC on the management of some stock portfolios.

Pimco, a unit of Allianz SE, also is offering voluntary severance to other U.S. employees. The cuts announced Thursday amount to 3% of Pimco's roughly 2,300 employees. The firm managed $1.5 trillion in assets at the end of March.

Fox Business Network first reported the layoffs.

"Like any responsible business, Pimco constantly adjusts its resources to capitalize on changing markets and investment opportunities for clients," a spokesman said.

Pimco is looking to expand in private credit, alternatives and client analytics, the memo said.

A spokesman for Research Affiliates declined to comment.

As part of the equity changes, Pimco will close six funds with about $260 million in assets. That amount represents less than 1% of the firm's stock assets under management, the spokesman said.

AIRBNB

Deal for $1 Billion

In Debt Completed

Airbnb Inc. closed on a $1 billion debt deal with large banks to fuel the expansion of its home-sharing site, a person familiar with the matter said.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley participated in the credit facility, the person said.

Airbnb is raising new funds as it continues a global expansion and takes steps toward an initial public offering. The eight-year-old company, last valued by investors at $25.5 billion, has amassed more than two million listings of accommodations in 191 counties.

More startups are turning to debt to raise large amounts of cash without having to dilute their existing shareholders or set a new valuation. Uber Technologies Inc. is in talks to raise $1 billion to $2 billion in the leveraged-loan market, people familiar with the matter said this week. Unlike stock pickers, who often buy on expectations of growth, debt investors focus on a company's ability to generate the cash it needs to repay obligations.

SWITZERLAND

Big Banks Warned

On Capital Levels

Switzerland's central bank said on Thursday that the country's two biggest lenders, UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, need to bolster their respective layers of protective capital.

The Swiss National Bank said in its annual Financial Stability Report that while both big banks have met requirements designed to protect the Swiss economy in the case of a large bank failure, UBS and Credit Suisse each have work to do in order to meet revised rules that go into effect in 2020.

UBS said in a statement that while it disagrees "with a number of depictions" in the report, it "does not point out anything materially new." Credit Suisse didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pimco, the bond fund manager, is laying off 3 per cent of its global staff as it continues to shrink in the wake of the departure of founder Bill Gross.Affected employees   the majority in business rather than investment roles   were told earlier today, reports Stephen Foley in New York.

The company said it employed 2,300 people at the end of March, after trimming the workforce slowly since Mr Gross s departure in September 2014 by not replacing staff who leave.

The company said that it had moved on to compulsory layoffs, in a statement issued today.

The FT has obtained the internal memo sent to staff by Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer, Doug Hodges, chief executive, and Jay Jacobs, president. Read in full below:

Colleagues,

Earlier today the Executive Committee directed a series of steps to ensure that our business is better structured to serve our clients in this fast-changing asset management industry landscape. We want to share this news with you now that we have connected with our colleagues who are affected.

As a primary step, we have taken the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by 68 people. We have always strived to hire top talent, so those who are now leaving are colleagues who have given tremendously to PIMCO and our clients. We pride ourselves on being a lean organization with a special culture, so that only makes this decision even more difficult and personal for us as a firm. While this reduction represents just 3 percent of our workforce, the changes are especially painful given the close bonds that all of us forge with one another as colleagues and friends. We thank all those who are leaving for their many contributions and we will miss them.

Secondly, we will be offering voluntary severance to eligible employees in the US. Those eligible will be contacted later today by HR. Separation terms will be determined by reference to local custom and regulations.

Finally, we have decided to restructure our active Dividend strategies by converting the equity exposure to Research Affiliates Equity Income (RAE Income). While our Dividend team colleagues have made important contributions to the firm, we believe this conversion is a better outcome for clients as we seek consistent performance with a lower risk profile, while delivering on the objectives of high current yield and long-term capital appreciation. As a result, the dividend team will be among our colleagues referenced above who are leaving the firm.

Here is why we are taking these measures: We remain committed to first caring for the assets that clients have entrusted to us. We also see growth potential in a range of areas including alternatives, private credit, solutions, client analytics, and regionally in many parts of the world, not to mention the increasing investor demand for many of our non-traditional strategies. We know that the role of active management has never been more important to client portfolios. The competitive demands of this industry require that we continually adapt and innovate to meet evolving client needs. Therefore, everything we do is focused on providing investment performance, innovative solutions for clients and outstanding client service.

Of note, as we collectively move forward as a firm, we will continue to build out teams and hire the best talent globally and manage our staff levels through attrition, hiring, repositioning of resources and through promotion and compensation. We have undertaken an extensive benchmarking exercise this year to compare our compensation with competitors and will use this to remain a top payer in our industry.

Taking these actions today positions all of us for the future. We will use our substantial resources to invest in you and add to our already remarkable talent where necessary.

Today is a difficult day for all of us at PIMCO, but most importantly, for those affected by these decisions. The firm is providing support to those affected and we thank them again for their contributions.

We thank you all for your continued commitment to our clients and the firm as we move forward.

Dan, Doug and Jay

Pimco lays off 3% of global workforce after client outflows

Pimco has laid off 3 per cent of its global workforce and has asked for more staff to volunteer to leave, as it continues to deal with the fallout of founder "http://www.ft.com/intl/topics/people/Bill_Gross" s damaging exit in 2014.

The fixed income-focused fund management firm s assets under management have shrunk by about $600bn to $1.5tn, the result of client outflows.

Pimco, which is owned by Allianz of Germany, employed some 2,450 people at its peak and has been trimming the workforce slowly since Mr Gross s departure in September 2014 by not replacing staff who leave.

Its executive committee decided to move on to compulsory lay-offs and informed 68 staff on Thursday that they were no longer needed.

The axe falls most heavily on the business side of the firm, although investment manager Brad Kinkelaar who runs dividend-paying equities portfolios will also be leaving.

 The competitive demands of this industry require that we continually adapt and innovate to meet evolving client needs,  staff were told in an "http://on.ft.com/1Yv03Cu" signed by Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer, Doug Hodge, chief executive, and Jay Jacobs, president.

The memo went on to say that Pimco would still hire in areas where it sees growth potential, although it has also contacted several dozen additional staff in the US to encourage them to apply for voluntary severance.

Outflows have come largely from the core bond portfolios formerly run by Mr Gross. While Pimco has been working to familiarise clients with a younger generation of star managers, it has also been struggling against concerns over the future direction of fixed income markets, where rising interest rates could hurt core bond portfolios in particular.

The company has lost market share to rivals such as MetWest and DoubleLine, while a Vanguard bond market tracker fund last year stole Pimco s title as the world largest fixed income fund.

The internal memo went on:  We see growth potential in a range of areas including alternatives, private credit, solutions, client analytics, and regionally in many parts of the world, not to mention the increasing investor demand for many of our non-traditional strategies. 

The rise of low-cost index funds and a growing disillusionment with high fees have roiled the industry, and there have been cost cuts at many firms, particularly those focused on active fund management.

BlackRock laid off 400 staff earlier this year, and Franklin Resources has set cost-cutting targets in response to big outflows. GMO, the Boston-based fund manager run by Jeremy Grantham, has also cut 10 per cent of its 650-person staff, according to a research report on the firm by Morningstar.

To meet requirements for leverage ratios, or capital held relative to assets and investments, UBS and Credit Suisse each need additional going-concern capital--which can absorb losses under normal operating conditions--of roughly 10 billion Swiss francs ($10.3 billion), the SNB said. It added that the banks could cover most of this requirement by issuing so-called contingent convertible debt, designed to turn into equity if a bank's capital levels fall beneath a designated level.

UBS said in a statement that while it disagrees  with a number of depictions" in the report, it  does not point out anything materially new." Credit Suisse didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Microsoft Corp. has agreed to acquire Wand Labs, a startup whose messaging technology will help upgrade the software giant's efforts in chatbots.

Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Earlier this week, Microsoft agreed to a blockbuster acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. for $26.2 billion.

Redwood City, Calif.-based Wand Labs will join the Bing engineering and platform group at Microsoft. The Bing group has been developing technology that fits into Microsoft's strategy surrounding what Chief Executive Satya Nadella calls  conversation as a platform."

Microsoft in March released on Twitter its Tay artificial intelligence-driven chatbot, which went rogue with anti-Semitic rants and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-muzzles-its-artificially-intelligent-twitter-persona-1458843873" in less than a day.

Wand Labs investors include InterWest Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Khosla Ventures. The startup scored $2.7 million in funding in December 2013.

Pimco in 2014 made a push into equities but has since closed some funds and several leaders in the business have departed. It currently manages about $40 billion.

The firm has suffered investor withdrawals in recent years following several leadership changes at the firm. Co-founder Bill Gross abruptly left in September 2014 and investors have pulled billions from the flagship fund he managed.

Firms that have long focused on active management have also been under pressure from growing investor taste for passive funds that track the performance of indexes.

Pinterest Acquires Team That BuiltFleksy Inc. About half of predictive-technology company s 10-person staff, including CEO KostaEleftheriou, to join image-discovery site

Pinterest Inc. on Wednesday said it acquired the team that built Fleksy Inc., maker of a keyboard app that uses predictive technology to improve typing on touch screens.

The image-discovery site said Fleksy's technology isn't part of the deal, and the app will continue to run for now. Instead, Pinterest said about half of Fleksy's 10-person staff will join the company, including founder and CEO Kosta Eleftheriou.

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

San Francisco-based Fleksy raised about $6 million from investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Highland Capital, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Founded in 2011, Fleksy started off as an iPhone and iPad app for the blind community to help them type on devices. It later expanded to serve a broader audience for both Apple iOS and Google Android devices, helping users to improve the speed of typing and enabling them to customize their keyboard.

Pinterest said some of the app's accessibility components that aid the blind and visually impaired with be open sourced. Fleksy has been downloaded on more than 12 million devices, Pinterest said.

The predictive technology powering smart keyboard space has been getting crowded with options such as SwiftKey and Swype vying to become the consumer's first choice.

Competition heated up when Microsoft Corp. "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/02/03/microsoft-buys-swiftkey-the-latest-deal-in-ai-hungry-silicon-valley/" for a reported $250 million in February, as ambitions in artificial intelligence have grown among the tech giants.

For Pinterest's part, the company hopes the Fleksy team's mobile-engineering prowess can help it build out a visual search engine it dubs a  catalog of ideas." Mr. Eleftheriou will be joining the product-engineering team.

 Pinterest is intensely focused on refining the mobile experiences that make it possible to flow effortlessly through our catalog of ideas on any device, any place in the world," said Scott Goodson, Pinterest's head of core experience.  The Fleksy team is made up of truly noteworthy engineers and world experts in their areas. These technical artists have a history of developing architecturally innovative, highly optimized software."

Pinterest has made several acquisitions in recent years to acquire talent. Last month, Pinterest acquired half of the staff at URX, a San Francisco mobile advertising service.

A New Status Quo for the Boardroom; Ed Garden, chief investment officer of Trian Fund Management, believes the successful management teams of the future will rule through cooperation, not coercion

For the better part of a century, there's been a clear separation between the ownership and the management of publicly traded companies. Most shareholders haven't individually owned enough stock or had the expertise to credibly demand a say in decision-making. As a result, most owners have been passive; if they disagree with the direction of a company, their only option has been to sell.

* "http://graphics.wsj.com/image-grid/future-of-everything/"

But all that is changing. First, institutional shareholders have gotten bigger, and their ownership of corporate America has become more concentrated. These institutions invest the savings of many Americans, and the amount they manage has swelled. Second, many of these institutional shareholders have developed deep industry expertise, truly understanding the industries in which they invest. Third, poor performance by management and outright cases of abuse of power and even fraud have created a mindset among shareholders that management teams have lost their right to be left alone. Lastly, there are a few shareholders, commonly known as  activists" but whom I call  highly engaged shareowners," who are galvanizing their fellow shareholders and providing the catalyst for management to be held accountable.

Critics have accused so-called activists of advocating business decisions that create a short-term bump in stock prices at the expense of the company's long-term health, and some politicians would like to legislate against the rising influence of shareholders, claiming that it leads to short-termism, rising inequality and low pay for workers.

But in my view, the management and directors of public companies, not the shareholders, have driven such short-term behavior, and the way to build strong companies and create jobs is not through government mandate or protecting weak management teams. It will happen because market forces will reward the companies in which management teams and highly engaged shareowners work together to achieve sustained, lasting growth.

There's no going back: Public shareowners are becoming more involved, more informed and more engaged. That will lead to better long-term growth and performance, a win-win for all constituencies, including customers, employees, shareholders and management.

FirstMark Capital, a New York City firm that has invested in companies such as Pinterest and Shopify, has raised $480 million for two new venture-capital funds.

The firm has raised $275 million for an early-stage fund and $205 million for an opportunity fund to invest in growth-stage deals.

Previously FirstMark raised a $225 million early-stage fund, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020131112e9bcqk2bk", in 2013 and a $150 million opportunity fund two years ago.  We wanted to keep it simple and keep the same strategy," said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark.

The growth fund will invest at Series B, C or D in startups both from its own early-stage funds as well as companies outside its funds.  It's for anything we believe has established itself as a winner," Mr. Heitzmann said.  These companies have clearly broken out and established themselves as iconic companies."

Some companies from the firm's first opportunity fund include Airbnb; Pinterest; InVision; and Tapad, which agreed to be "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160201ec21a2ip8" for $360 million in February.

Mr. Heitzmann said that despite launching the growth fund, the firm has been careful amid the rush to invest in high valuation late-stage companies, also known as unicorns. A number of the growth fund companies are from the firm's early-stage fund that they know well, he said.

 We've been cautious," he said.  We've been very selective on companies that are winners."

FirstMark, one of the larger venture firms in New York City, is bullish on local startups, having invested about 50% of its deals there, while also investing 25% of its deals in the San Francisco Bay Area.

 When we started in 2008, people said they aren't sure New York is big enough a market to start a VC firm," Mr. Heitzmann said.  That's changed over the past eight years and it's gotten to the point where its sustainable and building on itself."

New York City was the second largest U.S. startup market by deals with 137 to the San Francisco Bay Area's 264 in the first quarter of 2016 and by dollars, with $2.2 billion to the Bay Area's $3.9 billion, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource.

FirstMark is probably best known for its early-stage investment in Pinterest. The firm has also invested in Riot Games, which was acquired by Tencent; X.ai; Lumosity; Knewton; Shopify and Hyperscience.

The firm prefers to invest in serial entrepreneurs as well as people the firm has worked with before or known for a number of years. Areas of focus include big data, artificial intelligence, marketplaces, as well as social, enterprise, software as a service, health care and education.

FirstMark has aimed to build a tech community with monthly New York City events on big data, design and other topics, as well as services for its companies in recruiting, customer service and other areas.

The firm's managing directors are Mr. Heitzmann, Amish Jani, and Matt Turck. Two partners in the firm's last fund, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120151130ebbum9ygl" and Gerald Poch, aren't in the new fund. The firm doesn't have immediate plans to add new partners, but could do so if the right candidate is available, Heitzmann said.

Sapho has raised $9.5 million in Series A funding to back its software tools for enterprise app development.

Alsop Louie Partners led the new funding, which "http://www.wsj.com/pro/venturecapital" will use to expand its sales and marketing team. SoftTech VC and Caffeinated Capital also contributed to the round, which closed in January. Other investors include Morado Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures and Bloomberg Beta.

Sapho's Micro App Platform allows enterprise app development teams to build apps supporting their internal workflow, including functions ranging from human resources to license management to financial data.

The San Francisco-based company aims to distinguish itself from competitors by bringing to enterprise apps the alerting features that have become popular in consumer technology like push notifications. Sapho uses machine learning to learn which events are important, and alert users to them, said Chief Executive Fouad ElNaggar.

 In your personal life, computers tell you if someone's tagged you, or if there's something you should be interested in. We're trying to bring that to work," said Peter Yared, Sapho's chief technology officer. The strategy complements what industry analysts describe as the  consumerization" of enterprise technology, as enterprise users gravitate toward easy-to-use software that borrows features from popular consumer tech.

Sapho charges its enterprise customers on a subscription basis per active user within their company. Its customers include Turner Broadcasting Company, CBS Interactive, Kubernetes and PRX Corporation. The company has raised a total of $13.5 million to date.

Neil Woodford has built up a 21 per cent stake in Imperial Innovations, a technology-focused investment company, underlining the fund manager s commitment to backing small British companies with scientific expertise.

Mr Woodford, the UK s best known fund manager who won over investors during his 25 years at Invesco Perpetual by turning a 1,000 investment into 23,000, has acquired 2,739,604 ordinary shares in Imperial Innovations.

The Aim-listed company, which has links to researchers at Imperial College London, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge has stakes in a range of early stage science and technology companies.

These include Yoyo, a smartphone app that acts as a virtual wallet; Cell Medica, which is developing treatment for post bone-marrow transplantation viral infections; and Feature Space, a data analytics company seeking to predict how people react to situations based on behavioural patterns.

According to Woodford Investment Management, the company set up by Mr Woodford in 2014, the stake in Imperial Innovations is divided between his two funds, Woodford Equity Income and the Patient Capital Trust.

The technology investment company accounts for 1.4 per cent of Woodford Equity Income and 2.4 per cent of Patient Capital Trust.

Analysts said the 11.6m holding makes more sense for Patient Capital Trust, which invests in a mix of disruptive early-stage companies, as well as mid- and large-capitalisation companies.

But Jason Hollands, managing director of UK investment adviser Tilney Bestinvest, raised questions about the stake held in the larger Woodford Equity Income fund.

Imperial Innovations made a pre-tax loss of 5.9m in the six months to the end of January, and has never paid a dividend. Woodford Equity Income, which has 8.7bn of assets, primarily invests in companies that deliver sustainable dividend growth.

Mr Hollands said:  Imperial Innovations is entirely suited to the Patient Capital Trust. Eight of [the fund s] top 10 holdings are in the healthcare sectors, including three unquoted companies.

 Woodford Equity Income, in contrast, offers  exposure to companies that can deliver sustainable dividend growth and aiming to deliver attractive, positive long-term returns and a growing income stream . A stock like this doesn t naturally fit with that description. 

Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial, a fund supermarket, added that the technologies used by many of the companies backed by Imperial Innovations remained  unproven .

But he added:  Neil is a really big believer in the underlying technologies 	. 	. 	. 	If he really likes an idea, he will own a big chunk of it. 

Woodford Investment Management declined to comment.

However, a spokesperson pointed to a "https://woodfordfunds.com/blog/mission-possible/" by analyst Lucinda Crabtree in which she highlighted a company backed by Imperial Innovations   Mission Therapeutics   as  incredibly exciting .

Ms Crabtree said the company, which is developing technology to treat oncology-related conditions and neurodegenerative illnesses such as Parkinson s disease, stood out.

 We strongly believe innovation such as this will have tremendous commercial potential in the future,  she wrote.

LOMBARD
VE Day for US investment banks should be celebrated by clients too

American GIs who came to the UK for D-Day 72 years ago were jokingly said to be "overpaid, oversexed and over here". US investment banks have achieved their own victory in Europe in recent years, occupying four out of the top five spots for fees earned , according to analytics group Coalition.

Whether bankers at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are oversexed is for other pundits to judge. But it is questionable whether the banks themselves are overpaid. European clients shell out fees that are 18 per cent lower than those in the US.

European investment bankers, lacking a credible international champion of their own, tend to regard the disparity as unfair. They argue it is easy for Americans to muscle into their market, brought up to fighting weight by domestic fees as high as 7 per cent for a flotation. But charges may be high because US customers are insensitive to price, rather than because there is a cartel. The greater wonder is that European companies are so value-conscious over deals that may matter critically. One theory is that loss-leading privatisation mandates set Europe's fees artificially low in the '80s.

High US fees might equally be a cultural quirk. Some Americans wear turtleneck sweaters under their shirts and think Seth Rogen is funny.

Either way, the horrid truth Europeans should recognise is that US investment banks are successful here because they deserve to be. Their advice is no worse than local rivals, their distribution will often be better and they have big economies of scale.

Their commitment to staying in the business wins them clients and talented staff. Brands such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch were well known in the City at the time of Big Bang three decades ago. British investment banking names like Barings, Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg were big back then but are now largely historic footnotes.

US customers and stockholders should regard the implicit subsidy they provide to the European clients of Wall Street banks as a form of the Marshall Aid, which, after D-Day, helped rebuild a ravaged continent. The locals weren't notably grateful for that, either.

White House Officials Gather With Fintech Leaders and Regulators; Administration holds  FinTech Summit  focused on the industry s potential to advance economic policy

WASHINGTON White House officials met privately with regulators and leaders in the financial technology industry Friday to discuss how the government can work with innovators.

The half-day event called the  FinTech Summit" largely focused on how government agencies can tap into the innovation, in which new firms are offering small-business owners and consumers faster forms of loans and digital payments. Federal regulators have been studying the industry to determine how it can be regulated while still encouraging innovation.

On Friday, the White House took it a step further by inviting some of those regulators and key players  to discuss how fintech can help advance critical economic policy priorities," Adrienne Harris, special assistant to the president for economic policy, wrote in a blog post following the event.

 Technology isn't just changing the financial services industry, it's changing the way consumers and business owners relate to their finances, and the way institutions function in our financial system," said Ms. Harris, who led the event.  From consumers' financial health to growing and managing small businesses; from cybersecurity to helping developing nations prosper; and from big data to blockchain we spent the day identifying those areas where partnership across industries and between the public and private sectors can help advance our financial well-being and economic prosperity."

The summit, which was closed to the news media, included officials from the Treasury Department, the Small Business Administration, and leaders in both fintech and traditional banking.

Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker led a panel discussion on the government's role in fintech and how those firms are partnering with each other and banks. The Commerce Department recently kicked off its own  innovation" series in which Ms. Pritzker met with fintech companies to encourage public-private partnerships.

Other speakers included Marla Blow, a former top official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who helped start FS Card Inc., a fintech credit-card company with a focus on subprime borrowers. Ms. Blow spoke on the  changing landscape of financial services," according to an agenda obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

Summit participants also discussed the  big data" report released by the White House in May that addressed how such data can be used to offer credit to underserved consumers but also poses civil rights and privacy risks. Roy Austin, deputy assistant to the president for urban affairs, led that discussion, examining how fintech firms use such data.

The event concluded with a discussion on how fintech firms are a  potent enabler" for developing countries. The conversation was led by Gayle Smith, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

 Mobile phone-based payment systems are making vulnerable communities more resilient, allowing governments to operate more transparently," Ms. Harris wrote. She also said they could be the foundation for businesses in remote areas  so that households living beyond the electricity grids in East Africa can access clean energy for the first time and Indian villages can develop sustainable water systems."

The panel concluded that the public and private sectors need  to align around a common vision and work together to lay the foundations for modern, inclusive economies," Ms. Harris said.

Andreessen Horowitz Closes $1.5B Fifth Fund

Andreessen Horowitz has raised $1.5 billion for its latest fund, in what is likely to be one of the largest pools of startup capital raised this year.

The fund, Andreessen Horowitz Fund V LP, follows the firm's pattern of raising a $1.5 billion roughly every two years. Its "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020140327ea3ro6zgz" and its third closed in 2013. Both prior funds were also $1.5 billion.

Based in Menlo Park, Calif., the firm said it would use the new capital to continue investing in seed, early-stage and mid-stage-growth technology companies.

Scott Kupor, the Andreessen Horowitz managing partner who raised Fund V, said the firm hasn't yet invested out of the fund and is still placing bets with its fourth fund.

 You'll probably see us do more in [artificial intelligence] and machine learning," he said. He added that virtual reality  content is a big opportunity."

Andreessen Horowitz didn't raise the capital opportunistically, said Mr. Kupor, as many firms facing leaner times for startups have loaded up on cash, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/funds-flow-to-venture-firms-1459295426".

 We heard from our LPs," Mr. Kupor said.  There are firms out there raising ahead of when they need capital."

Andreessen Horowitz has invested in hundreds of tech startups since its founding in 2008. Among them are some of the largest and best-known privately held companies, including Airbnb Inc., BuzzFeed Inc., Lyft Inc., Pinterest Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc.

Lending Club, securitisations and proper loan due diligence

One of the causes of the global financial crisis   and there were many   was just outright fraud.

Fraud when US subprime mortgages were being written; fraud when those mortgages were being packaged into bonds; and "http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/02/bubbles-and-fraud" when those bonds were being sold to investors.

For example, banks would hire a company to check if loans they were securitising were dodgy, but wouldn t disclose the results of that review to end investors. The reason for this secrecy, as Felix Salmon discussed in a 2010 "http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/10/13/the-enormous-mortgage-bond-scandal/", is that the banks could demand a discount from the loan originator whenever they found bad loans, pocketing it as a profit instead of passing it on to investors, who were kept in the dark.

And as the world discovered, investors being kept in the dark   whether through malice, greed or stupidity   did not end well.

Today, banks and any other securitisers in the US have to file a Form ABS-15G, which tells investors if there was an independent review of the underlying loans and, if so, what that review flagged up. The regulation requiring this disclosure came into force in June 2015.

But a securitiser can still choose not to have a third party inspect the loans, therefore avoiding having to disclose anything and saving money too.

This appears to be the typical state of affairs for most deals involving loans originated by online lenders.

Even where the reports are available, they show that digitisation is not quite the cure-all to the problem of bad borrower data that some have hoped.

Here s a list of all the online securitisations there have been up to the end of March this year, courtesy of PeerIQ, a data analytics company that tracks the online lending space. Click for the full thing:

The list has 47 deals worth $8.6bn, 23 of which were issued after the ABS-15G requirement came into force in June 2015, meaning that any third-party due diligence reports would have to be disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission and made public.

So if there was third-party due diligence, theoretically anyone should be able to see it. But we were able to find just six reports for those 23 deals   if you find more, do let us know   suggesting that the vast majority were checked in-house by the issuer and therefore any problems found in the creation of the deal remain secret. (That count doesn t include deals issued since March.)

The deals that did have third-party due diligence tended to be those issued by the online lender themselves, rather than by an investor who had bought their loans.

For example, SoFi, which has always arranged its own deals, consistently has third-party due diligence. A spokesperson for Avant, whose securitisations this year were independently checked, said the oversight helps reassure investors given its relatively short track record as a securitiser. Similarly, a spokesperson for OnDeck, an online lender to small business, said both of the securitisations it has carried out directly were checked by independent auditors.

By contrast, none of Citi s securitisations of Prosper Marketplace loans appear to have had a third party checking over the loan data. A Fitch Ratings report for the deal priced in March   the last before the relationship rather publicly fell apart   notes that Citi did  all the due diligence in-house . Both Prosper and Citi declined to comment. (As did almost all of the online lenders we contacted.)

But where third-party checks did occur, they were only skin-deep. As PwC states in "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555110/000089853116000625/slc-abs15g.htm" for a securitisation by SoFi, the checks do not involve any assurances on  the completeness, accuracy, appropriateness, quality or integrity of any of the information  in the loan documents.

All the checks consist of is comparing a spreadsheet full of loan information with the underlying documentation, both of which are ultimately provided by the company that made the loan in the first place. There are no efforts to independently check if the information is accurate.

That said, even this rather shallow task throws up interesting discoveries that should make you question the data systems of even the newest fintech companies.

For example, this is from "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555110/000089706916000889/cg753a.htm" on another SoFi deal, showing the discrepancies in gross income that appeared between the spreadsheet, the  data file value , and the income calculated from the underlying documentation, or  source file value :

For context, that s three from a sample of 600 loans.

There are a few more noted in this report on the "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555110/000089853116000625/slc-abs15g.htm"   from a smaller sample of 100 loans   including a three-year discrepancy in the graduation date of one borrower (the third from the bottom):

Or perhaps more comically, in this "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1658153/000089706916000580/cg641.htm" on a deal by Earnest, another online lender to students, the discrepancies in a sample of 150 loans include the transformation of a $150,000 a year salary from Blackstone Group into a $450,000 a year salary from Goldman Sachs (if only life were so easy):

"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1658153/000089706916000832/cg731.htm" by Deloitte for another Earnest deal shows similar mixups in another sample of 150 loans (click to enlarge):

The point here is not that these deals were bad, or that these lenders have less reliable data than anyone else. Rather it s a reminder that even finance companies who have very recently built their systems from scratch don t get it right all of the time.

We ve seen the same thing in the UK. In the process of investigating Ratesetter s loan book and querying certain entries with the company, we found at times that the data were incorrect and could not be taken at face value.

Interestingly, there is also a report for the Jefferies securitisation of Lending Club loans, which would have been the first rated deal involving the company s loans but instead resulted in the departure of chief executive and founder Renaud Laplanche.

In case it s not fresh in your memory, the seeds of the crisis were a borrower documentation change requested by Jefferies. Lending Club duly made the change, but an employee tweaked the date on a batch of loans to make it look like they had been originated after the change had been agreed   thereby making it seem like they qualified for the deal.

The "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650171/000092963816001434/exhibit99-1.htm", published on "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650171/000092963816001434/0000929638-16-001434-index.htm", five full days before Lending Club revealed the scandal and its share price cratered, hints at those events. In the report, Deloitte says it received a listing of loans on April 5th, from which it randomly chose a sample. Then, a few weeks later on April 26th, Deloitte received a data file, likely a spreadsheet, which it would compare with the sample.

But on April 27, the following day, Deloitte received another data file, which contained  an updated origination date for each of the 11,830 unsecured consumer loans  in the initial data file:

We were instructed by representatives of the Company [Jefferies] to replace the origination date information set forth on the Initial Data File with the corresponding information set forth on the Origination Date Supplemental Data File

The report goes on to say that Deloitte found about half of the loans it sampled were missing from the data file. Lending Club and Jefferies declined to comment. Deloitte did not return a request for comment.

As it happened, Lending Club came clean and made a pretty good show to investors that it wouldn t tolerate any messing around with its loan data   even if there seems to be have been more going on than meets the eye.

But relying on finance companies to fess up instead of burying misdeeds has historically been a pretty bad bet, which is why these sorts of third-party reviews are important, even for fintech startups.

US investment banks conquer Europe

American GIs who came to the UK for D-Day 72 years ago were jokingly said to be  overpaid, oversexed and over here . US investment banks have achieved their own victory in Europe in recent years, occupying four out of the top five spots for fees earned, according to analytics group Coalition.

Whether bankers at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are oversexed is for other pundits to judge. But it is questionable whether the banks themselves are overpaid. European clients shell out fees that are 18 per cent lower than those in the US.

European investment bankers, lacking a credible international champion of their own, tend to regard the disparity as unfair. They argue it is easy for Americans to muscle into their market, brought up to fighting weight by domestic fees as high as 7 per cent for a flotation.

But charges may be high because US customers are insensitive to price, rather than because there is a cartel. The greater wonder is that European companies are so value-conscious over deals that may matter critically. One theory is that a slew of loss-leading privatisation mandates set European fees artificially low in the 1980s.

High US fees might equally be a cultural quirk. Some Americans wear turtleneck sweaters under their shirts and think Seth Rogen is funny.

Either way, the horrid truth Europeans should recognise is that US investment banks are successful here because they deserve to be. Their advice is no worse than local rivals, their distribution will often be better and they have big economies of scale.

Their commitment to staying in the business wins them clients and talented staff. Brands such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch were well known in the City at the time of Big Bang three decades ago. British investment banking names like Barings, Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg were big back then but are now largely historic footnotes.

US customers and stockholders should regard the implicit subsidy they provide to the European clients of Wall Street banks as a form of the Marshall Aid, which, after D-Day, helped rebuild a ravaged continent. The locals weren t notably grateful for that, either.

Kicker conspiracy

The imminent Euro 2016 football tournament will give fans the chance to debate the salient differences between the English and German version of the games. The playbook for awarding TV rights for football in both countries is identical: players extract astronomic pay from their clubs, which pass on the cost to broadcaster Sky.

The long-suffering News Corp affiliate has just agreed to "http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/06/09/sky-climbs-after-scoring-german-football-contract/"an average of 80 per cent more to show Bundesliga matches for four seasons at a cost of around  ¬3.5bn. It has lost exclusivity over top-flight German football in the process.

The outcome was as familiar as Germany defeating England in a semi-final. Sky last year agreed to pay 70 per cent more for three seasons of Premiership rights. Back then BT, rather than John Malone s Eurosport, was the deep-pocketed interloper who pushed up the bidding.

The gamble chief executive Jeremy Darroch took with Premiership rights appears justified by strong earnings and a declining debt burden. At best he can be credited with buying time for Sky, a medium-sized business whose fortunes are inextricably linked to a big money game. Mr Darroch himself is likely to have moved on before costs become truly unsustainable.

Kiwi combo

Flight of the Conchords, a sitcom about Kiwis adrift among New Yorkers ignorant of their nation, spawned the wry slogan:  New Zealand: it s not part of Australia . Nor is New Zealand s Sky Network Television part of the UK s Sky, mentioned above. But the group is set to become a subsidiary of deal-hungry telecoms group Vodafone through a NZ$3.4bn merger, which, for readability, we ll convert to US$2.4bn.

British companies have been hanging back from M&A ahead of the Brexit vote. Vodafone is going ahead with this deal, though in a place about as far as you can get from Nigel Farage without boarding a spaceship.

Telephone air time is increasingly commodified. There is fierce competition in pay TV. The combination of SNT and Voda s New Zealand operations is expected to yield cost and capital expenditure synergies with a net present value of $295m.

The partners are promoting the deal as a merger, though it can also be seen as a reverse takeover by Vodafone. The UK group will own 51 per cent of a group that will retain SNT s New Zealand listing. SNT, which is smaller than Vodafone New Zealand, is paying the parent $850m in debt-financed cash and the balance of the $2.4bn consideration in its own shares. These will be issued at a premium to the undisturbed market price, implying Voda is contributing its Kiwi cash flows to the combined group at a discount.

Fundraising values web security start-up at $1bn; Technology

Cylance, a cyber security start-up seeking to upend the old world of antivirus software, has raised $100m from investors including private equity firm Blackstone and Insight Venture Partners.

The fundraising values the company at $1bn, up more than threefold from $300m last year, according to a person close to the deal.

Blackstone invested from its Tactical Opportunities fund, which focuses on complex markets where it believes risk is mispriced.

Stuart McClure , chief executive of Cylance, founded the company after he left Intel Security, the antivirus software maker formerly known as McAfee. He said the group had seen bookings increase more than 1,000 per cent in the past year, and was cash-flow-positive.

Cylance uses artificial intelligence to detect threats to computers and other devices, rather than simply comparing viruses with lists of known malicious software.

Existing investors, including Silicon Valley venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and DFJ Growth, as well as private equity firm KKR, participated in the round.

Cylance's fundraising came after a period when venture capitalists appeared to be holding back from backing cyber security companies. The pause came after VCs spent two to three years pouring cash into start-ups in the sector in the hope that they could solve customers' cyber security problems and earn them millions.

"There's a lot of noise in this space," said Mr McClure. "Deal flow may be starting to come back for now, but it is sort of a tentative and waiting game."

Cylance is not alone in breaking the freeze: Lookout, a start-up focused on protecting smartphones, received an investment from Microsoft for an undisclosed sum recently.

Pro Private Markets
Freenome Raises $5.55M Seed Round For Cancer Detection

Freenome Inc. has secured $5.55 million to compete with several well-funded companies in a race to develop blood tests that detect cancer in its early stages and guide patients to the best treatments.

Andreessen Horowitz, Data Collective, Founders Fund and Third Kind Venture Capital provided the seed financing.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/liquid-biopsy-startups-face-long-road-to-payoff-1464003003" that detect DNA and other materials that tumors release into the bloodstream. In September, Piper Jaffray Cos. put the market opportunity for cancer  liquid biopsies" at more than $28 billion.

Most liquid-biopsy companies aim to steer diagnosed cancer patients to the best therapies.

Liquid-biopsy startups aiming for early cancer detection include Grail, which launched in January with $100 million from ARCH Venture Partners, Illumina Inc., and others.

Another player is Guardant Health Inc., which has raised $200 million from Sequoia Capital and others. Guardant, which sells a liquid biopsy to aid treatment selection, is moving into cancer detection through a research program called Lunar.

"http://www.freenome.com/" is developing tests to spot cancer in its early phases, when treatment is most successful. Its tests could also guide therapy decisions. Its process involves analyzing the collection of genetic material floating in the bloodstream, the  freenome." Using a machine-learning system, it identifies genetic characteristics to distinguish between people who have cancer and those who don't.

The technology detects known so-called cancer signatures and uncovers new ones, according to Chief Executive Gabriel Otte. In early research the technology has correctly distinguished between normal and cancerous blood samples. Having validated the approach in hundreds of samples, Freenome now plans testing in thousands of cases, Mr. Otte said. The company plans to publish papers describing how and why its tests work, according to Mr. Otte.

Freenome decided to raise a small amount while vetting its system. It will seek a larger funding depending on how studies progress, Mr. Otte said.

Developing a test is only the first step to success for liquid-biopsy companies. Winning support from regulators and insurers is also vital. Freenome says it is working with Medicare and the Food and Drug Administration on premarket review. The company is also confident insurers will immediately see the benefits of a test that tells doctors which treatment works best.

Company: Freenome

Amount invested: $5.55 million

Series/Round: seed

Investors: Andreessen Horowitz (lead), Founders Fund, Data Collective Venture Capital and Shana Fisher's Third Kind Venture Capital

Tradeshift Raises $75 Million to Connect Global Supply Chains; New funding values company at more than $500 million

Thousands of startups are born in Silicon Valley each year, but sometimes the freshest perspectives on new technology come from outsiders.

That is what happened with Tradeshift Holdings Inc., a six-year-old startup that was born in Denmark in 2010, although the company moved its headquarters to San Francisco a year later.

Tradeshift's three founders Christian Lanng, Mikkel Hippe Brun and Gert Sylvest met while working on a Danish government project, a software platform to digitize invoices, which was ultimately adopted by 95% of Denmark's businesses.

That gave them the idea for Tradeshift, which has raised $205 million and is on track this year to generate $50 million in revenue, according to Mr. Lanng, who is the company's chief executive.

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150811eb8bnw6fh" (Aug. 11, 2015)

The company's latest funding, a $75 million Series D round, values Tradeshift at more than $500 million.

Tradeshift started after its founders noticed that when companies traded goods or services, especially between countries, their business was often analog and involved sending invoices over email or fax.

 Our core idea was we have Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, but when it comes to companies, why don't we connect them in the cloud, in a network that feels more like LinkedIn or Facebook?" Mr. Lanng said.

At first, Tradeshift was just a free social network for businesses, although one that included the ability for members to do business with each other and build apps. The network spread to more than 100 countries.

About 18 months ago, Tradeshift also started selling software that companies could use to connect and manage their supply chains.

Companies can still do business on the network for free, but if they buy Tradeshift's software they get tools to manage complicated issues such as tax compliance and can also create private marketplaces for their suppliers.

Tradeshift now finds itself competing with Oracle Corp. and SAP SE for deals, Mr. Lanng said. More than 800,000 companies use the platform, and Tradeshift has several partnerships, including one with Baiwang, which provides tax-related services in China.

One reason Tradeshift has grown is because of the way the company applies machine learning and large-scale computing to  ingesting, validating, checking for fraud, extracting the signal from and intelligently routing an insane number of invoices," said Data Collective co-founder Matt Ocko, who joins Tradeshift's board.

When the Danish government asked Tradeshift's founders to digitize invoices for the nation's businesses, Mr. Ocko said,  they didn't know that level of automation had never been attempted."

Tradeshift's new funding round includes investments from several banks, because  banks are increasingly not able to access the next generation of business data," Mr. Lanng said.

To be competitive, modern companies need agility, he said, and for that they need software, which is  anachronistic and expensive and they have a hard time doing that."

Tradeshift's new funding was led by Data Collective, which was an early investor in the company, and includes several new investors: HSBC Bank PLC; American Express Ventures; CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund, which is managed by CreditEase; and Pavilion Capital. Current investor Notion Capital also participated in the round.

Technology (A Special Report) --- Does Nasdaq Shine for Chinese Firms?: CEO Bob Greifeld on whether the attraction has faded, and the implications of blockchain

For a long time, for many tech companies, the idea of getting a listing, especially on Nasdaq, was one of their highest goals. In the past few years, though, more companies are choosing to stay private or delay their listings.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq is implementing a big change in the form of blockchain -- a system that underpins the digital currency bitcoin and allows companies to make and verify transactions on a network instantaneously without a central authority.

For a look at what these changes might mean, The Wall Street Journal's Gerard Baker spoke with the chief executive officer of Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.

MR. BAKER: The phenomenon we've seen in this tech boom is the unicorn -- companies that don't go public, don't list. Or at least they delay their listings. Some of them are already enormous companies. They are weighing out very carefully the pros and cons of a listing, the onerous reporting requirements, against the demand for liquidity. How do you see it?

MR. GREIFELD: We typically counsel companies to think long and hard about going public. When you go public, you're obviously taking in money from shareholders who don't know you. Your reporting requirement as a result of that is quite onerous. And because they don't know you, they have to buy into a fundamental investment thesis. And that investment thesis better match your business model, and that communication has to be clear.

Now that business model does not have to say I'm going to make X% growth quarter after quarter in profits. It could be a model that talks about a story, but then you have to deliver on that story.

As I like to say, as a CEO of a public company, I get my report card every three months, right? We have to report every three months. And if you're not ready for that scrutiny, then you should wait until you are in fact ready to go there. So in terms of the companies that have gone public, that have been successful, the investment thesis matches the operation of the business.

MR. BAKER: Let's talk about China. Nasdaq was a favored destination for a lot of Chinese companies. Companies have pulled out, partly because of some reporting issues and partly because of some scandals there.

What's going on? Are investors more wary of some of these Chinese companies? Are the Chinese companies themselves more nervous?

MR. GREIFELD: We had a rush of Chinese companies that came to market, that did not fully understand the reporting regime and the scrutiny they would be under. So we had a period of delisting of those companies. [Now] our pipeline for Chinese companies coming to the U.S. is as strong as it's been in half a decade. A decade ago, it was really very ebullient in terms of companies rushing to come to the U.S. It's not that, but I think it's at a healthy level.

We think we'll come out with something approaching 10 Chinese companies listing in the U.S. in 2016. That's, I think, a healthy number. And in the context of the fact that the overall U.S. IPO market has been depressed, as a percent it's quite healthy.

MR. BAKER: There had been some issues with a number of very prominent companies, most recently Alibaba, announcing that it was subject to an SEC investigation of some of its accounting practices. Is this raising broader concerns about the reliability of reporting in China?

MR. GREIFELD: I don't know any details on Alibaba, but I think it's also a little bit unfair to say, wow, a Chinese company has a reporting issue, because we would have a very, very long list of American companies that have had reporting issues.

MR. BAKER: But there were a succession of Chinese companies.

MR. GREIFELD: We went through that phase five or six years ago. I think we're at a healthy balance today. We have many companies that have to learn as they go along and get better at reporting.

MR. BAKER: Let's move on to some broader technology questions. Tell us how you are changing. You've talked a lot very excitedly about blockchain and the changes that it's making to the way you can work. Tell us a bit about how that's affecting Nasdaq.

MR. GREIFELD: With respect to Nasdaq, I've always felt that we are a technology company. If you take away the imprimatur, or the exchange license, we're a transaction-processing business. In buzzy terms, we run our business in the cloud. It's software as a service, we get paid per use.

We're on the cusp of a golden age of technology, and it feels exciting. Blockchain and machine learning are really going to change the world that we live in. [With blockchain] you can obviate the need for the trusted intermediaries. And when you start thinking in those terms, it's amazing how many trusted intermediaries there are. That whole middle layer that exists and represents friction in the system will go away.

The first real thing we did with blockchain was in Nasdaq Private Market. In December, we did a trade, a liquidity event, where we traded, settled, cleared and moved the money in 10 minutes. That sounds interesting. It sounds great when you see if you bought or sold Apple that day, it would take three days.

In terms of the limitations of blockchain today, it can handle about 10 transactions per second. In the trading in our market today, we handle millions of transactions a second. So it's apples and oranges. I think where blockchain will come in on the transaction side is when the volume of trading and activity is less active and there's more dimensions to the order.

So, an equity trade is the easiest thing in the world because you've got to buy a thousand shares of Apple at a price. As you get into over-the-counter instruments, derivative instruments, you have a whole series of dimensions to it. And that would be more appropriate for blockchain.
